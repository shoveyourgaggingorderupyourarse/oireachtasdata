This relates to children who have been born through surrogacy.  Any proposed legislation is still some time away.  What proposals are there to protect children's rights and welfare in the interim?  I know the Minister supports resolving this issue and has met with relevant groups.  I am just taking the opportunity to raise the issue again.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300003#A00500"><p>The area of surrogacy is one of the most complex to deal with.  Compassion and sensitivity are required, as is a very strong emphasis on the welfare of the children born as a result of this process.  Since the formation of the Government, there has been substantial work and engagement with a view to future legislation on the wider issue between the Ministers for Justice and Health, the Attorney General and myself.  My colleague the Minister for Health has lead responsibility for legislation in this area.  His Department is working on drafting a Bill on assisted human reproduction, AHR.  This comprehensive legislation will encompass the regulation of a wide range of practices undertaken in this jurisdiction, including domestic altruistic surrogacy, for the first time.  I understand that officials in the Department of Health and the Office of the Attorney General will continue to engage intensively over the coming weeks to finalise this legislation.</p>  <p>  The Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 reforms and updates family law to address the needs of children living in diverse family types.  The Minister for Health is responsible for Parts 2 and 3 of this Act.  These were commenced in May 2020.  Parts 2 and 3 deal with the issue of donor-assisted human reproduction.  </p>  <p>  While legislation in the area of surrogacy is complex, it is important to note that there are some important protections in place for children in advance of the legislation's enactment.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has published guidelines for intending parents pursuing surrogacy arrangements abroad.  The Irish authorities require intending parents to provide a written undertaking that they will notify their local health centre of children's presence within two working days of their arrival in the State.  In addition, the genetic father is required to provide an undertaking that he will apply to the courts for a declaration of parentage and a guardianship order in respect of the child.  This ensures that his legal relationship with the child is established and that he is in a position to make decisions on behalf of that child.  The intending father must provide appropriate DNA evidence.  An intending mother of a child born through surrogacy is entitled to apply for guardianship of the child where she is married to, or in a civil partnership with, the child's parent or has cohabited with that parent.  </p>  <p>  While these current protections are important, we all recognise that the best interests of children should be supported through the robust regulation of surrogacy.  This is a priority for the Government, as is reflected in the programme for Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1449" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300003#A00600"><p>I thank the Minister.  As I said, I wanted to raise this issue again.  I know it falls under the remits of a number of Departments, including the Departments of Justice and Health.  I also know that the Minister has met with the groups.  In fairness, I believe he also went out to them the day they were here outside the D&aacute;il.  This is so frustrating for them.  They hear a lot of very positive words in this Chamber and in their meetings.  It is rare for everybody in this Chamber to agree on something but this is one of those issues on which we seem to.  There does not seem to be any movement on it.  I understood that legislation is forthcoming.  That definitely needs to deal with the issue of international surrogacy.  That cannot be left out.  Are children who are in precarious situations, perhaps because of a health issue within the family, particularly if it affects the father, going to be left technically parentless?  We all know they would not actually be parentless but they may be in the eyes of the State and that is really important.  Some children could be stuck in a grey area.  This is an issue these groups have been raising for a very long time.  As legislators, there is a responsibility on us to deal with this issue, particularly when there is such cross-party agreement on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300003#A00700"><p>I agree with pretty much everything the Deputy has said.  The issue of international surrogacy will have to be addressed.  We know it is a very sensitive and complex area.  We have to ensure that whatever measures we bring forward offer protection for children when they come to Ireland and for their parents but they should also offer protection to the surrogate mother.  That is really important.  This person will probably be in another jurisdiction and we have to be sure that protections are in place for her and that the child conceived through surrogacy can seek to establish relations with his or her surrogate mother in the future if he or she wishes to do so.  The Deputy is absolutely right with regard to the children who are here now who were conceived through different techniques.  The law we are bringing forward must address all of their situations, which are often quite different from one another.  Bespoke legal solutions may be needed for each situation in which children have been conceived.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1449" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300003#A00800"><p>I have two suggestions for practical solutions.  With regard to the upcoming legislation, could the Minister and the Ministers for Health and Justice write to the committee to see if the pre-legislative scrutiny stage can be progressed as a matter of urgency?  I believe it falls under the remit of the Joint Committee on Health although I would argue that some of it should fall under the remit of the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth as it affects children's rights.  Given that there is consensus on this matter, I believe the Bill could move through the committee and through the Houses very quickly.  I believe everyone would support it.  That is my first suggestion because we need to look at the legislation and the issue of international surrogacy.</p>  <p>  With regard to children who are already with us, the surrogacy groups have really good legal representation and really good solutions based on international best practice.  I know the Minister has met with these groups but is it possible to have a more formal meeting between the three relevant Ministers and Departments and those groups to discuss how to formalise the situations of these children so that they can be taken out of this grey area?  I believe that could be done within a matter of months.</p>  <p>  I know I have gone over my time but I will very briefly note that, over the past two years, we have seen that legislation can be passed quickly when there is an emergency.  We can do the same with regard to children and surrogacy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300003#A00900"><p>I certainly agree.  Urgency is important in this regard.  However, I am sure the Deputy will agree that it is important we get this right in light of the complexity and the different situations we are dealing with.  As I have said, a Bill on AHR is being advanced by the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  I believe it went underwent pre-legislative scrutiny in the term of the previous Oireachtas.  However, as the Deputy has pointed out, it does not address the area of international surrogacy.  An Oireachtas committee could be useful in addressing that matter.  I know the Ministers, Deputies Stephen Donnelly and McEntee, have been engaging very intensively on this issue.  While, as Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, I obviously have to ensure the best-interests principle is always respected, the actual legislative power lies primarily with the Ministers for Health and Justice.  I know that their two Departments have been engaging very intensively and that the Minister, Deputy McEntee, in particular is very eager for the engagement we have had with the groups, which, as the Deputy has said, are expert in this area, to continue.  I am sure that engagement will continue.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.17.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300003#A01100"><p>How were the proposals for the payment rates under the mother and baby institutions payment scheme arrived at?  One of the most disgraceful aspects of the Government's redress scheme for survivors of these institutions is the payment rates.  Mothers who spent less than three months in an institution are to receive a mere &euro;5,000.  These women could have endured human rights violations such as forced family separation and abuse.  Given that many of the proposed payments are contrary to the consultation with survivors, will the Minister please outline how these payment rates were arrived at?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300003#A01200"><p>In developing the proposals for the Government, extensive thought was given to how best to structure a fair and sensitive payment scheme for survivors of mother and baby institutions.  I asked an interdepartmental group to develop proposals for a scheme and to make recommendations for the overall approach to the payments as well as potential payment rates.  With regard to the payment approach, the group strongly advocated for a general approach based on time spent in these institutions rather than individual assessments.</p> <p>This is because of the stakeholder view that any scheme should be non-adversarial with a low burden of proof, and the national and international evidence that a general payment is the best way to achieve that.<br/><br/>This approach eliminates the requirement for applicants to bring forward evidence of abuse to demonstrate an entitlement or undergo any cross-examination of this evidence which by its nature can be adversarial and retraumatising.  Their experience is still, however, recognised through a payment structure which also takes account of more prolonged institutional experiences.<br/><br/>With these important considerations in mind, the group proposed a general payment with a schedule of payment rates similar to the approach taken for the Magdalen restorative justice <i>ex gratia</i>scheme.  The payment rates rise in increments of &euro;5,000 per year in recognition of the prolonged experience of the women and children who spent longest in these institutions.  A separate work-related payment is also being provided for those women who undertook what could be termed as commercial work in these institutions.<br/><br/>Of course, as we have all recognised, no financial payment or service provision could make up for the pain and suffering endured by so many people in mother and baby institutions.  This is acknowledged by the interdepartmental group, a point I have made many times.  The general payments are being made in recognition of time spent in these institutions, harsh conditions, emotional abuse and other forms of mistreatment, stigma and trauma.<br/><br/>It is important to note that the payment scheme stands alongside the 21 other actions the Government has pledged as part of the action plan to recognise the experiences of women and children in mother and baby institutions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300004#B00200"><p>The Minister did not answer the question of how the Department arrived at the rate of potentially &euro;5,000 for forced family separation.  The proposed scheme is deeply flawed in many ways.  The startling inadequacy of the proposed payment amount stands out.  It is still unclear how these rates were decided.  The figures suddenly appear in the interdepartmental groups report which was chaired by an official from the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  A group of civil servants sat down and devised these rates.  Survivors and the public deserve to know how that happened.  What, if any, consideration was given to the scale of abuses, the trauma and the years of stigma and hostility from the State?  Did anyone on the interdepartmental group have any qualifications in psychological trauma or transitional justice?  All those questions remain unanswered.  I ask the Minister to tell the House if he is happy that a woman, who endured the cruelty of the mother and baby institution system, was separated from her child and many other things, will receive as little &euro;5,000.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300004#B00300"><p>Based on what I said a few moments ago and what I said when the scheme was announced, I have always been clear that I and the Government recognise that no amount of money can make up for what happened to women and children in these institutions.  I think I have been clear on that.  We understand that a payment scheme and the range of actions we are taking cannot make up for the trauma that was experienced in these institutions.  However, it is a recognition of what happened.  It is an attempt to provide some element of support to survivors, be they mothers or children, of these institutions.  It is the State coming in behind the apology the Taoiseach made in January of this year.  That is what we are seeking to do in providing this broad payment scheme that will encompass 34,000 survivors of these institutions.</p>  <p>  In my further response I will speak about the payment rates.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300004#B00400"><p>I agree with the Minister that no amount of money could compensate for it, but &euro;5,000 is an insulting amount.  One would get more in a compensation claim for a slip or a fall.  The Department ran a consultation process inviting survivors to participate and many of them found the strength to do so in good faith.  Why then were so many of their recommendations for redress ignored?  The survivors called for an immediate interim payment, enhanced pension or periodic payments and additional sums, based on separate categories of harm suffered.  All that was ignored and none of them feature in the scheme.  The interdepartmental group's report cruelly dismisses some of them.  Most disgracefully for this horrific topic, the perspective of civil servants is being given greater weight than that of survivors.  Again, the State is deciding what happens and what is best for them, ignoring what they said.</p>  <p>  This was clearly an actuarial exercise, more concerned with budgets than trauma, acknowledgement of human rights violations or providing justice for survivors.  Again, their voices have been ignored.  The redress scheme is informed more by the opinion of civil servants than the experience of survivors.  How can we stand over it in good conscience?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300004#B00500"><p>I do not believe it is an actuarial exercise.  If that were the concern, the Government could have tried to rely on the recommendations from the commission which were much narrower.  We could have tried to rely on the recommendations of the interdepartmental group which were much narrower.  However, the Government did not do that.  We went significantly beyond what the commission recommended.  We went significantly beyond what the interdepartmental group recommended.  It would have applied financial payments to 19,000 survivors.  We are applying financial payments to 34,000 survivors.</p>  <p>  The rates are similar to those used in the Magdalen redress scheme, using the criteria of years spent in an institution.  As the Deputy correctly said, for short periods of less than three months' the rate is &euro;5,000 and for those who were there for ten years, it is &euro;60,000.  It is a sliding scale based on the scale used in the Magdalen scheme.</p></speech>

My Department is actively monitoring the issue and has sought data and evidence-based proposals from sectoral representatives.</p>  <p>  Last week, my Department convened a subgroup of the early learning and childcare stakeholder forum to discuss immediate staffing pressures resulting from Covid-19 and additional measures that may be needed.  The group is examining ways to provide additional staffing support on a temporary basis, including a proposal, which is being considered by further and higher education institutions, to build on the current process available to enable students who are undertaking early learning and care qualifications to work in the sector temporarily while carrying on their studies.  The group is meeting again today to consider proposals.</p>  <p> While Covid-19 creates additional pressure, longer term challenges with recruitment and retention of staff remain.  The high level of staff turnover in the sector, which was 18% last year, primarily reflects the level of pay and conditions of employment.  However, we should remember that the sector has continued to grow in recent years, despite the challenges.  Employment in the sector has risen from 25,700 in 2016 to 30,900 last year.  Thanks to considerable supports from the Government over the past 18 months, employee numbers in the sector have held steady.</p>  <p>  The State is not the employer and does not determine pay rates.  However, last December I began a process to examine the possibility of regulating pay and conditions.  This led to the establishment of a joint labour committee, JLC, which has been brought together.</p>  <p>  In budget 2022, I announced the introduction from September 2022 of a significant new core funding stream for services.  Among other objectives, core funding will support services to meet the conditions that may be set in an employment regulation order, ERO, as a result of the JLC.</p>  <p>  I will publish a workforce plan for the sector later this month, which will include important actions to strengthen career pathways and support recruitment.  The plan will also map out a positive way forward for the sector.  I believe the services will develop further as a result in the years ahead.</p></speech>

We have had that discussion and we know it comes down to the pay and conditions.  Highly qualified people are training up to degree level and sometimes beyond but are getting poor rates of pay.  I hope the JLC process works.  The Minister said the State is not the employer.  I wish the State were the employer; I would like to see that happening eventually.  Obviously, it will not happen today or tomorrow.</p>  <p>  The Covid pandemic has put considerable extra pressure on the sector.  There was a recent announcement of special needs assistants, SNAs, to be recruited for schools.  Several people in the early years sector contacted me - I am sure they have contacted other Deputies - to say their staff are applying for the SNA role, leaving them in a difficult situation.</p> <p>We definitely need to address short-term and long-term measures in relation to staffing.</p></speech>

The initiative has been able to provide some kind of extra buffer at the moment in terms of many services experiencing staff being out due to Covid.  We have acted in the short-term to support the sector, particularly as we, hopefully, crest the current Delta wave.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is absolutely correct in terms of the wider issues.  I have acted since I have come into this office.  We have established the Joint Labour Committee, JLC, which is a really important measure.  I think just as importantly, we have come in with financial support.  That core funding announcement in this year's budget is going to be hugely important.  There is a significant allocation of money to support the employment regulation order.  I really hope that the two sides can come together and agree that employment regulation order swiftly.</p></speech>

I have always argued that there should be a wage scale.  I would prefer to see that being taken on by the State but, in the absence of that, I hope the JLC process is successful.</p>  <p>  I welcome what the Minister said about the short-term measures because I think they are doing something similar in the education system in terms of people who are doing their masters.  Is there any data on how many people will be released?  The Minister probably does not have that information right here and now so I ask him to supply that information.</p>  <p>  I look forward to seeing the workforce planning report and it is welcome.  We need to analyse the panel of substitute teachers for schools in the long term.  Perhaps the city and county childcare committees could play a role in establishing a general relief panel for staffing issues when things arise.</p></speech>

We just announced it last week.  I have spoken to one or two child care providers in my constituency who were able to secure some of these students so it is making a difference and alleviating some of the real pressures spoken about by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  This month, we are going to have two very significant announcements, namely the workforce planning announced and published the final report of the expert group on the funding model.  Many Deputies here have waited for both of these for a long time.  These areas have been two real focuses of the early years section of my Department since I became Minister.  We sought to enact one part in the budget in terms of core funding and that was very much influenced by the expert group.  It is important that, even though the expert group was not finalised, we worked as quickly as possible to start to implement one of its most important recommendations.  We did not wait until budget 2023 before starting to take action.  There will be some significant announcements in the next week or two in this area.</p></speech>

I have been to both centres and was very impressed by the caring and inclusive way, they respond to the needs of families in their communities.  However, in the entire north of County Leitrim, a distance of 62 km from Drumshanbo to Tullaghan, families have no access to the supports and resources provided by family life centres.  These centres are badly needed and I ask the Minister to ring-fence funding for such a centre in Manorhamilton.</p></reply>

My Department allocates core funding for the programme.  Since 2019 we have provided an additional &euro;1.5 million to this important service and funding for 2021 amounted to &euro;18 million.</p>  <p>  My Department also secured funding for Tusla to support existing family resource centres, primarily with expenses relating to equipment and premises, through the dormant accounts fund for 2020 and 2021.  Tusla is currently arranging to pay over &euro;650,000 to relevant centres from 2021 dormant accounts funding.</p>  <p>  Tusla provided once-off additional supports during 2021 to many of its community and voluntary sector bodies, including family resource centres, to assist them in responding to Covid challenges.  As the Deputy mentioned, Tusla works with community-based family support centres and organisations and the two existing family resource centres in Carrick-on-Shannon and Mohill, to meet the needs of vulnerable children, families and communities.</p>  <p>  My Department and Tusla have formed a family support subgroup to better understand the demand in this sector and to understand demand for family recourse centres.  The output from this group is intended to be an integrated model of family support that expounds the national service delivery framework and provides clarity to policymakers, practitioners and service users across the continuum of need.  In carrying out this work it will look at existing provision of family support and resource allocation to family support.</p>  <p>  In budget 2022, Tusla has been allocated &euro;899 million, which is an increase of &euro;41 million.  The specific amount to be used in 2022 for its various services, including family resource centres, has not yet been finalised.  The matter will be addressed in the agency's business plan that will be submitted to my Department in the coming weeks.  I have issued my performance statement to Tusla outlining the overall performance parameters for Tusla.  In response to this, Tusla will prepare its annual business plan for 2022 and within that it will outline its provision of support for family resource centres.</p></speech>

He said that the budget is not finalised yet.  Both the Minister and I know that one of the most important aspects of family resource centres is that they are rooted in their communities, involve community participation and respond to the specific needs of families, especially in disadvantaged areas across the country.  While the two centres in south Leitrim do really good work they are too far away and their focus is, rightly, on their communities.  There are four electoral areas in County Sligo and each one of them has a family resource centre.  There are three electoral areas in County Leitrim but only two of them have a family resource centre.  In north Leitrim, over a distance of 62 km from Drumshambo to Tullaghan, there is no family resource centre so a centre is needed on the basis of geography, on the basis of responding to the needs of families and supporting families so that they can access these services.</p></speech>

I have visited a number, even in my own constituency, and they are quite different in terms of what they address because they respond to the immediate community need.  The work being done by Tusla at the moment, in terms of the family subgroup between my Department and Tusla, looks at the overall supports provided to families across the country.  Often Tusla provides family supports in an area without there necessarily being a resource centre.  The subgroup will give the full understanding of the range of services that are available and the range of supports that can be put in place, ensuring the geographical gaps in services provided, described by the Deputy in north Leitrim and I see them in my constituency as well, can be addressed and filled.</p></speech>

He has said that sometimes Tusla provides supports without family support centres.  The Minister and I know that a family support centre provides holistic resources and supports to families within a geographical area, which is hugely important.  Sometimes disadvantage can be harder to see in rural areas.  It is more dispersed and because of that it is less visible.  However, we still have many families on low incomes, an ageing population and small farm holdings.  We also have the same pattern of alcohol and drug misuse, abuse and addiction as everywhere else in the country.  The families in the very significant part of County Leitrim that I have referred to need these services.  I ask the Minister, in his capacity, works with Tusla to ensure that families in that area can get the kind of services that are available all around them in other counties.</p></speech>

As she knows, the determination on the allocation of family resource centres is a matter for Tusla.  It is important, in my role as Minister, to give the agency the discretion in that.</p>  <p>  I understand what the Deputy is saying that disadvantage is present in all urban and rural communities across the country.  I come from a very urban constituency and I know that the needs in a rural constituency are different but it does not mean that they cannot become as extreme.</p> <p>As I said, work is being undertaken currently to get a wider understanding of what family support services are available across the country and how they can be deployed more effectively to support need, be it in an urban or rural setting.  That is really important.  It is also really importance that the rural element of that shines through.  I ask that the Deputy writes to me on this particular issue and I will convey it to Tusla so that we can advance the provision of these supports.</p></speech>

The increase will be targeted at improving outcomes for children, young people and their families, as well as promoting equality and human rights.  I am allocating an extra &euro;78 million for the early learning and school-age childcare sector, &euro;41 million additional funding for Tusla and an extra &euro;41 million for international protection and the work to end direct provision, in addition to &euro;23 million for a range of other areas.</p>  <p>  The main spending areas - childcare, international protection and Tusla - represent 89% of the overall budget and are receiving a significant proportion of the increased funding.  In early learning and childcare, the bulk of the extra funding allows for a new core funding scheme for providers, which in return for a commitment not to increase parents' fees will entitle them to access a new funding stream to help cover increased operating costs linked to quality improvement measures.</p>  <p>  The additional resources for Tusla will bring funding for the agency to almost &euro;900 million and will allow it to continue to grow, to improve front-line services and to support those services provided by its partners in the community and voluntary sector.  This investment underlines the Government's commitment to ensuring that Tusla has the resources to meet its mission of protecting and supporting our most vulnerable children and families.</p>  <p>  A key priority for me is to end direct provision and I have allocated additional funding to start the transition to a new model of accommodation to meet expected increased demand for accommodation for international protection applicants in 2022.  Other very important areas, such as youth, equality and inclusion, are also receiving increases.  I have also placed a particular emphasis on supporting services for former residents of mother and baby institutions.</p>  <p>  I am very pleased the additional resources of &euro;183 million for my Department will allow us advance with significant work in 2022 and, indeed, achieve many of the programme for Government commitments</p></speech>

I have another question on childcare and I will leave until then.</p>  <p>  On international protection, the Minister is doing an awful lot of work in trying to end the direct provision system.  Will he give us an outline of how the additional &euro;41 million will expedite that process?  There is also &euro;3 million specifically for refugee and migrant integration and anti-racism projects.  Will the Minister provide a list of those projects?

It is to increase our capacity to respond to people as they arrive.  Another significant portion of that money will be used in securing the first element of the community accommodation for the new model and for providing the initial people moving into community accommodation with an independent living allowance, which will be really important in supporting them there.</p>  <p>  What was the second area of funding?</p></speech>

There is an extra &euro;5.6 million.  I know it is not under the direct remit of the Department, but the national Traveller education strategy is overdue and necessary.  It is the central plank for supporting the Traveller community.  It is always the first ask when one speaks to representatives from the Traveller community who are trying to do more.  I appreciate the additional funding, but are the Minister's officials working to expedite that with the Department of Education?  Can we do more on that please, Minister?</p></speech>

The national Traveller and Roma education strategy is something I feel passionate about.  It does fall within the remit of my Department because early years is a key issue.  We know in terms of accessing the early childhood care and education scheme, ECCE, the access rate of the Travelling community is 10% less than the settled community.  The educational disadvantage is already being ingrained there.  Funding will deal with that.  Part of the allocated extra money is to ensure that the Traveller pilot programme - I do not have the name right - which is run in a number of schools across the country and seeks to support the retention in particular of Traveller children in education, is supported for another year.  It had originally run for two years but because of Covid, it will run for an extra year.</p>  <p>  There are a range of reports published.  The Out of the Shadows report is really important, as well as a significant report on bullying in schools with a particular lens on the bullying Traveller children have had experienced.  A range of issues will feed into the Traveller and Roma education strategy that we will be working to bring to fruition next year.</p></speech>

The establishment of a national memorial and records centre is a core commitment within the plan and provides a basis for several other interdependent projects.  The national centre will stand as a national memorial in honour of those who were resident in mother and baby homes, county institutions, industrial schools, Magdalene laundries and other related institutions.  It will make a significant contribution to our journey of recognising and learning from the failures of the past, acknowledging the hurt which continues to be felt by survivors and seeking to rebuild a relationship of trust with those who have been so gravely wronged.</p>  <p>  With the intention of advancing this project as a priority, the Secretary General to the Government has been appointed to lead a cross-Government process to advance work on a national memorial and records centre.  This process, which will include engagement with survivors, will develop an overarching vision and proposed approach for the creation of the national centre.  Once this initial work is complete, a proposal will be brought to the Government for approval.  I have secured funding of &euro;1 million per annum for 2022 and 2023 to support the immediate preparatory work and research needed to deliver this centre.</p>  <p>  The national centre will include an archive of records relating to institutional trauma, alongside personal accounts of survivors' lived experiences, as well as presenting the historical and social context.  More generally, my Department has already appointed an archivist and established a dedicated information management unit to lead on the preservation and access to our records, including the commission's archive.  In addition to the national centre, work is being advanced in conjunction with the local authorities to deliver on the commitment to support local memorialisation across the country.  Furthermore, financial support is available from my Department through the commemorative grant scheme to support survivor groups in commemorating their experiences in a manner which fits their own specific needs.</p>  <p>  As we have learned from our consultations with survivors, memorialisation is very important to many of them, but it means many different things to different people.  In recognition of this, consistent consultation will be facilitated to ensure the process is informed by those most centrally involved with the experiences.</p></speech>

It is important that the survivors play an important role in this.  We have all learned from our meetings with survivors the importance of access to records and that there are no barriers.  That is our commitment from this Government, that we will make sure no survivor who wants to access his or her records encounters barrier after barrier.</p> <p>I am delighted that the Secretary General of the Government will chair this.  That is very important.  Like other Deputies, I have been working with survivors in my area.  One learns from that.  We will all remember listening to the stories of survivors about their journey.  This national memorial will play a significant part in helping them on that journey.  That is all we can do, as the Minister said.  We can only help them as best we can and make sure we are there to give them that support.</p></speech>

I agree with her.  The national records and memorial centre will be really important.  It will be important for survivors as it will be a physical manifestation of a recognition of what happened to them and, as the Deputy stated, it will provide a place for their stories and personal accounts to be told.  It is important for society as well in terms of educating people about what happened in these institutions.  It is also important from a historical perspective in terms of ensuring there is a single place where these records are accessible to historians and maybe individuals researching information about their families.  It is important that these records are made available in a very accessible format online as well, recognising that the survivor community is an international one.  It is all over the world and it should be easy for its members, wherever they are living now, to access these really important records.</p></speech>

Access, whether online or through one's local authority or the HSE or whatever, is important.  The message we have to send to survivors is that we are here to help them access their records if needed.</p>  <p>  Does the Minister have a timescale for this?  I welcome the funding allocated but timing is very important here in the context of all the work the Minister and the Government have been doing.  I know we on the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth have been working really hard with the survivors.  We need to get this up and running as soon as possible.  Letting survivors know is important.  Communication is key and I know it is a priority for the Minister.  It is about letting everyone know what is happening.  The survivors should be kept updated, whether through some sort of helpline or communications through the various Departments.  I always believe communication is key and that is the best way forward.</p></speech>

My Department is endeavouring to ensure we communicate effectively on this issue.  We send out a quarterly bulletin to approximately 500 survivors who are on a mailing list.  We engage with them by way of the quarterly update, but also letting them know when major announcements are being made, such as in respect of the recently announced institutional payments and updates on other legislative provisions.  That communication is there.  If there are survivors in the Deputy's constituency who wish to be added to that list, she should let me know and we can do that.</p>  <p>  We want to advance the national records and memorial centre quickly.  The Secretary General for the Government is probably in the best place to bring together the various Departments and agencies to undertake that work.  I know he is bringing together this group to undertake that initial scoping work, as well as getting that element of survivor consultation done.  It is a balance between moving quickly and ensuring there is adequate consultation.  I think we will strike that balance and move this really important project quickly.</p></speech>

The programmes offered by various Departments can collectively offer that kind of holistic response to the needs of young people.  The infrastructure of youth services across the country that are funded by my Department includes the 30 national youth organisations, a significant number of local clubs and the youth function of the education and training boards.  It works closely with agencies and local organisations, including many sporting bodies, on areas of mutual interest.  I and my officials are always happy to engage with any organisation that is interested in our policy role.</p>  <p>  At national level, my Department participates in an interdepartmental sports leadership group chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, which oversees the implementation of the national sports policy.  The Sports Action Plan 2021-23 published by the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, in recent days includes actions to increase participation in sport by young people.  One key action is the convening of a youth-centred stakeholder forum in early 2022.  Youth organisations will be consulted as part of this process.</p>  <p>  UBU: Your Place, Your Space is the main scheme for youth services funded by my Department.  The scheme provides out-of-school supports to marginalised, disadvantaged or vulnerable young people to enable them to achieve their full potential.  It recognises that youth services engage with young people through a wide range of activities that may include drama, music and sport, for example.  In addition, there are some legacy sport-related supports that meet the criteria of UBU: Your Place, Your Space and they have continued to be funded on that basis.  I am happy to continue to engage across Government on the issue of support for youth and sport, and my Department will always work collaboratively with youth organisations and agencies such as Sport Ireland to advance this.</p></speech>

I appreciate the reply.  I acknowledge the wonderful work that is done by sporting organisations across all sporting disciplines, as well as youth services around the country.  They make a massive difference in people's lives.  I tabled this question this because I think there is potential to do more in terms of using the capital and community infrastructure that is in place in the context of the sporting world to try to provide even more services in areas where there are no services outside the immediate primary sporting function of organisations.   I am cognisant of the fact that many young people are not engaged in sport.  How do we provide services for such young people?  At present, if they are not engaged in sport, there is very little else for them.  Can we leverage the network of sporting organisations around the country to create something for those young people and include them, although not in the primary sporting sense?  A holistic inclusion model would be very achievable, given the massive networks that exist in every community.</p></speech>

It is really important for us to get that balance to encourage young people to do what they want and to support them.  I think all present agree that trying to leverage young people into anything they do not want to do is absolutely not the right way to go.  The point made by the Deputy in respect of the availability of locations and buildings is a really valuable one.  I understand the Deputy will raise at a later stage the issue of capital funding for youth services.  Securing premises for usage is always an issue and there may well be things that can be done in that regard.  Youth services and sport probably have the same busy times but there may be something we could do to leverage the use of community space.</p></speech>

The local GAA club in a rapidly growing village is seeking to build new clubhouses and dressing rooms.  It is very open and recognises that, apart from its sports club, there is very little for young people to do in the locality.  Right now, it is very open to the concept of building the clubhouses but including in that new development a space that can be used for young people who may not be interested in playing Gaelic football or hurling to come in and be part of the community, develop as young adults, enjoy themselves and have a place to go at weekends and during school holidays and all of that.  That is not really recognised in the capital schemes as they are currently set up.  The sports capital programme is brilliant and there is space for collaboration and joint applications, but something specifically and formally organised between the Minister's Department and the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media would be really beneficial and progressive.</p> <p>It would try to capture those children, there are many such children, who do not engage in sport.  They are just not interested in it and it is not their thing, but they feel very much excluded because of that.</p></speech>

We are aware that the difficulty in securing capital for community buildings is a major issue for so many community organisations, be they sports clubs, youth services or more general kinds of groups.  I would certainly be happy to talk to the Department responsible for sport about what could be done to make it easier for the two areas to come together.  In my local authority area, Fingal County Council is building community centres that may have sport and childcare elements, but also a youth services element.  When the process is being led by the local authority, it may have a more rounded sense, but if sports organisations show leadership in the way the Deputy described, it is valuable.</p></speech>

Since then, my Department has taken a series of steps to implement these reforms, with a view to completing them by the end of 2024.</p>  <p>  A staff team has been established in my Department to lead the transition to the new model.  Ending direct provision and putting in place the new system, with its focus on human rights, not-for-profit delivery, and integration from day one, requires a whole-of-government approach.  My Department is therefore working closely with key stakeholders across government to plan, design, and implement the changes described in the White Paper.</p>  <p>  I have appointed a programme board, including officials from relevant Departments and agencies, and independent members, to oversee the transition.  The board has met four times since its establishment and its next meeting is scheduled for 16 December.</p>  <p>  I have appointed a three-person external advisory group whose role is that of independent observer of the implementation of the new policy.  Through its work, this group will help to build confidence in the reform programme among all stakeholders.  This group has already met twice, most recently on 19 November.</p>  <p>  As stated in the White Paper, I intend to have the new system of supports and accommodation for international protection applicants operational by December 2024.  This means we are working to end the use of all centres that do not meet the requirements for own-door and own-room accommodation by this time.</p>  <p>  We have made good progress on this objective to date.  Working with the Housing Agency, my Department has begun to acquire the accommodation needed to implement the White Paper reforms.  We are prioritising the acquisition of accommodation for phase 2 &mdash; that is, after people have completed their initial four months in a reception and integration centre and move into the community &mdash; and are now acquiring properties in this regard.  We are planning for the process of moving the first applicants into this accommodation to begin in 2022 and for it to accelerate over the following years as more properties come on stream.</p>  <p>  Working with the housing experts on the programme board, my Department is developing an ownership model for the accommodation, in addition to a funding model to enable approved housing bodies and other not-for-profit organisations to act as our delivery partners.  A subcommittee of the programme board is finalising a policy approach concerning the ownership model.  An allocation key to determine the spread of this accommodation across all counties has been agreed by local authorities and is being used to determine where properties should be acquired.</p>  <p>  With respect to integration, the House will be aware that the White Paper commits to the principle of &ldquo;integration from day one&rdquo; for all international protection applicants.  My Department is currently developing the detailed policy required to meet this commitment.  Integration supports will be delivered during both phase 1 and phase 2 of the new model.  My Department is working with local authorities to develop a system of integration supports.</p>  <p>  A nationwide network of integration support workers will help to deliver these supports, building on the current model established under the Irish refugee protection programme.  Applicants will also have access to integration supports delivered by service providers at a local level through interagency working groups co-ordinated by the relevant local authority.</p>  <p>  When living in the community, applicants will receive an international protection support payment to enable them to meet their needs.  A child payment will also be provided.  A detailed policy on the international protection support payments is being developed by my Department.  The draft policy was submitted to the programme board for review on 21 October 2021.</p>  <p>  It will take time to end direct provision and replace it with a new and very different system of accommodation and supports, grounded in human rights and delivered on a not-for-profit basis.  However, work to develop the new model is well under way and I am fully committed to implementing the model by December 2024.</p></speech>

It is important today to acknowledge the work of both the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on undocumented migrants.  It will have an important effect on asylum seekers.  Undocumented migrants who have been here for four years are being given today a once-in-a-generation amnesty to remain here and have their status regularised.  It will affect 17,000 people, including 3,000 children.  This is welcome because, in the discussions with the various migrant groups and the Department leading up to this, I lobbied to bring asylum seekers into the process.  With regard to the systems for asylum seekers who have been in the State in a documented way and people who have been here in an undocumented way, for various reasons, there had to be some measure of parity of treatment.  I am glad asylum seekers have been included.  How many will be affected?  I believe the arrangement pertains to people who have been here for two years.  It will have an effect on the Minister's dismantling work.  How many asylum seekers does the Minister believe will benefit from the important announcement of the Government today?</p></speech>

As he knows, it follows on from 21 years of an unjust and unjustified system.  It follows on from the McMahon report in 2015, which made 173 recommendations; the Oireachtas report of former Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, an excellent report; the report from Dr. Catherine Day; and the White Paper from the Minister.  I am mentioning only some of the reports.  The Minister has a job on his hands because we have a major housing crisis.  I appreciate that.  I mentioned all the reports to give the background and the 21-year history.  This is difficult to solve.  When I read the White Paper and Catherine Day's report, I understood the complexity of the matter, but we have no choice.  The Minister has set up an implementation body.  Could he guide me on that?  Is it an observer body or will it have power?  How will the feedback come?</p></speech>

I am very excited about that.  It is an important development, for which my party pushed very strongly in negotiating the programme for Government.  The Minister and Minister of State in the Department of Justice have shown great leadership in this area.  It will be a life-changing experience for undocumented migrants to fully regularise their affairs and participate fully in society.  I particularly welcome the fact that the measure has been extended to international protection applicants who have been in the system for more than two years.  We estimate that there are 2,800 in that category.  The mechanism will be significant in regularising the affairs of the very large number who are already in the process.  Therefore, when we bring in all elements of the White Paper, we will have a smaller number and will be able to move more rapidly.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Connolly's question, we have a programme board that works at a high level, in that it brings in staff from my Department and experts from other agencies.  It oversees the implementation overall.  The transition team, comprising civil servants in my Department, is working on a day-to-day basis on implementing the White Paper.  The advisory group, comprising Dr. Catherine Day, Dr. Lorcan Sirr and Dr. David Donoghue, is overseeing what we are doing, criticising if we are getting it wrong and giving us a bit of guidance.  The transition team is working from day to day, the programme board is engaged in implementation at cross-departmental and cross-agency levels and making sure all Departments are working away on this, and the advisory group, which I hope will give good reports on progress, is in place to flag failures to meet deadlines.  Catherine Day has a track record in this area, David Donoghue has worked very much in the area of international human rights and Lorcan Sirr, as we all know, is an expert in housing.  Therefore, the advisory group includes the key areas.  As the Deputy said, housing will be essential in getting this right.</p></speech>

It is a very important piece of work and is a credit to all of them.</p>  <p>  I wish to raise an issue on which I have spoken to a number of asylum seekers and I know that this is not a universal one but is about the plans on housing.  Many have told me that they do not necessarily want the housing assistance payment, HAP.  They are working and capable of work and of earning, want more flexibility than that, and do not want a system that requires them to participate in a HAP-type model where they feel that they do not necessarily need it.  I just wanted to highlight that point of flexibility within the work that the Minister is developing.  It is certainly part of the feedback that I have received directly from people who are working in the medical and caring sectors, particularly in different parts of the country where there is less relative pressure on prices for rental accommodation and where they may have other arrangements available to them.  I ask that the Minister keep that flexibility in mind from this feedback that I am giving him today.</p></speech>

Will those minutes or reports be available publicly so that we can see them?  It is not that I do not trust the Minister but we have had 21 years dealing with this issue.  Even when I outlined the reports I forgot to mention the Ombudsman&rsquo;s many reports on it and I am sure that I have not mentioned other reports.</p>  <p>  When one looks at the International Protection Accommodation Services reports, we got one back in November 2018.  We were supposed to get them regularly.  We have a new one now, the October one which is just out, and I welcome it.  There has been a gap.  Can the Minister explain why there has been a gap with these reports that give us updated figures and statistics?  From what I can see there is a very significant gap between November 2018 and October 2021.  That is my difficulty in this.  With the enormity of the challenge, given the housing crisis, I welcome the not for profit approach, the human rights framework and the use of that language but it is making a reality of this which is important.</p></speech>

We have always made provision where some people here are seeking international protection but do not enter direct provision because they are in a situation where they can provide for themselves.  There is flexibility, yes, but there is a key issue about people being treated similarly to Irish nationals also, and that there is no distinction in treatment.  That is also important in respect of the credibility of the overall system.  I thank the Deputy for the point, nonetheless.</p>  <p>  In respect of the Deputy Connolly&rsquo;s point, I will follow up on the specific issue on the gap between reports as I am unsure what the answer to that is at this time.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is completely correct in reflecting the failures to deliver on improvements on direct provision in the past and that is why it is so important for transparency.  The reports of the independent advisory group, therefore, will be made public.  The group members were very clear to me that they wanted to see themselves as having this independent oversight, that there was no element of window-dressing and that these are people who want to be engaged in this process.  They all have a stake in this and have shown that from their track record.  Their reports, be they positive or critical, will be independently available.</p></speech>

This is a seven-year plan for giving better support to childminding in the home.  Can I have an update on that please?</p></reply>

The National Action Plan for Childminding 2021-2028 which I published in April, sets out a phased, incremental approach to extending supports and regulation to all non-relative childminders.  It aims to improve access to high quality and affordable early learning and care and school-age childcare through childminding.</p>  <p>  During phase 1 of the plan, which began recently and is expected to last two to three years, childminding-specific regulations will be developed that are proportionate and appropriate to childminders, as will childminder-specific training.  In addition, primary legislation will be amended, and there will be further engagement and consultation with childminders. </p>  <p>  The steering group for the plan met for the first time in September and again on 1 December.  Its role is to drive, oversee and monitor implementation.  The steering group will be supported by four advisory groups on stakeholder engagement; training and support; regulation and inspection; and funding and financial supports.  The first two </p>  <p>advisory groups have already commenced their work. </p>  <p>  In line with commitments in the national action plan, childminders are represented on the steering group and the advisory groups.  In addition, Childminding Ireland which </p>  <p>represents childminders, is a member of these groups, and officials in my Department continue to work closely with Childminding Ireland, engaging on a regular basis. </p>  <p>  Extensive consultation with parents, childminders and representative bodies took place throughout the development of the plan and continues in the implementation phase that has now begun.  Ongoing consultation will be critical to effective implementation and work will begin shortly on developing a stakeholder engagement strategy.  In addition, my Department provides funding to representative bodies and support information and engagement with childminders on the plan. </p>  <p>  Childminders who are registered with Tusla can avail of the national childcare scheme, NCS, allowing parents to avail of subsidies.  The plan aims to support a much wider cohort of childminders to register with Tusla and, therefore, to take part in the national childcare scheme.  In this way, the plan will support parental choice in the type of provider of early learning and care and school-age childcare.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that work in this important area is making progress.  Childminding is a key part of the early years sector which up to quite recently was not getting the attention it deserved.  The national action plan has set out clearly where we want to go and does so in a way that emphasises a collaborative and step-by-step approach.  I will continue to support these developments in the coming years.</p></speech>

We are now spending, I believe, &euro;716 million, with a doubling of the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme of childcare places and a real focus, that has had to be there, on the regulatory standards around that sector.  There were some very good childcare providers and childminders but very many that were not.  We have seen that in quite distressing ways over the past ten years and a very significant amount of work has had to be done.</p>  <p>  Coming directly to this issue with the Minister, Fine Gael did an extensive consultation piece with thousands of parents and childminders, as he is aware, in its Care of the Child document.  The two big issues that emerged from this were, of course, cost, which we are aware of and flexibility.  The Minister said himself this morning that listening to parents and to what they need enables the flexibility that can can be built in for them in any model.  That may be in childcare facilities themselves or with childminders in order to be able to build choice and flexibility into a model, particularly recognising how people&rsquo;s working lives have changed and their needs are now different.</p></speech>

As she knows I have met with colleagues from her party on that comprehensive policy work that her party undertook.  The issue of flexibility is of great importance and childminding is a very significantly flexible element of the early years sector.  There is a very large number of people working in childminding.  The parents who use those services cannot, for the most part, avail of the NCS, because the childminders are not registered with Tusla.  We are beginning this process to bring a greater degree of regulation, recognising that childminders are not the same as centre-based carers.  The regulation should be different but still has to be of a relevant standard.  The educational qualifications are, equally, different but also have to be of a relevant standard.  We need to encourage childminders not to see this as some sort of negative or imposition but to see it as a way of supporting them and the parents that they work with financially.</p></speech>

When the Minister is doing this, can he make it easier for parents to formally set childminders up as employees, or whatever mechanism is appropriate?  People are not used to doing that and to creating businesses.  It is relatively straightforward but is not easy.  People want to be compliant and to ensure that everything is done correctly, so I ask that the Minister might remember that point.</p><p>There is also an ongoing question on the status of <i>au pairs</i>as people are not sure what that will mean for the future.  </p><p>I will return to the point about flexibility and it is related to his other piece of work on gender equality.  One of the points that arises - and I acknowledge that the Minister has done the work on the gender pay gap - and has a big impact potentially on flexibility and gender equality is the need to look at the culture of organisations.  This is how parents of both genders can go in and request flexible working four-day weeks instead of what has happened traditionally, where women go in looking for a three-day week and a man stays at a five-day week, with all of the implications that has.  The Minister now has a model through the gender pay gap reporting mechanism.  Can we think about how we could extend that to look at how often men are looking for flexible working also - whether that can be documented and noted in annual reports or anything of that kind - to try to get a picture of what that might look like for the future?</p></speech>

Some of that is through my Department and some is through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I believe that a monitoring element would be really useful in the context of getting the take-up.  We have seen a huge increase in the take-up of parental leave by both parents.  Whereas originally and pre-pandemic it was primarily just mothers, now we are seeing a lot of fathers taking that leave, which is positive.</p>  <p>  On childminding and the regularisation discussion, it is estimated that about 10% of the undocumented migrants who have the opportunity to be regularised through that scheme are actually working in the childcare sector.  I believe that the vast majority of those are probably childminding.  The work the Government is doing today on that will allow these people to regularise their situation and, hopefully in terms of the work we are doing on the childminding action plan, give them a stable career going forward.</p></speech>

I also believe that a career structure will be necessary to support the further professionalisation of the sector and to make careers in the sector more attractive.  Establishing clear and supported career pathways is important in improving the recruitment and retention of staff and in enhancing practitioners' continued professional development, both of which better support outcomes for children.  Putting in place a career structure will involve giving clarity on the different roles and services, as well as on the tasks and qualification requirements for those roles.  It also will involve identifying and supporting career pathways for individuals to progress their careers within the sector.  These are all elements that will form part of the workforce plan that I will publish the next number of weeks.</p>  <p>  Work began in 2019 on developing on a workforce plan for the sector.  The processes involved extension extensive engagement with sectoral representatives, as well as a public consultation process.  The workforce plan will set out actions to achieve related commitments in the First 5 strategy, including: a graduate-led workforce by 2028; development of a career framework; a national infrastructure for continuing professional development; and strengthening leadership development opportunities.  I will shortly publish the workforce plan, which has been developed in parallel with the work of the expert group on the funding model.  Commitments in the workforce plan are expected to complement the development of the core funding stream that was committed to in budget 2022.</p>  <p>  Another element of a career structure is the rates we pay.  It is vital to recognise the value of the work, with higher rates of pay for those with greater responsibilities or higher qualifications.  While the State is not the employer and I have no power to set wage rates, I have already referred to the process I began last December that has led to the recent establishment of a joint labour committee.  With this process now in place and with the backing of the new core funding stream from September 2022, I believe there is a real prospect of improvements in pay rates in this sector.  I am looking forward to progressing the expert group and the workforce development plan in the next week or two.</p></speech>

Has the Department done research on this?  What areas has the Department identified?  What must we do now to ensure we do not have such high turnover?  In his response to me, the Minister referred to people who are highly qualified.  They are moving on to other jobs.  I have come across people who have qualifications in childcare and who are not going into the sector because it is not attractive to them.  It is important, therefore, that we have the proper structure and the proper pay in place.  We also need to make sure that there is continuity and people do not feel they must leave because it is no longer a viable proposition for them to stay in the sector.  Perhaps the Minister will further outline his Department's knowledge in this area and the research the Department has done.</p></speech>

Just like him, I too have met constituents and young people, primarily young women, who have done the four years of a level 7 or level 8 course, and who then decided not to go into the sector because they did not see that career pathway for them.  As the Deputy noted, the issues are primarily pay and conditions.  Childcare professionals are not paid enough and the conditions are not adequate.  This is why we have such staff turnover.  The Deputy asked about research on this.  In 2020, the turnover was 18% across the sector, which is very significant.  It has an impact on the young people who have done all the study and then do not feel there is a future for them.  There is also an impact on the children because they are continuously meeting new childcare professionals in their service.  The bond they create, which is very important for the learning element of early learning and care, is not being established.  We are very aware of the problems.  Pay and conditions are the key elements.  The work we are doing with the workforce development plan and funding of the joint labour committee are how we are responding to that.</p></speech>

I can certainly touch base with him on that.  My Department has been in constant touch with the T&aacute;naiste because we are aware that the lack of sick pay, particularly in light of the current crisis, has been a major issue for the sector.  I am happy to touch base further, but that is certainly the assumption we have been working on.  While pay is absolutely important, conditions are also really important.  Nobody should be coming in sick to work but particularly not childcare professionals given the vulnerability of the children they work with.</p>  <p>  The joint labour committee is an independent process.  It has been established.  I got the ball rolling with the pre-process we engaged in.  The Minister of State, Deputy English, has now called sides together through the Labour Court.  It is now up to the Labour Court to oversee this process, by bringing together the five union representatives and the five employer representatives.  I would urge them all to act quickly because we have made financial provision to deliver this.</p></speech>

I am conscious that our towns and villages are full of derelict buildings that potentially could be renovated and made available for young people as youth cafes or centres where young people could go and hang out to have some place to go on weekend nights.  Many towns and villages around the State do not have those facilities at the moment.</p></reply>

Their input in recent years has greatly informed budgetary decisions.  For the past number of years, the annual capital budget available to youth services has been approximately &euro;3 million.  Decisions on the allocation of these funds are made based on an assessment of need at a given time and the consultations I have referenced.  The funding is distributed among more than 30 national youth organisations, over 250 funded UBU Your Place Your Space youth services, and more than 1,500 youth clubs funded by my Department.</p>  <p>  At present, youth clubs and services are largely operating from shared community facilities, their own premises or rented accommodation.  This reflects, for many, the age profile of young people being served which is schoolgoing, and the part-time requirements for accommodation.</p>  <p>  In recent years, capital funding for physical infrastructure has been provided in relation mainly to minor works, equipment, ICT and as a contribution to local authorities for the development of playground facilities.  In 2020 and 2021, works to adapt outdoor spaces, ventilation, sanitary upgrades and other Covid-19 related refurbishments were eligible for funding.  This enabled both the move to increase our online working with young persons and to create suitable spaces for meeting in person.  The capital allocation for 2022 will be finalised over the coming weeks.</p></speech>

There is a massive opportunity from a housing perspective but also to provide the types of buildings and facilities we know are needed.  I refer in particular to former pubs and shops.  Our towns and villages are dotted with such buildings that are boarded up.  Community organisations are there and, with a capital injection, they will run those places and make them available.  The capital injection is the key to joining the dots.  That would be a very ambitious and progressive programme.</p> <p> As I said earlier, we need a collaboration with sporting organisations in respect of the sports capital programme for organisations that want to provide youth-specific spaces in their clubs and facilities.  It would be money wisely invested and we would not have to reinvent the wheel.  Many of the social organisations are there, as is the infrastructure.  It just needs a capital injection.</p></speech>

My capital budget in this area is not huge - I have to be upfront about that - and much of it at the moment is being spent on supporting existing services and maintenance.  Many of the buildings in youth services are old and we are backing them up.  What I have been able to grow quite significantly over the past two years is our current budget.  Almost the opposite to what the Deputy was saying, perhaps we could get local authorities or something along those lines to examine buildings or derelict sites they have identified where there could be co-operation.  We have additional current funding to start running services.  Six new UBU services were set up this year and I hope we can get eight next year through the additional &euro;5 million we have invested in youth services.  There are ways for people to work together and I am always happy to engage on those points.</p></speech>

Young people should not be left behind and should be included in those plans.  There is a strong case for that Department to get additional capital funding to help, either solely or in a collaborative way, to provide those types of facilities.  Whether it is done through that Department or through some sort of a formal collaboration with the Department of Rural and Community Development or even local government, getting spaces for young people to hang out, have somewhere to go and be safe is really important in every town and village.  There are many towns and villages throughout the country where young people do not have anywhere to go.  They hang out on street corners and, inevitably, end up in trouble.  Having those spaces to go to and to be safe in is very important.</p></speech>

Throughout the country, there are youth organisations that have nowhere to go.  Has the Department considered engaging schools that are closed?  Some of them, which often have fantastic facilities the State has paid for, lie idle at night and on weekends, when young people could use them.  Throughout the country, in towns and villages, they are there.  Will the Minister give some thought to that and engage with schools?  It would not cost a lot.</p>  <p>  Minibuses are something youth organisations keep telling me they would like to have to get out of the club and into the countryside.  Is there a fund through which they can apply to get that kind of facility?</p></speech>

Whether it is through the Minister&rsquo;s Department or whatever, we need an audit of buildings that are lying idle in order to determine which of them can be used better.  We need also to build in the wider question of those youth supports and an audit of those projects and services that operate and where the gaps are.  I have said previously to the Minister that we need to deal with those absolutely necessary family supports.  That is a vital matter.  At times really good projects have been in operation but their remit has been widened and we have lost the thrust.  I will continue that conversation later with the Minister.</p></speech>

The one thing we have learned from Covid is that we are going to do things differently.  We have seen that young people need supports, particularly after Covid.  Unfortunately, we could be living with Covid for a long time, so we need to enhance facilities, schools, GAA and soccer clubs.  I have noticed in my community that many of the youth facilities finish at 5 p.m. and do not operate in the evenings, at night or at weekends.  That is when young people need to be engaged with.  The derelict sites levy is not being enforced by the local authorities.  It is the tool to force these landlords to use those buildings, and youth facilities could be a part of that.</p></speech>

We provided an additional &euro;5 million in both budget 2021 and budget 2022.  We have continued to provide those financial supports in order that we can have more services.  I visited the Kilkenny and Ossory youth services, based in Kilkenny city.  Under its UBU, it has a mandate to provide rural youth services in a range of towns and villages throughout rural County Kilkenny.  There is a model there.</p>  <p>  I fully agree on the point about the use of idle buildings.  I am happy to engage with any local authorities or the Department of Rural and Community Development.</p>  <p>  Deputy Stanton might revert to me on the transport issue and we can speak about it separately, if that is okay.</p></speech>

Will the Minister outline his plans and those of his Department to deal with the persistent issue of child poverty in Ireland?  In particular, does he intend to establish a special Oireachtas committee on the subject or a cross-departmental child poverty unit?  At the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Innovation and Youth, we have been engaging in meetings on child poverty and I have engaged with the Ombudsman for Children, the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance and others.  I am conscious the ombudsman has published a report, A Better Normal, seeking to ensure we will have twin goals of eradicating child poverty and eliminating homelessness for children, which are crucial aims.</p></speech>

The Department of Social Protection leads on the Roadmap for Social Inclusion 2020&ndash;2025, which is aimed at reducing poverty and improving social inclusion.  Under the roadmap, a new child poverty target is being agreed.  Addressing child poverty was identified as a priority action under Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures and will remain a priority in the successor framework being developed by my Department.</p>  <p>  Significant advancements can be made through my Department&rsquo;s co-ordination of the EU child guarantee, an important initiative that aims to combat social exclusion by guaranteeing access for children who are in need of a range of key services.  I will publish our national action plan for the child guarantee by March next year.  The commitments under the guarantee go to the heart of the child poverty agenda, given they deal with free access to early childhood education and care, education, healthcare for children in need, healthy nutrition including a healthy meal each school day and adequate housing.</p>  <p>   Tackling child poverty and effectively implementing the child guarantee will require the commitment and active participation of my colleagues across government to ensure it is collaborative, integrated and, ultimately, impactful.  As part of the child guarantee process and in developing the successor national policy framework to Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, I will engage with my Cabinet colleagues to consider the most appropriate and effective structures to pursue the reforms necessary to improve outcomes for our most disadvantaged children.</p>  <p>  As for child poverty-focused structures, I have an open mind on the question of an Oireachtas committee or other form of co-ordination mechanism.  My Department recently established a new EU and international unit, which, among other responsibilities, will lead on the co-ordination across government of the necessary actions emerging from the EU child guarantee.  This will enable us to pursue a coherent agenda in regard to child poverty.</p></speech>

I welcomed also the announcement today by the Minister for Justice on the regularisation of undocumented scheme.  I have been working with the Migrant Rights Centre, the Immigrant Council, Labour Youth and other organisations for some time and have constructively engaged with the Minister, Deputy McEntee, on that.  I am conscious that will really help and support many children who currently live in very precarious positions and in poverty.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, consider a more targeted focus on tackling child poverty?  I am conscious that in Britain, there was a model in the early years of the New Labour Government whereby a child poverty unit was established in Whitehall to target funding and resources with those twin aims of eradicating child poverty and child homelessness.</p> <p>We know investment in early years and early childhood care and education is also crucial, and is, in fact, the key measure necessary to tackle child poverty.  We have heard that from the experts who have appeared before us in the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  We are very anxious to see a public and universal access childcare and early years education scheme being rolled out by the Government.  We will work with the Minister on that.  We have been pushing for an equal early years campaign on that.  We would welcome any further and urgent steps being taken in that regard.</p></speech>

There is always the decision of whether to go narrow and centralise the decision-making process or make it broad and ensure all parts of government are acting towards it.  That is that balancing element.  Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the policy framework that is ending now, has been really successful, but I have been clear that in a successor I want child poverty eradication to be central and to play an even greater role.  I want to ensure that that is reflected across all Departments.</p>  <p>  The EU child guarantee is going to be located within that, but while the guarantee is perhaps a response to the most acute levels of poverty, we have to understand that the levels of disadvantage are perhaps broader than those addressed by it.  That is where the successor national policy framework will be really beneficial.  We can continue to engage on the issue as we go forward.</p></speech>

The Minister will be aware of all of the issues that stem and flow from it, including the impact it has on children with scoliosis, spina bifida and other hip deformities and orthopaedic conditions.  We need to get to a space where the capacity is in the system.  The issues have come into sharp focus again over the past number of weeks because a number of children have had to go public and talk about their experiences.  It should not take that to put the pressure on the political system to provide the services people need.  What additional capacity will be provided in this area over the next number of weeks and months?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300012#K00700"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  It is such a critical issue and it has to be solved permanently.  We are all very aware that waiting times for hospital procedures and appointments are unacceptably long.   This applies to paediatric orthopaedics, as he rightly said.  It is of particular concern to me when it comes to procedures that are time-sensitive, such as scoliosis and others mentioned by the Deputy.  I remain acutely aware of the impact that delays are having on children and their families.  We remain committed to improving access to these critical services and to ensuring that orthopaedic procedures can be accessed, in good time, and that the complex patient needs remain at the forefront of all service provision.</p>  <p>  Since 2018, Children's Health Ireland, CHI, has been provided with an additional &euro;9 million in funding to address paediatric orthopaedic waiting lists.  One of my first official engagements as Minister was to meet with the orthopaedic team in Crumlin children's hospital and to see the great work that they do and the challenges that they face.  This visit highlighted to me the improvements that need to be made, as well as the impact that timely orthopaedic intervention has on a child and their family.</p>  <p>  The additional funding provided has supported the recruitment of a significant number of people.  Approximately 60 whole-time equivalents, WTEs, were recruited in 2018 and 2019.  Accessing capacity in order that children can undergo the procedures remains a key priority, especially for those children who require time-sensitive procedures. To this end, CHI has been working with the HSE to source additional capacity to reduce waiting times.  For example, as the Deputy is aware, Cappagh Kids at the National Orthopaedic Hospital at Cappagh provides additional theatre capacity for non-complex, age-appropriate orthopaedic procedures.  Not only do those children get seen, but it frees up freeing up much-needed space at central CHI sites for the more complex work.  I will come back with more in my response.</p></speech>

I met with the CEO of CHI and the full clinical team, and I heard, first-hand, the very exciting plans they have for the National Children's Hospital, which will be a game changer in increased surgical capacity, staff and beds.  It will also provide protected beds for scheduled care, which is most important.  The team also outlined some of what they need in the next number of years to deal with the here and now.  One of the asks that they had concerned the &euro;200 million access to care fund, most of which, as the Minister will be aware, is used to outsource to the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, and the private sector.  They are saying that is not a solution for them.  What they are looking for is &euro;8 million or &euro;9 million in revenue funding to recruit staff that they need to provide the additional services to staff the beds, which are also very important.  The surgeon there told me that the issue of the provision of recovery beds is a problem.  There are problems with the provision of ICU beds, but the lack of recovery beds is an impediment.  I ask the Minister to give a commitment that this &euro;8 million or &euro;9 million of revenue funding will be provided.</p></speech>

It is not revenue funding or the access to care fund.  They are for different purposes.  The revenue funding is to build up the permanent capacity in the system so we never see waiting lists like this again.  While we are doing that, the access to care fund is used to ensure that the people who are currently waiting are seen.  Cappagh Kids and the National Orthopaedic Hospital at Cappagh have submitted several applications under the access to care fund.  They are using it.  They received just over &euro;1.5 million this year and they have more proposals in.  They have submitted a proposal for around &euro;2.6 million for next year.  The access to care fund is not just for private care; in fact, the majority of it goes to the HSE.  Indeed, approximately two thirds of the NTPF money also gets spent in the HSE and one third in private provision.</p>  <p>  On the important question asked by the Deputy, all of the applications under revenue funding, including those submitted by the National Orthopaedic Hospital at Cappagh and Cappagh Kids, are being looked at very seriously.  Indeed, there is more than the &euro;9 million funding provided.  We have told the HSE that there is funding available for critical care, diagnostics and capital proposals.  What we need to do is to ensure that those proposals are assessed quickly and are acted on.  Other capital proposals have been submitted, for example by the Crumlin and Temple Street children's hospitals, that we are looking to push along.  I will share the details of them at another time.</p></speech>

I believe the Minister is to meet with the CEO and her team next week.  The point the CEO was making, and asked me to relay back to the Minister, is that this particular fund is not the solution for them.  It is not a sustainable solution.  Yes, they can use some of it, but the CEO told me that &euro;30 million to &euro;40 million of that can be used for revenue funding.  They would prefer it if they could get &euro;8 million or &euro;9 million of revenue funding.  Whether it comes from that fund or from somewhere else is immaterial.  They need to recruit the staff.  Given all of the concerns that we have had on this particular issue, I think it should be done and the commitment should be given.</p>  <p>  On the surgical theatre space, we heard again, earlier this week, from Mr. Connor Green, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Temple Street, that the cancellation of procedures causes real difficulty for families and children.  We need to avoid that as much as possible.  Surgical theatre capacity, staff, paediatric ICU beds are all part of the solution.</p></speech>

If Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman and the team are looking for money for short periods, which is what the access to care funding provides, there will be money left at the end of December.  The HSE has not been able to spend all the money.  That is not from want of desire to do so.  Given all of the various issues that the HSE has been dealing with this year, it has made incredible progress.  There is funding there.  In Temple Street, for example, part of the permanent solution is a the construction of a fifth operating theatre.  CHI has put in a proposal for that.  We are looking that that urgently as part of the capital plan for next year.  I am very positively disposed to it.  I have spoken directly with the CEO about it.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware and as we have discussed previously, there are different requirements in different hospitals and children's hospitals.</p> <p>Crumlin hospital needs an MRI machine.  There are various issues.  All of this is being looked at within the capital plan for next year.  We allocated more money than the HSE drew down this year so the issue is not funding.  The issue is making sure that these critically important projects are processed and put in place as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I am sure the Minister has also read it.  It stated that there would be a shortfall of between 10% and 14% in the number of cancer diagnoses for 2020.  As somebody who had cancer during the first wave of the Covid pandemic, I am deeply worried that there is a significant problem with people not getting a diagnosis and treatment and, as a result, having more advanced cancers when they approach the health service in the future.  What is the Minister doing to address this crisis?</p></reply>

The Department and the national cancer control programme are systematically studying the impact of Covid-19 on cancer services through data monitoring and monthly review meetings.  I am sure I would be able to get the Deputy a detailed note on that if he wishes.  During the first wave, from March to May 2020, in line with international experience and as the Deputy has quite rightly pointed out, there was a significant drop in the number of people presenting with cancer concerns.  From the outset of the pandemic, great focus has been placed by the cancer services on providing safe patient pathways and encouraging people to come forward.  That is very important.  The HSE deserves great credit for maintaining urgent cancer services throughout the pandemic.</p>  <p>  By the time of the second and subsequent waves, the degree of resilience built up in the cancer services through staff commitment, revised treatment guidelines, social distancing and infection prevention and control measures instilled confidence in people that they could come forward and access diagnostics and treatment.  Services were much less impacted, which is very good news.  </p>  <p>  As indicated, we are continuing to closely monitor trends in the number of people coming forward to the diagnostic services and the level of attendance for appointments for treatment.  The most recent figures are as follow.  The total number of GP e-referrals to rapid access clinics for January to October of this year stands at 127% of the number for the corresponding period in 2019.  I have been discussing this with the NCCP.  The figure is higher for this year than for last year.  I hope that some of that relates to people we would have loved to come forward last year.  The total number of patients seen across all rapid access clinics for January to September 2021 stands at 99% of the number for the corresponding period in 2019.  I am out of time but I will give the Deputy the rest of the figures as we go.</p></speech>

It is one of the biggest threats to human life in this State.  Timely diagnosis can and will make all the difference for many people.  The Irish Cancer Society says that it is worried that many people have cancer and do not know it.  This will impact on their outcomes.  The Marie Keating Foundation anticipates a tsunami of cancer diagnoses.  Perhaps the figures the Minister has just given show that those delayed cancer diagnoses are starting to come into the system.  Research that we in Aont&uacute; recently carried out showed that there is a significant drop in the number of patients who are starting anti-cancer therapy treatments.  In 2019, 8,252 patients started chemotherapy, hormonal treatments or immunotherapy.  In 2020, this figure had decreased to 7,683.  So far in 2021, it is down to 5,703.  The numbers attending BreastCheck, BowelScreen, CervicalCheck, skin cancer clinics, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are all down.  We need extra capacity to be put in to deal with this right now.</p></speech>

In terms of treatment, the numbers are as follows.  The number of patients receiving chemotherapy this year is 95% of the number for 2019.  The number of patients receiving radiation oncology in the period from January to August is 85% of the equivalent number for 2019.  The equivalent figure for surgical oncology for January to August is 80% of the 2019 figure.  Critically, these figures do not include the private hospital activity being used by the public system, so the overall figures are higher.  I could not agree with the Deputy more with regard to the need to invest very seriously and very significantly.  As the Deputy will be aware, &euro;12 million was made available to restart cancer services to deal with Covid-19.  This funding is being used to address backlogs, extend clinic times, provide additional clinics and increase diagnostic capacity.  Last year, I allocated &euro;20 million for the national cancer strategy.  I am allocating another &euro;20 million for next year.</p></speech>

Nobody expects it to be able to deal with the issue 100%.  We talk about capacity <i>ad nauseum</i>in this Chamber but there is a difference of 260 between the number of ICU beds there should be and the number there are.  There are 112 to 117 people in ICU beds with Covid at the moment.  The lack of capacity is a bigger threat to ICU capacity than those patients.  There is a difference of 8,000 between the number of beds there should be in the hospital sector and the number there are.  That is 16 times the number of people with Covid in hospital beds.  The lack of capacity arising from Government's lack of investment in hospital beds is 16 times worse a threat to hospital bed capacity than Covid is.  We need to set out a significant plan of major investment in capacity.  There are 1 million people on hospital waiting lists.  Even outside of Covid, there is a necessity to build capacity.  It is hard to believe that the Government is looking to close down ICU beds and accident and emergency department beds in hospitals such as my own in Navan at such a time of need.  I ask the Government to say here today that there will be a radical step change in how it invests in hospital capacity to deal with Covid and other health issues.</p></speech>

That step change is already under way.  In the last year, there was a record increase in the number of hospital beds.  Very shortly, we will have added approximately 1,000 hospital beds.  To the Deputy's point, there are more than 500 Covid patients in hospital at the moment.  We have added twice that number of beds in the last year.  We are in the middle of the biggest increase in critical care capacity on record.  This year and last year were the top two years with regard to increasing the workforce and the number of clinicians since the HSE was established.  There is another question on critical care coming up very shortly and we can get into the detail at that time.  I absolutely agree with what the Deputy is demanding.  I am demanding exactly the same thing.  We need an unprecedented and historic increase in capacity and we are in the middle of one.  We need the same kind of targeted investment in cancer services.  That is why the national cancer strategy was fully funded for the first time this year.  It will get full funding again next year.  Approximately one third of the &euro;50 million for new drugs this year will be spent on cancer drugs.  There is an awful lot of catching up to be done but we are moving and investing as quickly as capacity can be added.</p></speech>

I looked into this and was advised that the HSE does not collect that specific information centrally.  When I was preparing for this session, I noted that the Deputy's direct question had not been answered so I asked the Department to see if that information could be collected.  The HSE collects data on cancellations locally but not centrally.  Arguably, that is something that should be done.  Capacity is obviously one of the big issues.  There is an acknowledged deficit in critical care capacity in the country.  We came into this pandemic with 255 beds.  The capacity review says that we should have in excess of 400 beds.  The target for the end of next year or early in the following year is 340 beds.  This would represent a 33% increase in our permanent standing critical care stock since the start of the pandemic last year.  That is a very significant increase.</p> <p> One of the big constraints is critical care staff so highly specialised nurses and doctors are required.  There is a lot of investment, building and recruitment to build up critical care capacity and, indeed, the entire patient flow so that we do not have these cancellations, which obviously are absolutely awful for the patients and their families.  Indeed, it is awful for the healthcare workforce who are trying to provide these patients with the best possible care.</p> <p> In terms of the private capacity, we have used about 65,000 private hospital bed days this year so far and that is about 20,500 patients.  In critical care units, surge plans remain in place and are being activated, as needed.  The latest information that I have from the HSE is that we have surge capacity, if needed through the winter, for about 380 critical care beds.  Obviously that is not a surge capacity that we hope to activate.</p></speech>

It now happens routinely.  Covid has exacerbated the problem but it happened long before it for which there are a number of reasons.  Obviously there is the lack of capacity, as the Minister mentioned, in terms of ICU.  There is a lack of recovery beds so surgeries cannot be scheduled.  There is a lack of specialist staff, as the Minister mentioned.  Finally, there is a lack of stepdown beds in the community.</p>  <p>  I wish to raise an issue with the Minister that was raised with me in Letterkenny recently when I met representatives of the Lifford Hospital Campaign Group.  It is a community hospital that provided long-stay beds.  HIQA advised that the hospital be closed temporarily and it is still closed.  My understanding is that the HSE may have funding to provide for short-stay beds, which would a great use of the hospital.  I do not presume that the Minister has the information to hand and ask him to provide me with a detailed note on exactly how much funding will be provided to the community hospital and give a timeframe for delivery.  It is crucial that we get all of these elements right.  There are many reasons treatments and care are cancelled.  Some of it is because of capacity and late discharges in hospitals, and the reason for that is that there are not enough stepdown beds.</p></speech>

It is not about simply providing more home care, outpatients, operating theatres or diagnostics.  We have got to look at the entire patient pathway.  Can they get to the GP quick enough?  Can the GP refer to a consultant or, better still, is there an intermediary, like an advance nurse practitioner scheme that we have seen treat and discharge between 70% and 80% of patients who, in many cases, would have had to wait to see a consultant?  Do the consultants have the outpatient facilities that they need?  Do the consultants and GPs have access to the diagnostics that they need?</p>  <p>  When someone is scheduled for a procedure we must ask the following.  Can we get the operating theatre space?  Can we get the day space?  Can we get the diagnostics on the day?  Can we get the recovery bed?  Is the critical care capacity there, if needed?  Are the ward beds there?  Is there an option to discharge?  Are there stepdown or rehabilitation beds?  Can home care packages be put in place?  We have found that in different parts of the country it is different things.  We have a very comprehensive level of investment right across all of that to make sure that more and more patients get seen.</p></speech>

I have met 17 hospital managers and all of their clinical teams.  I have met the CEOs of hospital groups.  I have also met people who work in primary and community care settings.  While some good work has been done through the enhanced community care programme there is still an awful lot more to be done so that we can have admission avoidance in acute hospitals, which is one of the things that we need to do to reduce the cancellation of surgeries and hospital appointments because that is not sustainable.  I will draft a report on all of my visits.  I will do a synopsis of what I have been told and what I have learned from GPs.  There is an issue in terms of GP access.  We know that we need more GPs.  There are problems in terms out-of-hours GP access for patients.  For far too many people, such as people who suffer chronic pain, respiratory illnesses or other illnesses, care management in the community is not happening quickly enough.  The infrastructure does not exist so the integrated care piece is critically important.  If we get that right then we can reduce wait times and increase hospital avoidance, which is important.</p></speech>

There is no better insight that I get, no more than the Deputy, than meeting clinicians, healthcare providers, social care providers, patients and their families and seeing what is going on.  An awful lot is working and people have done incredible work but, as the Deputy has quite rightly said, more is needed.</p>  <p>  While we have seen record recruitment into the HSE this year and lasts year, and record acute beds, the community care side of things has proven more challenging.  While we are broadly on target for adding acute beds that is not the case for community beds or community recruitment.  We have very ambitious targets.</p></speech>

This policy supports the reconfiguration of children's disability services to provide equitable child and family-centred services based on need rather than diagnosis.  The PDS programme will ensure that services are provided for children with complex needs regardless of where they live or go to school.  </p>  <p>  In line with the PDS model, resources assigned for children's disability services are allocated to the birth to 18 years disability network teams rather than a dedicated early intervention team or dedicated school age team.  No longer will a child age out of the services.  Before, when one reached the age of six, one was transferred to different services.  With this new PDS model, services will be allocated from birth to age 18 years, which I am sure everybody will welcome.  There are now 88 network teams in place and the remaining three will be in place by the end of the year.  This constitutes the most significant re-organisation of health and social care services ever undertaken in the State.</p>  <p>  The reconfiguration of network teams has been challenging, particularly in regard to staffing issues.  Currently, there are a number of vacancies on children's disability network teams in each community healthcare organisation, CHO.  Recruitment is being progressed, as a matter of urgency, by HSE national recruitment services, and directly in the case of section 39 lead agencies, in order to support network teams to optimise service delivery.  There are recruitment challenges due to the significant availability of new posts across the wider HSE in areas such as primary care and services for older people. </p></speech>

I have also had it confirmed for me that out of the three funded occupational therapist positions in Cork north Lee 1.5 persons have been on maternity leave since June 2020 and 0.5 of a person has yet to be recruited.  This means that for the past 18 months one occupational therapist has had to deal with over 850 children.</p>  <p>  Even if we did have three occupational therapists they would not be able to deal with the more than 200 children who have waited over two years and the other 650 children.  It is scandal that there is only one occupational therapist to look after 853 children.  I wish to emphasise to the Minister of State that parents are at their wits' end because they cannot get services for their children.  What can she tell me to tell those parents?</p></speech>

Nationally, 6,558 assessments of need were overdue in June 2020 under the old process.  At the end of October 2021, through a combination of different measures, approximately 6,100 children had their assessments completed, reducing the backlog to 460 cases.  That is a reduction of 93%, and by anyone's metric that is some reduction in the number of children who require and deserve their assessments of need to be done in a timely manner.  This has led to children being put on further waiting lists, and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte is working hard to get those therapies in place.</p></speech>

They are getting their assessments of need done, but then there are no services.  I am dealing with families who have had no services for their children for years.  We are talking about the children's disability network teams.  I am dealing with a mother who is doing a 12-week course to educate herself to enable her to provide occupational therapy to her son.  The course is a good idea for that parent, but not as a replacement for the service.  That is what this Government is standing over now - trying to educate a parent in six weeks to do something it takes years for a professional in college to learn and develop the required skills.  It is not good enough.  These vulnerable children are being failed by the Government and State.  I need answers for parents now.  Telling me about waiting lists being cleared so that children will have no services is not good enough.  The way children with disabilities are being treated is a scandal.</p></speech>

Since 2019, some 285 new posts have been allocated to children's disability services across the country.  The diversity of posts recruited include dieticians, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, psychologists, speech and language therapists, nurses and some administrative support staff.  These posts have been assigned based on several factors, including the existing ratio of staff to the number of children with disabilities in each area.</p>  <p>  To return to the children's disability network teams, they will provide a continuum of care for children with special needs from birth to 18 years, reducing the need for onward referral and allowing different professionals to work as one team.  This will be a fairer system, but it will have to bed down.  It will cover all parts of the country so we will no longer have areas with good services and other pockets where there were effectively none.</p></speech>

He cannot be here because of Covid-19 restrictions.  I am taking the question on his behalf.</p><p>Under the national drugs strategy, the Government established a working group to consider alternative approaches to the possession of drugs for personal use in December 2017.  The working group examined the option of decriminalising drugs and did not deem this an appropriate option in the Irish context due to legal difficulties, which could lead to the <i>de facto</i>legalisation of drugs and operational problems for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Government published this report in 2019.  We cannot be complacent about the risk to health posed by illicit drugs.  The Government is committed to a public health approach to drug use that will lead to better outcomes for individuals and society.  There are no plans therefore to decriminalise or legalise drugs.</p><p>In line with the working group&rsquo;s recommendations, the Government agreed a health-led approach to the possession of drugs for personal use, namely, the health diversion programme.  This approach will offer compassion and not punishment to people who use drugs.  It will connect people who use drugs with health services and a pathway to recovery, thereby avoiding a criminal conviction, which can have far-reaching consequences for people, particularly younger people.  The implementation of the health diversion programme is being finalised in conjunction with the Department of Justice, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE.</p><p>One of the strategic priorities of the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, for the remaining four years of the national drugs strategy is to promote alternatives to coercive sanctions for drug-related offences.  As well as the roll-out of the health diversion programme, other initiatives to be supported include the drug treatment court and the drug treatment services of the Probation Service.  A particular emphasis will be placed on the exchange of best practice on alternatives to coercive sanctions in EU member states, under the EU drugs strategy and action plan.</p></speech>

The use of language in this debate is extremely important.  I referred to the decriminalisation of the "drug user", while the response from the Minister of State refers to the "decriminalisation of drugs" and continues with a reference to the legalisation of drugs.  Decriminalisation and legalisation are completely different issues, as are decriminalisation of the drug user and decriminalisation of drugs.</p>  <p>  I am talking about the person, and the decriminalisation of the person.  If the Minister of State had come in here at the beginning of the pandemic and said that the solution to Covid-19 was to arrest everyone who gets it, everybody would have thought she was out of her mind.  People at the start of the pandemic would have regarded people working on the front line or living in poor conditions, for example, as victims of this virus, not as people who should be penalised by the State.  It would be a ridiculous response from the State to arrest people because they have Covid-19, but that is exactly what the State does in respect of people with addiction issues.  We arrest them for possession of something they are addicted to.  It does not work.  We have the fourth highest overdose rate in Europe.</p>  <p>  People are dying and the response-----</p></speech>

The health diversion programme will connect participants with health services and it will provide a pathway to treatment and recovery where there is problematic drug use.  It will also allow participants to avoid a criminal conviction.  An interdepartmental group, chaired by representatives of the Department of Health, is considering legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General and the formal views of the Garda Commissioner.  The group, as the Deputy may know, is chaired by the former Minister of State and Deputy, Kathleen Lynch, who is doing an excellent job.  I have been working closely with her in that regard, as has the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan.  Certain legal procedures and logistical issues must be clarified before this roll-out can commence.  However, we are not burying our heads in the sand on this issue.  We are acutely conscious of the linkages between mental health, dual diagnosis, addiction and court proceedings, and much work has been done in this regard.</p></speech>

The Minister of State's proposal is that people will get a criminal sanction if they are caught a third time.  What is the difference?  If someone is acutely and profoundly addicted to something, surely the hundredth time that he or she has an intervention because of that addiction should have the same response as the third time.  What is utterly heartbreaking about this is that the people affected are powerless.  If they had more power and more value in society, we would not be treating them like this and they would not be ending up in graveyards at the rate they are.  It is because they are disproportionately poor that they are treated by the State in this fashion.</p>  <p>  I suggest to the Minister of State that the proposal for a citizens' assembly on drugs be fast-tracked, she put to one side her current proposal on how to deal with people in addiction and look instead to the Portuguese model, which is much more humane and has successfully reduced the number of people in addiction programmes by 50%.  Crucially, it has also reduced the number of people dying from overdoses by 75%.</p></speech>

The report of the working group on alternative approaches to the possession of drugs for personal use published in 2019 noted difficulties with decriminalisation in the Irish legal context.  In Portugal, personal possession of drugs carries an administrative sanction.  The concept of administrative sanctions for a criminal offence is not compatible with the Irish legal system.  Therefore, in Ireland, drug use will remain a criminal offence but people will be diverted from the criminal justice system to avoid criminal conviction.</p></speech>

Many people look at this and wonder if it is consistent.  With the EU Covid-19 certificate we have a recognised recovery period of six months and as the Deputy has said, we have recent advice from HIQA that has been endorsed by National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, that the presumptive period is nine months.  It is a reasonable question as to why we do not adjust the Covid-19 certificate accordingly.</p>  <p>  The EU digital Covid-19 certificate regulation creates a framework for the issuing, authentication and validity of certificates to facilitate the safe and free movement across the EU during the pandemic.  Certificates are proof a person has been vaccinated against Covid-19, received a negative test result or recovered from Covid-19.  This initiative has been adopted by countries around the world, confirming its status as a robust international standard for Covid-19 certification.  To date, 24 third countries have joined the initiative and a further 32 are in the process of joining.  This really demonstrates how Europe can set global standards through decisive and co-ordinated action.</p>  <p>  The Irish Government has successfully delivered the EU digital Covid-19 certificate to the Irish public, and to date more than 4.5 million certificates have issued nationally, with more than 25,000 also issuing to the Irish diaspora, which is very welcome.  Across the EU, in excess 600 million certificates have been issued.</p>  <p>  The wide implementation of this tool for accessing indoor hospitality and services has supported the reopening of our economy and society nationally.  The scope and parameters for issuing the certificates has been agreed at EU level and is standardised to allow for complete interoperability.  That gets to the core of the Deputy's question.  Currently, the agreed maximum validity date for recovery certificates is 180 days after the date of a positive PCR test result, as set out in the EU regulation.</p></speech>

It is whether the Minister plans to extend the period.  I had to ask this way because I failed to get an answer up to now.  I know the Minister is extremely busy but this is a very specific matter.  We have seen HIQA's report and a letter to the Minister from Dr. Tony Holohan in November, and I believe there was one before that.  He sets out in a paragraph that based on the advice provided from HIQA, which I have already read, the NPHET further accepted HIQA's advice and so on.  The letter set out that NPHET endorsed the recommendation that the period of presumptive protective immunity following infection with Covid-19 should remain at nine months post infection at this time.  Will the Minister just deal with that?  I have been obliged to bring this question.  I know somebody who had Covid-19, as we all may have, and the period in question is six months.  NPHET has endorsed the HIQA recommendation of a nine-month period.  What is the Minister telling me?</p></speech>

HIQA has made its recommendations and they have been endorsed by NPHET but the EU regulation sets the six-month period.  I am advised the EU is not actively considering reviewing that six-month period at this time.</p></speech>

That is my own fault, I suppose, if the regulation is there.  If he has it to hand, he might just quote the regulation and indicate when it was introduced and effected?  Who has the Minister been advised by that the regulation will stand and not be changed?  Who is making that advice?  All the time we have endorsed NPHET and HIQA and, by and large, we go by their reports.  Why are we ignoring the advice on this occasion?  What evidence is there that has led the EU to indicate a six-month period?  Could the Minister point me to the scientific evidence on this?</p>  <p>  I have tabled a question so I expected an answer, if not from the Minister, then at least through him from the Department, which has all the expertise at its fingertips.  Now we will ignore NPHET and HIQA when it suits us.  We will talk about a regulation I do not know about.  There is no scientific evidence whatever in the reply.  This goes to the basis and the heart of trust so that when I go into the community I can advocate such trust in the system.</p></speech>

In addition to the existing primary care centre in Westbury, the site at Station Road, Ennis, is under construction and is expected to be operational by mid-summer 2022.  The HSE is also continuing to work with a developer on another centre in Ennis on the Tulla Road and is awaiting the outcome of a planning matter currently with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  A further project in Ennistymon is progressing, with HSE's estates division working directly with the promoter of the top-ranked proposal following a review of priced offers.</p>  <p>  The HSE is also engaged in a review of the current facilities and the overall accommodation requirements for the Kilrush area, while expressions of interest have been received for the site at Sixmilebridge.  In addition, the people of Killaloe will be served by a primary care centre currently in development at Ballina, Killaloe and Newport.  I understand some of these projects have been delayed due to planning issues or other factors and that is undoubtedly frustrating for the local population and their elected representatives, but the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the continued development of primary care services in Clare should be in no doubt.  These facilities are an essential part of the investment in enhancing capacity in the primary and community sector to deliver high-quality integrated care to people in their own communities.</p></speech>

The previous Fine Gael-led Government laid the foundations for these primary health care centres in County Clare and I thank the Minister and the HSE for continuing that work.  The Ennis site on Station Road is a really striking building and is a state-of-the-art facility.  I have been in touch with the Minister, his officials and the HSE throughout its development.  When is it expected that the doors will open in this facility?  Will the Minister give some more detail on the Tulla Road site?  I know the project is currently with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and that has been the position for quite a long number of months.  Has the Minister any update on that?</p></speech>

Station Road in Ennis is under construction and planning permission has been sought to increase the floor area of the building to provide for additional services.  A decision is awaited from An Bord Plean&aacute;la on this additional application.  Subject to the decision, which we all hope will be in the affirmative while we obviously full respect the independence of the process, the timeframe for completion of the additional floor space can then be established.  In other words, we will not know until we get a ruling from An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p> <p>It is anticipated that the primary care centre will be operational from mid-summer next year.  The Tulla Road project in Ennis is delayed due to an ongoing planning matter.  It is with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The HSE continues to seek progress updates from the developer on this.</p></speech>

It has met with some hitches and has been re-advertised.  Can the Minister give a detailed explanation of the next steps and when we can expect movement on that site?

In Sixmilebridge, an issue with the sale of the land at Ashview Drive halted the development.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.226" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="11:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300017#P01100"><p>In 2015, Government decided to draft a general scheme of a Bill to amend the Mental Health Act 2001 in line with the 165 recommendations of the 2015 expert group review report.</p>  <p>  Among the expert group recommendations were proposals on revised criteria for detention, updated definitions of mental disorder and voluntary and involuntary patients, the introduction of guiding principles, statutory individual care plans, a greater role for authorised officers in involuntary admissions, improved safeguards for service users, shorter intervals for tribunals, a presumption of capacity for young people aged 16 and 17 years to consent or refuse treatment unless proven otherwise, and the introduction of guiding principles for the care of children under the Act.  I thank the Deputy for his question because when I came to the post I was concerned to learn that the general scheme was drafted in 2015 and we had not made a lot of progress.  The original Act was introduced in 2001 by the Taoiseach, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, who was then Minister for Health and Children.  A lot of progress has been made in the last 18 months.</p>  <p>  The Department shared the initial draft heads of Bill with the Mental Health Commission, the HSE, the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland and the Departments of Justice and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth for their consideration and input.  Earlier this year, I launched a public consultation on the legislation which ran over March and April because I was conscious that the expert panel review had reported in 2015 and I felt we needed an update.  Therefore, an independent legal review of the Bill was also completed. </p>  <p>  The general scheme of a Bill to amend the 2001 Act was approved by the Government on 13 July and was published on the Department&rsquo;s website on 23 July 2021.  Pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme commenced on 2 November. </p></speech>

Since 2001, there has been a sea change around the understanding, treatment and acceptance of mental health issues.  We still have a long way to go but let us hope that the legislation reflects that sea change, the change in treatments and the fact that people have greater power and capacity.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned those aged 16 and 17 years.  During the week at the subcommittee on mental health, Mental Health Reform highlighted a particular lacuna between the heads of the Bill and the assisted decision-making capacity Bill.  The heads of the Bill say that the assisted decision-making capacity Bill would apply for the purposes of conducting capacity assessments, but there is no decision on supports for those aged under the age of 18.  Has that been highlighted to the Minister of State?  Why are we still talking about leaving an opening to admit those under 18 years into adult units?  I am very wary of that.  Hopefully we can move away from it.</p></speech>

I expect to introduce the legislation to the Oireachtas as early as possible in 2022.  Updating the Mental Health Act is a priority for the Government and for me.  I am glad that the Deputy mentioned detention for those under 18 years.  I understand that 27 people under the age of 18 have been admitted to an adult psychiatric unit this year.  I have recently visited all the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, units in Ireland.  Some 95% of those who were admitted to an adult unit were aged 17 years or over.  It is very difficult when, for example, a young girl of 11, 12 or 13 years with an eating disorder is on the same unit as a male of 17 and a half - a man - who may be psychotic.  It is in the best interests of the patient to take the best advice at that time, which may be to put him or her into an adult unit.</p></speech>

Will the money go with the Bill?   I know the Minister of State secured huge investment in mental health through the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, in last year's budget.  Have those positions been put in place?  It is my concern that we will create an expectation around this legislation as a Bill that is relevant to the 21st century in the way we treat mental health, but that the resources will not be behind it and, more importantly, there will be no way of finding out if the resources are actually going into the system and making a difference to services on the ground.</p></speech>

I will give another example.  A young adult, under 18 years, was admitted to a psychiatric unit in Donegal one night because it was not possible to transfer him to the CAMHS unit in Merlin Park in Galway.  Sometimes a decision like that has to be taken.  A person might only be admitted to an adult unit for six or seven hours overnight until he or she can be transferred, but it still goes down in the figures.  In some instances, a person can have multiple admissions to a unit.  However, one person is one person too many.  The national implementation and monitoring committee is examining the issue.  Jigsaw, for example, looks after young people between the ages of 12 and 25.  There is a mood change that we might have to expand the CAMHS age group from 18 years of age up to 21 or 23 years of age.</p>  <p>  The Deputy made a specific point about the funding.  It will be vital to implement the Bill next year.  We will have short-term, medium-term and long-term goals but a lot of revenue will be required.</p></speech>

Our front-line staff are exhausted from 20 months of dealing with Covid yet continue to deliver a high standard of care to all.  I wish to thank them and acknowledge the distress that overcrowded emergency departments cause to patients, their families and the incredible front-line staff who have to work in those difficult conditions.  </p> <p>UHL of course has one of the busiest emergency departments in the country and more than 63,000 individuals have attended so far this year.  Increased attendances and Covid-19-related patient safety protocols are contributing to slower progress of patients through the system, and this impacts on waiting times and patient experience in the emergency department.  However, despite an increase in attendances of 7% up to October of this year compared with the same period in 2019, the number of patients on trolleys is 35% lower.  That is despite an increase in patients and all the additional pressures of Covid-19.  Huge thanks and acknowledgement goes to our frontline healthcare workers right across the system, including those in acute, primary and community care, for putting in so much effort to make that possible.</p> <p> I published the HSE winter plan on 15 November.  The Government already allocated an additional &euro;1.1 billion in additional funding to support health services and this is being maintained into next year.  The winter plan is designed around a whole-system approach involving acute hospitals and the community and primary care sectors.  It has three key objectives: emergency department avoidance; patient flow; and hospital egress.  It is aligned with the Sl&aacute;intecare principle of "Right Care, Right Place, Right Time".  Specific measures for UHL include an extension of the National Ambulance Service pathfinder initiative and paediatric patient flow initiatives to ensure timely discharges.</p></speech>

I join him in complimenting our frontline staff at UHL.  They are under extreme pressure.  We are unfortunately a permanent fixture at the top of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation's Trolley Watch figures.  Today there are 47 people on trolleys in the accident and emergency department of UHL.  It is a frightening figure.  The next highest figure is in Cork University Hospital where there are 26 people on trolleys.  I recognise the work, including the addition of 98 more beds to the system over the last year, since the advent of Covid, to help us fight it.  There is also a critical project planned there.  It is a 96-bed permanent ward block.  It is important this project is fast-tracked.  We only have 533 inpatient acute beds in the mid-west region.  It is important this project is brought online as quickly as possible.  I ask the Minister to take a personal interest in this to drive it on because we just do not have enough bed capacity to deal with the admissions to the hospital.</p></speech>

As he rightly acknowledges, very substantial additional capacity has been added in UHL but as he also rightly says, still more is required.  We are still looking at patients waiting on trolleys at a level we must move away from.  In 2017 a new &euro;24 million emergency department opened.  Since the start of last year, 132 additional beds have been provided, which is a very significant number.  As the Deputy referenced, 98 of those beds are in recent developments.  On top of that, there is full planning permission for the 96-bed development and the project is currently out to tender.  UHL is also accessing private hospital capacity as well.</p></speech>

It is a really important project.  However, with respect to the short and medium term, will the Minister explain what efforts are being made to deal with this in the coming weeks to avoid the really chaotic scenes we have seen in recent times, when there were 98 people on trolleys at UHL?  What measures are going to be introduced to ensure that situation is not replicated in the coming weeks and months?</p></speech>

Many of the issues facing UHL are also being faced by University Hospital Kerry, UHK.  Almost a month ago we had senior HSE officials coming down to visit the hospital and meet stakeholders, yet there is still no plan.  There is a dearth of feedback from the HSE about what is happening or what is going to be done to address the massive problems we have at UHK.  Will the Minister please update the House on what is happening and what has resulted from those meetings?  A month ago I signalled my concerns in the House that this would be yet another visit and yet another box-ticking exercise.

The Deputy is asking a completely different question.  It is a very valid one about UHK and I would like to answer but it is not supplemental to this question.  I can send him a detailed note.  He and I have obviously discussed this.  The Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, and I are in regular communication on this.  As the Deputy will be aware, the national director of acute operations has been in UHK and there is a very comprehensive review going on.  For example, a figure I think I shared with the Deputy recently was there has been a 33% increase in the consultants added to UHK.  At the same time as we have had a one third increase in our doctors, fewer patients are being seen.  We need to understand what is going on there, whereby we can substantially increase our medical workforce-----</p></speech>

It is an essential one on an essential piece of infrastructure for Cork and indeed the entire region.  The provision of additional elective care delivery capability in Cork, Galway and Dublin is, as the Deputy will be aware, stated Government policy.  The purpose of elective care centres is to initially provide high volume, low- to medium-complexity procedures and a range of related diagnostic services as well.  There will also be outpatient facilities.  The range of specialties in the initial scope of the elective care centres-----</p></speech>

Incremental refinements to the current public hospital network will not, I think we can all agree, be sufficient to meet this demand by themselves.  The electives proposal has guided the work of the elective hospitals oversight group, under the governance of the HSE and the Department of Health.  The development of three elective care centres will require significant infrastructural investment and therefore the oversight group is following the process outlined in the updated public spending code.  This sets out value for money requirements for the evaluation, planning and management of large public investment projects, that is, those costing in excess of &euro;100 million.  I think we can all agree these will be investments exceeding &euro;100 million.</p>  <p>  A preliminary business case for the new elective facilities, including in Cork, is currently being reviewed within the Department of Health.  If it is technically compliant and approved by the Department of Expenditure and Reform, the preliminary business case, PBC, will then be further developed by that Department.  If approved, it is envisaged a memorandum for Government will be brought by me, seeking approval to proceed to the next stage.</p></speech>

This is December and it still has not been approved.  This is urgent.  A site should be specifically set out in the PBC.  Why is there a delay in announcing it?  It should say where the potential site is.  Where is the information for people?  I ask that this hospital be based on the north side of Cork.  The people of the north side have no hospital.  Fianna F&aacute;il closed down the North Infirmary.  Fine Gael closed down St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital.  I am asking for a full elective inpatient surgery hospital open 24-7 and not the part-time hospital that is being suggested.  There are 75,000 people on waiting lists in Cork city and county.</p> <p>We were promised this hospital before the general election, before the by-election, in 2018 and in 2017.  We are being promised and promised.  I am asking the Minister a straight question.  When will there be an announcement regarding this hospital?  Will it be located on the northside of Cork city? </p></speech>

To answer his exact question on when we will be able to announce where the hospital will be built, with details on its configuration, the number of operating theatres, the number of patients we hope to see, the timelines and so forth, I would like nothing more than to come to the Chamber and, indeed, meet representatives from the region, to give that information.  However, following the national children's hospital situation, a review of large capital investment was done.  It was agreed that there would be a multi-stage approach to this project to ensure value for money and to ensure it was done right.  The downside is that it takes time.  While I acknowledge the Deputy's frustration, and we are all frustrated by this, a set process has to be gone through to evaluate and approve the business case.  We are moving through that as quickly as it can be done.</p></speech>

We have people on trolleys and waiting lists.  This is not just about Cork wanting or needing a hospital.  Hospital services are at crisis point in Cork.  This hospital has to happen.  It was proposed that it would be operational by 2024.  There is no way I can see that happening.  I am asking the Minister a direct question.  Does he believe that this hospital will be operational by 2024?  This is a commitment given by his Government, his party and Fine Gael, who all made a promise to the people of Cork.  This is not about making election promises.  This has been specifically identified under health needs as a requirement for the Cork area.  This hospital is needed and the Minister knows it is needed, as do the HSE and the people of Cork.  When will it be delivered?  Will it be delivered on the northside?  Will there be beds to go with it?  We are talking about delivering elective hospitals, but we need a 24-7, seven days a week hospital, with the beds to support it.</p></speech>

Its members should have a discussion on exactly what these elective-only hospitals should or should not be.  I have an open mind on it, but my understanding is that elective-only hospitals will be for the regions and for addressing waiting lists for elective procedures.  I support its location on the northside of Cork, as it makes sense.  I spoke to Deputy Gould on this issue and we understand that these hospitals will be for people throughout the regions.  I hope that these hospitals, in whatever form they come, will address the critical mass of elective care that needs to be done, will take it out of acute hospitals, if possible, and allow more complicated work to take place in the acute hospitals, which will continue.  The debate about what elective hospitals are is an important one.  We need to bring as many people with us as possible, which is done through consultation with those in the constituencies who might be affected and engagement with Members.  Engagement with the Oireachtas health committee on this particular issue would also be helpful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.270" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="11:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300019#R00800"><p>I wholeheartedly agree with Deputy Cullinane.  There needs to be engagement with the health committee and elected representatives from the regions.  To answer his question, these will be regional elective hospitals that will not just serve Cork city, County Cork or Galway city.  They will be incredibly useful.  I suggest to both Deputies that elected representatives from the regions and members of the health committee consider arranging a trip to one of these hospitals, which I would be very happy to facilitate.  We have one such hospital, the Reeves Day Surgery Centre in Tallaght University Hospital, which has four operating theatres.  It is modest by comparison with what we are looking at building in Cork, but it is going incredibly well.  The Reeves centre has no inpatient facility.  I am very aware that there are strong views in some parts of the clinical communities in Cork and Galway that there should be inpatient beds as part of this.  That is actively under consideration and consultation.</p>  <p>  I have very strong advice from the expert group that these hospitals should be day case only.  It might be worthwhile if Professor Frank Keane comes in to talk to the health committee about that.  All I ask of the Deputies is to keep an open mind until they have an opportunity to engage with the experts on the rationale for it.  It is quite a compelling argument but no decisions have been made on that.  I strongly recommend a trip to the Reeves centre to talk to the surgeons there about how useful they are finding it for medium and lower complexity work.  Their lists are scheduled, they know they are coming in at 7 a.m. or 8 a.m. on a Monday and nothing stops that.  The volume is going very well.  In fact, more and more hospitals throughout Dublin are expressing interest in using it.  I would be very happy to facilitate a trip to the Reeves centre in addition to broader consultation.  Both Deputies are exactly correct.  There has to be engagement with those in the Dublin, Galway and Cork regions so that this is received well and understood as the best possible response and solution. </p></speech>

All of us in this House understand the difficulties that exist regarding families who are looking for home care packages that will ensure their family members can stay at home as opposed to needing to go into long-term nursing care.  We need to deliver that, while accepting there are difficulties because of pay scales and other issues.  The Minister of State's task force has met a couple of times and is considering incentivising people who work in this sector and ensuring that we get more people into it.  I would appreciate it if she will go into a little detail on that.</p></reply>

Recruitment for 130 posts to support the national roll-out of international resident assessment instrument, interRAI, as a standard assessment tool for care needs is scheduled to commence this quarter.  A national home support office is in the process of being established and a home support pilot commenced this month in one site, with the other pilot sites to be fully operational by January 2022.  I was disappointed that the four sites did not commence operation in October.  The only reason was the recruitment of staff.  It was not due to lack of funding.  We have started in one site and the other three sites will commence.  This is to test the statutory home care model in four sites to provide us with information as we go forward. </p>  <p>  On home care specifically, last year, I secured an additional &euro;150 million for home support, which provides for an additional 5 million hours.  My budget for home support this year is &euro;666 million, which is a vast amount.  The HSE target is to deliver 24 million hours of home support this year.  It is estimated that, by the end of September, 15 million hours had been provided to more than 53,000 people.  Notwithstanding the challenges we have, this is approximately 2.2 million more home hours compared to the same period last year.  The funding secured in budget 2021 to provide these additional 5 million hours has been maintained for next year.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has been made overall on reducing waiting lists for people awaiting funding approval for home support from 7,800 in January 2020 to just under 400 in September.  I will conclude in the next part of my reply.</p></speech>

I accept the added difficulties with the pilots the Department was looking to put in place in the context of the wider issue we have that an insufficient number of people are working in this sector.  I know that a lot of things are being considered.  We have to look at pay scales and any incentivisation we can provide.  We know of the difficulties of people, some of whom were contracted staff, who would state that they were not going to get paid expenses for travel.  Every obstacle possible was being put in their way.  I think the Minister of State told me that the task force has met, or at least had met when we spoke last, three times and that it is examining every avenue to deal with this problem.  Could she go into a little detail in that regard?  We all know that the big issue is weekend support.  Could she provide a general timeline for getting those pilots up and running?  Where is the pilot that is under way operating?  Where are the other three?  Will the Minister of State provide a timeline, with all the caveats necessary?</p></speech>

We are all aware of the &euro;666 million available.  Delays are occurring at the moment because we have delays in providing home care workers into specific areas.  As the Deputy said, weekends and rural areas, especially, can be very problematic.  Notwithstanding that, the number has come down significantly over recent years.  Home care in Ireland is delivered with a 50:50 split, that is, 50% public and 50% private, but it depends where someone lives.  Up in County Donegal, for example, only 19% of home care is delivered on a private basis, with 81% of care provided publicly.  In CHO 5, which includes Waterford, where the Acting Chairman and I come from, it is a 26:74 split, whereas in the Dublin area, for example, all home care is provided both voluntarily and privately.  That has been going on for many years.</p>  <p>  I have put in place a cross-departmental strategic workforce advisory committee.  It has met informally on a couple of occasions, but the inaugural meeting will be held very soon.  We want to look at the challenges of private providers.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to the difference in the rates of pay.  I will come back to that in a moment.</p></speech>

Again, I accept the difficulties in providing a timeline, but we need that task force to have its inaugural meeting.  I accept that considerable work has probably been done, but we need the task force to put the priorities that are required in place and on the agenda, to be enacted by the Government as quickly as possible.  We are all dealing with families coming to us who just do not have sufficient care.  Could the Minister of State detail, as I said, the pilot schemes and a general timeline as to when they will be up and running?  I have referred to the proposals on the agenda regarding improving the numbers of people in the sector.</p></speech>

Potential areas will be recruitment and retention, training and the career development of home supports.  I was updated by the chief officer yesterday on CHO 4, which comprises counties Cork and Kerry.  They are strategically looking to hire 300 healthcare workers in the next three months.  They have gone out on a very strong recruitment campaign, which is happening all over the country.  The challenge we have, however, is that many people have left the home care sector and gone into nine-to-five jobs and into retail.  Some have gone to work in factories, where the terms and conditions for some are more favourable.</p></speech>

GPs seem to be getting on well, but I would like the Minister's view on the mass vaccination centres and the pharmacies and how they are being used for the campaign.  Could he also speak to the staffing levels to provide the vaccine compared with the levels during summer?  Have there been changes in the staffing levels and resources we have at our disposal?</p></reply>

I do not think anybody expected to get to Question No. 117, so the note I have does not include everything I would like.  I will therefore go from memory, so if some of these figures are off, I apologise ahead of time.</p>  <p>  Between boosters and third doses for the immunocompromised, approximately 900,000 vaccines have been administered at this stage.  The highest priority groups were nursing homes and other long-term residential care residents, those over the age of 80 and those who are immunocompromised.  They have been either substantially done at this point or have been offered appointments for boosters or third doses.  The next group is healthcare workers and those in their 70s.  Approximately a little over two thirds of healthcare workers and a little over two thirds of those in their 70s have now had their boosters, and many more have been scheduled.  That is moving very quickly.  The next groups are those in their 60s.  One group I asked the HSE to accelerate vaccinations for was those who have underlying health conditions.  These comprise the vast majority of people in ICU, Covid patients or people with underlying conditions.  Good progress is being made on those in their 60s, and there are walk-in clinics this week.  There are walk-in clinics for healthcare workers as well in the vaccine centres.  Those with underlying conditions have started this week and, to begin with, they are being contacted.  What I am talking to the HSE about now is whether we can expand access to those with underlying conditions, for example, by walking into a pharmacy or contacting a GP, who may well have given them the vaccine last time, or by having walk-in centres for those with underlying conditions.  We are moving through those as quickly as we can.  The next group is those in their 50s.  I am advised that the plan for them is to start in approximately two weeks, so mid-December is the provisional date for that group.</p></speech>

However, it has been reported that we do not have as many vaccinators or staff as we had in the summer.  Is he able to speak to that?  I am not looking for numbers, but is that an issue?  It may not be a big one; it may be a small one.</p>  <p>  Second, we are following a similar vaccination pathway by prioritising older people, healthcare workers and so on, as we did initially.  Has there been any kind of judgment or indications as to whether there has been any drop-off in booster take-up as opposed to the first vaccine?  I would be interested to hear if there are early indications or data on that.  Let us be honest: we are benchmarking our booster campaign against a very successful initial vaccination campaign.  The vaccination campaign and what it has done to keep people alive cannot be overstated.  We all want the booster campaign to be a success.  I would be interested to hear from the Minister on those two points.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, was just saying to me, the demand in the nursing homes has been huge.  There has been no drop-off.  We saw over the weekend very long queues.  Obviously, we do not want anyone waiting many hours for a booster, particularly in the winter, but it is at least indicative that there is a very high demand, and we have seen it grow.  In fact, we have seen another big wave of interest since we found out about the latest variant.  The good news is that there is strong demand and we are seeing high take-up levels, as I said, for the initial groups who have had that little bit longer, namely people in nursing homes, those in other long-term residential care, the immunocompromised and those aged over 80.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's second question related to recruitment, which is one of the issues we are focusing on a lot on the task force.  We had a great many people in the vaccine centres.  There was a period between broadly the end of the vaccine programme and the start of the booster programme when we could not leave very large numbers of people with nothing to do, so many were redeployed back into-----</p></speech>

Some went back into retirement.  An amazing number of people had come out of retirement.  Students went back to college.  In recent weeks, the HSE has been successfully asking people to come back and has been deploying, where possible, from acute settings.  However, the acute settings are under severe pressure and one of the areas we were able to bring staff from last time was PCR testing.  We now have capacity of approximately 225,000 PCR tests per week.  The students are back in college so it is more difficult.  We are calling out to everyone we can to come in to allow us have as many people as possible available.  Regardless of that, between third doses and boosters, approximately 210,000 vaccines were administered in the past seven days, which is good.  We are looking to increase that all the time.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.303" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1521" speakername="P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300021#T00500"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work done by former Deputy John Brassil in preparing this Bill.  The Bill essentially replicates the good work John undertook in the previous D&aacute;il.  I am eternally grateful to him for his efforts in this regard and his support over recent months.  I also acknowledge the good work of the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly.  I am aware that he has to go to a Cabinet sub-committee meeting now, but since he has assumed office he has provided the largest drugs budget in the history of the State, adding &euro;50 million to the overall budget this year.  This investment needs to be acknowledged as it eclipses any previous drugs budget the State has had.</p>  <p>  That said, there is still a significant problem regarding the classification of rare diseases and the processes that surround the approval and reimbursement of orphan drugs.  Under existing legislation, there is no differentiation between orphan medicinal drugs and mainstream drugs.  It is abundantly clear that the orphan drugs used to treat rare diseases continuously struggle to secure reimbursement in Ireland.  Juxtapose that with the position in other European states.  The disheartening thing for me when I started my research on this was that Ireland is considered a laggard in European terms.  That is the unfortunate situation we find ourselves in.  Many countries in the eastern part of Europe are light years ahead of us in the provision of orphan drugs.</p>  <p>  The reimbursement process is often protracted, public and pits patients against the State.  Patients often have to take to the streets, lobby their public representatives or campaign for the approval of drugs.  The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 to put in place a structure for the HSE to appropriately assess orphan medicinal drugs when making a relevant decision regarding an item for reimbursement.  It will provide clear guidance to the HSE on appropriate use of the health technology assessment, HTA, guidelines when assessing an orphan drug, as well as establish new criteria for the HSE to consider when making a decision.</p>  <p>  The provisions of the Bill are set out in four sections.  This is a technical Bill.  I do not want to get too technical, but section 1 sets out to define what an orphan drug is.  Section 2 inserts the definition into the principal Act.  Section 3 amends section 19 of the principal Act, which deals with the HSE decision-making process in adding medical items for reimbursement.  It deals with issues around cost-effectiveness, the validity of the quality-adjusted life year, QALY, model and the role of the HTA.  Section 4 establishes a new set of criteria for consideration of orphan medicinal drugs, mitigating against low quantitative data and guaranteeing the HSE would consider qualitative data presented on an orphan medicinal product for patients.  Section 4 also deals with the concept of the State and pharma engaging in risk-sharing and obliges the State to be cognisant of what our European counterparts are engaged in.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, to imagine what it feels like to be diagnosed with a rare disease and possibly be told there is no cure, treatment or way of curtailing the pain.  I can only imagine the toll it would take on anyone in that position.  Imagine being told there is a new drug or treatment that may help manage this pain, suppress symptoms or improve quality of life.  Imagine the hope that availing of such a drug would bring to somebody diagnosed with a debilitating disease.  Then - bang - the unfortunate reality hits that in Ireland it takes more than 1,000 days, on average, to potentially get access to that drug.</p>  <p>  In response to recent parliamentary questions he tabled, my colleague, Deputy Michael Moynihan, received an outline of all drugs that have gone through the process and been signed off on by the HSE.  Comparing these with public data available from the European Medicines Agency, EMA, and HSE websites, we see that for June 2020 to 2021, on average, orphan medicinal products took 1,361 days from securing EMA authorisation to being authorised in Ireland.  The breakdown of that 1,361 wait is 426 days to make an application, followed by 429 days undergoing assessment under the so-called rapid review.  At 429 days, I question its rapidity.  A further 289 days are spent negotiating between the State and the pharma companies.  Once a drug is approved, there are a further 217 days before it is implemented.  In total, that is 1,361 days or 3.7 years.  For somebody with a debilitating disease who could be experiencing great pain, that must be an excruciating wait.</p>  <p>  Imagine how deflating and soul-destroying it must be for any human being to have a potentially life-changing drug at his or her fingertips, only to be most likely told he or she cannot be reimbursed for it because there is not enough data to support its use, it is in excess of the restrictive &euro;45,000 QALY threshold or fails some other aspect of the health technology assessment.  That is the scenario many people who suffer from rare diseases face.  It is unconscionable that the State, which has responsibility for the health and well-being of its citizens, would block, refuse or defer any decision on approving a drug because of the arbitrary &euro;45,000 figure.  That is the archaic system presided over in this country.</p>  <p>  Let us look at what our EU counterparts are doing.  I will not compare us with France or Germany because they have far superior resources to us.  I will make comparisons with countries like Sweden and Scotland.  In Scotland, an ultra-orphan pathway was established, providing a distinct process for assessment for these rare conditions where qualitative data can be used in the absence of significant quantitative data.  The Scots also provided for interim acceptance of some drugs.  That acceptance and the subsequent reimbursement are conditional on the provision of further data and evidence over a specific period up to three years.  Reimbursement is then provided on the basis that the drug in question clearly demonstrates its efficacy.  Any drug that is not proved effective would not be the subject of reimbursement.  This idea of risk-sharing between the state and the pharma industry means patients get quick access to potentially life-changing medications.  If they do not work or something better comes along, and inevitability in this sphere many drugs come along to replace others, the state does not bear the burden of the cost.  It is a clear example of the state and industry working together to provide for patients and improve health outcomes.  This State, however, continues to apply the most rigid HTA criteria, which gives orphan drugs little or no chance of being approved if they exceed the arbitrary &euro;45,000 threshold, as attested to by Professor Michael Barry, head of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, in front of an Oireachtas health committee in 2019.</p>  <p>  Since 2019, 31 drug indications have been approved by the EMA.  Scotland has made 19 of these available; we have only made four of them available.  The average time to approve those drugs in Scotland was 13 months; in Ireland, 21 months.  These are significant differences in timelines considering the serious and often life-threatening diseases we are speaking about.</p>  <p>  The assessment for reimbursement in Sweden is based on three core principals.  One, everybody has a right to healthcare.  Two, priority is given to patients with the greatest need and those most vulnerable.  Third is cost-effectiveness.  The big difference between Ireland and Sweden is that, while both use the QALY threshold and the Irish model employs the &euro;45,000 threshold, the Swedes employ no such arbitrary figure.  All drugs are assessed on their medical efficacy and the outcomes they deliver for patients, while still being cognisant of cost-effectivenes.  An arbitrary figure is not used as a bazooka to disapprove a drug regardless of its level of efficacy.</p> <p>Some critics of this Bill suggest that to remove the rigid QALY threshold we have in this State would somehow weaken our hand in any negotiations with big pharma.  This is a fallacy that was created to detract from this Bill when brought forward previously by former Deputy, John Brassil.  No doubt it is a myth that will be circulated again at some stage of this debate.  It is stated implicitly in Part 4 that any drug must be assessed as to its potential or actual budget impact in any question being analysed.  There is no magic money tree out there to approve all drugs all of the time, but it is possible to streamline legislation and guidelines on this issue in a way that gives patients hope but, more important, often gives them life-changing and life-saving treatments.</p> <p> In regard to the first section, I undertook an awful lot of research over the past few months into this topic.  I refer to the drugs Spinraza, Orkambi, Translarna, Zolgensma and to Onpattro, about which I raised an issue most recently and which the Minister of State has spoken about in previous D&aacute;il debates on this matter.  The bottom line is that is no way to conduct an assessment for any type of drug.  Deputies and public representatives should not be hauled in here pleading and begging with the Minister of the day to approve one drug over another.  There should be a clear transparent process with specific timelines.  That evidently is currently not the case in light of the 1,300 plus days I referenced earlier in the reply to Deputy Michael Moynihan's parliamentary questions.  That is a life sentence and, in many cases, a death sentence for people.  </p> <p> We need transparency in this regard and this Bill provides it.  I am open to discussion and amendments of any description so long as the current system is overhauled and improved because clearly it is not working.  Many people in the industry will say that such is the high threshold and, often, failure rates in Ireland in terms of this question in regard to orphan drugs Ireland is one of the least attractive places for any pharmaceutical company to come and negotiate.  </p> <p> Ireland has entered into an arrangement with other small nations in the Beneluxa agreement.  The logic behind that was that together a group of countries could compete and negotiate with big pharma companies in the same way as bigger nations such as France and Germany do.  The group came together with the ambition of negotiating better prices for the State and, ultimately, getting drugs for patients.  The Beneluxa group has been in place for two years and only one drug has been approved in that two years through that arrangement.  To say that we will work with other EU partners is great, I am all about co-operation and working together and improving the case for the State and the case for patients, but the Beneluxa arrangement has implicitly failed in the past two years in that, to my knowledge, it got only one drug approved.  </p> <p> I acknowledge that the Minister of State is standing in for the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, as he has to attend the Cabinet sub-committee.  In the past, there has been near universal agreement on this matter.  It is something I am willing to work with other parties on.  I am glad to see some of them represented here today.  I believe we need to do more for patients.  I would welcome the Minister of State's statement on the matter.</p></speech>

I recognise his sincere interest in patients who are in need of orphan medicines.  It is a cause he has championed for quite some time.  We hear about it regularly at our parliamentary party meetings.  I acknowledge the work of former Deputy, John Brassil, on this issue.  He, too, was very passionate about it.</p>  <p>  The Minister supports the intent behind the Bill.  He also wants to secure faster access to medicines for the most vulnerable of our patients.  I can safely say this is something we are all aligned on.  As public representatives, we are all moved by the tragic circumstances faced by many people suffering from rare diseases.  The pipeline of new innovative medicines coming to market remains strong and it is vital that Irish patients continue to benefit from these medical advances.  I understand the Minister is open to any ideas or proposals that might improve our existing pricing and reimbursement assessment processes, with a special focus on orphan products.  For that reason, he is not opposing the Bill.  I do, however, want to use this opportunity to set out the current process and to outline recent reforms that have been undertaken.</p>  <p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 is the statutory framework under which all new medicinal products must be assessed by the HSE.  The HSE is the statutory decision-maker for the reimbursement of such products and the Act ensures that these decisions are made on an objective and scientific basis.  In making decisions, the HSE carefully considers a number of criteria that are contained in the Act, such as clinical evidence, efficacy and the available resources.  It is only fair to acknowledge that these are difficult decisions and those involved must balance the availability of finite Exchequer resources with ever-competing demands.</p>  <p>  The 2013 Act does not include a specific rule set for the assessment of orphan drugs.  However, the HSE and National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, have assured the Minister that in making their decisions they have particular regard for the unique circumstances surrounding orphan drugs.  These criteria include not only cost-effectiveness and budget impact, but aspects such as clinical need and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment.  The HSE can, and does, take a nuanced approach with respect to the particular challenges posed by rare diseases, such as small patient populations and unmet clinical need.  This capacity for nuance is reflected in a number of reforms carried out to date under the existing Act.  The rare disease technology review committee is fully operational.  It carries out reviews of reimbursement applications for new orphan medicines in cases where the drugs group requires further guidance.  This committee gives voice to rare disease patients and to clinicians with expertise in the specific illnesses in question.  The committee played a key role in the HSE&rsquo;s approval in July of Patisiran, a new medicine for the treatment of the rare, inherited life-limiting condition called hATTR Amyloidosis.  Using the guidance from the committee, the HSE was able to take account of the challenges faced by patients in terms of unmet need and the potential impact of the drug, alongside considerations of cost effectiveness. </p>  <p>  The HSE drugs group has been expanded to also include representation from the National Patient Forum and further clinical expertise in the area of rare diseases.  The NCPE&rsquo;s patient organisation submission process encourages the lived experience of patients, carers and their families, as well as their views on the difference a new medicine may make.  This information is then used as part of the health technology assessment of the medicine.  Since implementation of this process in 2018, there has been a doubling in the number of patient organisation submissions received and it is expected that this number will continue to increase.  The challenge of accessing innovative medicines at affordable prices is one shared by our international partners.  It is estimated that 100 new indications will receive European Medicines Agency, EMA, market authorisation in Europe each year over the next five years.  The Minister, therefore, fully endorses the State's participation in international collaboration and co-operation in efforts to secure affordable and timely access to new medicines for rare diseases.  Our involvement in the Beneluxa international initiative with other EU countries demonstrated its potential to have a positive impact in relation to orphan medicines.</p>  <p>  As announced previously, in October the HSE approved the gene therapy drug, Zolgensma, for reimbursement for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy.  This followed the first joint agreement on the price of a drug between Belgium, Ireland and the Netherlands, carried out through the Beneluxa initiative.  This Bill presents one such opportunity.  However the Minister is also keen to maintain an open mind and be receptive to non-legislative avenues.  He wants to look forensically at the current system and identify further options for reform.  Increased transparency and communication would make for a more responsive system.  The Minister is committed to seeing where this could be achieved across the NCPE, the HSE and rare diseases technology review committee.</p> <p> Turning to the provisions of the Bill, I wish to outline the relevance of quality-adjusted life year and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio measurements.  The quality-adjusted life year metric is the economic evaluation system used by the NCPE to determine the cost-effectiveness of a given medicine.  It is a measure of the state of health of a person or group through which the benefits in terms of length of life are adjusted to reflect the quality of life.  One quality-adjusted life year is equal to one year of life in perfect health.  The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio expresses the value of health outcomes in terms of the cost per quality-adjusted life year.  Our experts believe the quality-adjusted life year metric is a valuable tool in the decision-making process. The HSE and the NCPE consider it to be the best method we have to assess the cost-effectiveness of medicines in a systematic and scientific way.</p> <p> If the HSE were unable to consider the cost per quality-adjusted life year thresholds for orphan medicines, it would have no guidance on their cost-effectiveness to support commercial price negotiations.  The executive would, therefore, enter such negotiations in an uninformed and disadvantageous position.  The Minister is assured by the NCPE and the HSE that the current system accommodates the approval and reimbursement of expensive orphan medicines.  Fifteen of the 43 new medicines approved by the HSE in 2021, up to 12 November, were orphan medicines for the treatment of various conditions, including, but not limited to, rare cancers and spinal muscular atrophy.  Together, they represent more than one third of approvals this year.  In many cases, these drugs significantly exceeded the guideline cost-effectiveness threshold of &euro;45,000 per quality-adjusted life year.  That metric, therefore, does not pose any barrier to the reimbursement of orphan medicines.  Indeed, the HSE has expressed concern that without having carried out such cost-effectiveness assessments, it would end up paying significantly more for orphan medicines than would otherwise be the case.  The advice provided is that abandoning the methodology would potentially have added an additional &euro;250 million cost over the next five years in respect of the orphan medicines already approved for reimbursement in 2021.</p> <p> It is clear, too, from an analysis of the trends over recent years that the overriding factor in medicines making it through the process to reimbursement is the availability of Exchequer resources.  The 15 orphan drug approvals to date in 2021 were enabled by an allocation in budget 2021 of &euro;50 million for new drugs.  By contrast, when no such funding was included in budget 2020, only eight orphan drugs were approved and, moreover, they were approved only when funding was made available through industry price realignments.  For this reason, budget 2022 has allocated a further &euro;30 million for the approval of new drugs.  This will provide the HSE with the resources necessary to continue providing access for Irish patients to new innovations in the area of rare diseases.  We cannot overlook that, in the context of finite resources, paying more for orphan medicines would have a very real impact on the health service's capacity to fund even more new medicines, including subsequent innovations in the area of rare diseases.</p> <p> To reiterate, the existing assessment criteria in the 2013 Act do not pose an impediment to the approval of orphan drugs.  However, our system is not perfect.  No one familiar with the challenges faced by citizens with rare diseases would make that argument.  The Minister has asked his officials to consider the available policy options in this area.  In particular, he is hopeful that opportunities exist to improve the transparency of the assessment process and communication with its stakeholders, including patients and industry.  Notwithstanding the concerns I have outlined today, I reiterate that this Bill is honourable in its intent and must serve as an occasion to explore the policy options available to us.  For this reason, the Minister does not intend to oppose it, as we continue to strive for an assessment process for orphan medicines that will provide some of our most vulnerable patients with access to the innovative treatments they deserve.  I congratulate Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan on all his work in this area and his determination to bring the Bill to the floor of the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.307" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="12:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300023#V00200"><p>I commend Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan on bringing forward this excellent Bill, which relates to an area in which I have an interest.  The previous health committee looked at this issue and made recommendations, many of which are included in the Bill.  I thank an Teachta O'Sullivan for his interest in this matter and for continually raising all these important points, as well as his predecessor, John Brassil, and others, from all parties, who have championed this issue for so long.</p>  <p>  The first point I want to make is to acknowledge the amazing work that is being done in the area of innovation in medicines and healthcare.  We are seeing a lot of groundbreaking treatments, all of which are to be welcomed.  Many new medicines have come on stream, including a large number of high-tech drugs, especially in the area of cancer, as well as huge advances in technology in regard to precision treatment and gene therapies.  Many of these treatments require high-tech drugs, including orphan drugs, which are very costly but also very necessary if we are to save lives.  This ties in closely with drug trials and the need for more funding in that area.  When we look at all this innovation, it is noteworthy that many of the high-tech drugs that are coming forward, several of which an Teachta O'Sullivan named, are produced in Ireland by pharmaceutical companies and their workers.  Much of the research, development and innovation that is leading to the development of these drugs, which are saving lives across the world, is happening here on our island and in this State.</p>  <p>  I am somebody who believes we should be leaders in research and development, encourage innovation and support and reward it when it happens.  I have met many people in the industry and they are at a loss when they look at the league tables of countries that can avail of many of the drugs produced on this island through reimbursement processes similar to our own.  We languish somewhere near the bottom when it comes to how quickly public patients can access those drugs in this State.  Even though we produce the drugs and support the research and development, because of our complicated, convoluted, bureaucratic system to enable drugs to get on the reimbursement list, patients on this island are not able to avail of them as quickly as patients in other countries.  That needs to change.</p>  <p>  We all appreciate and understand why the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, is not here to take this debate.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, said in her opening statement, "We cannot overlook that, in the context of finite resources, paying more for orphan medicines would have a very real impact on the health service's capacity".  There are many areas of the health service where capacity is needed but has not been delivered by the Government.  We have all asked for more capacity in healthcare.  In the case of new medicines and drugs, which we are talking about in this debate, the action needed is costly, yes, but it saves lives.  People simply cannot afford the huge cost that would be associated with any of these drugs being administered.  No individual would be able to fund it.  There are times when the State has to step up and give funding because it simply cannot be done by individuals.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State is saying we have finite resources and cannot put in place the type of funding that is necessary in this area because we must look at all the other areas of healthcare, which we do.  That statement is juxtaposed with what was done in regard to Covid.  Let us take a step back and look at how much money was spent on dealing with the pandemic over the past two years.  It comes not to tens of millions of euro but billions.  The reason we spent billions on Covid was, above all, that we had to protect people and save lives, which involved spending money on testing, tracing and vaccines.  It was the pharmaceutical industry that stepped forward in rapid time to create a vaccine from which we are all benefiting.  The booster jab is now being rolled out, which is giving us a very high level of protection from Covid.  That would not have been possible were it not for the innovation, research and development that is happening in the sector and politicians trusting the science which by and large most of them in this State did.</p> <p>When Covid-19 came, we responded quickly and we put in the funding.  We spent billions of euro to save people's lives by putting and infrastructures for testing, tracing and vaccine roll-out and so on.  Yet, for whatever reason, we do not seem to want to fund orphan drugs to the same extent, or even at a fraction of it.  In budget 2020 - and I welcomed this - the Minister made &euro;50 million available for new drugs.  In our alternative budget 2021, we provided for an additional &euro;50 million, but truth be known this still is not enough.  I agree that you cannot throw endless amounts of money at it and that there cannot a blank cheque for any area of healthcare.  Demand will always outstrip supply in healthcare because of the decades of neglect we have seen in investment into our public service.</p> <p> However, we need to put a much stronger emphasis on the areas of drug pricing and the supply of new drugs.  I have made my points about funding, about the need for the State to do more and my rationale as to why the State can be the only driver for this.  My understanding is some of these drugs cost hundreds of thousands of euro to administer, in some cases maybe more than a million euro.  Very few citizens who could afford that, and certainly not many I know.  If we want patients and people to avail of the groundbreaking drugs that can keep people alive, then the State simply has to do more.  That is on the funding side of it.</p> <p> There are also problems, to which the mover of the motion has already referred, about the reimbursement process.  Again, I have spoken to industry.  I accept fully, and I put my cards on the table here, that we have to strike a balance between what the pharmaceutical sector wants and protecting the taxpayer.  Nobody is saying and I am not saying there should be a blank cheque.  There has to be a process.  I assume the proposer of the motion supports this.  Of course we have to have a process.  However, the process is too convoluted and it takes too long.  As an Teachta P&aacute;draig O&rsquo;Sullivan said, it can take years for many of these drugs to find themselves on the reimbursement list.  I looked at the layers and layers involved in the process and all of the hoops that have to be gone through.  When you compare that, as the mover of the motion did, to the situation in other countries, they have much quicker processes, yet they can still find that balance that protects the taxpayer and they have a process that enables transparency and accountability.  Although we have that process, other countries can get much quicker decision-making so that drugs can appear on the reimbursement list more quickly.</p> <p> Those are the two issues here, if we are to cut to the chase.  We have to streamline the reimbursement process.  We have to make sure the drugs can be approved as quickly as possible and find themselves on the reimbursement list.  Critically, we also have to provide the additional funding.  This is because we can approve what we like, but if the funding is then not there then the drugs cannot be made available to patients.</p> <p> I talk to many people in healthcare.  On the course of my travels over recent months, I met many people in the area of cancer care, who provide excellent work.  It is mind-blowing what these specialists do in our hospitals throughout the State.  We sometimes talk about the inefficiency of our healthcare system.  However, we cannot overlook the work that is being done by so many people.  When we see the precision technology, robotic technology, the advancements in cancer care, the gene therapy treatments, the trials and the research being done in our hospitals with linkages to universities, it is mind-blowing.  We also see the treatments that come with that work, and all of these new drugs that are coming on board.  People working in healthcare are telling me they can only do so much.  They can only do their jobs as consultants.  Their job is to save people's lives.</p> <p> Imagine being a consultant who is treating a very sick patient and knowing that a particular drug can save that person's life, but it is not on the reimbursement list so he or she cannot get it.  Imagine knowing, as a consultant, that this drug would make a difference but you are not in a position to prescribe that drug because it has not found itself on the reimbursement list.  That is what consultants and specialists are dealing with day-in-day-out.  I am sure they understand everything the Minister of State said about finite resources.  However, when we talk to them about balance, funding and other capacity issues, they say they have to make decisions every day that save people&rsquo;s lives.  They are not in a position, at times, to be able to administer, provide or prescribe drugs, which they would like to be able to do, because the funding is not available.  I have heard one of our former colleagues who was a Member of the Upper House, Professor John Crown, talk about this issue several times.  As we know, he is a specialist in this area and has been critical of the slow pace of getting many of these oncology high-end drugs onto the reimbursement process.</p> <p> I appeal to the Government to do more to listen to the experts and the consultants, to make sure we put patients first and to work with Deputies, such as an Teachta P&aacute;draig O&rsquo;Sullivan and others, who have taken a keen interest in this issue.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.309" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1523" speakername="Colm Burke" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300024#W00200"><p>I thank my colleague from Cork North-Central for introducing this Bill, which follows on from the Bill that had been originally published by our former colleague John Brassil.  Deputy P&aacute;draig O&rsquo;Sullivan has outlined the extensive work he has done in this area.  It is important we give recognition to that and that we acknowledge the commitment he has made.  I also thank the Minister of State for her response.</p>  <p>  This whole area has been in the health committee for well over ten years now, since I first served on the committee in 2011.  We published a document in 2013, which was on recommendations of the national clinical programme on rare diseases.  One of its recommendations was to set up an office to deal with support for parents of children with rare diseases.  We must remember there are more than 6,000 rare diseases.  I remember coming across one particular rare disease where only 12 children in the entire island of Ireland had it.  That is an indicator of how rare some of these diseases are.  Therefore, when other countries come to deal with the pharmaceutical companies, they are dealing with far bigger numbers.  For instance, Germany starts using the medication immediately after it becomes available and then it negotiates the price of that medication over the following 12 months.  Obviously, that is because Germany has larger numbers than Ireland.  We might have ten people who have a particular rare disease here in Ireland, whereas Germany might have 1,000.  They are, therefore, in a far stronger position to negotiate.</p>  <p>  I always wonder about us teaming up with smaller countries to negotiate as a group.  Would we have been better-off teaming up with a bigger country in negotiating down the price of drugs?  I acknowledge what Deputy Cullinane said about the pharmaceutical companies.  A huge amount of research in this area is done in this country, yet when it is completed and the drug is produced, the drug might still not be available to people living in this country four or five years later.  We need to look at that.  In my own county alone, for instance, we have nine of the ten top pharmaceutical companies in the world.  They are based in Cork and are within a 50-mile radius of Cork city.  The work and research are being done and the end product is being produced, yet there are parents who have to fight to get access to the drug.  We need to look at the timescale.</p>  <p>  This even relates to ordinary drugs.  I remember being involved in the health committee and dealing with an issue where it took on average 23 months for any drug to be approved by the agency, even though the drug is available at a far earlier stage.  Remember that any drug that becomes before the assessment process here in Ireland has already been approved by the European Medicines Agency, EMA.  Even though the drug is approved by the European Medicines Agency, we are still taking another two years to come to a decision on whether we will include the drug in the reimbursement system.  My colleague has already outlined the situation in Scotland and we need to look other jurisdictions to see how they fast-track the assessment process.  We need to engage with them to see if we can replicate what they are doing.  This is not about cost in real terms.  This is about people&rsquo;s lives.  It is about families whose entire lives are surrounded by taking on the State to try to get access to a drug that they know will be of assistance to a member of their family.</p>  <p>  During my short time in the European Parliament, I had to go abroad for medical treatment.  One of the things I fought for when I was in the European Parliament was about the right to access medical treatment in another member state if you cannot get it in your own state or if there is undue delay.</p> <p>We started working on that in 2008.  It was eventually signed off on in 2009 and approved by the Commission, the Parliament and the Council in 2011.  It was then transposed into Irish law a number of years later.  That to which I refer gives people the right to access medical treatment in other member states if they cannot get it in their own state.  We should also be making sure there is joined-up thinking across Europe as regards access to medication, especially on orphan drugs.  We can come to a far better arrangement from a European point of view by working together with all member states of the European Union on access to a particular drug rather than only working with a number of countries.  It is something we need to look at.  We have done it with medical treatment so why can we not do it with medication, medical products and orphan drugs?</p> <p> This Bill is welcome.  My former colleague in the House, John Brassil, who was on the health committee, did work on this matter previously.  We should not be putting this off when there are families who know there is a drug available and two to three years after coming on the market at European level, they are still not able to get access to it.  Families have moved to other countries in order to get access to the drugs they required.  We need to look at why it takes, on average, 23 months for drugs to be assessed.  That is for all drugs, not just orphan drugs.  We need to review this now.  We did the review of the clinical programme for rare diseases back in 2013.  It is now time to review that clinical programme again.  It is nearly ten years on.  What part of that programme has been implemented?  What needs to be implemented?  What needs to be delivered?  In fairness to the Department, there are a lot of issues relating to Covid that it has to deal with, and I fully understand that people are under pressure, but we need to look at this as well.  We should not say we will come back and look at this in two years.  Now is the time to start the review and see what has been implemented, what needs to be implemented and how we can make sure that children or individuals who need a particular treatment can get access to it.  I support this Bill and I hope it will go on to the next Stage and that we can progress it.  At the same time, we need to bring about improvements in order that people can access the care and treatment they require.</p></speech>

It is vitally important that we make medicines as accessible and affordable as possible.  We need to remove barriers to medicine and this will be a positive step in the right direction, albeit not the final step, in achieving this.  Given my portfolio, the epidemic of crack cocaine comes to mind when talking about orphan drugs and new medicines.  A great deal of work is being done at the minute to find a pharmaceutical treatment for crack cocaine addiction.  This is an epidemic that is destroying communities and the lives of people and families.  Unlike heroin, there is no pharmaceutical substitute for crack cocaine and this is proving a huge barrier to people accessing treatment.  I would hate to think that, if and when we are at a stage where we can provide this vital treatment to those in the throes of addiction, cost will be a barrier to accessing that.</p>  <p>  There are serious issues with the process of approving new drugs.  There are also many issues around rare diseases and people with rare diseases need to be treated much better.  Last year, I was contacted by a lady suffering from very severe morning sickness.  She needed a drug called Cariban, which is used to treat severe morning sickness.  Her doctor agreed that she needed it but unfortunately, this drug is not available on the medical card and she had to pay for it out of her own pocket until such time as she could no longer afford to do so.  Unfortunately, when she had to stop taking Cariban, because she did not have the money, she ended up being hospitalised due to dehydration.  This goes to the core of this Bill.  It is about affordability and making drugs, and orphan drugs in particular, accessible under the reimbursement scheme.  This is only one case but it highlights the impact unaffordable medicines can have on people.</p>  <p>  It is disappointing that despite the Joint Committee on Health producing a report on these new medicines in 2018, it has taken a Private Members' Bill to progress this issue.  I suppose inaction on health from this Government is not surprising.  The fact that health policy is being driven by members of the Government from the backbenches says a lot.  The reluctance to properly resource the health service is matched by a reluctance to make healthcare affordable.  After months of pleading with the Government to consider antigen tests, we finally got there but instead of making these tests affordable, the Government has decided to leave this vital aspect of our fight against Covid-19 to Lidl.  That is where we are now.  Instead of properly resourcing healthcare we are relying on the free market to make healthcare affordable.  The Minister of State might ask those trapped in the housing crisis how that approach has gone.  As Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan said, it has taken almost four years to get a new, life-changing drug included in the reimbursement scheme.  That is a shocking figure and an indictment of our healthcare service.  People with rare diseases need to be supported.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State made a number of points.  She stated that the Minister for Health wants to look forensically at the current system and identify options for reform, and that he wants to increase transparency and communication to make a more responsive system.  I respect that the Minister of State is being honest.  She is not opposing this Bill today, but the question is whether she, and the Minister, will support it.  Will they support this Bill that is trying to make a difference to people with rare diseases?  Deputy Colm Burke spoke about the ten-year history of discussions in health about this issue, in 2011 and 2013.</p></speech>

I also acknowledge that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has entered the Chamber.</p>  <p>  Today is International Day of Persons with Disabilities.  While that is not the subject matter of this Bill, we are talking broadly about people having access to healthcare, whatever that may be, so it is important to recognise this day.</p> <p>I hope that we will have more focused debates on the matter in the coming weeks.</p> <p> I thank Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan for introducing this Bill and for speaking to me about it earlier this week.  The area of orphan drugs is not one I am very familiar with, being relatively new to this brief.  What is not new to me or any of us as public representatives is individuals coming to our clinics and ringing our offices who have rare diseases but are unable to access medicines that would help them and make their lives somewhat better or could cure them.  They are unable to access these medicines because of the medicines' exclusion from the reimbursement scheme.</p> <p> In researching this matter and being briefed on it, Ireland was described to me as a medications paradox.  We are a massive producer of pharmaceutical products but because of the system that is set up, some of these medications cannot get to the people who need them.  That must change.  Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan mentioned former Deputy John Brassil and his work on this matter.  I understand that Mr. Brassil is a pharmacist by trade, so he is someone with expertise in this area and who would have seen the weaknesses in the system on the front line.  That is why I am happy to see this Bill before us.  I hope that it makes some progress, given that there are weaknesses in the system.  When there are drugs that will help or cure people but that we cannot provide to the 280,000 people in this country living with rare diseases, then there is a weakness in the system.  We have to work together.  Being present for this debate and its contributions from every side of the House, I can see that everyone wants to get to that point.</p> <p> I thank Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan for introducing this Bill.  There is much more work to do.  I certainly have to do much more work in terms of my understanding of this area, but from the brief research I have done in the past couple of days, I can see that this Bill is needed.  I hope to see it progress.</p> <p> I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me the time to speak.</p></speech>

I also thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving his time yesterday evening to mark International Day of Persons with Disabilities, and I thank the House for turning Leinster House purple.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan for introducing this Bill.  This matter is something about which I am passionate.  On the Opposition benches, I saw the great work we did with Orkambi and Kalydeco in respect of cystic fibrosis and the difference that work made to people's lives.  It was a battle no different than the one Deputy Colm Burke mentioned, given the length of time it took us and all the hoops we had to jump through.  All the while, we could see people's lives disintegrating because they did not have access to those drugs.</p>  <p>  It is important that the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, has given his support to the Bill and to us understanding the process and why it takes so long to turn drugs around when we know that we have fantastic drugs in the system.  I am here to lend my support and I see the value this Bill can have.  The House should support it collectively.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputies who contributed on this discussion, in particular the Bill's sponsor, Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan.  I commend the goal of the Bill, which seeks to provide faster access for people to new medicines for the treatment of rare diseases.</p>  <p>  I was particularly struck by Deputy Gould's comments.  He was amazed that a backbencher could introduce a health Bill.  Does that mean that Deputy Gould is not allowed to introduce health Bills?  I compliment the two of his colleagues who are present - I am working with Deputy Colm Burke on a Bill on standards for home care and I am happy to work with Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan on this Bill on orphan drugs.  In government, we welcome all opinions.  We all have individual minds, thoughts, strengths and ideas.  I encourage anyone who wants to introduce a Bill.  Members should not feel like they cannot.  It is important that we hear from everyone across the House.  That goes for all colleagues.</p>  <p>  I have outlined some reforms of the existing assessment process carried out to date by the HSE and the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.  I wish to take the opportunity to acknowledge their work in that regard.  These reforms are ensuring that many expensive orphan drugs are getting reimbursed.  I also wish to recognise the contribution made in recent years by the Joint Committee on Health.  As Deputy Colm Burke mentioned, the committee has been considering this issue for the ten years he has been a member of it.  It has held a number of productive discussions on the subject of rare diseases.  Since the committee published its report in 2018, there has been substantial engagement between the Department of Health, the HSE and the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics on each of the recommendations.  In the previous D&aacute;il, we all campaigned for the inclusion of Spinraza in the scheme on behalf of many kids who were moving into adulthood.  We are all aware of how that drug has made such a difference to those families.  It was an emotive issue at the time.  There was only a small number of children involved, but it was great to see provision being made for the drug and those children being able to get on with their lives.</p>  <p>  The substantial engagement I mentioned has resulted in a number of positive changes in the assessment process for orphan medicines.  This includes the setting up of the rare diseases technology review committee, which facilitates patient and clinician input and gives these expensive medicines a fighting chance of getting through the system and becoming available to patients.</p>  <p>  Irrespective of the costs involved, we must not forget the human element of this debate.  We saw that with Spinraza and the effect it had on the children and their families.  People with rare diseases are among our most vulnerable and they are often faced with a large level of unmet clinical need.  Due to small patient populations, the development of new medicines for the treatment of rare diseases has historically been hampered by reduced commercial incentives.  However, the pipeline of new medicines for rare diseases has become stronger in recent years thanks in part to the European Parliament's adoption of measures to encourage innovation in this area.</p>  <p>  Today's debate offers an opportunity to progress our conversation around rare diseases.  We must continue to question and improve our systems with a view to providing faster access to new innovations.  Recent investment in research of treatments in this area is encouraging.  However, more could be done to support access to treatments for rare diseases.  The tabling of this Bill represents an opportunity to look comprehensively at the current system and consider how issues such as transparency and communication can be improved.  I understand that the Minister has asked his officials to do that.  In the circumstances, he does not propose to oppose the Bill.</p></speech>

It is great to see that the Bill has universal support and I look forward to it going to Committee Stage.  Deputy Colm Burke and our own Deputy Lahart are on the Committee on Health.  They are passionate about this topic.</p>  <p>  I will make a couple of comments in summary.  There are a few inescapable truths.  One is that these drugs are expensive.  Of that, there is no doubt.  The second inescapable truth is that we as a country make people wait much longer than they probably should, certainly compared to our European neighbours.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has taken this debate on behalf of the Minister.  In my opening speech, I referred to the fallacy of budgetary constraints, the concept that these drugs would be costly and that we would be opening a can of worms.  That is precisely where I want this debate to move away from, as it is a fallacy.  There is no truth to it and it is a myth.  The Minister of State said: "The advice provided is that abandoning the methodology would potentially have added an additional &euro;250 million cost over the next five years".  I would love to see how that figured was arrived at.  I imagine it assumes that all orphan drugs that went for reimbursement got approval.  I am not asking for that, though.  I know the process inside out at this stage.  I know that not all orphan drugs get approval.  That &euro;250 million figure is not a true reflection and does not stand up to any scrutiny.</p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Cullinane on one point he made, in that this sector is moving at a fast pace.</p> <p>My honest view is that this Bill is probably outdated already, insofar as it was initially put forward in 2018.  I essentially replicated it, but in the meantime we have made significant progress in the area of genetics and gene therapy, for example.  The Bill does not have those types of therapies included, and that is probably something that might emerge as a further amendment in the health committee.  That is something I would welcome.  Deputy Cullinane is correct in saying that this sector is moving fast.  I hope the Bill will become legislation in a few years.  There is no doubt that by the end of the debate, further provisions will be required.</p> <p> I wish to put to bed the myth that if we abandon the &euro;45,000 QALY threshold, costs are going to spiral out of control.  We can look at a dozen countries across the EU that do not have that QALY threshold.  I mentioned Sweden and Scotland, and Denmark is very similar to us in terms of population and size, but none of them operates a specific QALY threshold, be it for &euro;45,000 or &euro;100,000.  They assess a drug on its efficacy and then they do a cost-benefit analysis in the process.  All drugs get a fair chance.  The fundamental issue here is that orphan drugs are not assessed as orphan drugs, which means if 1 million patients in a country need a new drug, there is a specific pathway for them, but as Deputy Colm Burke alluded to earlier, if there are ten or 20 patients needing a drug, obviously the cost will go up and there is no specific pathway or process for the drug to be analysed.  It is analysed in the same way as a drug that is destined for 1 million patients, which is complete madness.</p> <p> There should be a specific pathway, criteria and timelines because the reality, as per Deputy Michael Moynihan's parliamentary question, is that it takes 1,361 days on average for a drug to come into someone's possession.  A total of 426 days are required for the initial application.  When we drill down into the 426 days, any of the companies that are applying for reimbursement for orphan drugs know the answer to the application process already.  They are going to be over the &euro;45,000 threshold.  It makes no sense for them to be assessed in the same way as a drug destined for 1 million patients.  It is completely bonkers.  In that respect, what we are trying to do here is to provide a statutory footing for orphan drugs.  They do not have that at the moment.  The intention is to provide hope for patients in the future that the drugs they require will be assessed on their individual merit and not with mainstream drugs or illnesses.  That is the crux of the matter.</p> <p> Other speakers have referred to the importance of pharmaceutical companies to us as a country.  Deputy Colm Burke mentioned that nine of the ten largest pharmaceutical companies in the world are based here.  It is unfortunate that drugs being made in Ringaskiddy, Little Island or wherever it might be are potentially unavailable here, but we are exporting them all over the Continent.</p> <p> The Bill gives people a definite pathway and it also gives them hope and opportunity.  I had only been a Deputy for two months when I had the hardest conversation I ever had around a coffee table outside Cork city.  I was told that a person was one of a couple of dozen people in the country that suffers from amyloidosis.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, mentioned it earlier.  This person had already had a relative die of that disease.  In the meantime, the person knew that for every year they did not have the drug, it was taking years off their life.  Thankfully, after four years the system approved the drug, patisiran, to specifically treat amyloidosis.  I befriended a number of people who suffer from the condition, which is especially prevalent in Donegal of all places.  It is connected with a specific gene and a number of related families suffer from this very specific illness.  There is relief for them now that they have a life and access to a drug.</p> <p> As Deputy Gould mentioned, many people cannot afford these drugs.  That is the simple reality.  I know the detractors of the Bill will say that it will open a can of worms, as has been said previously, and that a bottomless pit of money will be required that we cannot provide.  There is a specific provision in the Bill stating that it must operate within budgetary constraints.  Nobody is suggesting for a moment that it would be otherwise.  If a drug is effective and, following intense negotiations with a company, the State can get it at a reasonable price, it should be made available.  That is what this Bill provides for.</p> <p> Ireland is probably three to five years behind most of its leading counterparts in this regard.  We are playing catch-up.  Realistically, all the quantitative and qualitative data are already done in European countries.  Those pharmaceutical companies will use the same data when they are selling these products to us.  The reality is that because we are so far behind, we know the drugs work.  If we were ahead of the game, we would be taking a greater risk, but we are not.  We are years behind.  In that respect, we are playing catch-up.  We know that many of the drugs that will be sought for reimbursement work because they are being used across the Continent.  The Bill enshrines in legislation that orphan drugs will have a specific pathway.  That is all we can give to people.  We cannot expect the Department to give drugs if we are dubious about their efficacy, but because we are so far behind, we know the drugs work elsewhere and are enhancing and improving people's lives all across the Continent.</p> <p> I thank everybody for their support.  I thank the Ministers of State, Deputies Butler and Rabbitte, as well.  I met the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, last week on a Zoom call and I am grateful for his support of the Bill.  I look forward to the Committee Stage debate on the Bill.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.328" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="13:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300028#DD00200"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p>I am grateful to the Chair and to all Deputies for facilitating debate on this urgent rental legislation in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  I also wish to record my thanks to the Chief Whip and to the members of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage for enabling the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2021 to be read a Second Time here, following its passing in the Seanad last week.</p><p>I am asking the House to pass the Bill to enable its early enactment to provide for the transition to providing residential tenancy protections on the basis that any new tenancy that commences six months or more from the passing of this Bill shall continue as a Part 4 tenancy for an unlimited duration, unless terminated within the first six months of its commencement; amendment of the current prohibition on any rent increases in a residential pressure zone, RPZ, from exceeding general inflation, as recorded by the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP, to insert a new condition that the last rent set cannot inflate by more than 2% per annum <i>pro rata</i>; and a temporary fee waiver in the immediate aftermath of the roll-out of the requirement for annual registration of tenancies with the Residential Tenancies Board for certain tenancies registered.</p><p>The Government is particularly keen to enact and bring into operation the new rent increase caps in rent pressure zones without delay.  The most recent HICP inflation data for Ireland shows an inflation rate of 5.1% for October 2021 and the November data is due to be published in mid-December.  The fast-rising inflationary trend requires fast counter-action by Government.  This Bill, once enacted, will stop rent inflation beyond 2% per annum in RPZs.</p><p>It is not lost on me that this is the sixth time since the formation of the Government that we have asked D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to amend our residential tenancy laws urgently.  Most recently, the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Act 2021 introduced new measures in July 2021 to better protect tenants with affordability challenges by extending the operation of RPZs until the end of 2024 and prohibiting any necessary rent increases in an RPZ from exceeding general inflation, as recorded by HICP.</p> <p>The link to HICP aims to safeguard continued investment in the sector by existing and new landlords to deliver the much-needed supply of high-quality rental accommodation, while protecting against significant increases in rental inflation in the coming years.<br/><br/>When introducing these measures, the Minister was clear on the need to monitor inflation carefully.  At that time, inflation had averaged 0.73% per annum over the previous three years.  We needed to revise the RPZ rent control relatively quickly in July on a basis that could be independently verified.  The quarterly economic commentary for autumn 2021 of the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, outlines that despite the ongoing effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, both domestic and foreign sources of growth have contributed to the Irish economy's robust performance in 2021.  As public health measures are eased considerably, the ESRI anticipates a return to more normal economic activity by the end of the year.  The recovery has contributed to inflationary pressures, along with global supply chain problems and energy prices.  While the current expectation is that these factors are largely temporary, further domestic inflationary risks remain relating to the rapid recovery in household spending.  At this juncture, the ESRI expects that inflationary pressure will peak in quarter 4 of this year and then abate during 2022.  However, the ESRI also cautions that any sustained easing of the inflation rate could be compromised by a continuation of global price pressures for energy products, as well as by a faster than expected recovery in the domestic economy.<br/><br/>Section 3 of the Bill aims to address the rent affordability challenges that are building on foot of the unexpectedly fast-rising inflation rate by introducing a cap on rent increases in RPZs of 2% per annum to operate in conjunction with the current restriction based on HICP inflation.  As Minister of State, I only want to see the supply of rental accommodation increase, and thus I intend to implement legally and economically sound policy proposals onto the Statute Book.  Every action the Government takes in the rental sector causes a reaction.  We must also recognise that the very tenants whom we are trying to help could be left worse off if the wrong policy choices are made.<br/><br/>With the time available, I will outline the specific provisions of the Bill, which contains eight sections.<br/><br/>Sections 1 and 8 contain standard provisions dealing with definitions, the Short Title and collective citation of the Bill.<br/><br/>Section 2 provides a consequential technical amendment to section 6 of the principal Act, which relates to the service of notices.<br/><br/>Section 3 amends section 19 of the principal Act in the context of the setting of rent subject to a maximum permissible rent increase in an RPZ.  This proposed section, if passed, would amend the current prohibition on any rent increase in an RPZ from exceeding general inflation as recorded by HICP to insert a new condition that the rent set increased by more than 2% per annum <i>pro rata</i>.  This will mean that rents may only increase by the rate of recorded HICP inflation or 2%, whichever is lower.  The new cap on rent increases in RPZs is considered necessary, given the prevailing high level of inflation.  An inflation rate of 5.1% was recorded in the year to the end of October 2021.  With inflation on the rise, the original 4% rent increase restriction provision in RPZs has been breached by reference to the October HICP values and is likely to also be breached by future HICP values into 2022.<br/><br/>The operation of the new 2% cap will be subject to a review after 12 months, with a written report to be provided to the Oireachtas after a further three months.  This amendment of the principal Act also provides for the deletion of the Minister&rsquo;s power to prescribe an index other than the HICP for the purposes of restricting rent increases in RPZs.  This power is no longer necessary, given the new provision of the 2% per annum<i>pro rata</i>rent increase cap.  Consequential technical updates are also provided for.<br/><br/>Section 4 of the Bill provides technical referencing amendments consequential to section 3, section 22 and Schedule 2 of the principal Act.<br/><br/>Section 5 proposes to amend Part 4 of the principal Act, regarding security of tenure, to provide for enhanced tenancy protections on the basis that after six months duration a Part 4 tenancy is established for an unlimited duration, and not subject to expiry at the end of a six-year term should the landlord exercise his or her right to terminate the tenancy as currently provided for under section 3B of the Principal Act.  This is a commitment under Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland, and is being addressed in accordance with the advice of the Attorney General and taking account of constitutionally protected property rights.  The provision will apply prospectively in respect of tenancies commencing six or more months after the passing of this Bill.  The intention is to enhance security of tenure for tenants and to simplify the operation of the 2004 Act.  <br/><br/>In addition, where any existing six-year Part 4 tenancy is renewed, rather than commencing a further Part 4 tenancy, it will become a tenancy of unlimited duration.  Existing tenants may also seek the consent of their landlord to have their current tenancy treated as a tenancy of unlimited duration.  However, the landlord will not be compelled to grant his or her consent.  Where consent is not granted, the existing protections of the Act will apply.  The aim is to transition to tenancies of unlimited duration, while respecting the constitutionally protected rights under section 4 of the Residential Tenancies Acts, 2004 to 2021.  Only new tenancies commencing six or more months after the passing of this Bill must be on the basis of an unlimited duration.  Naturally, however, all Part 4 tenancies over time will be of unlimited duration.  As existing and further Part 4 tenancies terminate, expire over time or are renewed, this process will involve the creation of a new tenancy of unlimited duration in respect of a dwelling, should it remain in the rental sector.<br/><br/>Section 6 provides for technical amendments to sections 3, 29, 30 and 64B of the principal Act to reflect the transitions to tenancies of unlimited duration.  In particular, the amendment to section 64B provides that the duration of tenancy under any tenancy of unlimited duration and under any preceding Part 4 tenancy and-or further Part 4 tenancy would be treated as one tenancy in calculating any termination notice to be given.  This is an important technical amendment to maximise the tenancy termination notice period to be given to a tenant.  Section 6 will commence at the same time as section 5, namely, &quot;on the day that falls 6 months after the date of the passing of&quot; the Bill.<br/><br/>Section 7 amends section 134 of the principal Act, regarding the obligation to apply to register a tenancy, to provide that, subject to conditions, where a landlord applies to register a further Part 4 tenancy before the commencement date of the requirement for annual registration under sections 22 and 23 of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019, regarding a commencement date expected in quarter 1 of 2022, and where that tenancy still exists on that date, no annual registration fee shall apply in respect of that further Part 4 tenancy only.  Any new tenancy of unlimited duration that commences will be liable to an annual registration fee.<br/><br/>To be eligible for the temporary fee waiver, any outstanding registration fee associated with the relevant application to register a further Part 4 tenancy prior to the roll-out of the annual registration must be paid within one month of the commencement of the requirement to register tenancies annually.  The temporary annual registration fee waiver is being provided for existing further Part 4 tenancies in recognition of the registration fee payments already made to date in respect of relevant tenancies.  The intention is to commence section 7 of the Bill at the same time as the commencement, in quarter 1 of 2022, of the requirement under sections 22 and 23 of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2019 for annual registration of tenancies with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.<br/><br/>As legislators, we have shown how we can work together quickly and react to suppress the spread of Covid-19.  In that spirit, I again thank Deputies for all their co-operation on this Bill, which will make a real and significant improvement for renters upon enactment.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.330" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="13:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300029#EE00200"><p>As the Minister of State knows, I like to think of myself as a very reasonable person and as somebody who will genuinely listen to the arguments the Government puts forward for the various measures it introduces.  When it does something right, I will support it, when it does something poor, I will not oppose it, but I will highlight the inadequacies, and then, on many occasions, when I believe the Government is doing the wrong thing, I will oppose it.  </p> <p>I know this is the season of goodwill but any renter watching the debate so far and who understands the provisions of the Bill can only come to two conclusions.  The first is this Government has no notion whatever of what is going on in the private rental sector, specifically in terms of the enormous pressure on renters facing ever-increasing costs of living.  At the same time there is a dramatic and non-stop loss of private rental properties from the bottom and middle end of the market.  The idea that bringing six pieces of exceptionally poor amending legislation to the Residential Tenancies Act is suggesting this Government is doing something right is further evidence.  All of these minor changes, while marginally less worse than the previous set of changes, do nothing to tackle problems but simply add to the confusion out there.  The only sentence from the Minister of State's speech that resonated with me was that which referred to the wrong policy choices having the wrong consequences.  That is exactly what this and the previous Government have been doing with the private rental sector for so long, and it is why we are in the mess we are in.<br/><br/>A report in <i>The Irish Times</i>published just two hours ago indicates this State is the sixth most expensive place in the world in which to rent.  Dublin is the third most expensive capital city in the European Union in which to rent.  That is the reputation of our rental sector globally.  Looking at the most recent Daft.ie report for new rents rather than existing rents for the third quarter of this year, average rents across the State are indicated at &euro;1,500 per month and average rents in Dublin are indicated at over &euro;2,000 per month.  On the basis of affordability that puts rent at approximately 30% of net disposable income, people need take-home pay of either &euro;4,500 outside Dublin or over &euro;6,000 in Dublin in order for that average rent to be affordable for a household.  That is just out of this world.<br/><br/>Looking at the most recent RTB data, including existing and new tenancies, the picture is not much better.  We are still seeing State-wide averages of &euro;1,300 and in Dublin averages of &euro;1,800.  A report commissioned by Dublin City Council and produced by KPMG is included as an appendix in the county development plan, which means it is very significant research, and it looks forward to what will happen with housing supply and costs over the next number of years.  Based on all the most up-to-date data, including the Government's targets in the new housing plan, it indicates that over the next number of years average rents in Dublin will rise to &euro;2,400 per month, meaning people will need take-home pay of &euro;7,000 for that to be affordable.  That is the scale of the crisis facing renters, which is why the bottom line for our party is that renters simply cannot take any more rent increases.  They do not have the money, and that is the central problem.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, despite the talk about wanting to increase supply, since 2017, quarter on quarter, landlords and rental properties are leaving the market.  These are predominantly accidental and semi-professional landlords taking advantage of positive equity in the market but we have lost over 20,000 rental properties at the bottom and middle end of the market in the past number of years.  There is no plan from the Government to deal with this disorderly exit of the properties.  At the same time, the new stuff coming into the market is high-end, poorly designed build-to-rent properties way beyond the reach of ordinary working people.  Of course, it is one of the main reasons homelessness has started to increase again.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the Government's over-reliance on the private rental sector to meet social housing need because it is not building enough social houses itself means the housing assistance payment, HAP, in particular, but also the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, are absorbing far too much of what little rental supply is out there.  The homeless HAP is particularly necessary for people experiencing homelessness but it is inflating rental prices even further.<br/><br/>There is a crisis in the private rental sector like we have never seen before but what is the Government bringing forward?  With the rent pressure zones, it has brought forward an appallingly weak proposition.  With tenancy security, meanwhile, what the Government is claiming is simply not true.  A polite way of describing it would be &quot;dishonest&quot; but I could think of more forceful words.  I will explain that with relevant data in a moment.<br/><br/>On the 2% provision, I should first say that 2% is mad because renters cannot afford 2%, 1% or 0.5%.  If somebody is paying &euro;1,600, &euro;1,700, &euro;1,800, &euro;1,900 or &euro;2,000, any percentage of an increase is completely unacceptable.  The Government has not told people it is seeking to reverse a slightly positive change that the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, introduced in the previous Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Bill, meaning landlords will again be able to accumulate year-on-year rent increases if they had forgone them before.  If, on the passage of this Bill, I am in a rental property and the last rent increase was in 2016, the actual rent increase that the landlord will be able to hit me with is not 2% but rather the inflation rate from 2017 to now, which is 5.6%, because that is lower than the 8% figure from using the 2% calculator.  The Government is not capping rents at 2% at all for tenants who did not receive rent increases in previous years despite the Minister promising to get rid of that loophole; he got rid of it but only a few months later the Government is ripping up that provision and throwing it in the bin.<br/><br/>On top of this, the cap will not work anyway because RPZs have never worked.  First, the cap does not apply to the third of rental tenants outside RPZs or the new stock coming to the market.  It is impossible to police between tenancies, or when one tenant moves out and another moves in while the landlord charges above the limit.  I want to be very clear that large numbers of landlords obey the rules but there is too much scope in the RPZ process for them not to do so.  On that basis, not only is this legislation a bad idea if it did work but it is an exceptionally bad idea, because like its predecessors, it will not.<br/><br/>Let me deal with the Government's claim of introducing so-called tenancies of unlimited duration.  It is not what is in this Bill and it is simply not credible to come here and say that.  A tenancy of unlimited duration occurs if I sign a contract and the deal is that so long as I pay my rent, maintain the property and avoid engaging in antisocial behaviour, my tenancy is secure indefinitely.  This would eliminate no-fault evictions and it is a standard procedure in almost any other civilised rental market.<br/><br/>The Government, meanwhile, is seeking to remove a small technical provision of the Residential Tenancies Act whereby at the end of a six-year Part 4 tenancy, a landlord cannot evict without grounds.  I have no problem with its removal.  According to the latest data I have from the RTB, for the past three years only 3% of notices to quit have been on what are known as section 34(b) grounds, or the grounds the Government is seeking to remove.  Meanwhile, 77% of all notices to quit are on two other grounds, which relate to sale of property and use of property by a landlord or a landlord's family member.  So long as those two provisions remain on the Statute Book, tenancies of unlimited duration will not exist in this State; that is a fact and not an opinion.<br/><br/>If we go to other more civilised and better regulated rental markets, we can see that people would rent a property, abide by the contract and get to stay.  If the landlord wants to sell, he or she can do so with the tenant <i>in situ</i>and the tenant cannot simply use the property for a family member because it is ultimately a rental property and not for mixing and matching between private residential and private rental.<br/><br/>It is time for the Government to be honest with people.  It is making a small and technical amendment to the legislation. Yes, it is acceptable but it is nowhere near what is required to give tenants security of tenure.  If the Government was serious, it would get rid of those other parts of section 34 of the Residential Tenancies Act.  We can provide an opportunity for the Minister to do that on Committee Stage with our amendments.  As the Minister of State made clear with his very questionable remarks in the Seanad about blood being thicker than water, he has no intention of doing that whatever.<br/><br/>The claim we cannot have real tenancies of indefinite duration because of the Constitution is bogus.  It is the most bogus use of the private property protections in the Constitution I have ever heard.  The Constitution protects people's right to the property itself but it in no way limits how the State regulates the use of that property, as we know from planning permission, zoning and this legislation.  Unless the Government is willing to publish the advice from the Attorney General, which I doubt has been properly drafted, I will continue to believe the claim is bogus.  Such action will not happen not because it is not legally possible but rather because the Government does not have the will to introduce what it now claims it is introducing, which are tenancies of indefinite duration.  Shame on the Government for repeatedly claiming it is doing something it patently is not.<br/><br/>The other provision of the Bill is very technical and straightforward and I have no objection to it.  If somebody has already paid the registration fee under the old rules, they should not have to pay an annual fee until the Part 4 tenancy expires.  I have no objection to any of that.  We have worked constructively with the Minister of State on the Maritime Area Planning Bill 2021 and we have worked constructively with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, on the Planning and Development (Amendment) (Large-scale Residential Development) Bill 2021.  Sinn F&eacute;in will not oppose this Bill but do not take that for a single second as evidence we believe anything in this is either good or what is required.  It absolutely is not.<br/><br/>What do we actually need if the Government is serious about wanting the kind of rental sector just outlined, which is stable, growing and where both tenants and landlords can have security?  It is one where landlords could make a fair return providing a good service and tenants would have long-term security of tenure and affordability.  </p> <p>What do we need to do?  First, we have to accept we are in an emergency, and therefore, we urgently need a three-year ban on rent increases and a refundable tax credit to put money in renters' pockets.  A refundable tax credit would not be my preferred option; I would much prefer to see rents unilaterally reduced.  I do not believe that is possible or deliverable in the short term and therefore, the refundable tax credit is desired required.  However, at a minimum there must be an emergency three-year ban on rent increases.  Then we need to stop talking about cost rental and pretending we are doing it and we need to ask how much cost rental do we need and how much money it would require.  The allocation of a paltry &euro;70 million in budget 2022 to deliver more than 500 cost-rental units is an absolute embarrassment.  We need at a minimum 4,000 affordable cost rental units year-on-year at a cost of &euro;300 million plus, which is what Sinn F&eacute;in provided for, and even that would take some time to meet the need that is out there. </p> <p> We also need to plan to halt the disorderly exit of rental properties from the lower and middle end of the private rental sector.  The first thing that is required, which I called on the previous Minister, Eoghan Murphy, to do, as I am calling on the present Minister to do, is to commission research by the RTB to find out exactly the reasons those landlords are leaving.  There is some survey data from the board, which is very helpful, but we need to go one step further.  My suspicion is that many accidental landlords who never wanted to be landlords and semi-professionals who thought that it was an easy, soft investment and realised otherwise after the crash are now taking advantage of positive equity.  They are simply getting out.  However, there is a bizarre situation, which has happened on 70 or 80 occasions in my own local authority in the past number of months, where a landlord with a HAP tenant issued a notice that quit, the tenant moved out, the landlord sold the property and a mid-sized institutional investor bought that property at between &euro;30,000 and &euro;50,000 above the asking price, then leased it back to the local authority under the long-term leasing scheme at an astronomical price and a different social housing tenant was put in.  Eighty such leases have been advertised on our choice-based letting system in South Dublin County Council in recent times.  I suspect, knowing where the properties were, a very large number, if not the majority, were previous HAP tenants.  It is displacing one group of social housing tenants for another.  Here is the crazy thing: the Government, the Minister and his Department will not let our local authority buy those properties which is the most logical thing.  If a HAP, RAS or rent supplement tenant is in a property that is being sold, let the State buy it.  As long as it is of the right quality and subject to proper price controls, it should be added to the local housing stock.  However, there is also a case to seriously consider credible tax reform of the private rental sector.  Large institutional investors pay no tax on their rent roll.  Some medium-sized investors pay tax at a business rate while semi-professionals and accidental landlords pay much higher tax.  That is untenable and, therefore, comprehensive reform where all landlords pay a fair rate of tax on the profits they generate would be much more appropriate.  The Minister should do the decent thing.  If the programme for Government and the housing plan commit to tenancies of unlimited duration, then he should just do it and introduce the legislation, otherwise we are going nowhere.</p> <p> On the basis of this Bill, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, yet again, cannot be trusted by renters.  I expect that they will not be in here to speak to the Bill today to save their blushes but the incredible thing is that the Green Party Members, for all their election promises, will continue in support of bad Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael housing policy.  It does not have to be this way.  Rental markets in other European jurisdictions function much, much better.  That is what we are arguing for.  That is what our amendments on Committee Stage will do.  If the Minister really meant the things he says about the way he wants the private rental sector to be in the future, he would abandon the failed policies of his own party in the past, embrace the good ideas of ourselves and other members of the Opposition and create a functioning, stable and affordable private rental sector for all, something that we do not have because of him, his party and his coalition partners, but we could have if we had the change in policy that we are outlining. </p></speech>

We were optimistic that with this Bill, the Government would finally tackle the issue and support renters.  In the past four weeks, 14 families have come to me with notices to quit, which are really eviction notices.  In one day in my clinic, which is held every Monday, five families came to me with notices to quit.  They will become homeless in the new year.  Where in this Bill is the protection for families like that, when landlords say they are going to sell a property or that they will use it themselves?  If the landlord wants to sell the property, that is fine but why must the tenant move out?  That is an excuse that is still being used, which the Government has not protected renters against.</p>  <p>  We are in the middle of a pandemic yet families are being forced out of their homes and into emergency accommodation under the Minister's and the Government's watch.  A gentleman came to me last week.  His landlord tried to put him out with 24 hours' notice, contrary to advice from Threshold.  The RTB said it was wrong.  He rang the Garda because he was worried that the landlord was going to come down and force him out.  I actually drove out to his house to try to comfort the man because he was so nervous.  Then his landlord sent him an email to say he must be out on 22 December.  What kind of a country do we live in?  There are a lot of good, decent landlords out there but there are also unscrupulous landlords who will evict people Christmas week even though they are breaking the law.  This landlord will still do this.  Where are the protections for renters? </p>  <p>  People are sick to their back teeth of the Government making false promises.  People are looking to the Minister and the Government for help, hope and light at the end of the tunnel.  Once again, they are failing to do that.  I was dealing with a man who was supposed to be out of his home last Saturday night.  There are 12 units in the property and 11 tenants have moved out.  This property is being sold.  This is at the heart of the matter.  People are being forced out of their homes so landlords can sell up, developers can do them up and then they are advertised at much higher rents.  Where is the protection of tenancies of unlimited duration?  That man has been living in his home for years. </p>  <p>  The Minister&rsquo;s mentioned RPZs, which have been a complete failure.  We see that with the way that rents have increased.  In Cork alone, rent has gone up by 7% in the past 12 months.  Where is the 4% limit that should have been protecting people?  It is not only in the past 12 months; it has been every year.  Rents have increased in Cork from the time of the financial crisis by 108%.  Sinn F&eacute;in is offering real solutions.  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, wants to protect renters for three years and ban increase on rents.  We want to put a month's rent back into people's pockets. </p>  <p>  The Minister spoke about renters, inflation and a 2% cap.  The Minister may reduces the maximum increases to 2% but if a tenant&rsquo;s rent is unaffordable already, it will still be unaffordable.  He is not fixing the problem.  </p>  <p>  It is time to put ordinary people and renters first.  This was an opportunity to do that.  We hope that when we table amendments to the Bill that the Minister of State and the Minister will consider them.  We want to work constructively.  We have a job to do here.  People have put us into this Chamber to try to solve problems and make their lives better.  This Bill will not do that.  We want a policy to support renters.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned that we do not have the data for new properties coming online.  I know of an apartment complex in Cork where all the tenants had to leave because the landlord was selling it.  When new tenants were put in after it had had a lick of paint and a small bit of maintenance work, they had to pay &euro;400 a month more than the previous tenants.  </p>  <p>  This is a missed opportunity.  I hope when we bring forward amendments that the Minister will work with us positively.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.334" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="13:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300032#HH00100"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation.  As I think the Minister of State pointed out, it is one of several interventions this Government and the previous one have sought to introduce to address issues we raise consistently, in this House and beyond, in respect of the enormous difficulties facing our society and our economy in the area of housing provision due to a lack of affordable housing, housing supply and high rental costs.  Deputy Gould articulated it very well.  He speaks for all of us, that is, both Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la in government and those in opposition.  This is the issue that dominates our work on behalf of those we represent.  I have seen this grow exponentially, and I mean that in the true sense of the word, over the last three to four years.  We are in crisis.  A day does not go by when I am not contacted personally, when my office is not contacted or when I am not stopped on the street, as I was this morning by a woman I know very well who is caught in this trap.  She is in deep despair because she and her family simply have nowhere to go.  I welcome any initiative that seeks to intervene in the rental market and dampen down rent increases.</p><p>The last intervention the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, made was obsolete almost as quickly as it was passed.  He was warned that would be the case.  We knew it would be.  However, the Minister chose not to listen.  It would be churlish of me not to recognise a cap on rents of 2% represents a degree of progress.  If we consider that inflation in October was at 5.1%, an 11-year high, and has grown consecutively over the last 11 months, and that rent inflation is way in excess of that then at the very least a move to cap rents at 2% represents a degree of progress.  However, it is nowhere near enough given the scale of the current rental crisis.  Earlier this week my colleague, Senator Moynihan, pointed out that under the proposed legislation landlords will be allowed to hike rents in excess of current caps by combining years where they have not increased the rent, to put it in plain terms.  That is another loophole designed for landlords before the legislation has even passed.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I look forward to identifying ways we can address that problem on Committee and later stages.  What renters need is no more delays to a comprehensive solution to this very manifest problem.  What they need, and what we need as a society, is a plain and simple rent freeze like the one introduced by the then-Minister, Deputy Kelly, back in 2015.  It is possible.</p><p>We know a precarious rental market leads to precarious lives.  It leads to a precarious economy and to a precarious society.  People need security.  It is a basic human demand and inbuilt in the human condition, especially at this time.  However, no-one can plan for a future where rent increases are forcing people from their homes.  We often speak about housing in a social context and that is the right one in which to discuss and debate it most of the time.  However, even if a person is not interested in the provision of public housing, affordable housing or rent controls, or his or her ideology insists he or she is not, that person may still have an interest in how our economy operates.  We know the biggest issue facing the competitiveness of our economy is the one around the provision of affordable housing and housing supply more generally.  If people do not want to listen to me, they should take the advice of IBEC, the American Chamber of Commerce and a range of think tanks that have reminded this Government and its predecessor of the impact a lack of supply of housing and the crisis situation we are having at the moment is having on workers, businesses and on our economy more generally.</p><p>We are also aware of the impact it is having on our young people.  I recently read the story on <i>rte.ie</i>of 21-year-old Ciara Moroney who makes a one and a half-hour journey each way from her family home in Drogheda to college in Dublin.  It is a journey, she states, that costs both money and time.  Ciara, like many other students across the country, has no choice.  Students like her must commute such distances from Drogheda or even as far away as Dundalk each day because they simply cannot afford skyrocketing rents in the capital.  This creates a massive, if often silent, form of social inequity whereby those students privileged enough to live in the capital or on campus get the complete college experience and the development of the networks they will enjoy in later life and all that involves, while others are left living at home with their parents on a Thursday night.  In short, this serves to perpetuate the class conveyer belt prevalent in this country and prevents real social mobility here, which has been pointed out by the OECD and others.  This contrasts with the more universal student experience of peers in other EU countries like Denmark and Sweden, which we like to compare ourselves with when it suits us.  In those countries, students can avail of affordable rents and secure tenancies in purpose-built student accommodation no matter what a student's background or income is.  Alternatively, they can avail of private sector rents that are properly-controlled, fair, reasonable and secure.  Instead, what is proposed in this legislation is another set of meek half-measures.  It really is no surprise that Ireland has among the highest rates of people in their 20s living at home during the past decade.  That really contrasts with the experience in Nordic countries and elsewhere in other states that may be regarded as progressive across the European Union.</p><p>We have had RTB and <i>daft.ie</i>reports released in recent months which show rental inflation hitting 7% nationally with very worrying trends outside our urban areas too.  This is not a phenomenon restricted to the kinds of urban areas I represent.  There is nowhere in the country where rent has not at least doubled since the bottom of the market back in 2013.  That is an objective fact.  I represent County Louth and part of County Meath.  They are two of the ten counties that now have average standardised rents well in excess of &euro;1,000 a month.  Louth alone saw rent increases of 6.2% as of quarter 2 of 2020.  According to a <i>daft.ie</i>report published earlier this year, the cost of renting a home across Louth has continued to rise at an average of &euro;1,311 per month.  The position is much more acute in my own home town of Drogheda and the area of south Louth and east Meath.  There is a dichotomy within what is a small geographic area.  Rents in my area are much closer to those in Dublin than those experienced in the north of the county, challenging as they are to meet.</p><p>Different methodologies are used by different organisations but it is fair to say the trends are clear.  We are in a period of very high rental inflation driven by what the Central Bank and others have called supply-side bottlenecks.  In other words, there are not enough homes.  Put simply, these rent increases are in large part driven and exacerbated by the extraordinarily weak availability of rental accommodation in the country, highlighted earlier by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  That brings us back to the ultimate issue in the housing system, namely, a shortage of housing, be it public, private, affordable or long-term secure rental.</p><p>All that brings me back to the next point.  While the measures proposed in this Bill might be reasonable in the context of a functioning rental market, the interventions the Minister of State describes in the legislation and that are provided for, do little to solve the immediate crisis of out of control rents.  Quite frankly, we need to do the following things.  We will remind the Government again what needs to be done.  We need to declare the whole country a rent pressure zone.  We need a three-year rent freeze, akin to the form of rent freeze introduced in 2015.  We need to resource the RTB properly to proactively enforce this.</p> <p>On the first two points, we have to remember that the proposed 2% annual increase per year is coming at a time rent is already sky high and completely out of sync with wages and the direction of travel of wages.  For instance, the gap between the national minimum wage and the living wage continues to increase.  How will someone on the national minimum wage, or on low pay generally, be able to afford a 2% rent increase when he or she can barely scrape together enough money to pay the rent as it stands?</p> <p> It is clear we have to now come strongly down on the side of rent freezes, even for a limited period.  Put simply, while inflation rises, we need to introduce maximum rental prices, which will be a proper freeze for a period of time.  The Minister of State will say it cannot be done - he has said it previously and the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, says it repeatedly - and that it is unconstitutional and simply impossible.  That is not the case.  It has been done before and can be done again, if the political will is there.  I remind the Minister of State that, when it came to the crunch, it was done during the Covid-19 pandemic.  The Department found a way to make it happen, thankfully.  That was a very important intervention.  We have to again find a way to make maximum rent controls happen.</p> <p> These controls should not be set in line with, or dictated by, a dysfunctional rental market, which is where we are at present.  They need to be set according to the needs of workers and linked directly to wage rates, in addition to the behaviour and direction of travel of wages.  That can be done.  No full-time worker in this country should be forced to pay more than 30% of their income in rent.  That should be the rule of thumb, which was the case, generally, over the years and was considered reasonable by some.</p> <p> In addition, it is clear there is blatant non-compliance with rent inflation caps and an imbalance between renters and landlords.  Frankly, that is the cause of this issue.  Enforcement is key.  I recall the Fianna F&aacute;il party manifesto and discussions at the time - I am sure the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, will be familiar with this and that it was placed in his manifesto - that 200 additional staff would be in place at the RTB to deal with the issue of enforcement and so on.  We will watch very closely to see how the RTB is resourced to enforce the new swathe of legislation that has come from the Department in recent times.</p> <p> In the context of a market with unprecedented scarcity, I reiterate my party's call to Government to increase renters' rights and to put some power back in their hands.  As part of this, the Government must ask that build to rent, BTR, standards are reviewed to include balconies and facilities for more long-term living, as described in the renters' Bill introduced by Deputy Bacik and Senator Moynihan.  Building poor-quality housing does not allow people to live there comfortably in the long term.  I was never comfortable with any of the changes made in recent years to building standards.  I made that point at the time.  That ought to be addressed.  We need to empower renters to make them feel that their house is their home, tackle the affordability crisis and fundamentally change how we think about renting in this country.  </p> <p> We will not oppose this Bill, but that does not necessarily mean we are giving it our imprimatur either.  There is a significant difference.  We will outline amendments we believe will improve the situation for renters in the context of this Bill on Committee Stage.  We are happy to work constructively, as are other Opposition parties, to make the case for those amendments and to work with the Minister of State and the Minister on them.  I hope that the Minister of State and the Minister will ultimately choose to take real action to address the rental inflation crisis.  In our view, that can only happen with an across-the-board extension of a longer-term rent freeze and not rent caps.</p></speech>

His contributions are always reflective and he is practical, reasonable and objective.  Even he will recognise that his party leader, who is a former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, took a couple of steps regarding the size and scale of apartments that had a pretty devastating impact on property development in Dublin and the living conditions of people who ended up renting those apartments.  It is not something to be proud of and is not a positive legacy.</p>  <p>  I have a lot of respect for Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  We share some ideas, but I do not necessarily imbue him the same kind of messianic talents as some in the media.  I was very taken this week with the fact that he was invited to contribute on Sinn F&eacute;in's position on the mica redress issue.  He said at the time that he would contribute comprehensively to it.  He was invited by the Minister to do so and he did not.  I wonder how he explains himself to his colleague in County Donegal, Deputy Mac Lochlainn, in that regard?  What kind of conversation have they had on that issue?  That must have been very interesting.</p>  <p>  In my experience of 22 years in politics, I have never seen a Minister as open as Deputy O'Brien to inviting spokespeople from all parties and none to contribute to policy development on housing.  He has been Minister for 14 months.  When we look back at the raft of changes and the history of this period in the context of housing is spoken about, we will see that it represented not the destination of where we wanted housing policy to be, but certainly an advanced part of the journey to where housing policy was going.  I represent a constituency that is quite varied in terms of income brackets, socio-economic class, to use that clich&eacute;, and the challenges that face people.  People in my constituency would look enviously at rental costs of &euro;1,300 a month that previous Deputies mentioned.  The rent for a three-bedroom house in my constituency can be up to &euro;2,500 and we are not necessarily talking about the leafy suburbs.</p>  <p>  When we look back on this period, and this is not to suggest that there is not much more left to do because there is, we will see the introduction of a cost-rental model for the first time in the history of the State.  Today, we see the first steps being taken to freeze rents and cap rent increases on rental properties.  We see, in particular, unlimited duration tenancies, which never existed before.  Please acknowledge that significant steps are being taken and that in 14 months, this Minister has made dramatic changes and has shown he can deal with an evolving situation.  I agree that there is a crisis, there is much more to do on this - I have talked to him privately and the Minister knows this - and many more measures will need to be taken.</p>  <p>  I was taken by what Deputy Nash said.  I agreed with much of it, as a constituency politician, and with what was said by previous speakers on this side of the House, on the precarious nature of living in rented accommodation and the uprooting of families when a landlord decides that he or she wants to sell a house.  This might involve a family that has set down its roots, whose children have set roots down in schools, colleges and local employment and, suddenly and without warning, that is threatened.  I am dealing with a family at present that has had to make such a move on four occasions in their lives.</p>  <p>  We need to get on top of the condition of some rental properties once and for all.  I ask colleagues to appreciate that I am restricted in time so what I am about to say will sound like a pro-landlord piece; it is not.  I ask them to take this in the context that I accept all the support for this Bill and the support for tenants that needs to be provided.  More supports need to be in place but I have come across, as have all of us in this Chamber, tenants who have treated properties appallingly.</p> <p>They are in a very small minority, but we do need to make provision for landlords in those situations.  If a landlord can demonstrate that a tenant has abused a property or is damaging the property or leaving it in nowhere near the state in which the renter took it on, the landlord or the RTB need powers to impose in that regard.  I say that just as an aside.</p> <p> I welcome the start of this conversation.  It is part of an evolution in housing policy in Ireland.  There are destinations in housing policy articulated by members of the Opposition that I want to get to equally, that would see enhanced tenants' rights, security of tenure, on which first steps are being taken today, and rent predictability, that would allow people, while not necessarily owning their home or being tenants of a social home for life, to get to a point at which they could consider a private house, their home for life, without fear of eviction but with the ability to live comfortably and in security and the power to raise their family rather than having to uproot them every number of years.</p></speech>

House prices have risen so high that many people find it difficult even to put together a deposit.  I hear regularly in my constituency office how a professional couple earning what would otherwise be regarded as good incomes are struggling even to get a mortgage.  If the couple have any children, the additional cost of childcare makes it almost impossible under current Government policies to get on the property ladder.  Therefore, many people are now forced to rent rather than buy and are faced with spiralling rent costs.  Many rents are greater than what monthly mortgage repayments would amount to.  In this precarious and dysfunctional housing and rental sector, many people are no more than a rent payment away from being made homeless.  Rental prices in Dublin average &euro;2,000 per month.  The national average monthly rent stood at &euro;1,443 in the first quarter of 2021, a rise of almost 95% in a ten-year period.  Rents across the country have risen on average by 7% in the second quarter of 2021.</p>  <p>  There has always been an element of insecurity for renters, who are dependent on landlords.  In the current dysfunctional environment, insecurity of tenure has never been greater.  Renters need greater security over their tenancies.  They need proper rent controls and proper regulation over their rents.  Renters face ever-increasing financial burdens as the cost of living increases, with renters having to pay for childcare, school costs, healthcare, transport costs, bigger bills for utilities and much more.  Sinn F&eacute;in has put forward proposals to help hard-pressed renters who need a break.  We can go some way towards helping renters by freezing rents for three years and banning rent increases for all new and existing tenancies.  Sinn F&eacute;in has also put forward proposals that would put a month's rent back into every renter's pocket through a refundable tax credit.</p>  <p>  Rent pressure zones have failed and should be scrapped.  Recent reports have highlighted the lack of compliance by landlords with rent pressure zone legislation.  Pressure on the sector is increasing as recent figures show a decline in the availability of low-cost properties as landlords exit the sector.  The 2% cap on rent increases will have a limited effect on rising rents as there are too many loopholes, which leaves the door open to runaway rents, as will linking rent increases to inflation.  If inflation continues to rise, so will rents, so neither of the proposed measures in this Bill will be as effective as a rent freeze and neither will give renters the relief they urgently require.</p></speech>

Having heard the self-congratulatory comments from the Government, as if this Bill is the answer to all the problems in the private rented sector, overselling a technical change in respect of the provisions on indefinite tenancies, I am much more worried.  We have to start with an honest analysis of the problems, an honest acceptance of the problems and an honest analysis of this Bill and its limitations.  It is not something to be proud of that this is the sixth piece of legislation in less than two years on the private rented sector.  That is a sign that the other legislation has not done the job that was needed.  We see temporary measures, emergency measures and the measures that were implemented in the summer, tying rent increases to the harmonised index, which we all warned at the time would not work as inflation is going up.  We see the Government behind and out of step on this.  What we need is one Bill to correct the problems in the rental sector and to give certainty.  Several different pieces of legislation is only a way to sow confusion.  It leaves landlords, tenants and everybody else confused as to what the regulations are in the sector.  It is the worst possible way to do regulation or legislation.  No Government should be proud of coming back in here every few months with different Bills when it should be coming in once to sort out the problems.  It is very clear to me that the Government does not understand the pressures faced by renters and the problems in the sector.</p><p>It was said earlier that Dublin is the third most expensive capital city in the European Union in which to rent.  In fact, it is worse than that.  Dublin is the third most expensive capital city in Europe in which to rent and the most expensive in the European Union.  In Europe, it is behind only London and Monaco.</p><p>While I am assessing the Bill, I wish to bring in the voices and personal testimonies of renters because it is important we analyse the Bill and how it is affecting people in their real-life situations.  When talking about renters we are talking often about people on low incomes paying very high, unaffordable rents.  We are also talking, increasingly in recent years, about people on middle incomes and good incomes who would like to be able to buy their own home and who are squeezed out of doing so.  The average household income of a first-time buyer is now &euro;82,000.  It is higher again in Dublin.  Households below that level are simply being squeezed out of being able to buy and forced into a rental trap for years.  What happens in the rental sector affects people on low incomes particularly in affordability terms.  We need to look at this Bill in terms of how it affects renters in that regard.  I wish to quote from one personal testimony.  These personal testimonies are compiled by Dr. Rory Hearne.  One states:</p> <blockquote> 	I just signed a lease to rent a two-bed house for me and my two children.  I'm a single parent.  It is almost &euro;2,000 per month and, to be honest, I have no idea how I'm going to make ends meet.  I'm a full-time permanent employee and have been renting privately since I was in my early 20s.  I have modest savings but nowhere near enough to even think about a deposit for a mortgage.  Let's face it: I have no hope of getting one.  I'll be eating into those savings over the next while anyway to make ends meet, and then what?  So I'm in a situation where the bank says that I can't afford mortgage repayments of about &euro;1,300 so I pay nearly &euro;2,000 a month in rent instead.  It feels so hopeless, and trying to shield the kids from the stress is unbelievably hard. </blockquote>  <p>That personal testimony is something that all of us as Deputies will be very familiar with, unfortunately.</p><p>The Bill allows for 2% rent increases when we already have some of the highest rents in Europe.  These measures are completely insufficient.  As others have said, they will allow for cumulative increases beyond 2%, which people will not be able to afford.  In addition, they will apply only to those parts of the country covered by rent pressure zones.</p> <p>I have amendments in to address all those points.  There is only two hours for Committee Stage next week because that is all the Government has allowed, so whether we get to all our amendments is uncertain.<br/><br/>On rent caps, the Minister of State and others have referenced that the 4% cap did not work, has not been enforced and has been breached in every county.  If that did not work, why does the Government think the 2% cap will work?  We have been told nothing about why this new cap will not be breached when the 4% one was breached all over the country.  Despite the comments from the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on this, insufficient resources have been put into the Residential Tenancies Board and there has been insufficient enforcement of the existing rules.  Figures released to me by the Residential Tenancies Board show that in 2020, more than 90% of the investigations conducted by its investigations and sanctions unit related to rent increases above those allowed for by rules governing the rent pressure zones, RPZs.  That worked out at about 225 approved investigations into breaches of rent pressure zones.  In the year to July 2021, only 28 landlords received a written caution, monetary fine or both for breach of the RPZ rules.  That is just over 10% of sanctioned investigations resulting in action against landlords, showing how weak the system of enforcement is.<br/><br/>The alternatives needed to high rents include cost rental.  Unfortunately, the delivery on cost rental to date has been paltry.  It is not accurate for Government Deputies to say they introduced cost rental because the work on that was done by the previous Government, which introduced it, and by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, and others arguing for a cost rental model for years.  The take-up and roll-out of it has been extremely slow.  We heard in the previous general election, especially from the Green Party, that if it got into government we would get the Vienna model of cost rental.  Cost rental rents in Vienna come in for a two-bed apartment at between &euro;650 and &euro;750 per month.  The newer builds come in at about &euro;750 per month.  That is what we were promised.  We need thousands of cost rental homes per year and, if we are to get affordable rents, we need to avail of and leverage low-cost financing rather than using private speculative models of development.  We also need to do what they did in Vienna, namely, ensure lower land costs by having zonings that allow just for affordable housing to be built on land zoned for it.<br/><br/>I want to nail a few things on the head concerning rent regulation and the issues around it.  First, we have some of the highest rent levels in Europe and the European Union.  That has to be taken into account.  Second, when an investor looks at investing in rental accommodation, rental income is not the only thing he or she looks at.  If the investor is making a rational investor assessment, which he or she often is not, the capital appreciation is a key consideration.  Capital appreciation at the moment is good with house prices rising quickly.  If the investor is making a rational assessment, he or she also looks at rental yield and, in Ireland, the rate of return received on the money invested is amongst the highest in Europe.  A German investor who was reported this week to have bought up 72 homes in Clonskeagh was asked why they chose Ireland over other European countries for one of their first investments outside of Germany and said it was because rental yields in Ireland are higher.<br/><br/>It is important to say that, especially when it comes to landlords who own one property and that type of investment, it is not purely driven by maximum rental return.  There is a bias in people who invest in rental homes towards wanting to get a tangible asset - bricks and mortar, if you like.  Often in different countries people invest in rental properties instead of stock shares because it is a tangible asset.  If there is a complete economic crash, bank shares can collapse in value, while house prices will fall but not collapse to the same extent.  That point was made decades ago when this rental sector was being assessed by economist Peter Bacon.  He said it was not all about rational investment and that has to be taken into account when policies are being tailored.  We saw that traditionally in Ireland when a good number of landlords followed the practice of not increasing rent if they felt they had a good tenant <i>in situ</i>.  It was not always about maximising return.  <br/><br/>Important research was done in the UK recently on economic return and landlords which shows that small landlords generally do not compare rates of return on investment in rental properties with stocks and shares.  That research was from the London School of Economics.  Some two thirds of landlords in Scotland with tenants in arrears said they did not intend to seek an eviction on pragmatic and moral grounds.  Landlords often develop a relationship with their tenants not solely driven by economics.  Some 55% of landlords in Scotland supported emergency legislation to protect tenants from evictions.  There is no reason to believe landlords in Ireland are different.  That should be borne in mind when we talk about rent regulation.<br/><br/>A disappointment I have in the Government concerning the rental sector, with this legislation and more generally, is that the issue of deposits being withheld from tenants has not been addressed.  There has been legislation in place since 2015 for a deposit protection scheme but the Government has chosen not to get that up and running.  Tenants lost out on about &euro;200,000 from the rental company, Period Door Properties, when it went into liquidation and they failed to get their money back, despite determinations and judgments from the Residential Tenancies Board.  We have had tenants losing deposits of &euro;1,800 and in some cases being owed up to &euro;2,700 and tenants left without heat in the middle of winter and failing to get their deposit back.  The Government is doing nothing about that.<br/><br/>On insecurity, I will quote from a personal testimony compiled by Dr. Rory Hearne:</p><blockquote>	Was renting with two kids (one with autism and learning difficulties) in 2017 when landlord raised rent beyond means.  Then said he was giving place to daughter.  Before 3 months were up it was back on the rental market.  Took it to the RTB who found in my favour and fined &euro;9000.  He took it to tribunal and basically talked the whole time not giving me much time to speak and they found in his favour. ... Anyway moved 9 times in 12 years and effect on child with autism devastating.  Hates changing.  Went to ask for HAP or some stability and told I earn too much.  Over 70% of [my] salary on rent.  So basically no help from [local authority] or RTB or this government. </blockquote> <p>That is the devastating impact, which we are all aware of as Deputies from our constituency work, that insecure tenancies can have on tenants.  There is a suggestion that the closing of this loophole is somehow huge progress.  I will support it because this loophole should never have been in place.  It has been in place since a majority on the commission on the private rented residential sector recommended it more than 20 years ago.  I was one of the minority of representatives on the commission to dissent from and oppose that.  Its introduction had no logic except the landlord representatives, appalled at the idea of any additional measures to provide security, insisted on it.  We need an end to no fault evictions, as in most other European countries.  That is needed at this point.</p> <p>In regard to the breaches of the rent pressure zones, which I spoke about earlier, I want to quote a final personal testimony in that regard:</p><blockquote>	I&rsquo;m 45.<br /><br />Was in a rented flat for over 10 years and then the landlord wanted to increase the rent from 1100 to 1600. <br /><br />I was really struggling at 1100. I explained to him that the limit for rent increases was 4% per year. <br /><br />His response was &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a &ndash; [I can&rsquo;t say that word]. I&rsquo;ll sell if you don&rsquo;t pay it&rdquo;. <br /><br />I mentioned the RTB. <br /><br />He said &ldquo;sure they are useless, I wouldn&rsquo;t register any of my places with them&rdquo;. <br /><br />I believe he has at least 8 properties.  Maybe 12. <br /><br />I contacted Threshold and RTB.  They asked me to provide what he said in writing as evidence. <br /><br />Obviously I couldn&rsquo;t as it was done verbally so they couldn&rsquo;t help me until I did the work for them and gathered the evidence. <br /><br />My landlord told me he was advised by his son who happens to own one of the largest property management companies in Ireland. <br /><br />Then in the same breath telling me his son recently bought a Tesla car for &euro;180k.  I&rsquo;d given my landlord over &euro;100k in the 10 years. <br /><br />I didn&rsquo;t have the strength anymore to fight this alone (as the RTB and Threshold couldn&rsquo;t help) and left the apartment. </blockquote> <p>That is the reality for people with the bureaucracy around the rent pressure zones.  In this case, if the person was finally able to provide evidence - it is hard for tenants to be able to do that - and it was taken up by the Residential Tenancies Board, there is a good chance it has not been brought to any conclusion and no sanctions have been applied because we know from the figures I quoted earlier that, at this point, 90% of cases have not resulted in sanctions for landlords.<br/><br/>On the Bill, I have tabled amendments to various sections which it is hoped we will be discussing next week.  In regard to section 3, I have tabled an amendment to provide for 0% increases.  Anything short of that will not work, as we have seen in recent years in terms of the failed measures to date that have been breached.  We need a simple, clear measure and we need that strongly enforced and in place for a number of years to allow for supply to catch up.<br/><br/>Another amendment to this section deals with gender inclusive language.  We should not be bringing to this House Bills that are in breach of the United Nations guidelines on gender inclusive language.  I have raised this in regard to other legislation as well.  I raised it earlier in the week with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, on Committee Stage of a separate Bill and he responded to me on it.  I appreciate that efforts are being made to change the legal definitions in our Bills such that they are gender inclusive.  That is welcome.  However, that goes only halfway to addressing the issue because we still should not be producing legislation that does not reflect the fact there are many people in Ireland who have a gender identity that is neither male nor female and they should be included in our legislation explicitly.  It is welcome that the Government is addressing that in a technical and legal sense, but that needs to be done more comprehensively such that in all legislation everyone is included in the language therein.  We are approaching the end of 2021 and we should be able to do that.<br/><br/>I am also bringing forward an amendment to extend the rent pressure zones throughout the country.  We have seen some of the strongest rent increases in recent times in areas outside of the RPZs.  Nobody can afford those kinds of rent increases.  I urge the Government to accept some of the amendments from the Opposition, it is hoped next week.  I will not be opposing the Bill because the very limited measures in it are better than them not happening, but we should not be under any doubt that this Bill does not go anywhere near far enough to address the very substantial pressures renters are under.  We also need to be tackling heavily the exits from the rental sector.  If we do not have more fair and balanced tax treatment between different types of landlords, whereby large corporate landlords pay very little or no tax and small landlords pay a huge amount, we will not be tackling those exits.</p></speech>

I have been listening to some of the debate over the past while.  Most of those who have spoken come from urban constituencies.  I come from a rural constituency and maybe I hear very different testimonies from those being heard by other Deputies.</p>  <p>  Some Deputies opposite believe there is an easy solution to this issue.  There is no easy solution.  If an easy solution were available, this would have been resolved years ago.  I was taken by the contribution of the previous speaker, Deputy O'Callaghan, in regard to the tax treatment of large and small landlords.  I had intended to say something similar but I thought that in saying it, I would be seen as pro-landlord.  I believe something needs to be done in terms of a tax break for the small landlord who is being charged 50% versus the tax paid by some of the very large corporate landlords.  If we had a reduction in the 50% for the small landlord, we would have a far better rental sector than we currently have.  I am a landlord, which I disclose in my annual returns.  I have two rental properties, so I would consider myself to be a small landlord.  I hope I am considered to be a good landlord.  That said, we have excellent landlords and excellent tenants, but we have some terrible landlords and some terrible tenants.</p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin treats every landlord the same, that is, they are pariahs, they are terrible and they should not be in the field.</p></speech>

There should be more protections for the landlord than are currently in place.  In this regard, I often question the Residential Tenancies Board and some of its outcomes which have been very unfair on the landlords involved.</p>  <p>  I am lucky that I own my own house and that in the evening I can go home to my family and I do not have the worry as to when I might get that telephone call and I will be uprooted and have to move.  Some families have had to move on several occasions.  It is a huge upheaval for a family, in particular where the mother or father might be working in a local area or a child or young person is at school or college in the local area.  It is a huge concern.  We have an awful lot more to do in this area for tenants.</p>  <p>  An issue that has come to the surface over recent years is that of student renters.  Previously a student might have been able to rent a single bedroom but now he or she might have to double up with another person.  This is a huge problem which requires progressive plans and actions from Government.  I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, in conjunction with the Minister, Deputy Harris, to ensure much more conversation take places between the college authorities and the Government regarding college accommodation for students.</p>  <p>At the moment, most colleges are unable to accommodate even their first years students.  From my 20 years in politics, I know that would never have been the huge problem in previous years that it is now.  There is much more that can be done for students.  I ask the Minister to work on this with his Department and the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.</p> <p> There has been much talk about rent freezes, but they bring their own problems.  They can lead to a situation where landlords are left with nothing to invest in their properties other than the minimal in terms of renovation, painting and so on.  Have the rent caps worked?  Yes, they have worked in some areas.  Have landlords cheated the rent caps?  Some of them certainly have and they have not been penalised for their actions.  Going back to my earlier point, we need to look after smaller landlords, that is, the man or woman with one to five properties.  In the main, most of them are really good landlords, who treat their tenants well and look after their properties, but they have continuously come in for negative publicity.  A huge number of them have exited the rental market in the past number of years because of the changes, such as the 50% tax, and the negative publicity that tars them all with the one brush.  They never seemed to get a break in recent years.</p> <p> I support the Bill.  There is much more that should be, and could be, included in it.  I have no doubt the Minister will bring those measures forward in due course.</p></speech>

If the Government had listened not just to what we were saying but what the market was saying, it would not be bringing in this legislation, at this stage, to cap rent increases at 2%.  If the Minister had listened to what we said, he would be aware of what the increases in the past were doing and that no increases should be allowed while we are in a housing emergency that is continuing.  In fact, it is getting worse, so much so that houses that were built by the then Dublin Corporation are now selling for &euro;350,000.  Those homes were built by the corporation in the 1970s and 1980s as part of its housing stock.  Whether it was right or wrong to sell them to tenants is a different debate.  The fact is they were sold to working-class people, in the main, in places like Crumlin, Drimnagh and Ballyfermot.  They were sold to people who were working at the time, and are still working, in professions and who could not afford to buy them today.  People cannot afford the prices that are being sought for houses.</p>  <p>  The reason I am bringing up the prices of houses for sale is that they are driving young working families to look to rent in areas in which they never sought to rent before because homes were affordable to buy.  They are competing with professional families who can outbid them, although only just.  Even professionals, if that is even a word we use any more, with two incomes, cannot afford the colossal rents that are being sought in this city.  It has the third most expensive rents in the EU, as a colleague noted earlier.  To afford the average rent in this city, a couple would need an income of &euro;6,000 a month.  It is just not affordable.  While it is welcome that the Government is stepping in to do something, it does not go far enough.  There should be no increase in rents.  A national housing emergency should be declared and we should act accordingly.  That has not been done and it does not look like it will be done.  That means the couples I am talking about will continue to suffer and we will end up with emigration on the back of a housing crisis.  There is no need for that to happen.</p></speech>

Tragically, there is really nothing at all in the Bill that will make the slightest bit of difference to the people affected by the absolutely dire crisis we face in private rented accommodation and, more generally, in terms of access to some kind of affordable roof over the heads of the huge numbers of people who need it and are having great difficulty in securing it.</p>  <p>  Limiting further increases to 2% or the rate of inflation, whichever is lower, is worse than inadequate.  It is worse than useless against a background of rents that already are completely unaffordable.  I do not know how many times we have to say this and I cannot believe the Government does not know it.  Ministers see the same rent figures we do and I assume they have constituents in the same situation as I do.  They must know that if rents in Dublin are &euro;2,000, it means the vast majority of people cannot afford them.  In my area, the average rent is &euro;2,200 and rising.  This means people need an after-tax income of &euro;26,000 just to pay the rent in my area, or &euro;24,000 in most of Dublin, based on average rents.  That equates to 70% of the after-tax income of a worker on the average industrial wage.</p>  <p>  How does the Government think this is sustainable and how can it justify allowing for further increases, even if they are capped at 2%?  Its response is hopelessly inadequate and does nothing to address the primary reason that people find themselves in housing emergencies or homeless.  The vast majority of people who find themselves evicted are in that situation through no fault of their own and not as a result of the expiration of the duration of a Part 4 tenancy.  That is not the reason most people find themselves threatened with eviction or made homeless.  The vast majority are in that situation because their landlords are allowed to evict them on grounds of sale or substantial refurbishment or because they say they need to move a family member into the home.  Those are the reasons this is happening.</p> <p>I will be impressed with, or even take seriously, the Government's efforts to address the crisis facing tenants or those who want to be tenants but cannot find anywhere affordable, when I stop seeing day in, day out and week in, week out the trail of human misery and suffering that walks into my clinic.  People come in week in, week out to tell me the same terrible story about their landlord selling up, to ask me what they are going to do and to say that they simply cannot find somewhere that is affordable.</p> <p> All of the rents in my area are well in excess of the maximum HAP limits and even the homeless HAP limits.  The maximum payment you can get for homeless HAP is &euro;1,900 but, as I said, average rents are about &euro;2,200.  You cannot find anything, even with the uplift of homeless HAP.  If you find yourself threatened with eviction because your landlord is going to sell, make a substantial refurbishment or move in a relative, you are by definition in a housing emergency, at least in my area and in most of Dublin.  You are by definition threatened with the real possibility of homelessness.  When people with kids, individuals or families come to my office to express their fears and ask what their options are, I tell them they have to register with the homeless section of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  When they go there, the council officials tell them they might be able to get them a hostel somewhere in the city centre.  People have a fear of going into shared accommodation, such as hostels in town.  They often have kids going to school in our area.  They ask how on earth their kids are going to manage in that accommodation.  They ask how they will be able to get them to school in the morning.</p> <p> I will never forget the day a young woman called Kayley came into my office.  I could not believe it when she said she had been homeless all her life.  I would say she was about 19 or 20 at the time. I brought her case up here a few years ago.  When Kayley was born, her mother was homeless and she remained homeless for all the time that Kayley was brought up with her.  When Kayley came of age, she tried to become independent - she was at school and she was going to college - but she became homeless.  She went from being homeless with her mother to being homeless herself.  Never in all her years did she have a secure place to live.  Imagine that.  While that was a particularly extreme story, I am not exaggerating one iota when I say I see people in dire situations - if not that extreme, not far off it - day in, day out.  I see parents with kids who are terrified by the prospect of being made homeless.</p> <p> This proposal is just not good enough.  It is not serious at all.  I do not see what the Government thinks it will achieve with this.  It will neither touch the crisis that affects my area nor the crisis that affects most of the areas where the rental crisis and the housing and homelessness crisis are most acute.  What do we need to do?  We saw some of what could be done when it was done in the emergency conditions of the first phase of the pandemic.  The Government had to get buy-in from the public in the face of the pandemic and the lockdown measures, so it introduced a freeze on evictions to prevent evictions and it put a complete freeze on further rent increases.  Prior to the pandemic, government after government and housing minister after housing minister had said this could not be done.  They said they had advice from the Attorney General that it was not possible and was unconstitutional.  Lo and behold, faced with a pandemic, it could be done.  It was done and it had a positive impact.  The result was that the number of families and individuals in homelessness fell.  This happened just as those of us who had argued for a freeze on evictions prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, when we were faced with a more general housing crisis, said it would.  It is self-evident that the number of people forced into homelessness fell because evictions were no longer possible.  The majority of people who are driven into homelessness come from the private rental sector.  They are evicted by landlords who sell, substantially refurbish a property or decide to move a relative in.  When, for a brief period in the first phase of the pandemic, such grounds for eviction were no longer acceptable, lo and behold the number of people thrown into the misery of homelessness reduced.  Similarly, rent increases were frozen so people were not faced with the prospect of rising rents they could not pay.</p> <p> As I mentioned earlier, the HAP limits are inadequate to cover the cost of the extortionate rents in my area.  Insofar as people in the area can get HAP tenancies at all, most of them have to pay top-ups beyond what they would have to pay if they were paying a proper, differential rent in a council house.  They simply cannot afford these further top-ups.  They often get deeper and deeper into financial trouble because they are paying levels of rent that they simply cannot manage and getting themselves into debt or arrears.  Then they find themselves faced with the possibility of eviction if they get into arrears.  All of this is sanctioned.  It is now official.  It used to be unofficial.  The council would quietly say, "we know the HAP is not enough so you can top up", but now it is official.  The tenant fills out a form to say that he or she needs to top up to pay a rent that he or she cannot afford.  Lo and behold, people get into serious trouble.  They often get into so much trouble from a financial point of view that they cannot pay the rent and end up threatened with homelessness.</p> <p> We showed during the pandemic that we can completely freeze any further increases in rent and prevent no-fault evictions, which are currently allowed and are the kinds of evictions that the majority of people find themselves faced with.  If we remove those grounds for eviction, fewer people end up in housing emergencies and fewer people end up homeless.  Of course, as soon as the Government reintroduced the right to have rent increases and lifted the eviction ban, more and more people started to become homeless and we saw the figures begin to rise.  It is as simple as that.  All of that is combined, of course, with the continual raising of rents.  There has been a 7% national increase over the last year, according to the RTB, on top of the already unaffordable levels.  That is the minimum that is required in order to give some security to people in the current situation of utterly unaffordable rents who feel that there is always a possibility around the corner that they could be evicted on the grounds I have mentioned.  </p> <p> That does not go far enough, in my opinion.  This is where People Before Profit would go even further than any of the other Opposition parties are suggesting.  Given that rent levels are unaffordable, we need to reset rents at affordable levels.  That is done in some countries.  In Luxembourg, for example, a rent can only be a certain percentage of the capital investment in the property.  I am not saying that is the perfect model, but it is a sort of cost rental in the private sector.  It limits the amount of profit that the landlord can make, and the amount he or she can charge in rent, based on the investment he or she has made in the property.  In other places, rents are set on the basis of particular geographical areas at a level that is considered affordable.  </p> <p>That is what we need to do.  If we do not do that, we will not get an affordable rental sector.  Even that measure on its own, which we should and must take, will not solve the crisis because, as I am sure the Minster of State will be quick to say, we need supply.  We certainly do need supply in the market because there simply is not enough of it but the problem with relying largely on supply from the private sector is that the people who build rental property for profit have absolutely no interest in rents falling.  Why on earth would they build properties to rent if they thought the result of building those properties was that rents would fall and their profit margin would reduce?  They simply will not do it.  They will build properties only if they can make large profits.  If there is any suggestion that the profits will decline, they will stop investing.  That is the folly of relying on the private sector in order to solve the housing crisis and the rental crisis.</p> <p> What is necessary, on a far greater scale than this Government or any recent government has been willing to consider, is a return to the direct provision by the State of affordable rental accommodation.  In other words, we need council housing, which is genuinely affordable and based on a proportion of people's income.  Much as the Government says it is moving back towards this approach, I do not believe it.  I think there is a reason we have been asking for four years for a review of the income thresholds for eligibility for social housing.  The Government keeps saying there is going to be a review but it never arrives.  Why is that?  Why is it that the Government has not reviewed upwards the income thresholds for four years?  The reason is that the Government is intending to reduce social housing to something that is provided only for people on the lowest of low incomes.  That is the plan.  There is no question about it.  It is convenient for reducing the numbers on the housing lists because as people's incomes creep up each year the Government can lop another few hundred or few thousand off the list.</p> <p> The issue has now reached such ridiculous proportions that even people in homeless accommodation are being affected.  We are dealing with four cases in my area of people who are being evicted from homeless accommodation because of their incomes.  They are working and trying to get themselves out of that situation and their work takes their income over the income threshold but they still cannot afford anywhere to live.  They are being threatened with homelessness from homeless accommodation.  It beggars belief but that is where we have gotten to because of the refusal to raise the income thresholds.  That is a deliberate strategy.  In responses to parliamentary questions about this, the Minister uses a coded phrase about targeting social housing at the most vulnerable and those most in need.  That is code for saying we are only going to make social housing available to people on the lowest incomes from now on, as opposed to historically when social housing was made available to a very broad spectrum of working people.  Now, the income thresholds are such that it is available only to the people on the absolute lowest incomes.  That is deliberate and the Government's plan is to replace the historic provision of social housing with cost rental accommodation.</p> <p> Cost rental is better than the open market but it is still not anywhere near as good as social housing, where the rent is a fixed proportion of people's income, which is manageable and adjusts according to their income rising.  The rent in cost rental accommodation is linked to the cost of building the house and is therefore more expensive.  The first cost rental homes that have been delivered in my area cost &euro;1,200 a month.  That is cheaper than the average of &euro;2,200 but still shockingly expensive and completely unaffordable for huge numbers of people who are now no longer eligible for social housing because their income is over the limit.  However, they still cannot afford &euro;1,200 a month.  I know a council worker who was knocked off the housing list.  He is an outdoor worker on low wages and he was knocked off the list because he did semi-permanent overtime on a Saturday, which he could not get out of.  That knocked him off the list.  He had been on it for ten years.  I rang him when the cost rental scheme came up on Enniskerry Road and I said this might work for him.  I was thinking in my head that &euro;1,200 did not sound too bad compared to &euro;2,200 but he said I must be joking.  He said he could not afford &euro;1,200 on his income, and he asked if I was I kidding him.  He explained what his wages were as a council worker.  Cost rental is not good enough.  We need to set rents at levels that are affordable, based on the income of average and low-paid workers and we need the State to directly provide much of that because the private rented for-profit sector is incapacble of delivering it.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.354" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1574" speakername="Francis Noel Duffy" time="14:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300039#PP00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for bringing forward this Bill.  A crucial provision of the Bill is the introduction of indefinite tenures, which is a Green Party policy and a commitment we secured in the programme for Government.  However, in a recent discussion with Father Peter McVerry, he had a very clear and frank message for us legislators, which is that we have to be far more radical than we are being in order to solve the crisis.  He said we have to value housing as a fundamental right like the rights to education and healthcare.  I therefore look forward to the progress on the referendum on a right to housing, which is a commitment of the Green Party that my Government colleagues support and we will work together to achieve it.  I am, however, concerned about the fact that the referendum is ninth and last in the terms of reference of the commission on housing, which suggests it has the lowest priority.  I urge the Minister to raise this with the commission.  It should be one of the first, if not the very first, priority of the commission, considering its significance and the time a referendum will take to progress.</p>  <p>  On the Bill, there are a number of amendments that could strengthen its provisions, including a very minor but significant one that would ensure the relevant local authority, as well as the RTB, is informed of termination notices to tenants.  This amendment would ensure early interventions if there was a risk of homelessness, and is supported by the Simon Community.  I strongly urge the Minister of State to consider it.  Another amendment we in the Green Party feel ties into homelessness prevention and would strengthen rental protection is the introduction of a 90-day notice period when a landlord ends a tenancy of less than six months.  It is also critical that we end sale of a property as a reason to end a lease.  Similar to the protection of leases in commercial properties and other jurisdictions, leases must be secured and tenants need to be protected.  If this is not addressed in this legislation, I intend to pursue the matter to see if we can introduce something on it going forward.</p>  <p>  A quick solution that would stabilise the rental market and reduce rents, as well as reduce the State's expenditure and the reliance on HAP, would be the introduction of a temporary tax suspension on rental income.  Landlords are typically paying about 40% on rental income, which the State could instead suspend and thus reduce rents by that same percentage.  Not only would this reduce the exorbitant rents that are crippling families without impacting the landlord's income, it would also save the State money on the &euro;700 million rent assistance bill that is being paid into the private market at the moment on HAP.</p>  <p>  This Government, according to Green Party policy, has legislated for cost rental accommodation, where the rent is based on the construction cost of a home and is up to 50% lower than average rental prices.  We have moved this model from 50 units in existence in this State to 2,000 units a year.  That is the starting point in the establishment of this affordable housing model.</p></speech>

The rent pressure zones failed, as will this legislation.  It is almost as if it is legislation for a situation that is not as dysfunctional as the one with which we are dealing.  RPZs failed to deliver on 4%; the Minister is now talking about 2%.  We do not see the Bill delivering on that, but if we are talking about 2%, why are we not talking about 0%?  We also need to talk about putting money back into people's pockets.  Our option is the only one at this time, that being, a refundable tax credit worth up to a month's rent.  Everything we are discussing will take in or around three years to do due to the dysfunctional and brutal situation with which people are dealing.</p><p>By now, we each have a single transferable speech on housing.  In terms of rentals, for example, I could speak about <i>daft.ie</i>and more than &euro;1,300 per month for a rental.  I could say that there are multiple examples of regular houses in Dundalk that people are incredibly lucky to get for &euro;1,000 per month.  I have seen too many examples of &euro;1,400, &euro;1,600 and &euro;1,800 per month.  The situation is not getting better and what is being done now is not what is needed.</p><p>We all know the supply issues and we know that we need to discuss movement on actually affordable mortgages, cost-rental and social housing.  I accept that there are difficulties, but it cannot be beyond the Government to deliver solutions.  It has been done many times throughout the State's history.</p><p>Many Deputies accept that the RTB will not have the teeth to do even the limited amount desired under this legislation.  We know that there are significant issues with the state of some rentals.  We also know that we need to examine the entire rental sector in the context of the major tax breaks for large institutional investors and the departure of a large number of accidental landlords and others.  The system does not work in any way, shape or form.</p><p>I accept that we need to deal with the issue of estate management.  There are chaotic tenants.  Councils and those who live in council areas suffer particularly in this regard.  A significant suite of supports need to be introduced.</p><p>I reiterate the comments on the new mechanism for assessing people's right to be on the housing list.  It is removing a large number of people from the list who had previously been able to avail of it.  People are losing five to ten years on the housing list.  This is not good enough.  I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, about this issue.  I would like to have a follow-up conversation with officials.  We need movement on the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.356" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1504" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="15:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300040#QQ00200"><p>I wonder whether the Minister got lost on his way to this debate or did not have it in his diary.  Is it not the case that Opposition parties like mine should be listened to by the senior Minister on debates as important as this one?  In most debates in the House, the Minister is typically gone by the time the Regional Group gets to speak.  That is a pity, as we can all learn from one another.</p>  <p>  Ireland is in the midst of one of the worst housing crises in the history of the State, one that has spanned more than a decade.  One would not know that from the Government's response, though.  There are approximately 1 million people in housing distress.  They are either grappling with spiralling rents, on housing waiting lists or being outpriced in respect of rents and mortgages.  People still come to my office who are in mortgage distress and who are the collateral damage of the previous housing crisis.  They are still trying to navigate their way through the courts system.</p>  <p>  In practically every action that the Government has taken in the housing crisis, it has been pulled kicking and screaming into making those interventions.  Even where it does, it does so in the smallest way possible.  It must then intervene again and again.  Interestingly, we have probably had three or four Acts on rent in my time in the D&aacute;il.  This is the third Bill coming from a Fine Gael Government and supported by Fianna F&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  The rental crisis is unprecedented.  Rents in my county of Meath have doubled in the past 18 months.  I am sure they have also doubled in the Ceann Comhairle's county of Kildare.  The average rent in Meath is &euro;1,473 per month.  That is approximately &euro;17,676 per year.  Let us think about that for a second.  For a person on the minimum wage, this would make the average rent 100% of his or her post-tax income and 90% of his or her pre-tax income.  This means that we are saying, "Tough luck", to a section of society that is working 40 hours per week and that the average house is not available to such workers in that county.</p>  <p>  We are seeing a wave of people moving from east to west.  I am sure that Deputy Durkan has witnessed it himself.  We have people coming to us who left Dublin four or five years ago.  They moved to Ashbourne to access rents that were affordable.  They then moved to Navan, then Kells and are now living in Virginia.  They are surfing a wave of affordability westward just to be able to stay in a house.  Each time, they are taking their kids out of school so that they can move again.  This is having a significant impact on those individuals.</p>  <p>  The median wage is &euro;36,000 and it takes a long time to reach.  Young people who have just started work will still be nowhere near it after five, six or seven years.  In County Meath, rent swallows up 64% of after-tax income for a person on the median wage.  This means that he or she has just 36% of his or her income left to spend on everything else.  That is incredible.  This is on the back of rising electricity, fuel, insurance and childcare costs as well as other monthly bills.  It is outrageous that the Government has created in this State a whole section of society that is earning right up to the average wage for whom affordability in terms of renting houses is out of reach.</p>  <p>  In Dublin, the situation is even crazier, with rents of up to &euro;2,000 a month.  I looked at a studio apartment, and by "studio apartment", I mean "bedsit".  It was one room and everything was in it.  It is renting now for &euro;1,200 per month.  In rent pressure zone towns such as Maynooth, the same is true.  The average rent is &euro;200 more there than it is in the rest of the country, making it unaffordable to students who are now staying in hotels and guest houses to access their universities.</p>  <p>  The Government's response has been to come back to the well of rent controls three separate times.  If someone has to do something three times, it shows that there was a lack of ability the first two times, whatever about making a mistake the first time.  It is incredible that this is the third occasion of going to the well of rent caps.  The situation is undoubtedly at emergency level and Aont&uacute; is calling for a rent freeze to protect renters and ensure that they can hold onto their current standards of living and will not be pushed out of their homes and made homeless.</p>  <p>  I wish to discuss a few of the causes of the disaster of rent costs.  For us, vacant houses are one of the most frustrating elements of the housing crisis.  The CSO stated that there were 180,000 empty homes.  An Post reckons that there are approximately 90,000 vacant homes.  When I submit a question to the Minister asking how many vacant homes there are today, he refers to the CSO figure, which is nearly five years out of date.  It is incredible that the Government cannot even measure the scale of the difficulty in terms of vacant homes.  It is incredible if there are 90,000 vacant homes when there are tens of thousands of people on housing waiting lists.  The number of vacant homes in Meath is exactly the same as the number of people on the housing waiting list there.  This is so crazy you could not make it up.</p> <p>In the North of Ireland, the Aont&uacute; deputy leader, Denise Mullen, tabled a question and she was able to discover the number of vacant sites in 2021 across the North, broken down by county, town and city.  They are able to measure the problem in order to deal with the problem.  There is an old management saying, which is that if you cannot measure, you cannot manage.  That is certainly true of the Government.<br/><br/>What was the Government's response to the number of vacant homes?  The Government introduced a vacant site levy some years ago to deal with a part of the problem.  Last year, the tax brought in &euro;21,000.  It cost more for the Government to draft the Bill than it took in in a full year last year.  Now, the Government has replaced it with a zoned land tax, which will not be introduced for another two to three years and which is lower than the previous rate of 7%.  That begs the question of how the Government cannot see the urgency of the crisis that is front of it.  There is a chasm between the Government and the experience of the people.  It is incredible how out of touch the Government is with the experience of people when it comes to homes.<br/><br/>I wish to speak briefly about another component of the crisis, namely, real estate investment trusts, REITs.  The Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael market has been pitting REITs against families on a daily basis in a David versus Goliath battle where there can only be one winner.  Because of the battle, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have created a tenant class in this country the likes of which has not been seen since the landlord times.  This housing policy gives a blank cheque to international investors to purchase homes.  First, international investors are getting credit at very low costs.  Second, they have massive funds.  Third, they are getting taxed hardly anything in this State.  Let us compare that to a first-time buyer with a young family, who are being charged some of the most expensive interest rates in the European Union, who are limited with regard to the credit they can access, plus they are paying tax at the highest level.  The Government is creating an imbalance and an unfair competitive advantage for REITs to be able to wipe out families that want to buy homes.  We, in Aont&uacute;, have created a Bill that would level the playing field.  It would take the tax advantages away from REITs, which does not delete them from the sector, because they have some role to play, but it takes the advantages away so that young families can compete against REITs in the purchase of homes in this country.  The legislation is just lying there, and I urge the Government to help to get it through.<br/><br/>The Government's system is incredibly slow.  The Oscar Traynor Road site that was up for discussion at council level in recent weeks brings to light a number of important issues in the Government's approach.  It took eight years to take the plan from concept to decision-making at the council.  It will take another four years for those homes to be built.  That is 12 years in total from concept to turning the key in those homes in the middle of a national housing crisis.  Does the Minister of State think there is something wrong with that?  Does he think that is acceptable?  Does he stand over that happening within this country?<br/><br/>A number of other issues also arise in this regard.  The council states that one of the reasons it outsourced the building of the homes to Glenveagh is it did not think it would be able to get the capital necessary to build them.  Why is that the case?  It may be because the Government is not providing the capital, or it may be because of EU laws.  It is important to highlight the role of the EU in this as well.  The EU prevents this country gaining the necessary capital it needs, through lending, to invest in the building of homes in a national housing crisis.  That is an incredible situation for a sovereign country to be in.  It is wrong.  It is overreach by the EU.<br/><br/>The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, was asked a question about the EU fiscal rules in June by Christina Finn from <i>thejournal.ie</i>.  He was asked if he was going to sort this out and he said: &quot;There's certainly an argument for that&quot;.  He said he was dealing with his European colleagues on a regular basis on that specific point.  He got the ball and he literally pucked it out of the field.  He had no real interest on focusing on this issue.  His attitude was that the Government would do something about it, but the question was not answered properly.  The Government must go to the EU.  In the same way that there is a relaxation on investment because of Covid, there must be a relaxation on investment rules because of housing.  If the Government does not do that, if it stands over the <i>status quo</i>, it is responsible for it as well.<br/><br/>I wish to raise another issue in connection with the Oscar Traynor site.  The council stated that it would build units at &euro;444,000 per unit.  Glenveagh said it would build the units at &euro;370,000 per unit.  That is a differential of &euro;74,000.  What is the reason for a local authority building a housing unit for &euro;74,000 more than a private developer?  What part of the supply chain and the construction space is more expensive for the local authority than it is for Glenveagh?  In Aont&uacute;, we believe in a mixed economy.  We believe both the public sector and the private sector have significant jobs to do with regard to housing.  We cannot fix the housing crisis without good public delivery and without a good private sector.  Unlike many of the parties to my left, who focus just on the public sector, we also believe there must be a good private sector.  However, there is a major problem in the State if it costs local authorities &euro;74,000 extra to build a housing unit, and that must be addressed.<br/><br/>Another issue I wish to briefly raise is short-term lets or the Airbnb sector.  It is fascinating.  Covid has offered a scientific, economic experiment on housing in this country.  In March and April 2020, there was a significant increase in the number of rental accommodation units in the State.  All of a sudden, the number of homes available to rent in the State increased by 40%.  There was a particular spike in accommodation available in Dublin during those months.  That spike led to a big decrease in the cost of rental accommodation, especially in Dublin.  Why did that happen?  It is very obvious that when Covid arrived, the short-term rental space dried up and people were not renting Airbnb accommodation in this State.  Those landlords had to repurpose those buildings and put them back into long-term lets and they came back into use.<br/><br/>If we flip the coin to October 2021, people will recall the <i>daft.ie</i>report showed that there was an unprecedented shortage in the availability of homes across the country.  There were 1,400 homes in total to rent in the State, with approximately 800 of those in Dublin.  In some counties, fewer homes were available to rent than would fit on the palm of my left hand.  It happened suddenly because the tourism economy opened again and landlords repurposed those homes back into short-term lets because they can make &euro;250,000 a year out of one home on a short-term let basis compared to perhaps &euro;20,000 on a long-term let.  If they are flipping the property night-by-night on a short-term let, they can make up to &euro;250,000.  Of course, landlords are going to take that option if it is available to them.  What it means is that there is a radical reduction in the level of rental properties in the State, which hits families hard.  Again, the Government has done little or nothing about that.  I say to the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, that it is an incredible situation that under the Government, right now tourists stay in homes and families stay in hotels.  That is the mixed-up, muddled world we live in.  The Government has created a distorted market in housing.<br/><br/>We, in Aont&uacute;, have produced a temporary Bill for three to five years to prohibit short-term lets of non-principal private residences in towns or cities with a population of more than 10,000.  Overnight, that would take thousands of houses out of the short-term let sector and put them back into the long-term let sector.  That would make them available to families and reduce the cost of rent.  I urge the Minister of State to take that on board.<br/><br/>In my remaining time I wish to speak about the mica crisis and the impact it will have on rents, especially in the Donegal area.  All of a sudden, we will have many families who will be put out of their crumbling homes and who will have to seek rental accommodation.  We are going to see a difficulty arise in that regard.</p> <p>I attended the marches in Dublin last July.  It was a wonderful expression of people power.  People were leaving Donegal at 6 a.m. to be in Dublin in their thousands.  They very clearly stated that they wanted 100% redress for their families.  The Government said it would fulfil that request but, in a sleight of hand, the Government has looked to produce a plan which is nowhere near 100% redress at all.  It has put a cap of &euro;420,000 and created a sliding scale on the square footage, which means the mica redress scheme cannot achieve 100% redress for many people.  In many cases, the Government's plan will prevent families from rebuilding their homes as many will not be able to tap the &euro;30,000, &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 they will need to build them.</p> <p> True to form, the Government produced a plan that is less than what is necessary but, true to form also, the Government is now actively considering how to plan the U-turn on this issue.  We need only listen to the Government at the moment, and I have mentioned that the Government has reached peak confusion and that this is the confusion coalition.  We listen to all of the different voices coming out from the Government, where the Minister, Deputy Charlie McConalogue, says he fully backs the mica proposal, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, says it may need some work, and the Taoiseach says all the costs will not be borne by the mica homeowners and that these figures have been plucked from the air, while Deputies Joe Carey and Joe McHugh are still trying to make up their minds on supporting the scheme at all.</p> <p> Surely, if a person gets 100% redress for pyrite in Dublin, a person from counties Donegal, Mayo or Sligo is entitled to 100% redress.  We have to ask ourselves why is it they are entitled to 100% redress.  It is because Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael created a light-touch regulation system for decades in this country.  They allowed cowboys to create building materials that were below what was necessary for them to function properly.  I remember Bertie Ahern going internationally and selling Ireland as a light-touch regulation destination.  We had systems in County Donegal where the Government did not protect the homeowners, where the insurance companies did not protect the homeowners, where the quarry owners did not protect the homeowners and where the manufacturers of building materials did not protect the homeowners.  As a result, we have thousands of families who are stuffed.  If, on the one hand, the Government will not live up to its responsibilities and duty of care to make sure that the building materials are of 100% quality, then, on the other, it needs to provide 100% redress.</p> <p> It is heartbreaking to see that the Donegal families are still no nearer their destination with regard to fixing this and that they still have work to do.  For the families who are listening to the storm winds swirling around their broken walls, I urge the Minister of State to make sure the Government fulfils its responsibilities in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.359" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1508" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="15:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300042#SS00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  As the Minister of State and everyone around the country knows, even in areas where there was never a problem with rents, it is becoming a problem.  Even in small towns where three, four or five years ago there was not a problem, it is now a problem to get a house.  Thankfully, we see some families moving to such areas, which is welcome.  However, that is putting on added pressure because there are not enough houses.</p>  <p>  We have seen projects in the councils where, for one reason or another, not enough power was put behind them, such as at Oscar Traynor Road, which was to be done, and done again, but it keeps being put off.  I am not blaming the Minister of State.  I remember that, eight or ten years ago, one Minister got all the councillors together and it still fell back.</p>  <p>  There is one solution to rent and RPZs, and that is to get houses built.  The Minister of State will be familiar with the current situation where there could be projects for 12,000 or 13,000 houses caught up in the courts due to people objecting, which is a major problem.  Some of this has to be fizzled out.  Everyone now thinks they can shoot to the courts and basically block whatever housing is coming near their area.  Everything is granted so long as it in someone else's area but not at my back door.  Some of the decisions I have seen would cause anyone to raise an eyebrow.  There might be some wording left out in some bit of a document and the whole housing plan would still be held up.  The other part is that it takes bodies like An Bord Plean&aacute;la so long that we would wonder if anyone at all is working there at the moment.  The Galway outer bypass has been before the board for I do not know how many years; someone is looking at it but, every month, it is kicked down the road.  It is the same in housing.</p>  <p>  One thing we need to do is to call a housing emergency, put legislation through, get the stuff built that we need to get built, and get it done rapidly.  There is another thing we need to do for renters and for families.  If people are on &euro;30,000, or &euro;26,000 to &euro;27,000 in County Galway, they are not eligible for social housing but they cannot afford a house.  However, if they are in Dublin, the limit is &euro;35,000.  That is saying that someone in Dublin can earn more money and still be entitled to a house whereas, in counties Galway and Roscommon, or maybe County Kildare for that matter, the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s area, they would not be entitled to it.  There needs to be a bit of levelling off.  A house is a house, and people earn what they earn, no matter where they are.  The days where this is acceptable are gone.  There are parts of County Galway where a house is as dear as parts of Dublin, unfortunately, for the people trying to buy them or rent them.  The Department needs to look at the eligibility criteria.</p>  <p>  Given what we are doing at the moment, those in middle Ireland who are going out to work every day are being pushed out of being able to rent a house or, further down the road, afford a house.  At one time, a nurse and a garda, no matter where they were in the country, were able to afford a house, but they would want mummy and daddy to give them a bit of a pot to be able to afford a house now.  That society will not continue because that society is not sustainable.</p>  <p>  The one thing we need to do is make sure we drive the number of houses on, which will solve the whole rental problem.  It is like anything else.  If someone has a heap of cattle, the factories will make sure they do not get much of a price, but if the person has damn all, the price will go up.  That is a very simple analogy.</p>  <p>  There is a huge opportunity in this regard.  In many rural areas, there are old two-storey houses that were built of stone and many of them vacant, but we are not giving any incentives to people.  Where people are eligible for HAP, for example, they could be given extra money to do up a house and, for the time being, we would be taking someone off a list.</p>  <p>  Another issue is that some people have this idea that mummy and daddy are over the road so they are entitled to a house right beside them.  We need to bring in a system where, if a person is prepared to go somewhere up or down the country, regardless of where they are from, and to take a house for the time being, they would get moved up the list a bit after a year or two.  That would give an incentive.  It is done in England.  I have been saying this for a long time but no one in the Department seems to want to listen.</p>  <p>  To go back to the issue of houses in rural areas, there is one worrying aspect.  To be fair, the Minister of State is from a rural area and I ask him to make sure he keeps an eye on this.  The new county development plans are coming out in many counties at the moment.  I see that, for Galway, there are to be 945 one-off houses over a five-year period.  In my opinion, given the size of Galway, the second-biggest county in Ireland, that is curtailing building.  What do we want?  Do we want a person to build a house there or do we want them to go and put more pressure on the rental sector?  There are a lot of different avenues that we need to look at in this regard.</p> <p>The other side to it is that the Minister of State's Department and the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science must work together.  With the establishment of the new technological universities, some of them should grasp the opportunity and show a bit of entrepreneurship.  They should not sit on their hands.  Many of them have a lot of land and they need to go out to the market and get the funding.  They can do that because they have a sure bet.  They are sure they will have students every year and sure of getting rent, which must be set at an affordable price as well.  There is an opportunity there, but the question that might be asked then is what that point has got to do with this issue.  The answer is that every student living on campus or in accommodation beside a college, for those institutions that have land, takes pressure off some other part of a city or large town where someone else might need a house.  We must consider this side of things as well to ensure that we facilitate it. </p> <p> I am not going to stay talking all day, another minute or two will do because Deputy Durkan wants to contribute as well, but I ask the Minister of State to examine aspects such as the rural issue that I am on about.  We have a regulator that seems to be looking in on what every council is doing.  We are in an emergency and I do not understand why anyone would say to Galway County Council, or any other county council for that matter, that it can only put such a quota on the rural one-off housing allowed in a county.  For the next five to ten years, every house we can build in this country is a problem solved for some family.  It could also help to solve a problem in an area where there is ferocious pressure on housing now by reducing that as well, such as in the big cities where people are paying astronomical rents.</p> <p> We can bring in all the Bills in the world that we want, but that will do no good if we do not do things that are the low-hanging fruit in this area, such as allowing houses to be built in the countryside, renovating older houses lying idle in many areas and basically driving on the whole planning side of things so that it becomes a less complicated process.  Unfortunately, the planning system depends an awful lot on what county people are living in.  I will comment on one council now, and this is factual.  If people bought a house in Wicklow or Kerry years ago, lived there for a while and then sold that house to return home to take up farming or whatever, those people will not be approved for planning permission because they owned a house previously.  That is some set-up in a council.  The planners doing that seem to have a total disregard for circumstances.  People will hardly drive from Kerry to go to look at sheep lambing or cows calving in another county.  Those people are not coming home to build a house for the craic.</p> <p> There needs to be some accountability.  In some planning authorities there does not seem to be any.  It is possible to see in one county, and they are all going by the book and let no one say that any of them are different, stipulations concerning how to go about resolving issues, but then another planning authority will tell people to forget about it, head out the door and good luck.  If we maintain attitudes like that, then we are going to stop people and disgust them.  We will then have more debates here about housing.  This is about my 100th debate on housing and we still have the same common denominators arising for the simple reason that we are not building enough houses.  The planning system also needs a major overhaul.</p> <p> In addition, we must reconsider this idea of telling someone in a rural area that they must show they are from there and that they are going to be going farming or doing X, Y and Z.  I am not saying that every Tom, Dick and Harry should be able to come into the countryside to build, but let us take the example of someone who owned a house when he or she was younger, perhaps after going to college and then working in another county, in Kerry, for example.  If that person then decides that he or she wants to come to the west or the east of the country, and because that person is honest enough to say that he or she had previously owned a house and then sold it because he or she does not want to be driving 200 miles, the planning authority will tell the person that it is not possible to build because of the provisions of the county development plan.  Whenever there is a situation where that is the case, the Minister must move in and start to redress the situation.</p></speech>

However, I agree entirely with the opinions expressed by my colleague just a few minutes ago.  It is sad.  We have had many debates on this subject and we still do not seem to be able to break through the glass wall.  We know what should happen.  We all talk about it.  Yet we do not seem to make it happen.  With no disrespect meant, the Opposition makes its contribution as well.  It seems to be on the same track.  I am sorry that Deputy Boyd Barrett is not in the House now.  He understands this issue as well and he agrees, but of course he has a different way of going about it because he has the disadvantage of trying to further the cause of People Before Profit.  Those of us who are longer on this earth know that those who operate on that basis will get plenty of work, but they are not going to get too many jobs to do on which loads of people will be paid.  Likewise, with Sinn F&eacute;in.  Its members understand the situation.  They tend to politicise this issue to a greater extent and that is grand for those in opposition.  At some stage, however, the party may be called upon to resolve the problem at the coalface and then it becomes a serious problem.  That applies to all those Deputies who operate on a purely political basis from an opposition point of view.</p>  <p>  I agree with many of the criticisms made, however.  I and the Ceann Comhairle have come through periods where this kind of issue featured on many occasions, for example, in the 1970s, the 1980s, the 1990s and the 2000s.  It looks now as if we will have to go through it again.  That is as it is.  We had the economic crash and that seriously derailed the ways and means of having a short-term resolution.  By the same token, whatever happens from here on in must happen in real time, because the public will not allow, accept or countenance a long-drawn out situation regarding discussion of the whys and wherefores of what will happen if we do this or that.</p>  <p>  Let us look at the situation in this way.  An Teachta T&oacute;ib&iacute;n mentioned something about it taking eight years to make a decision about a development.  That is not a farce, it is true.  It takes that long.  It is a farce, however, insofar as the people waiting on the outcome are concerned.  It is an absolute atrocity that this kind of thing should happen.  Regarding the time it takes to do any of these jobs, it should be around two months.  It is as simple as that.  If it cannot be done in two months, then we should facilitate the public by saying that it will go up for tender and let us do it in that way.  Either we can do it or we cannot do it, in which case we should admit that it cannot be done.</p>  <p>  I seldom raise an objection to housing and I know the Ceann Comhairle is the same.  If I do raise an objection to housing, then that is to tweak, relocate or shift the boundaries of that housing project, or whatever the case may be.  Of course, this kind of coverage can be abused as well.  For example, some time ago I saw somebody&rsquo;s window looking into the back garden of somebody else&rsquo;s house.  Something like that is not supposed to happen in the planning process, as we all know.  We were all told about what constitutes good planning.  At this stage, we know what good planning is and what it is not.</p>  <p>  I also came across a recent situation concerning a health facility.  There was nothing wrong with it otherwise.  It was a fine facility.  Based on it being a health facility, though, all of a sudden the local authority and everybody else seemed to feel that it should get a walk through or a walk over regarding planning permission.  This is in the self same area where the local people who have lived there all their lives, the indigenous population, are being refused planning permission left, right and centre.  When people start to talk to me about this issue, the aspects to be considered on the one hand and on the other and then tell me that I do not understand that this is an important issue and all that kind of thing, I then ask those people if they would accept such a situation.  I ask them if they would accept somebody building a block of houses at the back of their houses that overlook their garden walls and if they would be happy about that.  The answer will probably be something along the lines that the people involved do not really live in the area, but 20 miles away.  Of course, we know all about that.</p>  <p>  Therefore, we need a long debate about this issue.  The stilted kind of debate that we get in this type of situation is not sufficient.  That is not the fault of the Minister or the Minister of State.  I know they understand this issue and are manacled in the same way we are.</p> <p>We must assert ourselves as elected representatives who say this is the way it is supposed to happen and this is what it states in the legislation.  We must ask if people have a problem, and if they do, they should step forward so we can try to resolve it.</p> <p> I could go on, as I know the Ceann Comhairle could.  It must be very frustrating for him to sit there and not have the opportunity to speak on the matter.  We have spoken about this many times in the past on the local authority and in this House as well.  The improvements applying to the work of the Residential Tenancies Board are fine.  Not all landlords are abusive of their tenants.  There is a cohort of landlords who have accommodated tenants and provided special arrangements, as if the tenant were a family member.  They continue to do that but do not ever get credit for it.  They are moving out of the system, replaced by people with just one characteristic in common.  This is where the ideas of Deputy Boyd Barrett come in, as such parties only have profit in mind.  They should not have unlimited profit and that is the point.  We have a position being reached where profit is stopping others from getting into the system.</p> <p> I had somebody in touch with me today seeking what used to be called a local authority loan under the 1966 Act.  That person has &euro;100,000 saved but has no chance of getting the required loan.  It is crazy stuff.  The Rebuilding Ireland loan or what used to be the local authority loan must be brought together in such a way as to deal with such a person not in six months or six years but in a couple of weeks.  We must facilitate such people not because they have been refused by the banks; they should not have to wait for that.  The individual circumstances should be examined with a view to ensuring the requests can be met in the shortest time possible.</p> <p> I know the Minister of State understands the matter and we have spoken about it already as well.  There must be a crowd of people somewhere laughing at us, knowing we cannot break through that glass wall.  For once in our political lives, we should identify this problem, which relates to taxation and affects wages and incomes all over the country.  It is a reason people do not want to come to this country to fill the jobs being offered to them.  That is crazy.  The Ceann Comhairle and I know of cases of people leaving this country because they did not have a house and wanted to get one somewhere else.</p> <p> I apologise for going on for so long.  My request is for us to have a real no-holds barred debate on the matter.  Let us deal with it once and for all.  Some people somewhere must think we are fools and it is about time we asserted ourselves.</p></speech>

It is interesting that a number of Deputies said the legislation was meaningless and would not serve its intended purpose, and yet they were very clear they are voting for the Bill.  At the outset that seems very strange.</p>  <p>  I refer specifically to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's comments on the number of Bills we have introduced to protect renters, which I referenced in my opening statement.  I indicated this has happened six times in the Thirty-third D&aacute;il during the pandemic.  The Deputy implied I was boasting about those Bills but I absolutely was not.  I made it very clear in my statement why the previous Bill, introduced in July and which linked rental increases to inflation, did not work.  I outlined the reasons for that.  We are trying to respond to this so we can keep people in their homes and rents as stable as we can in what is a very challenging environment of the Covid-19 pandemic.  Responding to those challenges is the Department's sole focus with these pieces of legislation.</p>  <p>  I have been very clear in the past in outlining in this House the dysfunctional nature of the rental market.  I am also very clear in my mind as somebody who attends a very busy clinic in my constituency office on a weekly basis, listening to very vulnerable people who are at their wits' end and concerned about rental increases, the availability of rental properties and, critically, their future access to sustainable housing.  It is something that weighs heavily on me and the Government.</p>  <p>  People come to this House to read emails and give details of very vulnerable constituents, and we all meet such people.  Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; referenced the "single transferable speech" and it is the first time I have heard Sinn F&eacute;in refer to that single transferable speech that its Members read in this House.  I would like to talk about the single transferable response we have seen from Sinn F&eacute;in.  In the first instance, this is an ideology of objecting to housing.  For example, a number of Deputies referred to the 854 units on Oscar Traynor Road but nobody referred to the political actions surrounding it.  The development has four parks and is a mix of social, affordable and private housing of mixed tenure, which is best for society.  It will have a community centre and childcare facilities all in one footprint.  That was objected to by Sinn F&eacute;in.  A second example is Ballymastone, where 1,200 houses were objected to by Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>  <p>  This is the nub of the matter and it proves that Sinn F&eacute;in wants the housing crisis to escalate.  We are always told in this D&aacute;il Chamber we should have public houses on public land.  Sinn F&eacute;in had a chance in Wicklow to vote for public houses on public land but those 18 public houses on public land were voted down by Sinn F&eacute;in.  The view of Sinn F&eacute;in and the Social Democrats is that any additional residential development is overdevelopment, or at least that is what they indicate in submissions when they object to such projects.  Sinn F&eacute;in has voted down development in local authorities and its response seems to be to object, object, object.</p>  <p>  I can see, as part of the Government, that the solution to increasing rents and this crisis is an increase in supply.  In any market where demand significantly outstrips supply, prices will go up.  The sole primary response must be to increase our housing units.  The last thing we need is Deputies constantly objecting to that while coming to this House trying to tell us they have a monopoly on compassion or how to represent vulnerable people in society.  We in the Government benches meet every day of the week trying to help such people, but those in the Opposition continue to vote against public houses on public land.  Those are the facts.</p>  <p>  I have heard people trying to eulogise about the great responses Deputy &Oacute; Broin would have if he had the honour of becoming the next housing Minister.  In Sinn F&eacute;in's 2016 manifesto, the party clearly stated it would build 36,000 houses between 2016 and 2021.  The Government delivered 39,000 houses a year earlier, by 2020.  What Deputy &Oacute; Broin may have delivered as a housing Minister is much less than what people got from the previous Government.  Hearing such comments, I ask people to consider the facts and see what the parties can deliver.  The Opposition can deliver one thing, which is objection after objection.</p>  <p>  Another interesting aspect of the debate concerns why so many landlords are exiting the market, with 16,000 doing so since 2016.  Of those, 85% had two or fewer properties and 75% had only one property.  We need a sustainable number of landlords in the market.  Nonetheless, in its pre-budget submission Sinn F&eacute;in proposed an additional tax of &euro;400 on second units.  All the landlords trying to hold on with one property would face additional taxation with Sinn F&eacute;in's policy.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin has said he does not know why they are leaving and surveys or data are being considered, but what is clear is we need a sustainable rental market.  It is critical.  It is what we are achieving with our cost rental model, which offers below-market rents and sustainable tenure through the &euro;4 billion multi-annual budget in the Department.  That is a record level of investment and the multi-annual element is important.</p> <p>Deputy Fitzmaurice spoke on one-off rural housing.  Being from a very large rural constituency, I know the importance of one-off rural housing.  There was a failure to acknowledge and understand the demand for one-off rural housing as a sustainable form of housing.  The reality is that people in rural areas have businesses such as agriculture, farming and large employers such as those in my area.  There is Green Farm Fine Foods in Rathowen, Mergon in Castlepollard, or C&amp;F in Collinstown.  All those are outside the main arteries like Mullingar or Athlone.  You need sustainable options for people like that.  We are updating the 2005 sustainable rural housing guidelines.  That will form part of our efforts to try to offer a sustainable alternative for people to have that right to build in rural areas and be part of their communities and keep local schools and shops open and enhance the GAA club.  That is what we really want - to try to build mixed communities.  As our housing increases, naturally it will be a smaller component.  When we are building fewer than 5,000 houses, rural housing was the majority but as we escalate past 33,000, as we will, we need to acknowledge, understand and permit rural housing in our rural areas.  We have to have a reasonable policy to allow that.  I articulated that over the summer.</p> <p> I am grateful to the Deputies who did give a response and put forward their views and to the joint committee for its quick examination of the legislation.  I look forward to working with all Deputies in the House on it next week.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.374" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1623" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="15:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300045#VV00400"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a second time".</p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to present the Health and Criminal Justice (Covid-19) (Amendment) (No.2) Bill 2021 to the House.  The purpose of this Bill is to extend the period of application of certain emergency provisions that have been key to the Government&rsquo;s response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  The emergency provisions that are to be extended include Part 3 of the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020; the Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Act 2020; Health (Amendment) Act 2020; and Part 2 of the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2021.</p>  <p>  The Bill that provides for the extension of the emergency provisions contained within these Acts until 31 March 2022, with the possibility of one further extension of a maximum period of three months, by way of resolution in both Houses of the Oireachtas, if warranted.</p>  <p>  The Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 was passed by the Oireachtas in March 2020, and the Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers) (Covid-19) Act 2020 was passed by the Oireachtas in September 2020.  These Acts were extended by way of resolution in October 2020.  The Health (Amendment) Act 2020 was passed by the Oireachtas in October 2020.  All three Acts were extended by the Health and Criminal Justice (Covid-19) (Amendment) Act 2021 in May of this year, and by resolution again in October.  The provisions of these Acts are due to expire on 9 February 2022. </p>  <p>  The Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2021 was passed by the Oireachtas in July this year.  It was extended by way of resolution in October, with its provisions due to expire on 9 January 2022. </p>  <p>  The legislative provisions contained within these Acts are essential to managing the spread of Covid-19 in our community.  Covid-19 cases remain high in Ireland and across most of Europe.  This is due to a combination of increased socialisation, the move indoors due to colder weather, evidence of waning immunity and the prevalence of the Delta variant.  We need to ensure that basic public health measures such as mask wearing, isolation when symptomatic, and social distancing continue in place and are being enforced.  We now also have a new variant, Omicron, of which much is still unknown, although scientists around the world are working hard to analyse the variant and try to understand its behaviour. </p>  <p>  When I came before this House in May seeking to extend the provisions of three of these Acts, I recognised the wide-ranging nature of these powers and that I, along with every Member of this House, wished that there was no need for their existence.  I would like to reiterate that sentiment now.  While it is extremely disappointing that Ireland, Europe and many countries around in the world find ourselves in this situation, we need to continue to provide for the making and enforcement of public health regulations.  As we have seen, the trajectory of this virus is ever evolving and the Government needs to be able to respond in a proportionate, rapid and flexible manner to protect public health, our health service, our most vulnerable and our front line workers.</p>  <p>  Over 5,500 people have lost their lives during this pandemic.  Over 5,500 families have lost someone they loved.  Many more are living with the impact of the disease both physically and mentally.  With the virus spreading at such high levels in the community and the recent emergence of the Omicron variant, we can unfortunately expect further hospitalisations and possible deaths in the coming weeks and months.  We can only imagine the trauma of families and communities affected and I extend my deepest sympathies to them.</p>  <p>  Ireland has endured a profound shock to its social and economic life as we deal with the impact of the virus at an individual, community and societal level.  It has had an impact on almost all aspects of our lives and, for many, their livelihoods, and continues to do so.  Our strategy to manage the adverse impacts of Covid has been guided by an evolving understanding of the disease and its emerging variants, the impacts of restrictions on health and well-being as well as other aspects of society and the economy.</p>  <p>  Members know that the trajectory of Covid-19 is uncertain.  In the last weeks, we have seen case numbers previously seen only in January this year.  The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in hospitals and ICU remain high while demand for testing is higher than it has been at any point in the pandemic and continues to increase.  The current level of Covid-19 infection is placing a very substantial additional burden on the delivery of non-Covid care across all aspects of the health service which is likely to increase over the course of the winter period.</p>  <p>  Our response is premised on the need to preserve and protect public health by slowing the spread of the virus, reducing its impact on us and limiting its impact on our society and economy.  That is why I believe that the public interest is best served by having the provisions in these Acts available if the situation requires them to be utilised for the protection of public health.</p>  <p>  The country remains vulnerable to a further deterioration depending on a number of factors, including levels of social contact in the coming weeks and over the festive period, adherence to basic public health protective measures, levels of immunity across the population and what we learn about the characteristics of the Omicron variant in terms of its transmissibility, severity, vaccine evasion, reinfection and more.  I ask that everyone prioritise the activities they undertake and limit activities in riskier environments including indoor crowded settings where distancing is difficult, that they take regular antigen tests if they are engaged in activities in riskier environments and hold off on visiting vulnerable people after undertaking these activities.</p> <p>Incidence is highest in those aged between five and 12 years of age, and it is recommended that families and young children prioritise discretionary activities and social contacts and the wearing of face masks and coverings for those aged nine years and over in certain settings.<br/><br/>The uptake of Covid-19 vaccinations in Ireland has been incredible.  I commend each and every person who has availed of the opportunity to be vaccinated.  There have been more than 8.3 million doses administered and over 91% of the eligible population, that is, everyone in our country aged 12 years and over, is now fully vaccinated.  I would like to emphasise that it is never too late for anyone to get vaccinated.  The people who have yet to decide to be vaccinated who choose to do so to protect themselves, everybody else and our health workers make a big difference.<br/><br/>We now know that there is a certain amount of waning immunity from vaccines after several months.  The profile depends on each of the vaccines.  This is why we are rolling out our booster programme, and I am happy to report it is moving apace.  In fact, it is moving at such a pace that when my speech was written, the figure for booster dose given was 878,000, and when I checked just before I got up to speak, it was in excess of 900,000, so it is moving fast.  I am referring to boosters and third doses for immunocompromised.  Critically, it includes many of our population most at risk, including people aged over 60 years, front-line healthcare workers, immunocompromised people and those living in nursing homes.  Those in age groups approved for boosters should take up their vaccine appointment as soon as it is offered and exercise more caution until they receive their booster.  I am delighted to be able to say the level of uptake for the cohorts to which it has been offered is very encouraging indeed.<br/><br/>As the booster campaign progresses, it is very important we all take steps to protect ourselves and those around us.  The public health message right now is to layer up those protections.  This includes acting fast, isolating and getting tested if we have symptoms, wearing a face covering where appropriate, making sure indoor spaces are well ventilated, maintaining social distancing whenever appropriate, covering our coughs and sneezes and hand hygiene.  These are measures we have all come to know very well.<br/><br/>I wish to address some of the concerns raised in debate by members of this House and the Seanad during passage of the Health and Criminal Justice (Covid-19)(Amendment) Act 2021 in May.  At that time, colleagues were concerned about the length of the extension to the measures, and others raised concerns about the multiple extensions provided for in the sunset clause in the draft of the Bill.  We had a very constructive debate and I agreed with many of the points being raised.  I accepted the concerns on the multiple extensions, so I sought Government agreement to amend the Act.  The Act we then passed was limited to one extension.  That, of course, is why we are here now, as that extension will come to an end.  The intention was that there would be a legislative process and this is exactly why we are here.  This Bill extends the provisions until the end of March 2022, from 9 January or 9 February depending on which of the Acts it was, with one further extension possible of three months, and that is it.  I believe the proposed length of time of the extension is proportionate and reasonable.  Given the environment we find ourselves in, it is necessary to protect public health.  While I sincerely hope there will be no need for a further extension beyond 31 March next year, as we all do, it is important to provide for this possibility.  However, I emphasise to colleagues the sunset clause allows for one extension which requires a resolution of both Houses and that single sunset clause can only be for three months.<br/><br/>The powers granted under these Acts are extraordinary, and the Houses provide an essential function in debating and evaluating their continued use.  During the passage of the Act earlier this year, and with the extensions made by way of resolution in the Oireachtas, the Houses carry out important checks on these powers.  In the interest of transparency, all regulations are posted online on <i>www.gov.ie</i>, all NPHET minutes and letters are published online, and information on Covid-19 at a national and local level is also published.  This includes cases, vaccines, hospitalisations and so forth.  These are all things Deputies will be very aware of.  Every regulation made under these Acts must be laid before both Houses as soon as possible after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either House within the subsequent 21 days, the regulation is annulled.  The introduction and continuation of public health measures are kept under constant review by Government.  Every Government decision on such measures is informed by public health advice and takes account of societal and economic concerns.<br/><br/>I will now outline some key provisions of the Bill in more detail.  The Bill is divided into five sections.  Section 1 amends section 2 of the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 to allow for an extension of the operation of Part 3 of the Act from 9 February 2022 to 31 March 2022, and to allow the provisions to be extended once, for a period of no more than three months, by way of resolution in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 inserted sections 31A, 31B and 38A into the Health Act 1947.  Section 31A provides for the making of regulations for preventing, limiting, minimising, or slowing the spread of Covid-19 and to deal with public health risks arising from the spread of Covid-19.  Any regulations made have been made in line with decisions of Government on public health measures.  The regulations have restricted events, movement, international travel, and the operation of businesses and services to varying degrees over the past 20 months.  Several regulations are still in place, such as the mandatory wearing of face coverings in certain settings, public health measures relatimng to international travel, and the closing of certain premises at midnight.  Section 31B allows the Minister for Health to make an &quot;affected area order&quot;.  The State as a whole has been deemed to be an &quot;affected area&quot; since 7 April 2020.  Section 38A provides for powers for certain medical officers of health to order, in certain circumstances, the detention of persons who are suspected to be potential sources of infection with Covid-19 and to provide for enforcement measures in that regard.<br/><br/>Sections 2, 3 and 4 provide for the same amendments and terms of extension for the Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers)(Covid-19) Act 2020, the Health (Amendment) Act 2020 and Part 2 of the Health (Amendment)(No. 2) Act 2021, respectively.  The Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers)(Covid-19) Act 2020 provides An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with statutory enforcement powers in relation to licensed premises and registered clubs, to ensure strict adherence to public health measures on premises where alcohol is sold for consumption on the premises.  It also provides a power of entry for the Garda in relation to the Covid-19 regulations.  The Act introduced a range of enforcement measures such as an immediate closure order for the rest of the day, an emergency closure order for up to three days, and a temporary closure order.  The first temporary closure order is for up to seven days, but this increases to up to 30 days for second or subsequent failures to comply.  The Act also provides for the issuance of a compliance notice and it sets out the grounds for objection to the renewal of a licence.  During the drafting of the Health and Criminal Justice (Covid-19)(Amendment) Act 2021 earlier this year, the Garda Commissioner advised that if the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Enforcement Powers)(Covid-19) Act 2020 were not extended, then members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would not have a clear lawful basis for entering a licensed premises to address breaches of the Covid-19 regulations.<br/><br/>The Health (Amendment) Act 2020 provides for the making of regulations to prescribe penal provisions in regulations made under section 31A of the Health Act 1947 to be fixed penalty provisions.  Fixed penalty provisions are currently in place in relation to the wearing of face coverings in certain settings.  Part 2 of the Health (Amendment)(No.2) Act 2021 provided for the reopening of indoor hospitality under certain conditions.  In essence, the Act gives effect to the Government's decision to enable access to relevant indoor premises for fully vaccinated persons and persons who have recovered from Covid-19, as well as certain children and staff.  The Act provides for a robust and enforceable system of verification as well as for powers of enforcement.<br/><br/>Section 5 provides for the Title of the Bill to be the Health and Criminal Justice (Covid-19)(Amendment)(No. 2) Act 2021, and that its provisions shall come into operation on 10 January 2022 for the Health (Amendment)(No. 2) Act 2021, and 10 February 2022 for the other three Acts.<br/><br/>The decision to extend these measures is not an easy one and I recognise there is disappointment we continue to need these powers.  We know that the use of vaccinations alone will not stop the spread of Covid-19 and so we must ensure there are other measures in place to protect public health.</p> <p>As a Government, we must now act to ensure we can continue to implement public health measures to limit the growth of the virus, especially in the face of the Delta and Omicron variants.  We are extending these measures to support our healthcare system and its workers, who have been working tirelessly on the front line for nearly two years.  We are extending these measures to ensure people can shop and work in supermarkets, pharmacies, shops and other settings with some degree of comfort, knowing that the wearing of face coverings is still mandatory and enforceable.  We are extending these measures to ensure that the use of Covid-19 vaccination certificates continues to be applicable in hospitality and entertainment settings, with the aim of keeping these establishments safe and open.</p> <p> While great strides have been made in combatting the virus, most notably through the excellent uptake of vaccinations, we are not out of this pandemic yet as recent events have clearly shown.  We expect the winter months ahead to be challenging in terms of the spread of the virus and the ongoing pressure on the health system.  It is essential that the Government has the option to continue the enforcement of public health measures in the coming months.  Through the combination of the roll-out of the booster shots, continued progress on antiviral treatments for Covid-19 and adherence to public health measures, we are aiming to reduce the spread of Covid-19 and are working towards the return to normal functioning of our economy and society.</p> <p> I very much welcome this opportunity to provide an overview of some of the key provisions in the Bill.  I look forward to discussing the Bill in more detail on Committee Stage and to listening to colleagues' contributions during this Second Stage debate.  I urge all members of the House to support this Bill and the continued use of public health measures to protect people from this dreadful disease, including our healthcare workers, other workers throughout the country, individuals and families, and to keep everybody safe. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.377" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="16:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300047#XX00200"><p>It is a very disappointing day for all of us for a number of reasons.  First, we are again being asked to keep on the Statute Book, and keep in use, emergency powers that we all hoped would be long gone.  It is equally disappointing because of the recommended changes that have come from NPHET, which the Government will have to decide on over the next number of hours and days.  I say that in the context of the public health advice, which is what it is, and my support for public health measures.  It is disappointing because many people will feel that we are going backwards even though we had such a major uptake of the vaccine during its roll-out and people have done their absolute best over the past, almost two years, to do what they can to protect themselves and their families.  It will feel like this is again a step backwards.</p>  <p>  It has to be said that there have been two characteristics to the Government's approach to Covid, which has again landed us in a situation where the Minister is asking us to give him and his Government a blank cheque to extend emergency powers, along with the prospect of additional restrictions to the hospitality sector and household visits, the extension of the use of Covid certificates in certain circumstances and limitations on indoor events.  Those two characteristics mean the Government has been very quick to take away income supports for workers and families.  We have seen that happen again over the past number of days.  It has been far too slow to implement the measures and supports it can and should put in place to keep people safe and to ensure that the first principles of test and trace, isolate and vaccinate work to the extent they should.  That is the background against which we are having this discussion today.  </p>  <p>  I will get to what I and Sinn F&eacute;in would do, which is often what the Minister and many of his colleagues ask in response to our criticisms when they are on the airwaves.  The last time we had a debate like this, the Minister accused me and my party of being against public health advice because we were against the extension of emergency powers.  He cannot have it both ways.  I fully support public health measures and their provision.  I will not oppose them, but what I cannot do is give what I believe are emergency powers to a Minister who, on several occasions, has not got it right.  As I said, he has been too slow to respond on occasion and clumsy at times in how he has approached many of the issues.  It has to be said, and I will put it bluntly, that he has made a dog's dinner of some of the responses.  All of that has created confusion and led to the mixed messages people have spoken about over the past while.  It has created anger, resentment and frustration at a time when people are very tired and fatigued.  They want to see strong leadership, but they also want to see a coherent response and be confident that we are making the correct decisions for them.</p>  <p>  People want the response to be done correctly and they want proper debate, scrutiny and accountability.  I remember when the Merriongate story first appeared in the public domain.  What was its characteristic?  Confusion.  The T&aacute;naiste at the time was not aware of the difference between the guidelines and regulations.  We had all of that and I will not go back over that ground.  That confusion was created because there was no clarity.  There was no debate on the regulations.  Even the T&aacute;naiste was not aware of precisely what the regulations were to do.  Yet, the Minister is asking this House again to give him a blank cheque to go away and make new regulations.</p>  <p>  I have read the media reports and I assume we will again learn about the regulations in the media.  There has been no offer of a briefing to the Opposition.  I wonder if we will get one over the next number of days.  We have again had recommendations coming from NPHET, which I support.  It is its right to give public health advice.  In more recent times, the Minister and his Government have nuanced that public health advice.  That is their right too.  It is the Government's job to take the advice and put measures in place that it believes are most appropriate.  My point about the nuancing of the message is that we are not asked for our opinion, we are not part of that discussion or debate and we do not have any hand, act or part in the development or creation of those regulations.  They are crafted by the Minister and the Government.  As he said, they are published and put on the website.  Today, if I vote for this Bill without any amendment, I am in effect saying to the Minister to go away and again make those regulations and nuance the public health advice in whatever way he sees fit, without any debate, scrutiny and accountability regarding what people in this House believe.  There will no discussion or debate whatsoever.</p>  <p>  I come from a school of thought that says if you get your hand burned on one occasion, you do not put it back in the fire.  That is what happened to us on previous occasions, in the early stages of this pandemic when the D&aacute;il was not sitting and there was a real crisis in terms of learning about what this virus was, when there was a need to have emergency powers.  We are not at that point now because circumstances have changed.  There is a difference between that and not needing public health advice or public health measures.  Of course we need them, but we do not need the level of emergency powers that, in essence, take powers away from the Oireachtas and give them to the Minister to go and make regulations.  We are then all held to account because if there are any mistakes, and there have been many, I am then asked to account for that in the same way as the Minister.  It would be correctly pointed out to us that we voted for this, we gave the Minister for Health those powers and we surrendered accountability and transparency.  I simply cannot do that.</p>  <p>  We have tabled a number of reasonable amendments that are very similar to those we debated last night in respect of a different Bill.  They state that the regulations made under the Act require the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Again, we were pragmatic enough to say that in circumstances where it is urgent, the Joint Committee on Health could give the approval of the Houses as soon as is possible.  The Minister could make the regulations but they would need retrospective approval from the House.  Our amendments would require a report reviewing the use, functions and impact of the provisions of the Acts at least two weeks before a proposed extension and they would mandate reporting of Covid-19 infections in the workplace.  We have many more amendments.  I assume that other members of the Opposition will also table very similar amendments, as they did yesterday.  If the Minister does not accept those amendments, we will be back to a situation where a blank cheque is provided to him and his Government.  That is where we will end up, which is very problematic.</p>  <p>  If we look at what is being proposed by NPHET, and again I can only go by what is in the public domain, it is back to front that its advice is published even before the Government makes any decision.  There is all this speculation about what it means, we are asked for our view, there is radio silence from the Government for a couple of days, it then makes a decision and we have to react to it without any engagement whatsoever with anybody else in the Oireachtas.  That is what happens.</p>  <p>  Let us look at what is being proposed.  For the hospitality sector, six people per table will be allowed, there will no multiple bookings, it will be table service only and there will be an 11.30 p.m. curfew.  </p> <p>I assume that all of that will have to be done by way of new regulations.  Nightclubs will be closed to all intents and purposes.  How else could the advice being given be read?  Live venues will have only a 50% seating capacity.  Household visits will be reduced to four, including the host household, per home.  There is to be extension of the Covid certificates to gyms and hotels.  Again, I assume that would require regulation.  As for indoor events, there is to be 50% capacity for cultural, entertainment, community and sporting events.  Again, I assume that all that would require regulation.  If it requires regulation, I do not know what provisions, of all the advice that has been given, the Cabinet will sign off on.  I have no idea.  Maybe the Minister will accept all of them; maybe he will not.  Maybe he will not go the full distance regarding the 11.30 p.m. curfew.  Who knows?</p> <p> We have to wait and see what the Government does, which is precisely my point.  We vote for this, the Cabinet goes off and makes a decision, the Minister makes the regulations, they do not come back to this House and our view is immaterial, yet we are then held to account in the same way that the Government is.  I have no doubt whatsoever but that if the Minister were standing where I am, he would see the difficulty in which that places me and many other members of the Opposition.  Therefore, when he appeals to people to vote for this legislation, he should at least make a distinction between that and supporting emergency powers and public health advice.  I have been very clear right through this pandemic that public health advice has to be heeded and supported.  It is the job of the public health experts to give advice to the Government.  Yes, on occasion there can be nuancing of that for practical reasons because the job of the Government is to look at a whole-of-society response.  I get that, and we in the Opposition have done that on occasion as well.  As closely as possible, however, we have stuck to the public health advice because that is the right thing to do.  These are experts who give advice.  We cannot change it.  It is what it is.  Then we have to make decisions, but we do not make the decisions.  The Minister makes the decisions.</p> <p> I wish to go back to some of the issues on which the Government has failed and fallen down in recent times.  There has been some movement on antigen testing, which I welcome.  Unlike some others, I welcome the fact that antigen testing is now being used in respect of travel for people who are vaccinated.  That is an appropriate use of antigen testing.  However, it can be made free and accessible.  The Government could decide to provide for that.  There could be a really strong communication campaign on how people should use the tests and in what circumstances they should and should not.  Then we could hardwire antigen testing into our overall response.  That was not done.  That was a failure of government.</p> <p> We have talked about ventilation in schools and in workplaces time and again, and again the Minister's Government has dragged its feet.  We had expert groups on antigen testing and for far too long the Government ignored the advice from the advisory panel on antigen testing.  We had an expert group on ventilation.  The Government just binned the reports and did not listen whatsoever.  We had people resign from that group, people who were on the group who were quite critical of the fact that we have not responded.  It is flabbergasting to people that we are again at a point when more restrictions are being considered and we have not done what we need to do in respect of ventilation in schools and workplaces.</p> <p> Consider the ICU capacity in our hospitals.  Again, the Government flunked that one and we do not have the capacity that is needed.  Contact tracing in schools was ended.  We went from the bizarre situation whereby schools were the safest environments you could possibly imagine and we did not need contact tracing, air circulation or ventilation, and all of a sudden the one cohort of the population that was unvaccinated, the Government says, is now the problem.  It finally accepted that measures had to be taken in schools, and what did it mandate?  Mask wearing, which is the public health advice, but none of the other issues such as contact tracing or ventilation were acted on and children are now freezing in schools because windows are open.  That is the level of frustration that principals, teachers and parents have.  The Government took away the supports for workers and for families, with a 40% reduction in the EWSS and a sliding scale reduction to the PUP.  Looking at the booster jab roll-out, the Government reduced the capacity that was there in the summer when the vaccines were being rolled out.  That capacity was scaled down and we are now not rolling out the booster jab as quickly as we can.  That is the central problem.</p> <p> I will finish my contribution by reminding the Minister of a number of things.  If he wants the support of the Opposition, he has to work with it.  We have to be part of the solution.  Decisions have to come before the D&aacute;il to be made.  The Government brought forward a Bill on mandatory hotel quarantine last night through primary legislation.  We had proper debate and scrutiny on it and we supported it.  I cannot support the emergency powers Bill as it is if the amendments are not accepted.  I cannot understand why they are not being accepted.  Similar amendments will be tabled, I am sure, by the Labour Party, the Social Democrats and others.  It is really frustrating for us, as I said last night, to hear the Minister time and again say the Government will change and will engage with the Opposition and that there will be briefings and discussion, yet I have not been informed of any briefing flowing from NPHET's recommendations, which end up in the public domain.  We are all asked about them.  I have been invited onto media programmes, as I am sure others in the Opposition have, and we speculate in the dark.  We can go only on what is in the media, and I assume we will not be briefed for the coming days if at all.  Yet the Minister then expects us just to give him a blank cheque to go and put in place whatever regulations he likes.  He is unable to respond quickly.  He has been too slow to respond in too many areas.  The approach of the Government far too often has been clumsy, and a dog's dinner has been made of so many of the regulations and guidelines in the past.  The confusion even tripped up the Government's own Ministers.  That is not something I want to see continue and is not something I will support.  I very much hope the amendments will be accepted.  I know we are in a difficult situation.  It is difficult for everybody.  It is difficult for all the workers and families out there who will be listening to the news later and watching the recommendations and the changes which are coming.  None of them are easy for anybody.  Some people will lose their jobs.  Some businesses will feel all that, but there is a real frustration out there that while all this is happening, the Government is not getting it right in so many places.  I simply will not give the Minister or this Government any blank cheque.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in has been consistent in our approach on Covid and public health.  I also commend the public on how they have carried themselves right throughout this pandemic and how they have looked after themselves and others.  This is despite the mixed messages, kite-flying and sometimes off-the-wall regulations the Minister has proposed.</p>  <p>  What I do not support is the way in which these measures have been brought in and implemented.  It frightens me to hand the Minister a blank cheque, a cheque he has used in the past for things such as the &euro;9 meal, which was pure nonsense.  The best way to ensure that public health measures are followed is to bring the public with you, and the Government has lost the public along the way.  Kite-flying and a Cabinet with more leaks than a sieve have led to public mistrust in the Government.  The people I speak to cannot take the Government at face value.  There have been impractical, complicated and unworkable rules for business.  I was getting my hair cut this morning and was talking to my barber, Lenny.  He is concerned about another lockdown.  During the first lockdown he put all the safety measures in place - masks, screens, sanitisers, air filtration, online booking systems - at great expense to himself only to be told that the shop would be closed down again.  He asked me again this morning, "Will this happen again, Mark?"  He has had no reassurance from the Government, and I could not reassure him because I cannot second-guess this Government any more.  Lenny and other small businesses that have followed the public health guidelines are to be commended, but they looked on in shock and horror at how the Government flouted its own advice by attending things such as the private soir&eacute;e in the Merrion.  This was a kick in the teeth for small businesses and the public and they feel that nobody has been held accountable.</p></speech>

The Government has had plenty of time to address our concerns.  Covid is an absolutely horrible virus.  I can speak at first hand of how nasty it is, and I still have symptoms of long Covid.  Nobody wants the Government to get this right more than me, and I mean that.  I am immunocompromised.  I am doubly vaxxed.  I got my booster last week.  I will follow to the end any common-sense, researched measures that are brought in.  What I cannot accept, however, is the Government's lack of planning and pass-the-buck policy.  It did it with the antigen tests.  </p> <p>It is now passing on the cost of the antigen test to the public.  For example, there is no Lidl or Tesco within walking distance of my constituency office.  If people want an antigen test, they have to go to the pharmacy.  They are not sold in singles but in multipacks, which cost &euro;30 each.  That might not seem much to the Minister but &euro;30 on top of the rise in the cost of living is insurmountable to some families I represent.  </p> <p> Deputy Cullinane touched on the failure in our schools.  The Government had two years to reduce class sizes, introduce contact tracing and put proper air filtration systems in place but it did none of this.  It passed the buck to the schools, which are already under enough pressure.  No child should be refused entry to a school for not wearing a mask.  What happens if home is not a safe place to send a child?  Has that entered the Minister's thoughts?  </p> <p> Parents have contacted me numerous times to say their GPs are not writing waivers or notes to say their child cannot wear a mask.  Has the Minister had consultation with the GPs or did he just land them with this?  Failure to prepare is to prepare to fail.  </p> <p> During the previous debate we had here, the Minister interrupted me as I was speaking on the extension of powers under the Mental Health Act, especially around involuntary admissions to psychiatric wards by tribunals.  He told me he would send me a note.  I still have not received that note.  I sent him an email, which he has not acknowledged.  I took the Minister at his word.  I can resend the email I sent last month.  He expects us and the public to take him at his word but we get mixed messages and he does not follow through.  He needs to restore public confidence in this Government and bring in practical, researched, easy-to-follow solutions so it is not put on the likes of schools or small businesses to carry the brunt of this.</p></speech>

The people that have been on to me this afternoon, particularly in the past hour and a half, are angry but also disconsolate and sad about where we are going with this virus.  They have known for a number of weeks that we have been heading towards restrictions.  The figures have been too high in respect of case numbers and, particularly, hospitalisations and ICU admissions.  While the mortality rate has gone done and the vaccines have played a significant role in that, between four and six people per day are still dying from this virus.</p>  <p>  Many of us saw this day coming in terms of restrictions being announced.  The frustration is that we in opposition have asked for changes over recent weeks, including long-term measures.  As I have said, we cannot operate as if this wave will be the last.  We hope it will but we have to plan that it is not.  That is why we needed a strategy on antigen testing that worked.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach in response to me said he saw a role for regular antigen testing in households as a key measure in 2022 to suppress the virus.  A couple of days later, the Minister said the Government would not subsidise antigen testing but let the market do it.  Deputy Ward indicated succinctly the cost of those tests.  They are not affordable for people on low incomes or social welfare payments.  Antigen tests only work if done serially or regularly in a pattern.  That science has been clear from the start and that is why we needed them subsidised or free.</p>  <p>  Today, I received a reply to a parliamentary question to the Minister on staffing in our vaccination centres.  He said there are struggles there and the people we had in the summer when the vaccine roll-out was firing on all cylinders have gone back to work in primary care, college, back into retirement or are in our PCR testing or swabbing centres.  We are in bad shape.  It is clear from his response today that we do not have enough people working on our booster programme.  That is the emergency measure and power we need: a booster programme that is firing on all cylinders and getting people into pharmacies, GP surgeries, vaccination centres and pop-up vaccination centres. </p>  <p>  I am deeply concerned.  It was confirmed to me earlier what we have been hearing for several weeks, namely, that there are staffing issues in the booster programme.  I ask that every effort be made.  I know it is not easy.  There is not a large number of skilled vaccinators out there but our backs are to the wall with this virus.  We need to pull out every stop we can, even if it requires short-term training.  Whatever it requires, we need to get vaccinators into all those centres and environments and get people jabbed as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  With the restrictions recommended by NPHET today, my heart again goes out to the arts community, those working in hospitality and taxi drivers.  Many taxi drivers recently came off support payments.  December gets them through January and February and the rug has been taken out from under them.  We have space in next week's schedule.  I do not mind sitting next Friday if it means we are bringing back emergency legislation for support measures such as the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, for these workers who will be out of work.  The fact these supports have been wound down while we reintroduce restrictions will mean people will lose their jobs and incomes is what angers me the most.  We need to protect these vulnerable workers who, even at the best of times, can have irregular work.  Now they are in the worst of times and have very few supports.  They face a December that is even darker than last December, if that is even possible.  </p>  <p>  I ask the Minister, if we are extending the powers to 22 January, to at least have a weekly briefing in that period for spokespersons from NPHET please.  We need it.  As Deputy Cullinane stated, we are asked to go on media.  To the people in our communities, we may as well be in government.  We are Deputies and we have to have answers.  We are giving advice and responses based on media reports and corridor rumours.  It is not good enough on an issue like this.  We need to know and to have briefings.  Can we have regular briefings while we go into the teeth of this dark period?  </p>  <p>  In the Minister's opening statement, he said: "With the virus spreading at such high levels in the community and the recent emergence of the Omicron variant, we can unfortunately expect further hospitalisations and possible deaths in the coming weeks and months."  Will he speak to that?  Is that because the emerging data suggests the omicron variant is vaccine-resistant?  Is there increased morbidity with this variant?  What is the science?  I know it is emerging science on a new variant, but what is the latest?  I do not want to take our information from snapshots of news articles on Twitter and so on, but that is where people are.  Something is shared that says omicron is very mild and something else that says omicron is really serious.  The Minister has stated we expect further hospitalisations and deaths because of the emergence of the omicron variant.  It would be most helpful if he would articulate the science behind that as best he can.</p>  <p>  We need a long-term strategy to address the Covid-19 pandemic.  We are back in a panic situation and being submerged into the depths of what will be a long December and January.  We have plateaued at levels that are far too high.  We have had a couple of weeks where discussions about the pressures on our ICU departments and hospitals were front and centre of the debates in this House and the media.  We moved on to PCR, antigen and HEPA filters.</p> <p>However, the pressure in our hospitals is worse now than it was last week or three weeks ago and it is only going to get worse.  We need to imagine ourselves being inside those buildings and just how bad it is.  We need to remind ourselves of the "Prime Time" documentaries, when the cameras were allowed in to show how bad it was, and how shocked we were.  It is as bad now as it was then.  </p> <p> I do not know what the strategy might be for the unvaccinated but we have to speak about them and the damage they are doing to our health service.  If there are people out there who are hesitant for medical or other reasons that we can understand and we can speak to them, we should do that.  There are others who have staked a flag on the issue of vaccination as some kind of front line on freedoms, such as were outside the back gate demonstrating today.  They have gone as far as taking people out of hospitals, causing real damage.  People are dying because of this.  I have said that previously.  This is an issue on which I am not asking for an answer because I do think there is an answer.  We have to be strong in condemning in the strongest terms that reckless messaging and activity that is killing people.  We know from the figures that the majority of people in ICU are unvaccinated.  Whether those people are active in that regard, they can be influenced by it.  The power of social media messaging is so complex now it is reaching into every corner of our State.  If people are vulnerable on the issue of vaccination and they have concerns about it, this is a very powerful and potent message and a dangerous one that is killing people.  It is making people very sick and it is crippling our hospital services.  We cannot have this debate without mentioning that.  </p> <p> People say that the Government has lost the dressing room.  I think we are there now.  People are fed up, angry and sad.  They do not see an end to this pandemic.  What they do see are certain tools that they want to see the Government supporting.  They want Government to ensure that there are not two-day delays in PCR testing, that they have access to antigen testing and that there is good air quality in their schools.  HEPA filters will play a role in that, but they are not a silver bullet.  There is no silver bullet.  The public want clarity on policies on this and investment in these areas.  The public are pragmatic.  They do not want to see people die or to see our hospitals under such pressure.  As difficult as they are, the public can understand restrictions.  They would probably swallow them if they believed that the right decisions were being made in long-term planning for improving our health service and resourcing our doctors, nurses, healthcare assistants and hospital staff and for pandemic-proofing our health system and ensuring the roll-out of the booster jab is operating as best it can, but they are angry because they do not see these things happening.  They fear there is another dark winter ahead and there is no hope coming from within this building from the Government.  That is a problem.</p> <p> The financial supports have to be revisited.  These restrictions are not going to be a circuit breaker.  Whether they will work is an unknown, but they will not be a circuit breaker.  This is going to be slow down and slow out, which means people are going to be out of work and not earning a living for a long time.  Twenty-one months into this pandemic, that is unacceptable. </p></speech>

I uphold - one might ask who I am to uphold it - the right of every Deputy to express his or her views but, like me, Deputies will have noted an increase in the public temperature over the past week and, therefore, there is a need for measured comments and measured responses.  I have heard members of the Opposition speak of a complete failure in our schools.  Where is the evidence that there has been a complete failure in our schools?  This afternoon, I visited Firhouse Community College, which was holding a raffle for Pieta House and the transition year students had constructed a wooden shed.  It was a fabulous occasion.  There was no comment among the teachers, the principal or the students about this, although I am sure if I had been able to stay longer we might have got into a conversation about it.  Every school is open, including every post-primary school.  Everybody in this House knows that every part of the school community is doing its absolute best.  There is not a scintilla of evidence that there is a complete failure in our schools.</p></speech>

The Government moved very quickly this week.  It met the Licensed Vintners' Association, the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland to respond as quickly as possible to the issues, concerns, anxieties and awful challenges that they face.  The Government will continue to do that.  A sum of &euro;600 million per month is being expended by the Government on behalf of taxpayers and citizens on support measures for businesses.  I accept, as much as anybody, that, to borrow a quote, "Too long a sacrifice can make a stone of the heart".  I know people are fraught and anxious.  I know also that, for example, some members of my extended family can travel into this country this Christmas; they could not do that last year.  Despite Opposition Deputies saying that there is no hope from this Government, almost 1 million people have been administered a third dose of vaccine.  A year and a half ago, we did not think we would have a vaccine.</p>  <p>  Members of the Opposition need to be measured in their comments.  If not, what they say will be exploited and we will see more demonstrations such as took place today and they will increase.</p></speech>

When science starts to contradict itself that creates problems.  When scientists say schools are safe and they then say they never said that, that creates the kind of chink that the people who were outside this House today need.  It cannot happen.  When circulars are issued with blunt language, probably unknown to the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, for whom I have huge admiration, the Minister then has to go out and give the practical, reasonable, real Government response to the public that we trust our schools to deal with the issue of masks and children and to make the right decisions and be sensitive to the needs of those children around whom we need to be sensitive.  I accept that this week some of those issues created a degree of panic and uncertainty.  When we have gymnastics by science on antigen testing, again that leads to the kind of fraught responses that we have had this week.  When schools receive a circular stating, "This is a requirement and it must be enacted tomorrow morning", that is not helpful.  In those circumstances, it can sometimes be helpful for Government to state that if sometimes its messaging appears confusing, a little inconsistent or even contradictory, it is because we are in the teeth of something we have never faced before.</p> <p>Ours is not a perfect world and I ask colleagues, in all reasonableness, whether they could do better.  Will they ask themselves which measures they would not have implemented?  Would they stand over all the statements they have made over the past year?  I read reports in the media today about the Government losing the room.  I ask those journalists to examine the column inches that were published in the past 18 months and consider whether they would stand over all of them now.  The Government is made up of human beings who are dependent on scientific advice in the teeth of a pandemic involving a virus we cannot even see and that keeps mutating and evolving.<br/><br/>The Minister knows I have a huge amount of respect for him because he keeps calm.  I have not seen him lose the head under all the pressure and burden of decision-making that is on him and his colleagues.  He should remember the conclusion of the poem from which the following lines are taken:</p><blockquote>	If you can keep your head when all about you<br /><br />Are losing theirs and blaming it on you... </blockquote> <p>He should hold that to his heart.  There is a lot of anxiety out there but I ask the Opposition to be measured in its response.  There is a responsibility on it, too, in this fraught time.  The Government will make the decisions it has to make in the best interests of the people.  It does not always get it right, and that is pointed out really quickly when that happens, but I ask colleagues seriously whether they could do any better.  I wish the Minister and his colleagues well in the decisions they have to make.  I take the points, as I know he will, about the need to communicate those decisions a little more clearly.  Sometimes people issue stuff that is outside the realm of the Government, which must then respond to it.</p></speech>

If I closed my eyes, it could nearly have been Deputy Durkan talking, who is usually there with his sad stories of what is going on with the Government and how Members opposite are so sensitive.  Schools and parents were given 16 hours last weekend to implement new measures for schoolchildren.  Perhaps Deputy Lahart will have a small bit of sensitivity for them.</p>  <p>  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have always said we will support measures in the interest of public health, based on public health advice.  What we will not support is the way the Government is seeking to impose restrictions with little consultation, no scrutiny or review of the effectiveness of the measures they are seeking to extend, and a complete disregard for the impact that last-minute measures, mixed messaging and kite-flying have on families, businesses and services.  That is why we have submitted a number of amendments to ensure the regulations are scrutinised and subject to the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas or, where urgent, that of the Joint Committee on Health.  We also demand that a report reviewing the use and impact of the provisions in the Bill be provided two weeks before an extension is proposed.</p>  <p>  We ask for these measures for very good reason.  There has been an unacceptable level of consultation with, and briefing of, the Opposition in the drafting and setting of new regulations and guidance.  At every turn, the Government has avoided scrutiny of the measures it seeks to extend.  This makes for poor decision-making, which is something we cannot afford given the challenges facing our health and livelihoods.  We have seen the consequences of this in impractical and unworkable rules being imposed on businesses, schools and families.  This lack of transparency always results in the key stakeholders being excluded.  Where was the consultation with schools, principals, parents and GPs on the face mask rules?  A quick email to principals the evening before the rules were due to come into effect was an outrageous example of incompetence on the part of the Government, which had a week to decide on the measures but left schools and parents with just hours to prepare.  This attitude gives the impression the Government is either out of its depth or is putting politics above the welfare of the State.  Ministers kept repeating that the schools were safe but took no action to ensure this was the case, sending children back to school with no mitigation measures.  Open windows were the solution; now it is children having to wear masks.  In the first 36 hours of antigen testing being available for pod contacts in schools, 10,000 tests were being ordered.  The Government cannot pretend there is no Covid in our schools.</p>  <p>  What about businesses?  Unclear guidance, mixed messages and impractical rules are damaging them.  The Government response is an insult to every business owner who needs the EWSS and PUP payments restored immediately.  Businesses are screaming for help.  They are looking for certainty and a plan.  The time for mixed messaging, no accountability and a lack of scrutiny of the Government's measures must end.  Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled a number of motions that had the express purpose of keeping people safe, ensuring draft regulations are not repeated and there is full scrutiny to assist families and businesses through this crisis.  If our amendments to this Bill are not accepted, we will not support it.  The Minister has had plenty of time to address our concerns and correct the democratic deficit.  We might be able to worry about his sensitivities after he does that.</p></speech>

We did not know how it was spread or how quickly it was transmitted.  Everyone in this House was on board when, shortly after, we were asked to pass emergency legislation.  It was a global emergency and we all understood speed was of the essence.  Human rights organisations flagged the importance of balancing public health measures and the rule of law with human rights.  We went ahead without the safeguards we would all have liked because we knew there was not the time to put them in place.  That was 22 months ago, yet we are still operating on the narrative that there is no time for a review of the legislation and no time for oversight, proportionality tests or human rights assessments.</p>  <p>  I mean in now way to diminish the current seriousness of the pandemic but we are not operating in the same conditions as we were when we were originally asked to enact the predecessor of this legislation.  This Bill, which follows the series of Bills that went before it, will again extend the sunset clause set out last year, which was some comfort, with no changes to the content.  Time and again, we were promised reviews and that the latest extension would be the last.  We are now being asked to trust the Minister again in extending the provisions for another three months, with a possible additional three months after that.  Many of the measures in the Bill are necessary.  The requirements on wearing masks are a very important aspect of the public health measures and I accept that their enforcement is needed for the adult population.  However, can we really guarantee that every single measure in the Bill and every single regulation that was passed or signed is needed?  I understand that in excess of 90 regulations have been signed, which has resulted in the Policing Authority expressing concerns about navigating them.  We cannot guarantee they are all necessary, nor can the Minister, because there have been no reviews of the emergency legislation or measures.</p>  <p>  There are internationally recognised standards and frameworks for emergency laws and they exist for a reason.  Such laws, by their very nature, bypass scrutiny.  In this case, we are, in effect, dealing with rollover legislation.  Human rights organisations in the State have been asking from the outset that the Government adopt a human rights law framework for public health measures.  It is on this basis that I have submitted a number of amendments to the Bill requiring that the regulations receive approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas and that the State's human rights watchdog, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, be consulted on any measures that will impact on human rights.  I am not talking about things taking forever, but consultation is necessary.  A human rights law framework recognises that, in certain circumstances, limits may be put on individual rights, as when we needed last year to protect the rights of life and health that were most pressing, including for the people working in our hospitals, supermarkets and so on.  However, such limits must be evidence-based, proportionate and temporary.  We need to consider those conditions.  We must have a careful analysis of the Covid legislation and regulations to date and more oversight over any future legislation.</p> <p>None of the current legislation we have seen this week has been through pre-legislative scrutiny.  No outside bodies were consulted and the legislation itself was published at the last minute, giving the Opposition very little time to analyse the legislation and the regulations properly.  In fact, we had to have our amendments in yesterday, before the debate started and before we had heard the Minister&rsquo;s opening statement today.  I ask the Minister to consider the amendments tabled to this Bill.  There is a sense of dismissiveness where Opposition amendments are treated as just something we have got to go through, and the Government will get the approval because it has the numbers in the D&aacute;il.  That is not the way to deal with this.  It was not the way it was dealt with at the beginning of the pandemic.</p> <p> Ensuring interference with rights is proportionate requires a careful balance of numerous factors, such as scientific evidence, analysis of the nature of the threat to the public health, careful analysis of what measures are needed to respond appropriately to that threat, what impact these measures will have on rights, how to keep interference with rights to a minimum, and how best to protect the most at risk and to prevent discrimination. </p> <p> There have been terrible mixed messages.  Good advice came from an expert group on environmental science about the use antigen testing.  However, it seems a hierarchy of expertise is being listened to.  Some of that is about the practical measures.  There is a public sector duty in this country to promote equality, eliminate discrimination and protect the human rights of Members, staff and the persons to whom they provide services.  This applies to all public sector actors, including the HSE, the Department of Health, the Chief Medical Officer and NPHET.  For that reason, I have submitted amendments to add a general non-discrimination clause to the list of things the Minister must consider when drafting amendments.  We are elected to legislate to ensure the laws passed in this country are considered and appropriate.  Likewise, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, was formed by the State as its human rights watchdog.  It is explicitly mandated to keep under review the adequacy and effectiveness of the law and practice in the State relating to human rights and equality.  I simply ask that it and we be allowed to do our jobs.  Further scrutiny of regulations by the Oireachtas and by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission would help prevent the unintended consequences we have already seen from the regulations, such as the rise in domestic violence, the isolation of older people in nursing homes and who are cocooning, the isolation of single people, the unsafe conditions for people in crowded and substandard accommodation like, for example, direct provision, and garda&iacute; not being clear on - although this was much more at the beginning - what was guidance and what was law.  I saw some of that myself.</p> <p> A fundamental principle of a law is that it must be clear, precise and accessible.  Everyone in this country needs to know what is legal, and what is not legal but guidance.  In fact, the public is good at taking guidance.  We have seen that in recent weeks, where they restricted their movements in droves, so much so that it has caused a knock-on consequence for several sectors, including the hospitality sector, events, taxi drivers, hairdressers and everyone else.</p> <p> Throughout the last 22 months, it has been difficult for ourselves as legislators, for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the public to differentiate between what is required of us legally, what is being recommended to us through guidelines, and what is just the personal opinion of individual Members, Ministers or of NPHET.  We were told at one point that HIQA would do a review on children and mask wearing.  We were waiting for that review and I do not believe HIQA did it.  However, there was an announcement late in the day at 9 o'clock at night when circulars were sent to schools with regulations to be implemented and mandated the following morning at 9 o'clock.  I am sure the Minister is getting the same calls as I am from people who are upset.  I have no doubt there is a high level of virus circulating among primary school pupils.  However, we continuously heard from NPHET that schools were safe.  That is what most people heard.  It was qualified by Dr. Ronan Glynn, who said, &ldquo;we said that they were safer&rdquo;.  That is not how people heard it.</p> <p> The Minister now has to explain to children, primary school pupils and their parents why there is a value in mask wearing, what it sets out to achieve, the time limit on its implementation and which people can be excluded from wearing masks.  On the points that were made earlier, people are certainly telling me that the GPs are not providing letters.  People are upset.  Yesterday, I was contacted by a parent whose child has autism.  They went to the GP to be sure there would not be an issue.  This has been a lightning rod for people because they have not had time to think it out nor have they had the rationale explained to them so that they can in turn explain that rationale to their children as well as being able to accept it themselves.  Some people have serious problems with this.  I am not sure if it is a majority of people, but there are certainly people who have serious problems with this.  A communication piece is hugely missing.</p> <p> There is no doubt it is a different experience for a child who is looking at a teacher who is talking from behind a mask.  It is a different experience for children to talk to each other while wearing masks.  This sends a message that they may have reason to feel a little more unsafe by virtue of the fact this protection is required.</p> <p> The Minister set out this message, but he ignored the advice from environmental health about HEPA air filtration systems in schools.  I am hearing from teachers who are saying they have a problem getting substitute teachers.  Many teachers are out with colds and flu because windows and doors in schools have to be open.  If the doors are not open then the CO2 monitor will show the air has reached an unsafe level.  They are wearing three coats, they have blue hands, and they are like that for five or six hours a day.  I am probably exaggerating about the three coats, but the children are cold.  They are sitting in a classroom that is at 10&deg;C.  You would not ask somebody to work in that kind of an environment.  There has to be a rethink about situations in many of our schools and classes where there are a good number of pupils.  Most primary school class sizes in my area, and I am sure in the Minister&rsquo;s area too, are somewhere around 30 pupils.  That is a lot of people in a classroom.  It is difficult to achieve good air quality.  There is a part-solution here that would be enormously helpful.  Somebody has got to go back to the drawing board fairly quickly, look at this and start taking the advice of people who are the environmental scientists.  They need to look at and listen to the evidence from those people, rather than from those who are not experts in environmental science.</p> <p> On boosters, I was one of the fortunate people who was in the cohort the Minister talked about.  I was in Citywest last Friday.  I was in a good humour to queue for a long time.  I was happy to be there and happy to get the booster.  However, people were there who were frozen cold because they did not know that they were going to be standing outside for two hours and then another hour and a half inside.  It was worse the next day.  I felt sorry for the people inside, because there were not enough people administering the vaccinations.  That is where the logjam was.  Some of it was a timetabling thing.  It could have been timetabled better.</p> <p>We have to throw everything at this in terms of the number of vaccinations.</p> <p> It is not fair on the people on the front line.  Some of them are getting complaints but the complaints are going to the wrong people.  We should be saluting these people.  It was not the same scenario in the vaccination centre for the booster as it was for my first and second doses.  It felt a lot more chaotic as regards the length of time I was there.  Whoever can be put in to assist should be.  The pharmacies can be a great solution there.  The boosters are going to be very important and we all acknowledge that.  The Janssen vaccine wanes fairly quickly and a large cohort of young people, who will be out and about, got that.  There will have to be a serious look at the duration between when they got it and when they will get the booster, or the second dose or whatever you want to call it.  I am not put out by what people call it.</p> <p> Those practical measures are the things we need to see and we need to see them at speed.  We have gone from accepting that this is a pandemic to a point where we have to accept that this is endemic.  The CEO of Pfizer said he anticipates that an annual vaccine will be required but we have to put other measures in place so we can live as normally as possible.  We have to stop going from wave to wave and we must have an armoury of things that can be used.  The likes of air filtration systems are part of that because the last thing any of us want is our schools closing.  We have to keep them open but we have to keep them open safely.  That includes teachers and pupils.  There is a finite number of teachers and we have to keep them as healthy as possible.  I was surprised that they were not included in the antigen testing regime.  We have to accept that our climate does not allow for a lot of outdoor activity in the winter, although it is fine in the summer or when the weather is okay.</p> <p> Regarding this emergency legislation, we have to get back to people being briefed.  People are ringing me up and asking if there is going to be another lockdown and so on and asking what I can tell them, but we are relying on the media.  It is not good enough that we would not have a briefing to break down what the issues are.  We cannot be advocates for some of these measures because we simply do not have the information.  We cannot have an input and we are excluded from regular briefings.  Then things come like a bolt out of the blue, like this legislation, without the kinds of safeguards we require.  We are 22 months on.  How do we not have time to consult with the very people who will be the watchdogs, at the time we need them, that is, when there is emergency legislation?  The idea of excluding the State's watchdog on human rights, namely, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, from this kind of legislation is just not acceptable.</p> <p> I hope the Minister will look at the amendments we have tabled.  They have been put down in good faith and we would like them to be taken in good faith.  I appeal to the Minister to do something about the communication on mask-wearing in schools.  He also needs to go back to the drawing board on ventilation in classrooms.  Children cannot go through the winter with all the windows open, particularly when there is another avenue that could go some way towards assisting good quality air in classrooms and perhaps keeping the level of the virus down in the primary school cohort.  It is going to be some time before they are offered a vaccine and there may well be a different attitude when it comes to that.  There will need to be some serious reassurance of parents because adults will take a vaccine themselves but will be more thoughtful about their children, so we need more advanced warning and thought on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.400" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1553" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="17:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300053#DDD00200"><p>It is now 22 months since this House enacted legislation that imposed very significant restrictions on people's lives and freedoms.  At the time Deputy Donnelly and I, as well as Deputy Lahart, were in opposition on the other side of the Chamber.  In fairness to this D&aacute;il, every party in this Chamber agreed with that legislation, which was enacted back in March 2020.  All Independent Deputies supported it as well.  It is important, however, that we reflect on the powers that were given as a result of that legislation because they were extraordinary.  We were given the power to restrict people's freedom of movement and stop people from leaving their houses unless they had a reasonable excuse.  There were powers to close down schools and to allow children to be educated at home and there were even powers to close businesses and restrict people from playing sport.  They were extraordinary powers that this House delegated to the Minister for Health.</p>  <p>  The reason we did so was because of the great fear we had.  It was a fear of a pandemic about which we knew so little and which seemed to be posing such a threat around the world.  It initially started in China but when it came into Italy it sent shock waves throughout the rest of Europe.  After that, we had significant lockdowns.  Relative to the rest of the world, we probably imposed some of the most strict and lengthy lockdowns in the world.  The reason the Irish public went along with that, and the reason the body politic remained united in respect of it, was, to be blunt, because of fear and because of hope.  The fear was one of this unknown disease and what it was going to do to the public and the fact that so many people were dying as a result of it throughout the world, but the hope was also hugely important.  The hope was that vaccines were coming on the horizon.  One of the most remarkable achievements of mankind so far in this century has been to produce vaccines that have been so effective in protecting people from this dangerous disease.</p>  <p>  The Minister does not generally get credit from the media or the Opposition but what they cannot take away from him is the fact that he presided over an extremely successful vaccination programme and he is continuing to do so.  What we managed to achieve in this country is quite extraordinary.  We have 93% of the adult population vaccinated.  If we had said that to people in this House before the vaccination programme started, they would have thought it highly unlikely that that level of success could be achieved.  We are also now seeing the extent to which the vaccines are effective.  The Minister mentioned that 50% of the people in ICU are unvaccinated and do not have underlying conditions, whereas the 50% who are vaccinated do, regrettably, have underlying conditions.  Obviously we wish all people in hospital well and we want to ensure those patients get out of ICU.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the lockdowns and restrictions was to ensure our health system did not become overrun.  That was the primary objective and that was the reason it was justified and accepted in this House.  Today, there are 528 people in hospital, 110 of whom are in ICU.  Our health system is not being overrun.  We need to recognise that there are threats to the healthcare system but also we need to recognise that the Irish public have been through an awful lot.  Many people are concerned today because notwithstanding the fact that we have 93% of the population vaccinated and that we had some of the lengthiest and strictest lockdowns in the world we are considering reimposing restrictions.</p> <p>The Cabinet has a difficult task, but it is important we take into account that factor as well as where the public is in respect of this issue.  When NPHET puts out information to the effect it is making recommendations to the Government, that puts the Government in a difficult position, but when making decisions, it is important we try to retain the level of agreement and consensus that has existed in this House and among the public to date.  My concern is that it is probably inevitable that support will become more fractured and fragmented as time goes on.</p> <p> Twenty months ago, I emphasised what I thought was the importance of considering the consequences of the restrictions.  We all see the consequences of the pandemic in the more than 5,700 Covid-associated deaths and the number of people who have been to hospital, but we do not appreciate the damage the restrictions can have on various sections of our population.  I have always been concerned about the impact lockdowns have on children.  The closure of schools was devastating to children and we need a much broader perception of what public health is when considering issues in respect of schools.  It is a great achievement that our schools have remained open, but there should be no question mark over them closing.  It is fundamental to the educational, social, physical, personal and public health development of children in general that they stay open.</p> <p> I have noticed that the levels of anxiety in society have increased significantly recently.  There is a fear we are in an endless cycle of new variants each year that will inevitably result in the Government and the Oireachtas supporting further restrictions on people's movements.  However, we need to recognise we are in a different position today than we were in March or even December 2020.  The benefits of vaccination mean something and are significant.  One of the great advantages of there being such widespread vaccination is we can now have a broader assessment of what risk is.  At the beginning of the pandemic, risk was viewed exclusively in terms of the impact the pandemic was having on our public health system and the impact the disease was having on individuals.  We must now recognise we need a broader assessment of risk.  When considering restrictions, we need to recognise the damage they can do to the public at large, in particular children and other young people.</p> <p> I will support the legislation.  It is important the Minister would have this power.  I know he will be careful in exercising it because he will take into account the factors I have mentioned.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in has submitted a number of amendments.  I will focus on one for the moment, which reads: "Require regulations made under the Acts to require the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas or, where urgent, the Joint Committee on Health, with approval of the Houses following as soon as possible."  What member of a democratically elected Government would have a problem with that?  Accountability and oversight are compatible with good government and good governance.  Without our amendments being accepted, we cannot support the mechanism and method of how these measures are being introduced and implemented.</p>  <p>  Consistently, there has been an appalling lack of consultation by the Government with relevant stakeholders, most recently school principals, parents and GPs regarding face masks and children.  There has never been a greater example of "We have tried nothing and we are all out of ideas" when it comes to this Government, schools and managing Covid.  For a Government that has so many well-paid advisers, the communications concerning Covid have been consistently mind-boggling.  This has caused confusion and created a vacuum where misinformation was given the oxygen to spread.  That is unforgivable.  The Government had an opportunity to bring people with it, but not only did it miss that opportunity, it ignored it completely.</p>  <p>  The Government gave itself a week to make the decision on face masks for kids and then gave schools 16 hours to communicate it and enforce it with a hard-line attitude that we have not even seen in operation in the D&aacute;il at times.  The guidelines issued take no consideration of so many factors that it is difficult to know where to begin, but I will start with this one.  A medical certificate must be provided to the school confirming a pupil falls into one of three exempted categories, the first being any pupil with difficulty breathing or any other relevant medical condition.  The first question most people would ask would be what a relevant medical condition was.  GPs are already operating beyond capacity, yet the Minister for Education stated on national radio that kids with glasses could get certificates of exemption.</p>  <p>  We are all in agreement that no children should be penalised or have their education withheld.  As difficult as Covid has been for us as adults over the past two years, the pressure, anxiety and stress it has placed on children are incalculable.  As adults and legislators, we need to stop trying to force children to look at Covid as we do, that is, through adult eyes.</p>  <p>  The Opposition, school communities and parents have raised concerns vocally about the safety of schools, but we were met with the constant mantra of "Schools are safe".  The Government could not even stand over that statement because contact tracing had ceased.</p></speech>

My foot is sore today.</p>  <p>  I will state categorically that People Before Profit will not be supporting this legislation.  We opposed the renewal of these measures in the past and we are opposing them again.  They are to be extended to March and possibly beyond.  We are opposing them because we do not trust the Government with these laws, nor do we any longer have hope that it will do the right thing in a manner that will build and maintain social solidarity throughout the pandemic and secure public health.</p>  <p>  In 2020, our citizens responded to the health measures with admirable social solidarity.  They respected lockdowns, they respected social distancing and they took care of one another.  We now have a very high vaccination rate.  The Minister went through the figures - more than 91% are fully vaccinated and the partially vaccinated represent, I believe, 95%.  Of the 5% of people who remain unvaccinated, a large cohort are marginalised communities to whom the Government could do much more to reach out in an attempt to educate and convince them it is the right thing to do.</p>  <p>  I disagree with people who are opposed to vaccinations, but I do not scapegoat them.  They are not the largest part of the problem, particularly given that our society has such a high level of fully vaccinated people.  The pandemic is still spreading.  That is not the fault of the unvaccinated, yet this legislation could scapegoat them.</p>  <p>  The majority of people support vaccinations.  We saw the queues last week when it was announced that boosters would be available in places like Citywest.  The queues were enormous.  People waited nearly five hours to get their boosters.  They are enthusiastically embracing the vaccination programme.  As such, the situation cannot be framed as the unvaccinated being the problem.</p>  <p>  I wish to discuss what I view as a much wider problem.  To start with the global issue, there is a major problem in the spread of the variants.  Delta and, lately, Omicron have become frightening.  I watched a newsreel about South Africa today.  South Africa's hospitals are being overwhelmed, mostly by young patients.  However, that is not the result of a biological evolutionary process in the virus alone.  It is also the result of private ownership of the pharmaceutical industry and its drive to increase its profits at all costs.  South Africa, other countries and the WHO have repeatedly asked to lift the patents on these vaccines to enable countries to control the virus in their own way and produce vaccines across the developing world.  Tragically, this Government has enthusiastically supported the EU in backing the global pharmaceutical industry in its refusal to remove the patents.</p> <p>This is the most brutal case of putting profit before the health of the population of the world.  Now we have a greater pool of unvaccinated people in the developing world, which gives the virus more and more scope to mutate.<br/><br/>I heard the remarks of Deputy Lahart about how the Government has followed the science and taken the advice at every step.  That is just not true.  Last Christmas, clear advice was given to the Government that it could choose to open up the economy or allow people to visit each other's homes over the Christmas period, but it could not do both.  What did it do?  The Government did both.  It ignored the advice.  That has led to a further lockdown and endangering thousands of lives.<br/><br/>The failure to respond to the scientific evidence that Covid-19 is an airborne disease and the failure to legislate and regulate for cleaner air in all workplaces, most importantly, including schools, is outrageous.  That was a choice.  An expert group was set up and scientific advice was given, but the Government chose to ignore it.  There have been shambolic and dangerous policies in schools.  We have put at risk thousands of unvaccinated children, teachers, families, SNAs and other staff.  Alongside the totally inadequate conditions, we stopped testing and tracing in schools, which was a deliberate policy to hide the number of cases.<br/><br/>There are incoherent and inconsistent policies around antigen testing.  This should have been available from the start, but the Government has been dithering and procrastinating and is worried about the cost of it.  These tests have become another excuse for rip-off Ireland.  In Britain, France and Finland, those tests are free to people who are worried about being contaminated with Covid or those who are showing symptoms.  In Portugal and Germany, they cost as little as &euro;1 each.  Here, they are as high as &euro;8 each.  It is rip-off Ireland all over again.  There has been mixed and confused messaging that has undermined public confidence in public health measures like, dare I say it, golfgate and Merriongate.  Despite that, people still responded in an overwhelmingly responsible manner.<br/><br/>The Government has failed us.  It has failed to introduce a comprehensive national sick pay scheme.  It has failed to increase hospital bed capacity or ICU capacity.  It failed to pay student nurses and other student cohorts who worked so hard for us during the pandemic.  We failed to give nurses more leave or to increase their pay and it is one of the main reasons we continually hear nurses talk about emigrating.  We failed to take private hospital capacity into public ownership, despite vast sums of money being paid to those private entities.  We failed with an ineffective and outsourced mandatory hotel quarantine system that has served as a racist theatre, where we single out countries from which people may or may not come freely into this country.  Now, elected representatives are being asked to extend this legislation that will impact on people's rights without the parliamentary scrutiny or robust analysis other Deputies talked about.<br/><br/>The majority of people in this country will continue to do the right thing if they have confidence in the Government to maintain social solidarity, but that confidence is constantly being eroded, in particular by dishonest messaging.  It was totally dishonest to talk about the schools being safe.  Overnight, it has been replaced with a contradictory, unrealisable instruction to principals to take instruction on masks from the Department.  I want to go into the issue in detail because this is worrying principals and teachers right across the country.  I will read from a letter a deputy principal sent to the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley.  The Minister will probably get sight of it:</p><blockquote>	I am concerned that the ambiguity surrounding the memo given to us leaves us in a very vulnerable position as a school.  This memo issued as a pdf not on departmental paper and it is not at all signed.  It is unclear under whose authority this has been issued.  The memo states that we should refuse entry to schoolchildren, which is in stark contrast to all other circulars and statutory instruments regarding access to education.  Usually there are protocols and procedures in place that involve discussions with parents and lengthy interventions before we would take such a drastic step as to exclude a child from school.  Is this memo legally binding and if so, can you clarify its status in terms of legal instruments? </blockquote> <p>I am finished the quote.  I am not directly asking the question myself, although it would be useful if it could be answered.  I know not everybody is going to be able to see what I am holding, but I can and civil servants and Ministers here will be familiar with it.  I have in my hand what an official memo from the Department looks like.  It is on headed paper, it has Oireachtas written all the way across it and it is signed.  What was sent out to the schools instructing them that where a medical certificate is not provided by a pupil, they will be refused entry into the school was not on headed paper and was not signed.  It was not in the format that one could accept as a legally binding document.  That must be urgently clarified to schools, parents and children.<br/><br/>I believe the recommendation for everybody who can, to mask up, is the right thing to do.  People Before Profit sees it as part of a suite of measures that will help prevent the spread of the virus.  I ask the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, if measures come in suites to help prevent the spread of the virus.  I do not mean bags of sweets, I mean S-U-I-T-E-S.  If they come as packages of things that we must do, then where are the high efficiency particulate air, HEPA, filters for schools?  Science has told us that they help in the fight against the spread of an airborne virus.  We will give the kids masks but not filters.  We will give schools instructions to exclude kids, but we will not give them the testing and tracing that they need.<br/><br/>This heavy-handed approach, combined with the failure to heed the science has only served to increase anxiety and hesitancy.  The powers given to the Garda in this legislation are also disproportionately applied and worrying.  In May, we got figures for fines for fixed-payment notices issued by the Garda.  At that time, of the 6,066 fines issued, almost half were issued in two Garda stations, Blanchardstown and Ballymun.  This is obviously where the Garda were working the hardest &ndash; in working class areas, where 70% of those who were fined were under 35 years of age.  The disproportionate application of those powers is extremely worrying.  That is why we do not believe they should be extended.  We should depend on the social solidarity and goodwill of people responding to a Government that seems to know what it is doing, but not to a Government that does not seem to know what it is up to.<br/><br/>In the same vein, how many managers of meat plants have been issued with fines for their failure to protect workers in those meat plants?  Only last week we heard of an outbreak in a meat plant with 260 cases.  The previous week we heard of a grant being given to the meat industry of &euro;78 million, allegedly to help it through Brexit, but we could not spend &euro;12 million on providing every classroom with a HEPA<b></b>filter.  This week, the Government voted against giving those meat plant workers the right to a sick pay scheme that would help to keep them safe and would mean that they would not feel obliged to go into work and spread the virus when they had symptoms or when they were sick.  What fines have been issued to directors and managers of nursing homes?  The outbreaks in nursing homes are rising again.  Where is the increased capacity in the Health and Safety Authority to inspect workplaces?  We were told there is one extra inspector this year.  The Government's strategy to quell the virus with practical measures is weak and instead it relies entirely on personal behaviour.  There is a very good article in <i>The Irish Times</i>today.  When I grow up I want to be able to write like Orla Muldoon.  She is a professor at the Centre for Social Issues Research at the University of Limerick:</p><blockquote>	Eulogising personal responsibility is usually a counter-narrative designed to obscure systemic failures.<br /><br />The failures in our systems are serious: an overburdened health service going back many years, a PCR testing system that cannot meet demand, a track and trace system that has not been able to keep up with the levels of reported infections, historically overcrowded classrooms where mitigations have been too long coming...<br /><br />To continue with personal responsibility as a solution to the greatest crisis of our times is a political choice.  It is also a shameful abdication of political responsibility and leadership. </blockquote> <p>I could not agree with her more.  Covid-19 has brought into sharp relief the utter failure of the capitalist economic model to protect our health and the utter failure of this right-wing Government.</p> <p>In the same breath as we seek to extend far-reaching powers, this Government has cut the pandemic unemployment payment to the bone and is due to end it completely as this legislation is extended.  There is no intention in the legislation to reintroduce the eviction ban as we face into the winter.  There is no intention to ban rent increases.  There are no measures to deal with the energy crisis and the rising prices that people are facing while they are expected to stay at home longer.  The only response to the energy crisis is for the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to announce this week that he is allowing the building of another seven gas-fired power stations to fuel data centres at a huge cost to the Exchequer.</p> <p> I do not want to be all negative and I want to finish on what we could do.  First, we need to replace the Government.  We need to get rid of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael and replace the Government with a genuine left-wing government that will defy the rules of the capitalist system and take measures that are necessary to protect people's health.  We need to increase hospital capacity to reach the EU average level of beds per 1,000 of the population and increase the ICU capacity to 500 beds, given we only have 5.6 beds per 100,000 of population whereas the average in Europe is 12 ICU beds per 100,000.  We need to bring staffing levels of public health teams up to the recommended levels as they are currently at one third of the recommendation, take private capacity of hospitals into public ownership and ensure an integrated, single-tier health system for Covid and non-Covid healthcare.  We need to resource the test and trace infrastructure to ensure rapid access to testing, including walk-in test centres, free antigen tests and state-of-the-art contact tracing, restore the contact tracing in schools in full, and work with teachers and their unions to help resolve the staffing crisis in the schools.  We need to establish legal minimum requirements for ventilation and air filtration in our workplaces and provide resources to ensure this happens.  We need to pay the nurses, midwives and student nurses, and abolish the fees they must pay to enter college to have these careers.  We need to speed up the booster vaccine programme, with priority for the vulnerable elderly,  healthcare workers and those areas of our society where there is low vaccine coverage.  Most important, we need to demand a waiver on the intellectual property rights of vaccine production.  We need to restore the PUP for those losing their jobs and their earnings because of any new advice that may come out today.  Ultimately, we have to move away from the disgraceful health service we have lived with for decades and increase our capacity to a system where we always have about 20% of overhead in case of emergency.</p> <p> They might seem like way-over-the-top socialist policies but that is what we need to do.  That is why I say that if Covid has shown us anything, it is the utter failure of the capitalist mode of production and economic activity to protect the health of human beings on the planet.</p></speech>

I made a comment like every parliamentarian.  I was elected to this House, like the Deputy, to give my view.  The Deputy wants to give everything for free - the money tree is there - and pay for absolutely nothing.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, we are back to a situation that we all wished we would not have to revisit, and it is unfortunate we are back.  I know people can blame Government policy and Government decisions and everything like that, but I laugh when I hear people on the Opposition benches standing up to say they accept the public health advice and in the next breath they rubbish it.  One issue that has come through today is the wearing of face masks for nine-year-olds.</p>  <p>  I was very fortunate and lucky to be at the Cabinet table for nine and half years.  Unfortunately, part of that was when Covid hit this country.  The Opposition parties ran for the hills when difficult decisions had to be made.  After a number of months, they wet their finger and put it up to see what way the wind was blowing, and said, &ldquo;Now we will go with whatever way the wind is blowing.&rdquo;  Fortunately for them, maybe, they do not have to make the decisions and they do not have to defend the decisions.  They can be all things to all men, and that is exactly what they have been for the past 18 to 24 months.</p>  <p>  The Government has a responsibility to protect the citizens of this State.  I think they might not always have got it right but they have done their best on every single occasion.  The public might not want to hear the messaging from Government.  This is where there is a responsibility on the Opposition with regard to the mixed messaging and everything like that.  They understand the process.  They understand when the NPHET advice comes in and the Government has to have time to consider it.</p>  <p>  There is also a responsibility on our media and our national broadcaster.  Over recent weeks, they have been disgraceful in some of the coverage they have given this issue of Covid-19.  I often think they nearly wish for it to continue because it covers plenty of hours on our national airwaves.  It is totally irresponsible behaviour given some of their broadcasting and media coverage over the past while, specifically over recent weeks.  They understand the process very well.  They are professional people.  They are being paid very well to understand it.  However, because it does not suit their narrative, they muddy the waters, create a bit of hysteria, mud throwing, and everything like that.  I would call on our national broadcaster to be more responsible in its messaging, to be more responsible in its production, to be more responsible when its presenters are going out, and to give some fair coverage and responsible coverage.  Some people on this side of the D&aacute;il will be afraid----</p></speech>

Have manners.  Did I interrupt you?</p>  <p>  I call on our national broadcaster to be responsible in its broadcasting.  That is why it is being given the licence fee to do so.</p>  <p>  It is very difficult for the Government to impose restrictions.  It has not been easy on the citizens of this State.  It has not been easy for the social fabric or the economic fabric of this State.  Yesterday, with my colleague Deputy Durkan and many others, I met people from the hospitality sector.  It has been a really difficult time for them over the past 18 months and now they have further restrictions.  The Minister is sitting at the Cabinet table.  I understand an announcement is coming up regarding economic supports for this sector and I plead with the Minister that they are given every support possible.  They were very thankful yesterday for the supports they have been given over recent months, and it was responsible of them to recognise that.</p>  <p>  We still have huge amount to learn about the new variant and we are learning as we go along.  Maybe if there had been no new variant, we might not be in this serious situation we are in today.</p>  <p>  People spoke about antigen tests.  In some European countries there are pop-up antigen tests free of charge.  It is not a swab up the nose and, although I am only going on hearsay, my understanding is it is a saliva test.  We have time between now and Christmas, or up to the middle of December, to have pop-up test facilities across Dublin, Limerick, Cork and the bigger cities, which would be a very worthwhile project.  People would get their email and when went into a restaurant would be able to say they had their antigen test in one of these pop-up facilities.</p> <p>I encourage the Minister to look at that aspect.</p> <p> My other issue concerns vaccinations for children aged five to 12.  I plead with the Minister to ensure we roll out this vaccination process as soon and as fast as possible.  It has been proven that the vaccines are working in secondary schools.  The highest rate of infection now is to be found in our primary schools.  I plead with the Minister, therefore, to get the roll-out of the vaccination process underway for those aged five to 12.  It is of the utmost importance.  I spoke with the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, about this issue at a committee meeting yesterday.  In his opening statement, the Minister said that 91% of those aged 12 years old and older have taken the opportunity to get vaccinated.  What we are witnessing here is unique, compared to the rest of the world.  We should, indeed, also make more financial supports available to Third World countries in respect of the roll-out of vaccines.  </p> <p> I could speak here for the next hour on this issue, but I plead with the Minister to look at the points I have raised.  I commend him on the job he is doing.  I also commend the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the three Government parties.  This is a very difficult time.  The Opposition has no responsibility here.  It does not want the responsibility and it will never take it in respect of this traumatic time we are witnessing as a country.</p></speech>

It is in power, and therefore it has the information and all the resources of government to be able to do what needs to be done.  Our difficulty from time to time has not been regarding measures, but the lack of a coherent plan and clear messaging.  These aspects must be improved.  We all accept that this is an incredibly difficult situation.  Everyone here, particularly from an Opposition perspective, has spoken about how we do not get the briefings.  We are not aware of all the ins and outs of the situation and all the information.  Sometimes where we get our briefings from is RT&Eacute;.  I suppose that is no different now.</p>  <p>  I see in a notification from RT&Eacute; that the Taoiseach has said that when he spoke to the CMO, the CMO and his team were exceptionally clear about their worries and that has been accepted by the Government.  We are talking about a form of restrictions between 7 December 2021 and 9 January 2022.  Nightclubs are to be closed, there is to be strict social distancing in bars and restaurants, with table service only, a distance of 1 m between tables, no multiple bookings and 50% capacity at entertainment, cultural, community and sporting events.  In addition, Covid passes will be required for gyms, leisure centres, hotel bars and restaurants.  Household visits are also now reduced to those involving four households.  There may be some variation regarding that last issue.</p>  <p>  We accept that we are in a really dangerous situation.  People are talking about the potential danger posed not only by the Delta variant that we have been dealing with already, but what we now face from Omicron as well.  Whatever we do, though, we must ensure we make up for where the messaging has not been clear.  I call for the Government to engage more with the Opposition.  That must happen.  I do not think that using this form of emergency powers almost two years into this process is the correct way to deal with this issue.  When the Government has come up with sensible solutions, we have supported them, and that is what we must have now.</p>  <p>  Difficulty arises sometimes when NPHET guidelines are issued, but then no narrative or declarations follow from the Government.  That adds to the possibilities.  Everyone here has spoken about the messaging to schools.  At best, it was fast and imperfect.  I engaged with the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, and she spoke about flexibility and common sense.  I hope that will occur in schools.  The messaging in this regard, however, must be improved.</p>  <p>  We know the situation we are dealing with.  We must deal with the issue on an international basis in respect of a waiver of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, known as the TRIPS Agreement, and thereby ensure the maximum output of vaccines across the world.  We must also get our booster process, PCR testing and everything we can do in operation as fast as possible.  We know our healthcare system is under stress and that there are weaknesses there.  However, all the tools that we can bring to bear in this regard must be brought to bear.  Therefore, I again ask the Minister for a greater level of engagement.  I think he will be happy with the response that he will get.  People out there and in here want to do the right thing.  We must, however, sell what needs to be done to the public, and that requires good, decent and clear messaging.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.422" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1504" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="17:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300057#HHH00300"><p>We in Aont&uacute; will be opposing the extension of this legislation.  We are the only political party in the Chamber that has opposed each extension of these measures.  Governance of this country is at a low ebb.  It is incredible that even today, details of NPHET's proposals concerning potential restrictions were leaked to the media before that information was even given to the Government.  Nobody thought of giving that information to the Opposition to allow us to look at these recommendations.  Now we have a situation whereby the Opposition has been forced to learn about these restrictions through the media.  The democratic structures of this State right now are an afterthought.  Will the Government do anything about the leak?  Absolutely not.  How can a Government that has been built on leaks do anything about leaks from other organisations?</p>  <p>  It is important to state that there is good news.  The hospitalisation figures regarding Covid-19 are falling.  We would not know this currently by the narrative that is out there, but thankfully the numbers of those requiring care in ICUs and hospitalisation more generally are down.  The incidence of the virus is highest among the very young, but there is good news there as well.  The damage done to the very young is thankfully low.  Nobody under the age of 14 has died from Covid-19 in the last two years in this State.</p>  <p>  For 19 months, in fairness to the Government as well, it also made the point that young people were protected from the worst aspects of this virus.  However, for some strange reason, the Government has significantly flipped its message in the last four weeks.  The truth of the matter is that Covid-19 is going nowhere fast.  Whether they are vaccinated or not, most people in this country are likely to get Covid-19.  We need to be careful and we must protect the vulnerable.  The best way to do that, though, is by creating hospital capacity.  Inaction with regard to capacity is one of the biggest threats to the protection that can be afforded to people with Covid-19 in this State, as well to the 1 million people on the waiting lists for treatment.  The differential between the number of ICU beds that exist and the number there should be is 260.  That is double the number of ICU beds taken up by people with Covid-19.  The lack of Government investment, therefore, is a bigger threat to ICU capacity than Covid-19, and that is saying something.  </p>  <p>  In addition, regarding hospital capacity, some 70,000 people applied to the Be on Call for Ireland campaign.  People came home from Australia and elsewhere to help with human resources and hospital capacity, but only 400 of those people were employed.  That is an incredible thing.  No matter what kind of marketing bumf we get from the Minister opposite, the truth of the matter is that the dial has hardly been moved when it comes to increasing healthcare capacity.  </p>  <p>  One of the other big issues in this regard has been access to antigen testing at specific venues.  We in Aont&uacute; have been calling for that for more than a year.  It is one of the biggest failures of this Government.  It has been talking about it for 14 months, and has been refusing to decide.  When it finally did make decisions in this regard, it then quickly U-turned, and finally outsourced the matter of antigen testing to Lidl and Aldi.</p>  <p>  Nursing homes and hospitals have been at the epicentre of the Covid-19 crisis in this State.  The majority of people who have died in this State have caught Covid-19 in a hospital or nursing home.  These are two areas for which the Minister is directly responsible.  It is incredible.  We have brought much information to light in this regard.  In the first six months of 2020, some 10,000 people were moved from hospitals into nursing homes.  The advice at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic was to stop visitors going into nursing homes, but the Government overturned that.  For another month, visitors were circulating in nursing homes.</p>  <p>  We have called for an investigation regarding this matter, but the Government has refused.  Therefore, we in Aont&uacute; have drafted a Bill and submitted it.  We hope to be able to speak to it soon.  It is intended to facilitate the setting up of an investigation into what happened in the nursing homes.  We must remember that more people died in nursing homes and hospitals than in any other institutions since the founding of this State.  There must be an investigation into this issue.</p>  <p>  Instead of building capacity and doing the simple things right, such as air filtration, PCR tests and contact tracing, something else has happened.</p> <p>The Government has leaned on the people of Ireland with great cost and look at what it has done.  It has been a complete Horlicks in a range of matters from the very start.  We had the &euro;9 meal we were told was safer than &euro;8 meals and pubs had to keep records of meals sold for 28 days.  There were calls to bring in the Army to control students.  There was a limit of ten people at a funeral in the largest buildings in town when dozens of people were in queues for wine and crisps in the shops directly opposite.  We had people able to drink pints while standing in public spaces but not allowed to do it sitting down, and this led to riot police charging at people a couple of streets away from this D&aacute;il Chamber.  We heard debates on whether socks were essential items of clothing and saw nightclubs closed.</p> <p> Incredibly, parents, teachers and students were given a 16-hour space in which to implement a diktat putting masks on nine-year-old children.  The idea the Government would refuse education to a nine-year-old child with glasses who cannot see when wearing a mask because the spectacles fog up is absolutely incredible.  There is the nonsense of being able to get a Covid-19 test in this State before travelling abroad and the same test allowing re-entry into the country.  The Zappone Merrion Hotel affair also demonstrated the rules were for the little people and not the Government.  The Government has been a fiasco factory for over 18 months.  It has relied on yo-yo restrictions over and back and they have caused enormous damage to the fabric of our society.  Everywhere we look, people are afraid because of what is happening in this country.</p> <p> Covid-19 is going nowhere and we must live with it.  That means we must do our best to protect life but also do our best to keep society open.  We are being told to follow the science but every time I put in a question, I am told there is none.  I asked NPHET if any research was done on the Covid-19 pass but it said there was not.  The Covid-19 pass lets people into hospitality who have Covid-19 and can stop people who do not have Covid-19 from using the hospitality.  It is incredible.  I asked the Government a week ago now if there was any evidence to support the mandatory wearing of masks by young children in schools but none has been forthcoming.</p> <p> I know the Minister is busy but I ask him to listen to the facts.  I have information, some of which is from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre website.  Additional data have been released to me as well.  In the past four weeks there were 26 outbreaks in nursing homes,  81 outbreaks in hospitals, 27 outbreaks in residential centres for people with disabilities and seven outbreaks in refuges for women.  In the same period there were three outbreaks in hotels, four outbreaks in pubs and two outbreaks in restaurants.  Right now there are 20 times more outbreaks in hospitals than there are in pubs in this State.  That information was given to me by the Minister's Department and it contains such damning figures.  Again, the locations where people should be most protected are those where probably the most damage is happening in the State.</p> <p> I only have a little time left.  Unfortunately, the Minister is presiding over a crumbling health service while pontificating to struggling small and medium-sized enterprises, including pubs and restaurant owners etc., on keeping people safe.</p> <p> If we want to reduce infection rates in hospitals, we must start introducing antigen tests for people wishing to access those hospital buildings.  The problem is the Government is blind to such possibilities.  It was going to wind up NPHET a month ago and Mr. Paul Reid said in August that when we hit a 20% vaccination rate, the whole country would open.  The truth is the level of transmission between those who are vaccinated is far higher than expected.  The vaccine has absolutely done tremendous work in reducing the level of damage caused by the illness with respect to mortality and morbidity but it has not stopped transmission.  The Government has not taken this into consideration with its current policies and actions.  We must introduce antigen testing to replace the Covid-19 pass so we can reduce the level of illness in hospitals.</p> <p> The Government has gotten away with its actions in large part because the Opposition has been atrocious over the past while.  Sinn F&eacute;in sat on the fence for almost two years, afraid to make a mistake while it waits to be part of the Government.  The smaller parties have gone down a zero Covid cul-de-sac from the start.  The Social Democrats, for example, said the country should not open until we get to a level of fewer than ten cases per day.  It is an incredible figure and if the policy had been followed, the country would never have opened at all.  It is incredible the country's smallest and newest political movement in this D&aacute;il has provided the strongest opposition to the disastrous policies from this Government.</p></speech>

That is from the Bill itself.</p>  <p>  I listen to science and I took account of swabbing, mask use, testing and tracing, ventilation, social distancing, rapid and not so rapid testing.  The truth is we would not be in our current space if not for our society and the development of Covid-19 vaccines.  They have put us in a singularly more positive place than we could have hoped to have been 12 months ago.  We have one of the highest vaccine take-up rates in Europe now.  That said, many are still decrying the actions taken to date, including the mandatory implementation of restrictions, the closing of businesses and schools, restrictions to civil liberties etc.</p>  <p>  The Omicron variant is still being assessed for the possibility of a higher rate of transmissibility.  The key to understanding restrictions is to comprehend that a higher level of infection nationally will lead to a higher number of people being significantly ill.  These additional sick people, combined with our current hospital population, would completely overwhelm our healthcare system, and this is what we are trying to defend against.</p>  <p>  I am not a fan of restrictions.  I am a member of the Regional Independent Group, which was first to propose an amendment in this House that would add a sunset clause to the legislation the Minister is proposing to extend.  In my previous contribution to the Minister some weeks ago, I asked that he would not return to the House without seeking a new mandate for an extension of powers.  That said, the new variant is, unfortunately, a game changer.  We cannot afford to delay in trying to suppress this virus in our general population and society.  Some of the powers being debated, including the right to detain people under certain circumstances, should only be exercised as a last resort and we need a definite date for their termination.</p>  <p>  I will speak to what we are doing and what we are not.  With air travel, we have not yet implemented a testing system, and it has been announced that it is again delayed for another 48 hours.  The system will require people arriving to the State, whether vaccinated or not, to have a negative Covid-19 test result.  Those people travelling with an antigen test result would need it done within 48 hours of the arrival into the country and it must be professionally administered.  Those with a PCR test result have a longer window of 72 hours.</p>  <p>  I will reflect what a Galway man has passed to me.  He is travelling to Birmingham tonight with three family members and has booked antigen tests in the UK at a cost of &pound;116.  He and his family are returning on Sunday night and rapid testing may not detect a virus he could contract in the UK before returning freely to Ireland.  The Minister knows I have lobbied for antigen testing for close to two years.  Why are we using them now in a fashion we know is ineffective?  Why do we not require subsequent antigen or PCR testing days later for those who are returning on flights from abroad?  Communications is a key area and one might ask how senior establishment figures who rubbished antigen testing for more than 12 months can suddenly embrace it and see it used in a way for which it was never designed or intended to be used.</p>  <p>  Given that we are being asked to extend these health regulations, at what point will NPHET solely advise the Government and stop advising the people?  </p> <p>We have had various examples of recommendations from public health officials where the Government has challenged, endorsed or ignored the advice.  This mixed messaging is causing further anxiety and some distrust in the general population.  Leaders lead; followers follow.</p> <p> The failure of public health officials to acknowledge other voices which have often been proved correct continues to be a significant cause of concern to me and many others.  Public health messaging needs to be curtailed to Government communications only so that the Government alone should advocate public health actions and accept that responsibility.  Were the Government to take sole initiative and exercise sole responsibility, it would reduce the ambiguity and mixed messaging that is causing distress to many.</p> <p> I refer to some reports that were done nationally, not by public health professionals but by joint committees of the Oireachtas.  The health committee did a key report on antigen testing, which it strongly recommended but that was resisted until recently.  Another report was published by that committee on the potential of vitamin D supplementation.  It too has been, and continues to be, ignored, including by our most senior and prominent public health visionaries.  There are thousands of reports in the EU advocating vitamin D supplementation as mitigation against Covid-19 infection and serious disease progression.  In Ireland, a year-long study charting the possible relationships between low vitamin D concentration and adverse outcomes has been published in Irish medical journals recently.  It is not the double blind, randomised control trial protocol signally demanded by our public health officials and it can never be as we cannot deprive a control group of vitamin D.  There is significant and ample evidence to base a public campaign on vitamin D supplementation across society, yet we continue to ignore a simple and probably very beneficial Covid mitigation exercise.</p> <p> With regard to restrictions and their further extensions, we must support the hospitality sector.  The recent announcement to reduce employer supports and temporarily the support to redundant employees must be rethought in light of new public health restrictions and messaging.  While the public sector and multinationals have continued to function largely without financial impact, that is not true of SMEs.  They employ close to 1 million people in this country.  If we are all in this together, no one must be left behind.</p> <p> We are facing into a very difficult Christmas and new year.  We are not alone in facing this challenge as there is a resurgence of Covid across Europe and the world, but we must learn from our past mistakes.  We cannot continue to delay, deny or to defend our recent failures brought about by our failure to act in a timely and supportive way.  We must rely on the full analysis of the scientific community, national and international, and we have to act in defence of the science.  We must act quickly and use all available technology to mitigate the pandemic.  Most of all, people want clarity.  If there are significant further restrictions in the offing, the Government needs to be straight with the people and explain what it is doing and why, and why there are no other choices or better possibilities.  It is time for the Government to become proactive in the fight against Covid and to use all the State's intellect and intellectual actors to design the best way out of this pandemic.  We cannot just wait for multiple European reports to tell us what our hospital doctors and medics have said for months without being listened to.  We must retrace our steps around community and hospital care.  We must ensure that every resource available is brought to bear to suppress this latest wave.  We need the public to be fully on board and for that we need action based on facts, not listening to the voices advocating science fiction.</p></speech>

Everyone forgets that we had that for 50 years and it failed.  We could go back in that direction again, try out another experiment and say, "That is the way to go."  Then we think of Venezuela where the cactus blows around the streets.  One can imagine the music of Ennio Morricone as Clint Eastwood rides into town in the midst of it all.  That scenario will solve no problems at all; it will only make what we have worse.  One thing is certain.  The front-line workers have been tremendous in how they have done the job in the face of an appalling attack from the virus.  The Government has responded to the virus in every way possible.  That should be acknowledged and the Government complimented for it.  Had the Government run away and or gone off in different directions every day, we would have a bigger problem.</p></speech>

That is the simple answer and we would want to watch out for that.  What has happened is the Opposition has changed its views hourly and daily.  It forgets one thing.  The virus has changed almost every day and the urgency of the virus has also changed.  It has become necessary to do different things in a different fashion in a different sequence on a daily basis.</p>  <p>  Let us consider other countries across the globe.  They have had the same problems as this country and they have had to change their tactics.  They have had to take much more extreme measures than in this country in an effort to curtail the virus.  Of course there are some things we can do.  Air purification for indoor settings such as schools was mentioned.  I think that could work.  I am not certain about whether the costs would be prohibitive but it may well have to happen.  Some of these inventions have the capacity to remove 100% of the virus.  There is a very strong case for them, particularly in indoor settings such as hospitals, nursing homes, and schools.  The Minister could examine that to see how it might fit in because it would have an impact and make a difference, which we need. </p>  <p>  I can understand why Opposition Members, although not all of them, would resort to political allegations.  That is fine but the only thing wrong with that is this situation is too serious to allow politics to cloud our vision.  We must look at what is before us and how best to deal with it.  To be fair, some of the Opposition continue to do that.  At this point, we are either against it or for it.  There is no sense in pretending it does not exist and that it does not affect us or that it will happen to somebody else.  There is a tendency to ignore the fact that more than 5,000 people have died and that some children have been affected and those in other younger age groups, and that there were very serious consequences for them.  We tend to forget that as well.  The consequences do not go away with the passage time.  We must take account of the seriousness of the pandemic.  All measures we think of must be put in place to ensure that we curtail its progress.</p>  <p>  I wonder how best to proceed from here.  Do we listen to the people who protest at the gate and say there should be no vaccines and it is all a conspiracy?  That is grand but that affects our families, which it has the capacity to do in every instance.  All the sacrifice and good work done by the front-line workers, and by the Minister and the Government, will go to nought if we start to ignore the advice that we have been given.  If the Government did not do the right thing we would be guilty of absolute abdication of responsibility.  It would been charged with criminal negligence.  It is a difficult task and there are more brickbats than plaudits, unfortunately, but that is the way life is.  However, the Government has to keep its eye on the ball.</p> <p>It must keep its eye on the target.  It must stay with it.  It must call on the public to use their best judgment as well and so far they have, and they have co-operated.  However, all the sacrifices the public has made so far will be to no avail unless we continue right down to the end.  That spot of light may remain far away in the distance for a long time more - we do not know.  However, if we put out the light and stop doing the best things to deal with the situation we will find ourselves in a situation that will be beyond recovery.</p> <p> In conclusion, I simply tell the Minister to stick with it.  He should take the right decisions.  He should not be afraid to do what is likely to have a positive impact insofar as the virus is concerned.  It is a difficult and challenging road.  There will be more challenges and people will ask is this really worth it.  They may ask whether we should have done anything.  They may ask whether we should let people die, a Darwinian theory suggested in some places, so that eventually we get a resistance to the virus.  I think we are doing the right thing.  I think the Minister is doing the right thing.  He should just continue and hope that sufficient support and co-operation with the policies pursued by the Government on behalf of the people will eventually wear the virus down.</p></speech>

I listened to Deputy Lahart speaking about the Opposition.  He was giving out and saying we should be more measured in what we say and that we were not acknowledging the huge and great work being done in the area of education.  I have absolutely no problem saying school principals and communities are doing tremendous work, given the restrictions and the way they are hamstrung by overcrowded classrooms and a lack of investment over the years in the school buildings themselves.  Since it was announced they were all going to get CO2 monitors, there has been mixed messaging from Ministers, Departments and education and training boards.  There has also been a lack of planning with the messages being sent out.  Who forgot to tell the IMO and GPs they were going to face a wave of parents looking for genuine letters of exemption for children who have problems breathing if they wear a mask for a whole day?  Somebody forget to tell those doctors because in cases I have dealt with GPs are refusing to issue such letters because they are afraid of the flood of applications.  We are now in a situation where the measures are in place and most children I know in secondary school have accepted them thus far and have worked well with them.  However, I am sorry to say they are freezing in their classrooms at this stage.  We need to get real about a situation where we have children in classrooms wearing their coats, scarves, gloves and hats.  Anything else we do on these issues must be tied to a financial package, which should have been announced at the same time as the Minister was bringing in this legislation.  The EWSS and the PUP should have been reinstated in full for those sectors and for the people whose livelihoods are going to be affected by additional restrictions.</p></speech>

I thank you for your f&iacute;or-fh&aacute;ilte.  I am glad to see you are back in full swing as well.</p>  <p>  This evening, we are once more in a situation where restrictions are being rolled out.  They have been drip-fed to us all week which has put businesses into disarray.  People are contacting the offices of all politicians about the cancellations and the uncertainty.  I am not talking only about hospitality but about boutiques, shops and clothes shops.  People were spending a little for Christmas.  Deposits have been paid and people are now looking for them back, and whatever else.  The people have gone through hell and back.</p>  <p>  Either the vaccine passes are useless and we should get rid of them, or they work and we certainly do not need further restrictions.  It must be one or the other.  Both situations cannot be true at the same time.  However, this Government, while acting as though the vaccine passes do not work by implementing restrictions, continues to discuss the extension and widespread use of other restrictions.  It is bizarre.  Where is the logic?  Where is the science it always talks about?  The Minister has failed dismally to get this situation under control.  NPHET has failed in its duties and has lost the support of the public.  It lost it a long time ago.  The Government has failed to build up hospital bed capacity and ICU capacity despite being given the resources to do so.  I put on record the HSE and the Department of Health got an extra &euro;3.884 billion on top of the &euro;20 billion-odd they had for 2020.  That is not to mention what they have spent this year which we are just coming to the close of.  I shudder to think we have so little capacity in our ICUs and that it has been so little increased.  The waste has been shocking.  The Government has failed to build up hospital bed capacity and ICU capacity despite being given the huge resources, as I said, and huge additional powers that are in this legislation and which I will refer to in a minute.</p>  <p>  Thanks to a parliamentary question from Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, we know 26 new outbreaks have taken place in our nursing homes, 81 in hospital settings and 27 in residential care for people with disabilities.  These are places we need to protect and have not protected.  There have been seven in refuges and places of respite for women.  However, once again we are picking on hospitality.  It is an easy group to pick on and one that has been hammered all the way through although there have been very few cases in hospitality.  I have the figures somewhere but cases in hotels, pubs and so on would not come up to the figure for hospital outbreaks.  I think there have been about 12 hospitality outbreaks in all in the last four weeks.  It is shocking.</p>  <p>  I have serious concerns about the powers of NPHET, its level of control over almost every element of Irish society at present and its lack of accountability.  A very eminent paediatrician contacted me today saying paediatricians were not consulted about the mask-wearing enforcement for children.  Although it is only a requirement, the Government is putting the fear of God into school boards of management and principals.  I have been contacted my numerous such people who have a duty of care to the children, and they know that.  They have huge responsibilities and they know that as well.  The boards are voluntary ones that do tremendous work, as do the principals and their staff, and now they are in this perilous situation.  I understand NPHET has no paediatrician among its extensive advisory groups.  HIQA has advised them twice already, I think, not to mask young children, that it was not good for them, and that advice has been thrown in the bin.  Thus, if we want to use HIQA to tell the nursing homes to do something then we do that but when it gives advice NPHET does not like we just bin it.  Who holds NPHET to account when it is wide of the mark?  When there are leaks and misinformation coming out of NPHET, leading to despair within an industry, who does it answer to?  When NPHET ignores bodies such as HIQA, implements restrictions on our children with no debate, no requirement for legislation, no pre-legislative scrutiny and no parental consent how can we say we are operating in a functional and democratic society?  We clearly are not.</p> <p>The Minister, and his Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste and Cabinet, have abdicated their responsibility to NPHET.  Sideshows and competition for the airwaves are going on.  If it is not one of them, it is the other and the mixed messaging has been appalling.  Members of NPHET have no business being on the airwaves.  This Government has been duly elected and voted in, not thanks to me, as part of a cobbled up coalition.  It is hiding behind NPHET.  The Government wants to let it do this because it thinks it is good or it does not have the gumption to face NPHET down when it needs to.  Yes, listen to its science, when it is correct, and its advice, but the Government makes decisions for our people.  I asked the Minister previously in this House, when he was going to sign all these statutory instruments that are in this legislation tonight - when he was in the Opposition he railed against them - and knowing the conventions, who was pushing his hand?  Is it the heavy hand of big pharma that is pushing the Minister to sign instrument after instrument, one more draconian than the next?<br/><br/>As I said, we are again facing severe restrictions, with Christmas coming on top of them, when people want to be happy and celebrate the holy season and the birth of Our Lord.  The Government tells us more than 93% of our population is vaccinated.  Where does this end?  We have arrived at a situation whereby the hospitality sector is once again facing frightening restrictions and NPHET wants to tell the public who they can and cannot have in their homes.  Will we get serious?  This is not fair.  People in the hospitality sector and other industries will be forced onto the PUP but what about all the people coming off those payments?  They will not be able to get back on them again and they need to be supported into the future and the new year.  What about the music and entertainment industry and many other areas I could talk about all night long?<br/><br/>I will refer to this draconian legislation the Government is implementing.  We only got the Bill yesterday and a briefing note late last Thursday for what is a conglomeration of four previous Acts now put into one.  The Minister did not call it an omnibus, but he could.  It is giving the Government new and dangerous powers.  Power is a dangerous thing.  The Minister has never sat in the offices of the Department of Health without these powers.  He does not know what it is like to be an ordinary Minister with normal powers.  The extension of section 2, Part 3 of the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020, which amends the principal 1974 Act by the insertion of section 38A, raises serious legal and ethical concerns surrounding the detention and isolation of persons in certain circumstances.  These are not my words but those of legal experts who have voluntarily helped me to put this together tonight.<br/><br/>I remind the Minister that internment was introduced in 1971 in the Six Counties.  Section 38A contravenes Article 5, the right to liberty, Article 6, the right to a fair trial and Article 8, the right to private and family life of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 40.4 of the Constitution.  Has the Minister read or looked at all this?  Who is drafting this legislation for him?  Why does he think he has the power to bring in instruments that deal with all this?  There is no sufficient evidence base for the extension of this sweeping power, which provides a medical officer with the power to make an order, in writing, for: </p><blockquote>	the detention and isolation of such person in a hospital or other place specified in the order [we do not know what that is yet] (including ... other hospital[s] or other place as may subsequently be appropriate and specified in the order) [which the Minister may fill in and sign with no recourse to the D&aacute;il] until such time as ... [that] medical officer certifies that the person's detention is no longer required for the purposes of this section. </blockquote> <p>That is quite draconian by any yardstick.  The medical officer can invoke the powers under section 38A(1) where he or she:</p><blockquote>	believes in good faith that - <br /><br />(a) a person is a potential source of infection, and <br /><br />(b) the person is a potential risk to public health, and<br /><br />(c) his or her detention and isolation is appropriate in order to-  	(i) prevent, limit, minimise or slow the spread of Covid-19, and <br /><br />(ii) minimise the risk to human life and public health, <br /><br />and  (d) such [a] person cannot be effectively isolated, refuses to remain or appears unlikely to remain in his or her home or other accommodation ... agreed, by the Health Service Executive. </blockquote> <p>The Minister should pay attention to the Government's own services.  I just quoted the figures, courtesy of Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, of outbreaks in hospital settings in the past four weeks and compared them with outbreaks in other areas.  They are minuscule in those other areas compared with what is going on under the Minister's watch, yet he is penalising the people.  The necessity of the extension of this measure has not been demonstrated.  In accordance with the Freedom of Information Act 2014, the Health Service Executive should and must provide details of how many orders have been made under section 38A(1) since the inception of the emergency legislation in March 2020.  We have not got those details and I hope the Minister knows it.  It is in the interests of transparency, openness and the public interest for such information to be published before any debate on the necessity to extend power to detain and isolate a person, depriving him or her of his or her rights to a fair trial and to his or her private family life and liberty.  Is that why there was no pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill and why it was not brought to committee?  The fact is the Minister is bringing together three or four Acts that have had no pre-legislative scrutiny, were rushed through the D&aacute;il with little debate and passed because of the Government majority.  Did he not want pre-legislative scrutiny because he might be asked these questions?<br/><br/>According to section 38A(2) a medical officer in exercising this power shall have regard to &quot;the fact that Covid-19 is recently declared by the World Health Organisation to be a pandemic&quot;.  It was declared a pandemic in March 2020.  How long will the clock be stopped at 2020?  The WHO also has many questions to answer and Minister cannot say this is a necessary implement now, some 21 months later.  It is now 21 months since the announcement of these emergency powers and the State has had ample opportunity to put in place public health measures for the purpose of preventing, limiting, diminishing or slowing the spread of Covid-19, referred to under section 38A, with the consequential effect that this measure is no longer justifiable.  Such a power can only be justified if the State can show a grave risk to life.  Recent statistics issued by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, showed a dramatic decrease, thank God, in Covid-19 related deaths since 2020.  These are the basic, naked facts and the science proves them, but the Minister uses science selectively.<br/><br/>The reasoning and rationale for this measure no longer exists and the State has not provided sufficient proof to justify any extension of such a draconian power.  The existence of the Omicron variant, and ever-emerging new variants, is not sufficient for such powers to remain in a democratic society.  We will get variants, like all the storms, with a different acronym for every one of them.  The very fact the medical officer can make an order under section 38A(1) if a person is a potential source of infection and a potential risk to public health raises fundamental issues surrounding the subjective implementation of these terms.  It is deeply concerning that one medical officer has the power to make such an order based on his or her belief, in good faith, that a person is a potential source of infection.  In effect, this means that a person can be made subject to a detention and isolation order without testing positive for Covid-19.  That is truly shocking in my opinion and in the opinion of the legal experts, whom I thank for formulating that opinion with me.  This means a person could be detained and isolated by a medical officer as a result of that officer's subjective view of what constitutes a potential source of infection and a potential risk to public health.<br/><br/>There are no safeguards in place to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of the person who could be deprived of his or her liberty on the word of said medical officer.  For example, in this current climate, it is not beyond the imagination that a medical officer could make such an order for detention and isolation under section 38A(1), simply because a person is unvaccinated, for whatever reason, whether it is because he or she is unable to take the vaccine or because of choice.  The power of detention process is open to abuse as the Act requires only one medical officer to make an order for detention.  That is quite serious and dangerous in a so-called democracy and a so-called republic.  Under section 38(A), the medical officer:</p><blockquote>	may in writing order the detention and isolation of such person in a hospital or other place specified in the order (including such other hospital or other place as may subsequently be appropriate and specified in the order). </blockquote> <p>You could end up in the Curragh Camp or anywhere.</p>  <p>It will be up to the Minister's officials and his hand to sign the order.  Does the Minister realise what he is taking upon himself?  I think he does.  I think he is punch-drunk with these powers and he has not a clue how to run the Department or rein in or deal with the pandemic in the medical system.<br/><br/>I will continue from where I left off: &quot;(including such other hospital or other place as may subsequently be appropriate and specified in the order) until such time as the medical officer certifies that the person's detention is no longer required for the purposes of this section&quot;.  I do not see that as anything different from what happened in the North in 1971.  The extensive power to detain a person in any place specified in the order is not defined under the Act, which effectively means that a person could be detained anywhere at the discretion of the medical officer.  There are no definitions.  Most legislation has definitions and appeal systems.  This is more rushed legislation.  There has been no pre-legislative scrutiny on it.  The Government is getting away with blue murder - if it gets away with this and if enough people vote for it.  I hope they will not.  I and my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group certainly will not.<br/><br/>The Act does not specify the maximum period of detention, which is also very serious.  It states that a medical officer may, in writing, order the detention and isolation of a person in a hospital until such time as the medical officer certifies that the person's detention is no longer required.  In other words, that person would be there at the whim of the medical officer.  The medical officer is under a duty to review the detention no later than 14 days.  The detained person can be incarcerated for 14 days.  He or she has no right to request a review by another person other than that medical officer, not even another medical physician, but there are no details on this process.  That breaches the rules of fair procedure, due process and natural justice.  Has the Minister ever heard of those?  Has he lost sight of them all?  He was Independent, like me, then he was with the Social Democrat and then he jumped to Fianna F&aacute;il.  Then, through whatever sleazy deal, he became Minister for Health.  Has he lost his moral compass and his respect for the people's rights and the Constitution?  He must have done.<br/><br/>The State has failed to justify the proportionality and necessity for such a far-reaching measure, depriving people of their right to liberty.  That is very serious 100 years after the likes of Treacy, Breen, Liam Lynch and Michael Collins fought so hard and unfortunately died in the War of Independence and the Civil War and all the people who sacrificed their lives.  I have heard people here looking for people to ring snitch lines.  That has come from parties I am very surprised with.  They are looking for people to report on people and so on.  We are dividing society and creating an apartheid and it is totally wrong.<br/><br/>The variant is not a specific enough reason for these measures.  We have some clinical trial data from the pre-Alpha strains and lab data for Delta.  We may overlook some data, but we have no epidemiological information that the vaccination has had any impact on the epidemic.  For Omicron, the genetic data suggest the vaccines may not work.  It will take at least two weeks to find out whether they work in the labs.  As the example of Delta has shown, even lab data are not enough to justify any restrictions or mandates.  We need evidence that the restrictions and mandates have an effect.  Just having them there is not good enough.  It is not good enough for the Minister to do what he is doing just because he wants these measures in place and likes his powers and wants to keep them to beat down our resilient, brilliant people, many of whom we have so sadly lost.  Even one life lost is sad, but many people have succumbed to this virus.  A significant number of people have died in nursing homes and hospitals.  I have called time and time again for an internationally led investigation of what happened and the incarceration that went on here.  I believe the Hague will have to be invoked and that people will have to be brought before the world courts there.<br/><br/>The UK and Ireland had a narrow peak in late January and a nadir in late May.  The EU's nadir was a month later.  For the current wave, this means that Ireland's deaths, thankfully, are flat and not going up as in the EU, thank God.  The UK and Ireland are past the peak of the Delta variant.  That is the science and they are the facts, thankfully.  The number of deaths per million per day is 1,000 in the EU, which is horrific, 100 in the UK and ten in Ireland.  The 1:10 Ireland-UK ratio <i>per capita</i>has been the same for the past 18 months.  There is ample science if the Minister wants to listen to it.  The people put their shoulders to the wheel and invoked the sense of the meitheal of our good old country of Ireland and helped one another, ag cabhr&uacute; le gach duine, but now they are downtrodden and broken and the Minister is trying to kill their spirit and their resolve.  The Government has that done to many sections of society such as our music, our culture, &aacute;r dteanga and many other areas.  I ask the Minister to withdraw this legislation and to bring it back to pre-legislative scrutiny.  It is time to give people hope.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  Together we can fight this and go on honestly and truthfully, facing the people with truth.</p></speech>

The people I represent are weary.  We are all, I think, weary at this stage, nobody more, I suspect, than the Minister.  Notwithstanding that, I am here, along with some of my colleagues, to oppose this Bill and to try to explain in brief why I am opposing it.</p>  <p>  In March 2020, in the first substantive debate on the pandemic after the last general election, I recall sitting over there beside Deputy Connolly and we were both very concerned, as I think many people were, by the extraordinary powers that were being given over to the Government to make law and regulation without any degree of accountability or debate.  However, we agreed to them because we were concerned about the news that was coming in and we were told they would be in place for a short period.  During the first lockdown we were told we were locking down to flatten the curve for just a few short weeks.  Covid was not eliminated but the curve was flattened.  Slowly it started to spread again.  Then we had another lockdown in October.  That lockdown was in order that we could all save Christmas or have a meaningful Christmas.  I always thought that was a dubious basis on which to lock down, but it was one that was dreamt up by members of NPHET, no less, so people generally went along with it.  Then we locked down after Christmas and it was a very long lockdown.  We were told the restrictions would be eased slowly in order that we would not have to go back.  We were told we would lock down until enough people were vaccinated.  We were told - not by the Minister, I accept, but by various experts in the media - that would be 80%.  Then we were told that 80% of adults would not be enough and that we needed more people vaccinated so we needed to stay locked down a little longer to achieve that, and we did that.  All the while the Minister wielded these extraordinary powers the D&aacute;il had granted to him for a very short period.  Those powers were extended, extended again and extended while we were told they would not be used, and now we are told they will be used.  Now we are told the powers which are to expire - because we were told they would not need to be used - are being rolled over again.  The Minister tells us they will be rolled over until 31 March and that some of the measures can be further rolled over again and again but others can be rolled over only once.  Of course, however, another piece of legislation such as this can be introduced.</p>  <p>  Until when are we locking down or imposing restrictions?  When is the end point?  I listened carefully to the debate.</p> <p>Deputy Durkan said we need to see this out to the end.  I respectfully ask what that means.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.440" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1518" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="18:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300063#OOO00300"><p>I do not know of any immunologist or serious academic on the issue of Covid-19 who says it will end.  Safety is always relative and complete safety is impossible to attain.  Increasingly, people have elected governments to keep them safe and governments have taken more and more powers to keep people safe.  Yet, unfortunately, safety is unattainable.  Again I ask when is the end.  Are we talking about the end of Covid?  If we are, I fear we are deluding ourselves.  If we are talking about locking down and restricting essential freedoms until the end of Covid, we are talking about restricting them forever because nobody suggests Covid will come to an end.  Will we impose these restrictions until we reach the end of liberal democracy as we know it?</p><p>I am not just talking about Ireland.  The Minister has left for, I am sure, good reason but, in fact, some of our restrictions look mild compared with what we see on the television screens from Australia, in particular, and many other countries.  We are, in my view, witnessing the end of liberal democracy or even democracy as we know it.  Democracy is more than a tyranny of the majority.  It is the ability to question regulations and laws, to ask the basis for them and to probe whether the underlying assumptions are correct.  We have not had that because those who effectively determine what we should do are not amenable to this D&aacute;il because they are not Members of it and do not have a duty to come before it.  They advise the Minister.  Rather, they advise the public and the media what they will advise the Minister and put it up to the Minister to do that.  If he does, he has them to fall back on.  If he does not do it and things go wrong, which they will because we will not be safe and Covid will not end, then he will be pilloried for not having followed the public health advice.  However, the public health advice is focused on one thing only: the suppression of Covid-19.  That is something I support and always have but I do not accept it is the only basis on which we should be running our society or economy.  I am not saying economic rights or the economy are more important but our healthcare system is dependent upon an economy to function.</p><p>I will go a little bit into these powers.  We had a Covid committee at one point.  The Minister, who, unfortunately, is not here at the moment, was a member of that committee.  We had a former Supreme Court judge from the United Kingdom address us.  He said:</p> <blockquote> 	[I]f the Government is going to confer extremely drastic powers on the Executive or Ministers, it is extremely important to have a very high level of parliamentary scrutiny.  These powers should only be available subject to parliamentary confirmation and regulation and they should have a very limited duration and be open to renewal.  It seems to me that for democracy it is absolutely fundamental that the Legislature should not forfeit pretty well day-to-day control of what Ministers are doing with powers which in any normal circumstances would be regarded as inconsistent with basic democratic laws. </blockquote>  <p>He concluded:</p> <blockquote> 	I have read the Health Act 1947 of Ireland ... [which is what we are essentially extending. He said:] it seems to me that the provisions for parliamentary scrutiny are virtually non-existent.  That seems to me, as a democrat, to be questionable. </blockquote>  <p>Deputies do not have to go to England to find this criticism.  A group of academics in Trinity College Dublin examined the whole thing and reported in August.  They came to the conclusion that, &quot;The relationship between the government and NPHET&mdash;and the locus of power in that relationship&mdash;isn&rsquo;t always clear.&quot;  That is essentially the construct we are extending and rolling over in the legislation.  That is why I opposed it as a democrat who was democratically elected.  The people can get rid of me at the next election and possibly they will.</p></speech>

The assistant professor in Trinity said:</p> <blockquote> 	The overarching finding of this report is a significant lack of transparency in how and why important decisions were made during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland.<br /><br />Transparency and clarity are key aspects of public health governance and one of our recommendations of this report is the need for far more.  [That is, far more transparency.]  If we don&rsquo;t have clear lines of decision-making and accountability, and a clear sense of the power resting with the government, then the idea that we can have even notional democratic oversight for ... [those] powers seems very remote. ... [That] is undoubtedly a cause for concern. </blockquote>  <p>It is because that construct is being rolled over that I must, in conscience, oppose this.  I do not oppose public health doctors giving public health advice.  I oppose the abdication of parliamentary accountability in a democracy to public health doctors.  I believe it is wrong, dangerous and will end in a crisis because Covid-19 shows no signs of ending and nobody is predicting it will end.  On that basis, I oppose the Bill.</p></speech>

For the youngsters of this country, the announcement this evening is devastating.  It is devastating not alone for them but for any person who talks about being a politician or being involved in politics because we politicians saw what was coming from NPHET today on our phones.  It was not from a Minister.  We did not get any briefing.</p>  <p>  It is similar to every bit of emergency legislation that has come in to this D&aacute;il in the past year.  Some of it was got ready on a Thursday or Friday and, over the weekend, every journalist was able to write about what we would look at next week.  If we are elected by the people, we should be informed.  Government Ministers, especially, should be informed of what is coming down the line and not reading it on a phone, like we did two to three hours ago, before our Taoiseach came out to tell the people.  It was not a new story because it was on the phones before he came out.  We knew what was going to happen.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, Ministers are in a no-win position.  The likes of NPHET will make their decisions.  If a Minister does not go with it, he or she is made a pariah in the media.</p> <p>Between the media and the doctors running this country, we are like the last link in the chain.  We come in here and we vote one way or the other, be it on a Wednesday, Friday or Saturday evening, but all we are really doing is endorsing what unelected people have advised be done.  I worry where we as a nation are going.  Sometimes, you have to stand up and be counted.  Everyone in this House and society in general wants to suppress Covid and to get rid of it.  Some of the youngsters in Ireland have never been to a disco.  That is sad.  It is all right for us, we have lived life, been to places and we did not have to wear masks for years, but the youngsters who are of an age to go out do not know what is to go into a normal place.  This will be the second Christmas they do not have a lot to look forward to.  This Christmas they will be under the feet of their mothers and fathers, which is not a normal Christmas.  </p> <p> If I want to travel from some other country into this country, I have to get a negative PCR test 72 hours beforehand or a negative antigen test 48 hours beforehand and I can sit beside another person on the aeroplane for up to two hours while, at the same time, when it comes to the local pub, I cannot go to the bar, I cannot sit at a table with more than six persons and I have to produce a document confirming that I am vaccinated and, if not, I have to go outside to a shed with my drink.  Where are we going as a country?  We need to make sure that we bring people with us.  </p> <p> I worry about democracy.  There will always be debate, disagreement, people who have different views, right and wrong, and people to whom you could not tell one thing or the other.  I worry when I look at what is happening in Australia and what is being talked about in Austria and in Germany by the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and her sidekick, Ursula.  I hope Ireland does not go down that road.  I believe in democracy and the political system, whether on one side or the other.  We should always respect each other.  We should not shut down debate and questioning.  Unfortunately, in the media you are put into a box.  You could be the biggest supporter of something, but if you ask a question against it you are now put into a little corner and you are one of them.  That is not the way politics should be done.</p> <p> I worry as well about powers.  We were told by the so-called experts that if we reached an 85% or 90% vaccination rate, it would be happy days, happy Christmas and happy everything.  I talk to people from around the country.  Ordinary, hard-working people are asking me if this is ever going to end.  They were told this and that a year ago, something else six months ago and now we are back to square one.  I understand that Covid is a virus and that nobody knows the ins and outs of it but, my God, we are at a crossroads in our country.  We need to give people hope, in particular those working in the hospitality sector.  In a normal year, disc jockeys would have 16 nights' work over Christmas.  This year, they will have none and they will get only approximately &euro;200 per week because the PUP will come back.  They are not part of an employment because they are subcontractors.  That is the reality.  What did they earn in the past year?  The PUP came down and because they had no tax, they were not open.  Will this be a happy Christmas for them?  Definitely not.  Make hay when the sun shines is a lesson we in rural Ireland always learned.  Unfortunately, those people have gone into darkness tonight.  I urge the Government to think of all aspects of the hospitality sector.  </p> <p> As a D&aacute;il, we need to start scrutinising some of the decisions that are coming forward.  The Government cannot keep wobbling, twisting and turning.  We need leadership or we will lose the people around this country who, in fairness, have made an honest effort this past year.  We need to bring everybody with us.  If someone has a reaction to a vaccine, let us not be afraid to talk about it.  Let us talk about it and not shut it down.  In being open and transparent we bring people with us.  I do not believe in bringing in more and more powers.  Powers will not solve this.  I have trust in the people of Ireland, who are making an honest effort.  We do not need to make criminals out of them.</p></speech>

Inexplicably, we missed many of the letters and came to that one.  The word "Omicron" as an anagram it means moronic.  It was not I who came up with that but somebody who came into my office and shared her concerns with me.  The word "moronic" is terribly derogatory, but there are many meanings to it, such as foolish, idiotic and stupid.  Many of those words are characteristics of the Government over the past two years.  I say that reluctantly and as someone who believes Covid has been extremely dangerous and that people have suffered from it, including all of our families, in one way or another, through not attending funerals, not being able to visit nursing homes and so on.  It is unfortunate that we have to preface our comments with that.  That is what we have come to in this country.</p>  <p>  A pandemic was declared on 11 March 2020, having declared the outbreak of a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2021.  The first case in Ireland was on 29 February 2020.  It is important to say this because our memories dim after a while.  As stated by Deputy McNamara -  I was near him; I did not know him that well at the time and I would say I still do not know him but that is neither here nor there - I had a reluctance in passing the legislation because I feared what was going to happen with no oversight.  I said there was no need for a committee because I foolishly thought the D&aacute;il would retain session of this and monitor it.  The next battle we had to fight was on the Business Committee, of which I am not a member but on which I sat for a number of sessions because Deputy Pringle was, I think, isolating at the time.  There was a danger that even the D&aacute;il would not sit and that we would get briefings.  We went through all of that and then the D&aacute;il sat for a day or two per week but with reduced numbers and all of that.  That was the background.</p>  <p>  At that time, the language was very inclusive, such as "We are all in it together."  Very nice words were said at different times.  The then Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, said: "We must protect the most vulnerable members of our society."  The T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, then Taoiseach, said: "The question is how we can take what we have learned in recent weeks and some of the things we have done to build a better society in the aftermath of Covid-19, how we can honour the sacrifices made in every community in our country and renew our society by developing a new social contract."  Deputy Donnelly, now the Minister for Health, said: "When we are considering powers as serious and extensive as this we must as an Oireachtas make sure there are checks and balances."  The then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar also said, "When faced with a common foe we can put aside our differences and work together for the good of the country."  At the time, I expressed my own concerns, which I will not quote.  I will stay in the present and look back.  What happened to those lovely words and the "meitheal" that Deputy Mattie McGrath so often mentions, "the coming together", "bringing out the best in people" and "we are all in it together".  It started to go very quickly, did it not?  The 70 year olds were told to stay indoors.  They were told in such a duplicitous way it was appalling.  They were led to believe that it was an order, that it was in legislation from the Government when all the time it was not.  </p> <p>Indeed, when they dared to step out and go for a walk, we nearly had a situation where one neighbour was turned against the other.  People would question others for being out and tell them they must stay inside.  Does the Minister remember that?  I remember it very well because it upset me at the time.<br/><br/>I am jumping forward and back in the timeline but the points I want to make are important.  When the vaccinations arrived, people aged 60 to 69 were told to take AstraZeneca or leave it and go to the bottom of the list.  Does the Minister remember that language?  Then the language around the virus started to change.  The virus was personified; it became nasty and vicious.  The Minister referred to it yesterday, if I recall correctly, as &quot;sinister&quot;, with reference to possible new variants.  I do not think viruses are nasty, vicious or sinister.  People and policies can be nasty and vicious but viruses cannot.  By their very nature, they change and alter all the time.  The experts told us from day one to expect alterations and variations.  I do not have a science background but I read and try to understand the information.  The new variant is no big change from what we should have been expecting.  There will be constant variations.<br/><br/>There were also changes in the language around the distinction between the vaccinated and unvaccinated.  For a while, it was very sweet and everybody was encouraged to come forward, which the vast majority did.  Then, however, we started to demonise and discriminate against those who did not come forward, saying they were responsible for all the outbreaks.  I even heard that today from a Labour Party Deputy, who keeps using this language around the unvaccinated, who are like the unwashed and responsible for all the problems.  I fundamentally object to that type of language.  It is not the way to deal with the threat facing us from Covid and the variations of the virus that are going to come.  It is a public health problem and I will refer presently to some of the reasons it has overrun our country.<br/><br/>As I said, we demonised those who are not vaccinated, who are only a small group and never a homogenous one.  There are many reasons, most of them acceptable, why a person might not take a vaccine.  Then the facts made it difficult to continue demonising them, which I will come back to.  In the meantime, Covid passports were brought in, not to restrict, supposedly, but to allow us to travel.  However, the use of the passports was extended to other areas, with people needing them to go for a coffee or get their hair done.  When people go into some coffee shops, they get a little card saying they have had two coffees today, making seven in total, and will soon get a complementary one.  I am sure the Minister has seen the wrongs of the cards, with their tick marks, showing the number of Pfizer injections people have had.  It raises the question as to whether he intends to have the Covid passport updated to include information on whether the holder has had the booster.  I am posing these questions because they are points that should be up for discussion.  At what point do we stop?  Will it be at two boosters or five boosters?  Will there be a distinction between the colleagues sitting behind me if one has the booster and the other does not?  Will one be able to go into a coffee shop and have coffee there and the other will not?  Next year, when another variant arrives, will we up the requirement again for a Covid passport, which was supposed to be a temporary measure?  None of these questions has ever been discussed in this House.<br/><br/>I welcome the 20 minutes I have been given to contribute to this debate, as I welcomed the time I was given yesterday.  It is very important to have this time to discuss the legislation.  However, it was published only in the past few days.  As we struggle to work through the Bill - rightly so; it is my job as a parliamentarian to do so - the Taoiseach is outside giving a statement to the media, members of which already know what it contains and have already been prepped.  The only uninformed people are the Deputies in this august Chamber struggling with legislation that will give the Minister unfettered powers until next March and potentially until June.  The Taoiseach did not see fit, almost two years into a pandemic, to come in and talk to the elected Members of the D&aacute;il and inspire confidence in us in order that we can go out and inspire confidence in our constituents and explain why all of this is happening.<br/><br/>The Government repeated the mantra that schools were safe and I believed it.  Now we are masking children.  When the discriminatory talk about the vaccinated versus the unvaccinated was wearing thin, we moved on to children.  Now the children are the greatest problem.  The children who get Covid but have no symptoms are being treated as the greatest threat, not in order to protect other children but to protect adults.  I am no expert in this but I have a difficulty with the message changing all the time.  In fact, the message seems to have more variations than the virus, with very serious consequences for our democracy.  On testing and tracing, schools have repeatedly pointed out that it was stopped.  The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, and the Minister for Education said it did not happen, but it did and there were consequences to it.<br/><br/>I raised the question with the Minister this morning as to the distinction between somebody who has been vaccinated and somebody who has had Covid and has been certified as such.  I am still none the wiser other than that there is an EU regulation that says the immunity applies only for six months.  I have gone through all the letters from NPHET to the Minster and it is stated more than once that the advice from HIQA to NPHET, which the latter accepted, is that the period of immunity is nine months.  Can the Minister explain why he has accepted and cited <i>ad nauseam</i>advice from NPHET and HIQA but not on this point, with no information or analysis as to why?<br/><br/>I have a difficulty with the bellicose and warlike language that is being used, mostly by men, with honourable exceptions.  This is not a war.  It is a public health crisis arising from a very serious virus that is threatening our health, which comes on top of a public health system in which hospitals were already creaking at the seams, a primary care system that is non-existent and a public health infrastructure in which public health doctors are nowhere to be seen.  We had the Crowe Horwath report from 2018 or 2019 identifying the deficiencies in our public health system.  Other than the Minister coming in here and rattling off numbers, such as there being 2.2 extra doctors here or there or something like that, I am none the wiser as to what steps have been taken in a public health crisis to put public health doctors, nurses and experts in place to instil trust in communities.<br/><br/>There are very few extra hospital beds and the total is way below what was set out in various capacity reviews, including the review of ICU beds.  We are none the wiser in regard to private hospitals, what deal has been done, how much it is costing and why they have not been used to more capacity.  I do not have time to go through the details I have of waiting lists for people in Galway, including pain lists and orthopaedic lists of two and three years in length.  Home help provision is non-existent in Connemara.  The private company cannot provide any more home helps for many reasons, Covid being one of them.  We have commercialised and made a product of our health system.  That was being done for years and along came Covid on top of it.<br/><br/>Then we have the warlike language of adding more tools to our armour to fight the battle on the front line.  Nurses and doctors have done great work, but so have the cleaners who struggled to keep our hospitals clean and the porters who have run from ward to ward and from ward to X-ray department without enough trolleys.  When we pay tribute to nurses and doctors, I would prefer if we paid tribute to all the people involved in our health system, who were struggling well before Covid and will struggle well after it until we recognise that we cannot continue to have what we currently have in this country, which is a private system supported by public money and used to undermine completely the public health system.  Recently, a person I know went to Merlin Park University Hospital, which is set on 150 acres.</p> <p>We should be building a state-of-the-art new hospital at Merlin Park University Hospital for the million people whom the hospital serves.  That person went as a public patient for a scan, paid by public money, to a private facility on public lands in Merlin Park University Hospital.  Such is the complexity of what we have done with the private system into the public system in Ireland, it is extremely difficult to disentangle it.</p> <p> The Minister will ask what has that got to do with all of this.  This determined how we dealt with Covid-19, when it came along.  It was difficult for all of us because it was new, but as the years went by - and it has now been years because we are in the second year of the pandemic - we did not learn.  When I say &ldquo;we&rdquo;, I mean the Government and NPHET, which is not what any properly representative committee should be in terms of mental health, nursing homes and so on.</p> <p> During that time, we tried to learn because we set up an all-party committee.  Deputy McNamara, who is sitting behind me, was the Chair.  I took the trouble of reading its report.  It made many recommendations.  It even published an interim report with 22 recommendations.  The report talked about many things, including nursing homes and how an inquiry was necessary.  Nothing has happened of course.  We have completely ignored a cross-party committee that made recommendations that were practical, and that were not way out.  I do not think the Minister has ever come in and answered why the recommendations were ignored.</p> <p> This legislation seeks to put four pieces of legislation together.  In theory, I have no difficulty with that.  It is much better to have one piece of legislation as long as we ensure we have enough time to speak about it and its implications.  However, there has been no input from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, into this legislation.  It has not been run by it nor by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC.  There is an obligation on the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to look at all legislation that has implications for human rights.  It has been utterly ignored.</p> <p> I almost did not speak today.  I was truly weary of hearing my own voice all over again on this.  I am sure the feeling is shared by all the Members on this side of the House.  How do we keep saying this?  How do we get across that we want to work with the Government?  We see Covid-19 as serious, but the restrictions on fundamental human freedoms going into their second year without any analysis is totally unacceptable and is the most serious threat to our democracy.</p></speech>

One of its recommendations was that a no-fault compensation scheme would be set up.  Does the Minister remember that?  Has he ever pondered that, thought about it or come back to us on it?</p>  <p>  We have heard a Member - I think it was one of the Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers - praise Pfizer and the pharmaceutical companies for the wonderful work they have done and for the power of private companies to come up trumps.  They did not make a mention of the public money.  We still do not know how much it has cost.  We do not know the nature of the deal.  However, we do know that an indemnity has been given to them forever and ever.  There has not been a single word of discussion about that little deal.  Again, the Government will tell us that it was Europe that did that, just like it did with the regulations saying there are only six months' immunity and not nine months.  These are basic things we should be discussing in the House.  Maybe the Minister could tell us tonight, and if he cannot tell us tonight, maybe, when he is sending me the details of the regulation that says we can only give six months' immunity for someone who had Covid-19 and not nine months and he has dealt with that paragraph, he might come back to the deal with the pharmaceutical companies.  How much public money has been given and to which companies?</p>  <p>  I will draw to a close as I will not go over time.  I have outlined the discrimination between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated, the discrimination between who could get which vaccination and the discrimination between young and old.  Then, there is the ultimate discrimination between us in Ireland, a rich country that has 92% of its population vaccinated, and all the other countries that have not even one dose of the vaccination.  The Minister might explain that to us.  He might explain what discussion has taken place about waiving the intellectual property right so that we can all benefit and truly all of us be in it together.  He might explain to us how, with a figure of 92% or 94% vaccinated, depending on which Minister or which Taoiseach is talking, we could have such high rates of transmission if the vaccination is so effective.  Maybe we could have some honesty about the waning effectiveness of vaccination.  Maybe we could have some honesty about telling people to go out, drink, eat and be merry while there are no day centres and no respite.  Maybe the Minister can tell us how people can go out and drink when there are transmission rates from vaccination.  As I understand it, the vaccination is to prevent hospitalisation and getting sick, but it does not prevent transmission.  How does the Minister explain all of those contradictory messages and tell us we are all in it together?  I go back to the word &ldquo;moronic&rdquo;.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the broad support for an approach in Ireland which is led by public health and by evidence.  I acknowledge the broad support for vaccines, the broad support in the House for boosters, the broad support in the House for testing, both for PCR testing and for antigen testing, and the broad support for an approach to Covid-19 where the benefits of us all following the public health advice are so important.  It is supported by not all but most Members of this House, both in government and in opposition.  I acknowledge that and I thank colleagues for that.</p>  <p>  The public health advice right now is as important as ever.  If any of us are symptomatic, we should stay at home and get a test.  If we are going out, we should use the layers of protection we have all become used to and, indeed, that we use here in the House.  These are hand hygiene, cough etiquette, masks, ventilation and so forth.  For a few weeks, we should reduce our discretionary social contacts, particularly in the higher risk areas, which we are aware of.  Finally and probably most importantly, we should get vaccinated and, indeed, get a booster vaccine when it becomes available.</p>  <p>  Right now, approximately half of the Covid-19 hospitalisations and approximately half of our Covid-19 patients are from the small group of people who have to date chosen not to get vaccinated.  Approximately half of the patients in ICU who have Covid-19 are from this group who have to date chosen not to get vaccinated.  It is a horrific illness.  I have spoken to ICU nurses who have many years of experience.  They have seen much more than we hope most or all of us in the House will ever see in terms of human struggle and people dying in difficult ways.  An ICU nurse with decades of experience has told me they are traumatised and are suffering from post-traumatic stress because of how horrific Covid-19 has been for the patients in their care in the ICU wards.  I appeal to anyone who is still considering whether to get vaccinated to do so to protect themselves, first and foremost, and second, to protect those around them.</p>  <p>  I thought it was interesting and I wanted to share with colleagues that now about two thirds of our hospital patients are Covid-19 patients, whether they are in a hospital ward bed or in ICU.  Approximately two in every three of these patients are now under the age of 45.  That is relevant as well.  We should engage with younger people.  Not every person under the age of 45 is necessarily younger, but there has been understanding that those who are older-----</p></speech>

There is genuine concern in Ireland right now.  We are all aware of it.  We are all talking to our constituents, families and friends and there is real concern.  New measures have just been announced by an Taoiseach for the coming weeks.  People are hearing about initial reports and are listening to initial reports and views on the Omicron variant, and they are, quite naturally, concerned.  All of us have a role to play at the moment, at what is a very difficult time for people all over Ireland.</p>  <p>  On the Omicron variant, we are going to have to wait a bit longer for the medical and scientific community to give us more definitive answers.  They need more time.  They are doing a lot of theoretical work on what the characteristics of the virus might mean in terms of the mutations and so forth.  They are also looking at real world evidence around transmission patterns, the speed of transmission, levels of infection, levels of severity, the impact of the vaccines, reinfection and so forth.  We are going to have to wait to get definitive answers on that.  However, expert groups all over the world are signalling that we need to take this variant very seriously, and because of that we are acting in a precautionary way.  We all hope for the best but we cannot just plan according to the best-case scenario.  We have to take the expert advice very seriously.</p>  <p>  The measures announced this evening follow clear public health advice.  NPHET is concerned about two things.  It is concerned about higher social interaction in December, which we all know happens, combined with the potential impact of this new variant.  That is why it has advised the Government to take the measures that have been taken tonight.  That is why the Government has decided to take those measures and has moved very quickly in doing so.  I was handed the letter from the Chief Medical Officer while sitting here during our debate last night, and as I sit here now, the measures have already been announced.  We are moving very quickly on this.  We all appreciate that some of these measures are going to be very difficult for people to hear, particularly businesses that will be badly affected by them.  This is going to land very badly with some people because it is going to have a tough impact on them, their plans and their staff.  That is why it is very important that financial supports were included in the measures put forward.</p>  <p>  It is also important that people know, even in the context of concerns about this new variant, that the national effort is working.  It is important we remember that.  The efforts individuals and families have made in recent weeks in response to public health advice are working and the huge efforts so many businesses are making to protect their staff and customers are working.  The programmes of work the Government has put in place are also working.  There is a lot going on on the Government's side.  We are continuing with vaccines and boosters.  There is a huge amount of PCR testing and antigen testing going on as well as a huge amount of testing and tracing.  We have international measures in place, including the Covid pass.  We are working hard to make sure we will have access to the antiviral drugs when they become available.  There are very significant protections in place for nursing homes.  There is the flu vaccine programme, the winter plan and much more.  The combination of the efforts individuals and families are making, the efforts businesses are making and the efforts the Government, the HSE and various arms of the State are making is working.</p>  <p>  Cases have stabilised.  They are too high but they have stabilised.  Covid hospitalisations are too high but they have stabilised, as have Covid ICU admissions.  It is important that we remember this.  This is a tough time.  The entire world is worried about this Omicron variant but the efforts the Irish people have made, and continue to make, are working.  Even in the face of this incredibly contagious variant called Delta, people's efforts are bearing fruit.  It is important we remember that.</p>  <p>  I appeal for as much solidarity as possible.  I acknowledge that I and the Government have a role to play in that and I have heard what colleagues said, both today and yesterday.  I ask that that be reciprocated.  Some of what I have heard this evening from some in Sinn F&eacute;in, albeit not everyone, and others is people saying they support the public health-led approach and public health advice, but then rubbishing that advice in certain sectors like schools.  Schools are following the public advice to the letter.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-12-03a.481" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="19:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021120300067#SSS02300"><p>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;</p><p>Before I begin, I know many workers tonight, particularly those in the hospitality and night-time economy sectors, will be worried by the latest restrictions.  Almost &euro;9 billion has been spent on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, to date.  This Government has stood four-square behind workers every step of the way throughout the pandemic and that will continue to be the case.</p> <p>For this reason, I intend to reopen the PUP for new applications from workers who lose their jobs as a result of the new restrictions, which will take effect from 7 December.  I have asked my officials to work on reopening the scheme as a matter of urgency.  Full details will be announced over the coming days.<br/><br/>As Deputies know, the purpose of the Social Welfare Bill is to give legislative effect to the changes announced on budget day.  The priority of my Department and the Government is to provide the right policies and services at the right time and place for people throughout society, including pensioners, families with young children, people of working age and employers.  Deputies will agree that the schemes introduced to deal with the pandemic - enhanced Covid illness benefit and the PUP - delivered on that.<br/><br/>However, we must continue to be progressive.  The social protection budget package amounts to &euro;558 million in 2022.  It is the largest social welfare package in 14 years.  This Government is conscious of the cost-of-living pressures facing our citizens.  Therefore, I am pleased to say that this year's budget provides for across-the-board increases to weekly payments for pensioners, people with disabilities, carers, lone parents and jobseekers.  In parallel with this, I have continued the policy of targeting increases at people at most risk of poverty, including families with children and pensioners and people with disabilities who are living alone.<br/><br/>It is important to point out that some of the social protection measures announced on budget day do not require primary legislation and, therefore, are not reflected in this Bill.  These measures include the Christmas bonus, which I am pleased to say is being paid next week to 1.4 million recipients, with payments totalling &euro;313 million.  I wish to take this opportunity again to encourage people to spend their Christmas bonuses locally this year and to support SMEs.  Other budget day measures that are not included in the Bill include a provision to reduce the minimum number of contributions required for people aged between 25 and 28 years to access the treatment benefit scheme.  This means that young people will be able to avail of visits to the dentist or optician much sooner after entering the workforce.<br/><br/>Deputies will be aware of the significant amendments to the carer's allowance income disregard, which has increased to &euro;350 per week for a single person and &euro;750 for a couple.  These are the first changes to the means test for carer's allowance in 14 years.  I was pleased to work with carers representative groups on these changes, which they have warmly welcomed.  These improvements, like the Christmas bonus, will be done by regulation.<br/><br/>The increase of &euro;5 per week in the fuel allowance payment and the uplift in its income threshold for qualification, both of which I ensured took effect from budget week, do not require amending legislation.  Nor does the extension of the hot school meals programme, a programme that is close to my heart and that I have been pleased to increase tenfold since my appointment as Minister last year.<br/><br/>Another budget measure that does not require legislative amendments is the equalisation of the back to school clothing and footwear allowance thresholds for one- and two-parent households.  The costs associated with the return to school are the same regardless of whether it is a one- or two-parent household and I was pleased to work with representative groups like One Family to introduce this change.  I am also increasing the allowance itself by &euro;10, bringing the rate for each child under 12 years of age to &euro;160 and for each child over 12 to &euro;285.<br/><br/>Other budget measures that do not require legislative amendments include the extension of access to support grants for jobseekers with disabilities, for example, towards a sign language interpreter, personal reader or workplace adaptation, and increasing the rate of wage subsidy scheme for employers of people with disabilities by &euro;1 per hour, making it equivalent to 60% of the national minimum wage.  This rate has not changed since 2008 and it is timely to do so now.  This and many other measures announced on budget day will benefit people with disabilities and it is appropriate that we are discussing them today on International Day of Persons with Disabilities.<br/><br/>Section 1 is the commencement provision.<br/><br/>Section 2 provides for definitions in the Bill.<br/><br/>The weekly earnings of an employee determine the PRSI rate of employer contributions paid on behalf of that employee.  Currently, employer PRSI is charged at a rate of 3.8% on weekly earnings of between &euro;38 and &euro;398.  Weekly earnings in excess of &euro;398 attract employer PRSI at a higher rate of 11.05%.  The earnings threshold increase from &euro;398 to &euro;410 in section 3 is designed to take account of the increase in the minimum wage from &euro;10.20 to &euro;10.50 per hour from 1 January 2022.  Employers with employees benefiting from the increase in the national minimum wage will continue to attract the lower rate of employer PRSI.  It is intended that this section will come into operation on the same day as the national minimum wage increase, that is, New Year's Day.<br/><br/>Section 4 provides that, for the purposes of the Covid-19 employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, the employer PRSI contribution rate of 0.5% will cease on 28 February.  The effect will be a reversion to the standard employer social insurance contribution rates of 8.8% and 11.05% for EWSS the following day.<br/><br/>Section 5 provides for a &euro;5 increase in the weekly rate of maternity benefit from &euro;245 to &euro;250 from 3 January.  Sections 6 and 7 provide for the equivalent increases in adoptive benefit and paternity benefit, respectively.<br/><br/>The purpose of section 8 is to extend the duration for which parent's benefit is payable from five weeks to seven weeks in line with Ireland's commitments under the EU work-life balance directive.  Parent's benefit is popular and we have seen a significant increase in claims this year.  I am pleased to be able to extend it by a further two weeks next year to support young families.  My colleague, the<b></b>Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, will make a corresponding amendment to the associated parent's leave provisions.  I understand that this is likely to be done by way of regulation.  Section 9 provides for the rate increase for parent's benefit.<br/><br/>Jobseeker's benefit rates are graduated according to earnings in the relevant tax year.  Section 10 will give effect to the increases in the graduated rates.  Section 11 provides that the amount payable for a qualified adult on a graduated jobseeker's benefit will increase from &euro;87.20 to &euro;89.30 per week.<br/><br/>The purpose of section 12 is to provide for a grant of up to &euro;500 towards the cost of a wig or hairpiece for people suffering from hair loss as a direct result of illness or treatment for an illness.  This is a new measure that I am introducing under the treatment benefit scheme and will be of particular benefit to persons who suffer hair loss as a result of conditions like alopecia or who are undergoing chemotherapy.<br/><br/>As I have said, today is International Day of Persons with Disabilities.  As a result of section 13, 18,000 disability allowance recipients will gain up to &euro;5 per week on top of the general increase.  That is because this section provides for an increase in the general weekly means disregard for disability allowance.<br/><br/>The working family payment, formerly known as family income supplement, is a weekly tax-free supplement available to employees with children.  It gives extra financial support to people on low pay.  Section 14 provides for a &euro;10 increase in the weekly income thresholds of working family payment for all family sizes.  Working families on the scheme will benefit by up to &euro;6 per week.<br/><br/>Section 15 is the first of two provisions that were not announced on budget day.  It provides for periods spent on PUP to be counted towards the number of days of continuous unemployment required on a relevant payment to qualify for back to work family dividend.  This is a weekly payment to help people with children to move from social welfare into work.<br/><br/>Section 16 is a technical amendment to remove an out-of-date reference to section 238F.<br/><br/>The other provision that was not announced on 12 October is section 17.  The aim of this is to provide that the Minister may designate one or more persons to act as deputy chief appeals officer.  That person will be designated to deputise for the chief appeals officer if the latter is not available to perform his or her duties.  This should ease the administrative burden on the chief appeals officer and I hope will help to speed up the social welfare appeals process and improve turnaround times, something I know Deputies will welcome.<br/><br/>For most social insurance payments, an increase is paid for dependent children.  The &euro;3 increase for qualified child dependants aged 12 and over from &euro;45 to &euro;48 per week recognises the extra expenditure required during the teenage years.  The payment in respect of qualified children under 12 increases by &euro;2 from &euro;38 to &euro;40.  This continues the policy of recent years that has been informed by research on the minimum essential standard of living.<br/><br/>The living alone increase is an extra payment for people on certain social welfare payments who are living alone.  Section 18 gives effect to increases in the qualified child payment and the living alone allowance for claimants in receipt of social insurance benefits.</p></speech>
