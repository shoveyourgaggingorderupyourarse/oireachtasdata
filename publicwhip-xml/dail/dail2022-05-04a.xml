The roll call of victims of an aggressive religious dogma in healthcare settings is heartbreaking.  Far too many Irish women have paid far too high a price.  So the new national maternity hospital is absolutely vital for the delivery of modern, progressive healthcare for women in Ireland and everybody wants to see this hospital built and built quickly.  But we also have to get it right.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, brought a memo to the Cabinet seeking the green light for the development of the hospital on the St. Vincent's site.  This was, I believe, a premature move and I welcome that decision has been paused.  It is essential that the Oireachtas is afforded the opportunity to scrutinise, consider and debate the details of this proposal.  It is right that this will now happen.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach is aware there are legitimate concerns surrounding the ownership structure and the clinical independence of the hospital and there is strong grounds for these concerns given the history of that relationship between church and State which denied healthcare services to generations of women.  The Minister for Health stated this morning that he can absolutely 100% guarantee that all women's healthcare services allowable under Irish law will be provided at the new hospital.  These guarantees must be cast-iron legal protections and not simply rhetorical assurances.  In the same interview, the Minister for Health referred to criticism of the ownership model as a &ldquo;red herring&rdquo;.  That is not a fair characterisation of what are well-founded concerns.  The State proposes an investment of &euro;800 million possibly increasing to &euro;1 billion when all is said and done.  That is taxpayers&rsquo; money; the State should own the hospital and the ground that the hospital is built on outright.  That is simple common sense.</p>  <p>  Under the Government proposal, we will own the building but not the land which will remain in private ownership.  That makes absolutely no sense when the State is footing the bill.  We need a publicly built maternity hospital on publicly owned land, delivering public healthcare services for women to a standard of excellence.  Instead what is proposed is a convoluted maze in which the Sisters of Charity have transferred the land to a holdings company that then leases the land to the State.  It is all very messy, unnecessarily so, and it is stoking unease and worry.  People ask why on earth is this happening.  Surely the best solution is for the Sisters of Charity to have gifted the land to the State and to ensure and guarantee full public ownership of the entire hospital.  This would protect the State's investment and address so many of the concerns of so many who fear still that religious dogma could compromise the delivery of healthcare.</p>  <p>  T&aacute; an t-ospid&eacute;al n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta m&aacute;ithreachais nua r&oacute;th&aacute;bhachtach.  Caithfimid &eacute; a fh&aacute;il i gceart chun neamhsple&aacute;chas clinici&uacute;il a chinnti&uacute; agus infheist&iacute;ocht phoibl&iacute; a chosaint.  N&iacute; m&oacute;r don Rialtas &uacute;in&eacute;ireacht St&aacute;it ioml&aacute;n a chinnti&uacute; den talamh ar a bhfuil an t-ospid&eacute;al le t&oacute;g&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  We have to get this right and we have to work together to get it right.  I will put the proposition simply: we need to achieve full State ownership for the new hospital and the land on which the hospital is built.  This has to be done before any contracts are signed.</p> <p>Will the Taoiseach work urgently to convince St. Vincent's Healthcare Group to gift that land to the State?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-04a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050400004#B00200"><p>At the outset, I would like to say that my only motivation here, as Taoiseach, is to ensure we make a decision that provides a modern, world-class maternity and neonatal hospital and facility for the women of Ireland now and into the future and that will allow all services legally permissible in the State now and into the future to be provided to the women of Ireland.  That is the objective and motivation I have as Taoiseach.  However, I want to see it done.  I do not like hanging around forever.  We should get it right.  However, the latest phase of this co-location proposal began in 2013.  It is now 2022.  How long more do people want to wait?  How many more years are women expected to go to a hospital that is physically not for purpose, as the current Holles Street hospital is?  There are Nightingale wards.  There are physical transfers of women with complications from Holles Street to St. Vincent's hospital.  That is simply not good enough in the 20th century.  Cork University Maternity Hospital was built and commenced during my time as Minister for Health.  I sanctioned it and we got it built.  Admittedly, that was two State hospitals coming together to provide state-of-the-art maternity and neonatal facilities.  Nothing has happened since in terms of maternity facilities.  The existing facilities of the other maternity hospitals are very old buildings.</p>  <p>  Collectively and politically, we have responsibilities to decide too.  We must make decisions.  I accept legitimate concerns were raised.  They have been comprehensively addressed and not via rhetoric but by legal guarantees and documents that have been published and that I implore the Deputy to read.  The initial concerns were around clinical governance, operational independence and financial independence.  Those have been comprehensively addressed via the constitution of the new national maternity hospital.  There are the articles of association and the golden share the Minister has to ensure the reserved powers within the constitution are implemented in terms of all legally-permissible services being made available and provided.</p>  <p>  It has now moved on to ownership.  I respectfully suggest leasing land and a building for 300 years at a tenner per year is ownership, by any stretch of the imagination.  That is public ownership by any historic or objective analysis.  It will be a 300-year lease at a tenner per year.  That is what the agreement states and to me that is public ownership.</p>  <p>  I ask people to read the documentation and to go through the operating licence the HSE will be giving to the new national maternity hospital.  It is very clear in respect of what obligations are there on behalf of the hospital to deliver all services to the women of Ireland to ensure we have better outcomes.</p>  <p>  Remember all of this happened because expertise 20 or 25 years ago was telling us we needed to co-locate for the safety of women and better outcomes with deliveries.  That was the original motivation behind co-location.  That is why it happened in Cork.</p>  <p>  This was to happen many years ago.  The Mulvey agreement was published in 2016, I think.  The current agreements are a significant advancement on Mulvey due to the golden share but also the public interest directors.  It is now three being appointed by the Minister, three by the national maternity hospital and three by St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  I ask people to read the documentation and accept there are now legal guarantees provided that are cast-iron.</p></speech>

However, I raised with the Taoiseach the ownership of the land and he has responded by reminding us we are looking at a 300-year lease at a cost of &euro;10 per year.</p> <p>That begs the question as to why lease on those terms and why did the Sisters of Charity just not make a clean transaction of it and gift the land to the State.  That would copper-fasten and clarify the absolute public ownership of the facility.  It would give the reassurances that are necessary, not for a small minority but for wider public opinion in terms of the governance, the independence etc. of the hospital.</p> <p> By the way, I accept the Taoiseach's bona fides in wishing to see this project advance.  As somebody who availed of maternity services in my time in this State, I can tell the Taoiseach we all have a vested interest in seeing that advance.  I am not challenging that for a moment.  I am raising this issue of ownership because it is a matter of genuine concern.</p></speech>

To all intents and purposes, it is 300 years at a tenner a year.  What is the issue then?  It will be operationally, financially and clinically independent.  All of the legal documentation underpins that, that is, a variety of legal documents from the constitution of the hospital right across to the operating licence the HSE will be providing to the hospital, obliging it to provide all of the services legally permissible in the State.</p>  <p>  By the way, within those legal guarantees, there is a clear obligation that no religious ethos will have any hand, act or part in the operation of the hospital and the delivery of services, and likewise in terms of ethnic or other distinctions.  It is as clear as it could be.</p>  <p>  There is an onus and an obligation also to weigh this up in the balance because, as I said, this latest phase began in 2013.  The current Government had the Mulvey agreement, which the previous Government agreed with, as did many Members in the House did also, which also provided guarantees.</p></speech>

I welcome the decision by Cabinet last night to delay, as I understand it, by at least two weeks, the making of any final decision.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health, as we had asked.  Indeed, I welcome the ongoing publication of documents on the HSE website.  I read the documents that were up last night.  I note another one this morning.  That is important but the concerns around ownership, control and governance of the new national maternity hospital remain, notwithstanding the changes and the publication of those documents.</p>  <p>  In particular, the key question everyone is asking is, if this is public ownership in all but name, why not move to public ownership?  If a 299-year lease amounts effectively to State ownership, why do we not see a gifting of this site to the State, so that it is truly and beyond doubt within public ownership rather than this Byzantine series of legal arrangements?</p>  <p>  I have waded through these documents and they are complex.  We have seen legal counsel previously describe these as labyrinthine complex arrangements, making it difficult to establish with certainty the issues of control and governance.  These are legitimate concerns that have been raised, including concerns raised by two members of the HSE board.  We understand they are legitimate concerns raised by women at the Cabinet table, as a result of which we are seeing this delay.  These are legitimate questions and we are asking why we simply cannot move to public ownership.</p> <p>Why can we not request or require the site on which the hospital is to be built to be gifted to the State or, indeed, move to compulsorily purchase it?  We in the Labour Party have been calling for a compulsory purchase order to be considered as an option since as long ago as 2017.  That is five years ago.  Had the State moved at that time, the site would now be in public ownership and we would not see these ongoing and real concerns around governance and control.  There are valid concerns emerging from those documents on governance and control.  There are valid and substantive concerns around the control issue when we look at who the directors will be and when we see that the landlord, the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, will have the right to appoint three directors to the new national maternity hospital designated activity company and, indeed, under the terms of the constitution of that company, will therefore have the right to appoint a chairperson in three years' time on a rotating basis.  That means the landlord will have a very strong influence in how the tenant runs its affairs.  That is a valid concern arising from the documents.</p> <p> There is also a valid concern around governance when one looks at the key phrase "clinically appropriate".  It is in there twice in the constitution of the new company.  It is also included in the operating licence and yet it is not present in the clause around the golden share of the Minister, clause 5.3 in the constitution which states the Minister's golden share is to ensure that the obligations are complied with and that any maternity, gynaecological, obstetric and-or neonatal services which are lawfully available in the State shall be available in the new national maternity hospital.  Let us see that phrase used elsewhere and those qualifying and conditional words, "clinically appropriate", removed from the document.  Otherwise we are going to continue to have these concerns around ownership, control and the governance of women's healthcare access.</p></speech>

That was a core issue that was raised some time ago around the whole proposal for co-location.  That happened many years ago for the reason I have given, which is that people think that is the way to get the best outcomes.  The issue of women being entitled to all services has been comprehensively guaranteed in the constitution of the new hospital, in the operating licence granted by the HSE, which imposes an obligation on the new national maternity hospital to provide such services and in the powers given to the Minister in the form of the golden share to enforce the reserved powers.  The arrangement brokered by Mr. Kieran Mulvey only allowed for one public interest director where we are now providing for three ministerial directors to be appointed in the public interest, along with three from the maternity hospital and three from St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.</p> <p>It is a far more advanced agreement now than was the case, having listened to what people said and responded to the concerns people legitimately raised.

I am not questioning anyone's bona fides and I do not think it is helpful to do so but legitimate concerns remain around ownership, governance and control.  Positive changes have been made over the years, largely as a result of Opposition pressure and of pressure from activists and women seeking improvements in services and seeking to ensure we do indeed have a modern, world-class new national maternity hospital.  Those concerns still remain, however.  This State has an unfortunate and terrible legacy of failing women in our access to reproductive healthcare.  It is only four years since we repealed the eighth amendment.  Those of us who fought for decades to ensure women would have a right of access to abortion when we need it are very conscious that these rights can be very quickly reversed or overturned, as we are seeing in the US with the terrible news about Roe <i>v</i>. Wade and the potential overturning of that landmark decision for women's rights.  That legacy, and the legacy of the State in investing a great deal of public money over the years in building up infrastructure through private hospitals owned by religious orders-----</p></speech>

The reason for this shambles and this delay is that this Government and successive Governments have insisted that private companies controlled by religious orders must remain in the picture, even though every cent going into building this hospital is public money and that what is wanted is a public hospital being paid for with public money.  The Government insists, and successive Governments have insisted, that instead we get a private company influenced by a Catholic religious order.  That is the constitution of the new St. Vincent's Holdings company which, interestingly, has been signed - the plot thickens - by people representing a company called Porema Limited and another company called Stembridge Limited.  Who are they?</p> <p>We have the holding company, the Religious Sisters of Charity, the healthcare group, the designated activity company, DAC, and now Porema Limited and Stembridge Limited, which are allegedly associated with thousands of offshore companies.  We are in this mess because the Government insists on involving these people in a public hospital that is charged with providing healthcare for the women of this country, and it is influenced by a religious organisation.  The Government says our concerns are baseless.  Why did two members of the HSE board dissent to the decision to transfer the Religious Sisters of Charity shareholding to this new body, which was set up with the approval of the Vatican?  What does it have to do with women's healthcare in this country or approving the overarching company which will own and control the national maternity hospital, as well as three other hospitals?  It is unbelievable.</p> <p> One of those people is Professor Deirdre Madden, who dissented, reportedly on the basis that she had concerns regarding the legal ownership of the site, the building, and the governance and control of the proposed new maternity hospital.  The Taoiseach said he is not a legal expert.  Maybe we are not all legal experts but, helpfully, Professor Madden is a legal expert.  She is a professor of law at University College Cork.  She specialises in health law and medical ethics.  She was concerned enough to dissent because of ownership, control and governance questions.  She clearly has a basis for those concerns.  What is the problem with having a publicly-owned and controlled national maternity hospital?  The clue about having continued religious influence is in the name of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  It should gift this land for the national maternity hospital to the State so that it is fully publicly-owned and controlled.</p></speech>

Let us not try to deepen the plot, for whatever reason the Deputy might want to deepen it.  Many conspiracy theories are floating about and to nail one of them, the Vatican should have nothing to do with healthcare in public hospitals, has nothing to do with healthcare at this particular maternity hospital and will have nothing to do with it.  Forget about that, since it is totally out of the equation.  The involvement of any religious ethos is out of the question.  That is clear in the legal documents underpinning this new hospital.  A 300-year lease on the hospital for &euro;10 a year has been agreed.  Through the constitution of the new hospital, the articles of association and the golden share arrangement, there are cast-iron guarantees that all legally permissible services in the State will be provided today and into the future.  The Deputy says that I insist on a private company with a religious influence being part of it.  I do not.</p></speech>

Co-location was correctly identified by experts in medicine and health as being the optimal configuration to produce better outcomes for women, with maternity hospitals co-located on tertiary hospital sites.  While it has happened for other locations, the only place it has happened with a major hospital is at Cork University Maternity Hospital, which is on the site of Cork University Hospital.  The idea that there would be a relationship between St. Vincent's hospital and Holles Street hospital was mooted 20 years ago.  It is not because of any religious ethos, but because it would combine two high-quality hospitals to get better outcomes for women.  That was the original motivation, rather than what the Deputy is suggesting.</p> <p>We do have, historically, a model of healthcare in Ireland that prior to the 1940s and 1950s has been led by religious orders.  That was how things evolved historically.  In many instances, increasingly this is reducing very significantly.  In the case of St. Vincent's University Hospital, they are now out of the equation.  They are most certainly out of the equation with regard to the National Maternity Hospital.  They have no involvement and they will have no involvement.  We need to accept that, at least, as a factual position.  There is no religious ethos involved in this new national maternity hospital and there will not be.</p></speech>

I predicate everything that I say by making that point.  They are fantastic people.  The problem with these religious organisations is that, for example in St. Vincent's, one cannot get sterilisation or a vasectomy.  Why not?  This is a hospital that is publicly funded but owned by a religious organisation that has an ethos that does not believe in and does not want to give certain procedures.  They continue to have an influence.  In the new St. Vincent's hospital, they have three board members who will be on the holding group, which is the overarching group that will own the four entities, namely, the designated activity company, DAC, for the new national maternity hospital; the private St. Vincent's hospital; the public St. Vincent's hospital; and St. Michael's Hospital, which is in my own area.  Why did Professor Deirdre Madden, a professor of law and the vice chair of the HSE have the concerns that she had if they are baseless?  Why?  Why does St. Vincent's insist on retaining a foothold in the new holding company?  Why?</p></speech>

Let us make that point.  Protecting the State's interests was critical in the legal agreements that have been arrived at.</p>  <p>  Most importantly, better outcomes for women and for babies delivered at the maternity hospital has to be the key rationale and motivation behind everything that we do.  The idea behind co-location is what brought two hospitals together, that is, the hospital at Holles Street and St. Vincent's.  St. Vincent's is a separate group, and has been historically, as we know.  They have given explanations for what the Deputy has highlighted with regard to the constitution of the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.  Our concern primarily right now has to be the establishment of a national maternity hospital to replace a hospital that is not physically fit for purpose in the 21st century. My biggest concern is that as we continue to debate on this issue, women right now are not getting the physical conditions that they deserve.</p></speech>

He was actually on the Grand Parade in Cork when he quite kindly attended the military veteran's respect and loyalty parade on 4 May.  That movement was established, as the Taoiseach is aware, to highlight the very poor terms, conditions and pay for members of the Defence Forces, a phenomenon that is, unfortunately, continuing to this day.  To be fair, the Taoiseach was the Leader of the Opposition at the time.  He listened to the speeches and I believe that he agreed with the vast majority, if not all, of what was said.  Unfortunately, fast forward three years and we are pretty much in the same place.  Perhaps we are even a little worse because the Ukrainian situation has highlighted the deficiencies that were pretty much hidden in the past.</p> <p>To be fair, the Government's and the State's response to the Ukrainian crisis from a humanitarian and economic perspective has been good and commendable.  Unfortunately, however, there has been absolutely no appreciable improvement in the country's ability to protect itself despite what has happened in the last 70 days in eastern Europe.</p> <p> Last weekend, a number of Russian aircraft incurred into Swedish and Danish airspace.  Our Scandinavian cousins actually have an air policing service that could detect, intercept and escort those aircraft out of their airspace.  Even more sinisterly still, a mock simulated submarine attack against Ireland was played out on Russian state television as well.  Again, there is a reason for that.  There was a reason why the attack was simulated from the Irish exclusive economic zone, EEZ.  Everyone recognises that this country is very poorly protected and is the weak spot from an EU perspective.</p> <p> To be fair, we should realise this country is militarily defenceless.  We really are at the mercy of rogue states like the Russian Federation that can do with us whatever they wish.  Can the Taoiseach offer any reassurance to the House that the State's inability to protect itself will be addressed in the short-term and that 100 years after us gaining our independence, we will soon be in a position to protect our territorial integrity and sovereignty?</p></speech>

I take his point more generally that there is clearly a need to upgrade significantly and improve resources and capability in respect of our Defence Forces.  We need not just to maintain sufficient military capability but add to and strengthen it.</p>  <p>  The Government wanted to get the balance right and have a proper researched approach to this.  For that reason, as the Deputy will know, the programme for Government committed to the establishment of an independent Commission on the Defence Forces.  That commission was established within the first six months of the Government and its report was published in February.</p>  <p>  The report is a very significant body of work amounting to over 180 pages.  It had a very wide process of consultation with nearly 500 public submissions.  The commission met a wide stakeholder group, conducted site visits across a large number of military locations around the country and met with more than 1,000 Defence Forces members and their representative associations.  As the Deputy knows, the report proposes very significant changes for the Defence Forces and covers high-level Defence Forces structures, defence capabilities, organisation, culture and human resources, the Reserve Defence Force, RDF, and above all funding.</p>  <p>  There are three indicative levels of ambition.  Level of ambition one represents current capability.  Level of ambition two represents enhanced capabilities, which would involve building on current capability to address specific priority gaps in our ability to deal with an assault on Irish sovereignty and serve in high-intensity peace support, crisis management and humanitarian relief operations overseas.  This would involve a significant defence funding increase of &euro;500 million per annum above current defence spending.  Level of ambition three would involve developing full-spectrum defence capabilities to protect Ireland and its people comparable to similar-sized countries in Europe.  The report sets out costings of approximately &euro;3 billion per annum for this.</p>  <p>  These are, therefore, very significant recommendations with very significant implications, particularly in respect of expenditure.  There have been interdepartmental consultations.  The Minister for Defence will bring forward a memo to Government in June in respect of that consultation between Departments and in respect of the recommendations with a view to the Government making decisions then within a timeline as to how we would enhance and strengthen our overall capabilities.</p>  <p>  We also accept that in the modern era, security challenges are such that they cannot be met individually on your own in the sense that we are part of the United Nations and of European Union security and defence discussions and the strategic compass in particular, which provides a political and strategic direction for EU security and defence policy for the next ten years.</p></speech>

The Commission on the Defence Forces was established at the end of 2020 and we still do not have an outcome or result.  One of the international members of the commission gave some public commentary a couple of days ago in which he described our Defence Forces as not being fit for purpose.  Those views were echoed by the Chief of Staff yesterday, which is a fairly scandalous indictment of what has happened over recent decades from an investment point of view.  I urge the Government to be as ambitious as possible in terms of both the content and the timing of the delivery of this.  We have no idea where the Ukrainian crisis is going, whether it is going to escalate or whether Ireland will become involved against its will, which is not entirely our decision.  I urge the Taoiseach to be as ambitious as possible.  I look forward to that memorandum going to the Government in the next number of weeks.</p></speech>

We accept the basic point that we need to enhance and strengthen our military capability, not least because the world has changed.  The immoral and unjustifiable war on Ukraine in many ways reveals certain vulnerabilities in European-wide security and the security of the European Union.  Moreover, in light of other threats, from cybersecurity to hybrid threats, it is not all about conventional welfare.  We need to strengthen our expertise and capability in cybersecurity, which we are doing and in respect of which we are allocating expenditure.  We also need to work with other member states in combating that and other forms of hybrid warfare.</p></speech>

This is an important Bill.  A number of Opposition amendments have been tabled.  Sinn F&eacute;in tabled amendments that would, for example, reverse the Government-imposed increase in the price of home heating oil that came into place last Sunday and, further, reduce it by &euro;118.  The amendments would also lead to a reduction in the cost of petrol, diesel and agri-diesel.  These are important amendments and, regardless of whether the Taoiseach supports them, he will, I hope, agree it is important Deputies have an opportunity to discuss their various merits or otherwise.  One hour is simply not good enough.  We ask, in good faith, that the Government allocate additional time.</p></speech>

As I indicated to Deputy Denis Naughten, who was deputising for the Ceann Comhairle at the meeting of the Business Committee last Thursday, we have been asking for several weeks for a proper debate on agriculture and the many issues relating to agriculture and food supply, such as the cost of fertilisers, oil and everything else.  The Government last night announced some paltry, ha'penny scheme.  We need something worthwhile.  Is the Government so far removed from the land that it has dumped the wellingtons and is forgetting rural Ireland?  It is all about the Pale, Cork city and other places and green projects, and to hell with farmers.  To hell or to Connacht; the old slogan.  We depend on the farming community.  Every village, town and hamlet depends on them, as does our food supply.  I want a meaningful debate.  The Government Chief Whip could not indicate last week when the Government would give us time to debate the issue here.  We need a full and comprehensive debate on farming issues and food supply.</p></speech>

Might we amend the Order of Business to take some time to tease out that question and debate why we cannot look at a compulsory purchase order to see the State finally take effective and legal ownership of the site on which the hospital is to be built?</p></speech>

It is not going to be possible to accommodate further business this week but we could commit to a debate on agriculture next week.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine will be available to take such a debate next week and the Chief Whip has indicated a willingness to accommodate it.

Imagine how those families felt when they learned in this morning's <i>Irish Independent</i>that the Government provided a mechanism for millionaires, with net assets of millions, to put off paying taxes during the Covid pandemic.  Why is it that the Government can always find schemes to benefit wealthy people?  In this instance, it allows them to warehouse &euro;6 million in taxes without paying interest, yet the Government constantly finds a reason to delay, frustrate or simply refuse to support families and workers in heating their homes, getting to work or feeding their families.</p><p>As was predicted in this House for many months, we now know that groceries are the latest necessity to see significant price hikes.  Does the Taoiseach now accept the Government needs to introduce a comprehensive package of measures to address the cost-of-living crisis?  This crisis was made worse by the Government's actions this week through another carbon tax hike.</p></speech>

This Government intervened in an unprecedented way during the Covid-19 pandemic to protect workers, in the main, businesses and enterprises right across the economy to an extraordinary degree.  It was the right thing to do because of the protection it gave to workers and jobs.  That was evidenced by the rebound in the economy in the aftermath of the pandemic as we emerged from the emergency phase of Covid itself.</p></speech>

Since the budget, we have allocated &euro;2 billion to a whole range of measures to reduce VAT rates, for example, in addition to the decision to increase the free fuel allowance.  Some &euro;914 was paid to eligible households over the course of the winter.  An additional lump sum of &euro;125 was paid to 370,000 households and a further &euro;100 on top of that.</p></speech>

These are alarming figures.  We know a major cause of homelessness is the lack of protection for renters against evictions and simply a lack of supply of sufficient homes for rental.  In my constituency of Dublin Bay South, we have a particularly high proportion of households and individuals who are reliant on private rental accommodation.  It is one of the reasons that last autumn, the first Bill I introduced in this House as a Deputy was a renters' rights Bill, which was legislation seeking to ensure greater security of tenure for tenants, in addition to ensuring better quality of life, better standards in rental accommodation and a three-year rent freeze to protect against the sort of dreadful hikes in rents we have seen.</p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach for an update as to whether and when we can see some of the principles in that legislation being brought into force.  It was not opposed by the Government and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, said he would look forward to working with me to bring aspects of it into effect. </p></speech>

A number of factors underpin that increase.  It needs to be pointed out that the current level of family homelessness at 1,080 is 34% below the peak figure recorded in July 2018.  The number of children under-18 associated with these families is 31% below the peak level recorded in September 2019.</p>  <p>  This Government has introduced approximately six rental Acts to deal with a whole range of issues, including protection.  We will work with the Deputy and other Members to see how we can further enhance that.</p></speech>

But that is not entirely correct because there are still many concerns.  In fact, two of the experts on the HSE board expressed concerns about the legal framework in place and as a result of those concerns they dissented from the vote.  Those two experts were Professor Deirdre Madden who is a professor in law, and I believe is the only legal expert on the HSE board, and Dr. Sarah McLoughlin who is a public advocacy and ethics expert.  I believe the Taoiseach appointed Dr. McLoughlin to the Medical Council at one time because of her expertise in the area.  Is the Taoiseach concerned that these two experts on the HSE board have expressed concerns about the legal ownership, the site and the building-----</p></speech>

I am not privy to the HSE board meetings.  It is a new departure that we now seem to be getting into a situation where there is public discussion of the individual contributions - whether they are accurate or not I do not know - of each individual member of the HSE board if they happen to take a particular stance on a particular issue.  That is a new departure that I do not intend to engage with because I cannot second guess meetings of a corporate body like the HSE governing authority.</p></speech>

There is great concern about the accessibility to the hospital, the level and quality of care and the threat to patient safety.  The Department of Health has appointed an expert team to investigate the chronic overcrowding and the apparent breakdown in the delivery of services.  Despite the fact that UHL gained an additional 100 beds in the past 18 months, last Thursday it recorded 126 people on trolleys.  That is the highest figure recorded since records began.  These patients were not in the emergency department.  They had been triaged and deemed to be in need of urgent admission.</p>  <p>  What are the terms of reference for the expert team?  Will they engage with the nursing staff, the GPs of the region and the ambulance services?  Will they engage with patients and listen to the traumatic experiences of patients?  It is imperative that they examine and indicate the additional supports and facilities that should be provided at Nenagh, Ennis and St. John's Hospital to alleviate pressure on UHL.  Would they also examine the need for step-down beds?  In the interests of transparency the outcome of this inquiry should be made public.</p></speech>

That expert team began its assessment at UHL last week.  A key part of the solution for Limerick is additional beds.  As the Deputy said, 150 additional beds were opened in UL Hospital group since 1 January 2020 of which 98 have been in UHL.  The hospital has reported that it is continuing to deal with record volumes of patients attending the emergency department.  It recorded a 10% increase in attendances in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2019.  The hospital is working to ensure that care is prioritised for the sickest patients and as part of the escalation plan additional ward rounds, accelerated discharges and identification of patients who transferred to UL model 2 hospitals are all underway.</p>  <p>  UHL is working with HSE Mid West community healthcare to formalise a governance structure to deliver on the investment in community care, hospital avoidance and chronic disease management for older persons.</p></speech>

It is time to tackle Lyme.  They met the T&aacute;naiste in 2015.  They have met with so many people.  All they want is quality of care and proper lab tests, which are available in Germany, to be recognised here.  These people are getting old.  They are parents and have adult children now.  They are worried about their future because this is a long term illness.  They want some quality of life, some treatments and a recognition of the disease.  Above all, they want an awareness campaign especially in the forests, woodlands and other places with signs put up to advise people that they might get this bite unknown to themselves and become very sick.  There is a need for the Government to recognise this and deal with it.

I have raised this issue with the Taoiseach many times, most recently last December when there were 25 patients on trolleys in SUH.  The Taoiseach said that he would ask the HSE to focus specifically on Sligo to determine how it could be helped further to alleviate pressure there in the next while.  Yesterday there were 39 patients on trolleys in SUH.  Today there are 50.  That is double what it was when I raised that with the Taoiseach last December.  These figures are not an aberration.  I have looked at the analysis of Trolley Watch figures.  Nationally, for the month of January from 2006 to 2022, the increase in numbers nationally was 22%.  Does the Taoiseach know what it was in SUH?  It was over 400%.  Those figures are unbelievable but true.</p></speech>

There are challenges and pressures at Sligo General Hospital, as the Deputy outlined.  Of that there is no doubt.</p> <p>The HSE is working actively with sites of concern, including Sligo, to mitigate the situation.  Key actions include reviewing discharges and egress options, liaising with smaller hospitals in the group to facilitate transfers, as appropriate, reviewing ED attendances, establishing alternative care pathways, as appropriate, in collaboration with community health organisation services and, of course, the prioritisation of diagnostics to aid in patient discharges.  Capital funding has been allocated in 2022 to progress a new 42-bed medical block and two further floors, with four floors in total, for expansion of day services activities, including a car park extension at Sligo University Hospital.  Included in these works is a new build consisting of 120 m by 210 m to enable the relocation of nuclear medicine and the reconfiguration of existing nuclear medicine with extension to take a second CT scanner and accompanying requirements.  Additional critical care capacity with the provision of four new isolation rooms at the ICU in Sligo University Hospital was designed and procured in 2020.  Construction is nearing completion.  A two-storey modular extension at the front of the hospital was funded as part of the response to Covid 19 and became operational in January.  That has provided additional waiting areas and treatment spaces for patients, as well as additional staff facilities.  Minor internal department reconfiguration is to be completed by the end of May.  Much capital work is, therefore, going in there to try to alleviate the pressures.</p></speech>

This will help greatly with reducing its cost.  However, there is an issue where the introduction of this scheme for commercial service will have a detrimental impact on services where a public service obligation, PSO, competes directly with a commercial service.  I give the example of the Naas to Maynooth route.  For someone with a student Leap card, the old PSO fare was &euro;4.30.  This will now be reduced to &euro;1.70 but for a commercial private operator the fare will stay at &euro;4.50.  In the interest of fair play, the concession being given to public transport will have to be extended to private commercial operators.  It is unfair competition.  These private commercial operators will not be able to compete with this level of fare reduction for a public service.  As I said, it is great we are reducing fares but it must be for all operators of public transport.</p></speech>

It is increasingly clear the classification of carer's allowance as a social assistance payment does not recognise the uniqueness of family carers within our social welfare system.  Many family carers I have spoken to feel strongly the means test for the allowance needs to be overhauled.  As the assessment of needs for carers is applied to gross rather than net income and does not consider mortgage repayments, dependent children, college fees, nursing home support scheme contributions and medical costs, it does not reflect the reality faced by many caring families.  Families may appear relatively financially comfortable based on their gross income but struggle to make ends meet when living expenses and costs of care are deducted.  The expectation a carer provides full-time care at least 35 hours per week for just &euro;16 more than the basic social welfare rates is untenable.  Government needs to demonstrate it recognises the value of carers.  I ask the Taoiseach to prioritise reforming the means testing of carers.</p></speech>

In budget 2022, the Government announced significant improvements in the means test for carer's allowance in recognition of the vital role carers play.  The general weekly income disregard for carer's allowance will be increased from &euro;332.50 to &euro;350 for a single person and from &euro;665 to &euro;750 for a couple.  That will enable more carers with modest incomes to become eligible for this scheme and those currently in receipt of a reduced payment may now receive a higher payment.  The capital disregard will also be increased from &euro;20,000 to &euro;50,000 for carer's allowance.  That will help carers who have accumulated relatively modest savings.  These have been some of the more significant changes to the means test for carers in many years and were welcomed by carer representative groups at the time of the budget.  In addition to these changes to the means test, all recipients of a weekly carer's payment will have seen a &euro;5 increase from January and those with children will also have seen an increase in the qualified child payment.</p>  <p>  I accept people will always want us to do more.  Based on the total number of carers identified as part of census 2016-----</p></speech>

Those who are already in a plan and there is a break do not get another one.  We are dealing with a number of situations.  Councillor Kevin Meenan raised at Dundalk municipal level the case of a healthcare assistant who was on a payment plan, got ill and was in hospital for an number of weeks.  She returned home to find the letters from HAP waiting for her.  She was told there would be no more payment plans and that she had to come up with &euro;1,600 in legacy arrears in five days.  This was not possible.  HAP stopped the payment to the landlord and he has issued an eviction notice for the middle of May.  She is facing an emergency operation this month as well as homelessness.  Those on payment plans, even if they are broken, re-engage and clear arrears.  Where does HAP think people are going to get this arrears payment in five days?  Is it from moneylenders?

Traditionally, Ulster Bank had a very significant presence in the Border region.  I know of many families, individuals and businesses in Cavan-Monaghan that are very concerned about the loss of banking services.  This is by far the biggest logistical challenge for Irish banking since the introduction of the euro as there are 960,000 Ulster Bank accounts and 300,000 KBC accounts in the State.  The backdrop to this is one of significant branch closures over the last decade and recent reduction of personnel through redundancy and non-replacement of retiring staff.  This means there is huge potential for disruption and so much additional pressure on bank employees.  There is a narrative out there about regular contact with key stakeholders, including the Central Bank, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and the Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland.  An unacceptable omission there is the Financial Services Union, FSU, which is the representative body for bank employees.  It is a key stakeholder.  I ask the Government and Department of Finance to use their influence with the Central Bank to ensure the FSU is at all the relevant negotiations.  I am aware the Central Bank is convening talks later this month with the five banks.  The FSU, as representative of the employees, should be present at all negotiations critical for a smooth transition during the exit of these banks from the State.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and his officials are engaging with the banks that have indicated their intentions to leave the market, in particular, KBC and Ulster Bank.  They have recently confirmed they will provide their customers with six months' notice to close their accounts.  The Minister and his officials are also engaging with Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland to ensure the remaining banks are prepared to accept applications from customers who are switching from the closing banks.  As the Deputy said, on 27 April the Central Bank issued so-called "dear CEO" letters to the five retail banks and to the largest financial services direct debit originators setting out the regulator's expectations and the requirement for a customer-focused approach.  On 17 May the Central Bank will meet the leaders of the retail banks at a round-table meeting to discuss their readiness for the migration of accounts from both Ulster Bank and KBC and to ensure all parties prioritise the interests of customers and prospective customers throughout the unprecedented volume of account migration.</p>  <p>  I will certainly convey to the Minister the Deputy's point on the FSU being a key stakeholder.  We will also be insisting the consumer protection code 2012 is adhered to in all aspects and that the code of conduct on the switching of payment accounts with payment service providers is in place to support customers.</p></speech>

My apologies to the six Deputies who have not been reached.  This is the first time since we introduced this new system that Deputies have not been reached.  The reason is Members who got called exceeded their time very substantially and the answers exceeded the time.</p> <p>I have to say, between Leaders' Questions and Questions on Policy or Legislation in recent times the disregard for the orders of the House are very significant.  It is very difficult to conduct business in an orderly fashion if everybody ignores the time limits laid down.  I do not make up the time limits - if Members do not like them they should change them - but it is my job to try to implement them.  It is not easy when one is constantly ignored.  I am not prepared to be ignored any further.</p></speech>

When responding to a Topical Issue debate raised by Deputy Gannon which was taken on 17 February 2022, I indicated from my script that the unlicensed product Cariban is considered to be a food supplement in Ireland.  This was incorrect.  The Department of Health officials have since been advised by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, that it would not be appropriate to classify Cariban as a food supplement.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-04a.198" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1460" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="15:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050400017#R00900"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to make provision whereby the entire Carrigaline local electoral area shall be prescribed as a rent pressure zone; to ensure that where a substantial area of a local electoral area is prescribed as a rent pressure zone, the local electoral area shall be prescribed as a rent pressure zone in its entirety; and for those purposes to amend the Local Government Act 2019 and the Residential Tenancies Act 2004. </blockquote>  <p>I imagine many people listening in are coming to the conclusion that it is unusual to move a Bill that is so local and specific.  However, I have been trying to highlight this for four years.  It is a matter of legislation.  It is a loophole in the legislation.  There may be other areas effected - I am unaware of them.  The legislation also seeks to prevent that the difficulty created by the loophole does not arise in other areas.</p><p>It is a relatively straightforward Bill but could have a huge impact on protecting renters in Carrigaline, Ballygarvan, Crosshaven and the surrounding areas.</p><p>Most of County Cork and, indeed, all of the city are prescribed as rent pressure zones reflecting the seriously unstable rental market that we have in Cork.  This important prescription as a rent pressure zone is necessary as it ensures that rent increases are kept to the level of inflation and protects renters from uncontrolled rent hikes.</p><p>Rent pressure zone protection is not perfect by any means.  My party would prefer and has repeatedly called for a rent freeze.  However, a rent pressure zone prevents landlords from asking for whatever rent increase they want.</p><p>However, due to a crazy loophole, the part of Carrigaline south of the Owenabue river as well as Ballygarvan, Crosshaven and some of the outlying areas are not included in a rent pressure zone.  Those renters are vulnerable to landlords who can increase rent to any level that they want with no regulation.  Despite it being a much-in-demand rental area, rents could be increased by &euro;300 or &euro;400.  There is no restriction on rental increases.</p><p>This loophole has been allowed to exist for five years.  In 2017, the Ballincollig-Carrigaline electoral area was prescribed as a rent pressure zone.  At that time, south Carrigaline, Crosshaven and Ballygarvan were part of the Bandon-Kinsale electoral area, which had not been designated.  In 2019, the boundaries were redrawn and the electoral area, as we now know it, was created.  However, the rent pressure zone boundary was never amended to reflect this new electoral area to bring these areas into the rent pressure zone and to afford renters there the rental protections that their neighbours would have.  To put this into context, there are 3,394 people living in 1,415 rental properties in the Carrigaline electoral area.  Because of this loophole, 35.4% of those are currently outside the rent pressure zone and have no protection.  Therefore, 500 properties and 1,200 renters have been left vulnerable.  They can face whatever rent increases their landlords decide with no protection.</p><p>I have raised this with two housing Ministers and numerous other Ministers as well.  Initially, the former Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Mr. Eoghan Murphy, sought to suggest that this would be caught by ongoing reviews.  However, subsequent replies from the Department make it clear that is untrue and that it requires a change of legislation.</p><p>As I said, it is not common that a TD would introduce a piece of legislation on such a specific and localised issue but this is a matter of legislation and policy and I have not succeeded in trying to pressure housing Ministers in relation to this.  There are two Ministers and the Taoiseach in the constituency and it is a matter of regret to me that it has not been resolved over the course of all this time.  I note comments from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, that it would be sorted out next autumn and that it will be next autumn before any action is taken.  We were given commitments in autumn 2021 by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, but if we can see progress on it I will be satisfied with that.  It has taken far too long.  We have been given commitments at various stages over the past three or four years and no progress has been made on it.</p><p>I believe it is necessary to take this action here to highlight it in a more specific and concrete way.  I hope to have the opportunity to move the Bill on Second Stage and I hope that it prompts Government finally to act on this and to provide that protection.</p><p>It is far from a bullet-proof protection.  We need a rent freeze.  We have a cost-of-living crisis.  Cork has the third highest rents in the State averaging over &euro;1,300 per month but the Bill will at least allow some protection from unlimited increases to renters living in Carrigaline, Ballygarvan and Crosshaven.  I do not believe that they should have to wait until next autumn for action.  They are vulnerable right now.</p><p>We need to stand up for renters.  We need to close this loophole.  It is clear the law needs to change.  I urge the Government to work with us and to support this Bill.</p></speech>

T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm an deis seo a fh&aacute;il &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh agus cead a lorg &eacute; a fhoilsi&uacute;.  Bille cuimsitheach at&aacute; ann agus creidim f&eacute;in go bhfuil tairbhe mh&oacute;r ag baint leis.  I am delighted to get this opportunity to introduce this Bill before the House.  It is a comprehensive Bill with 30 sections and it has been four years in gestation.</p><p>I thank my colleagues on the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Rural and Community Development and the Islands for their interest in this Bill and the staff of the office of parliamentary legal advisers, OPLA, for all the work they have done.  I also thank the person who came to me first and made what is a very interesting suggestion to me.</p><p>The Irish banks first opened in the late 18th century and since then they have held safe deposit boxes.  It is believed that these boxes, many of which are unclaimed, could hold items of historical interest.  In the event of no owner being identified the Bill proposes that those of historical interest should be transferred to the National Museum of Ireland, which might pass them on to other appropriate agencies such as the National Gallery and the National Library, while any cash not claimed should be lodged in the Dormant Accounts Fund.</p><p>The specific provisions of the Bill are broken into four parts.  The first purpose is to create a register of property deposits in banks.</p> <p>The second purpose is to identify the safekeeping property deposit where the records are sufficient to identify a living or beneficial owner starting with the oldest deposits first.  There are all sorts of provisions included to publish and look for owners where they are not readily identifiable.</p> <p> The third purpose is to examine all property where the owners are not identified and to notify the director of the National Museum of Ireland of any unclaimed property.  He or she will then examine the property and decide whether it should be retained by the museum or by certain other bodies and put on display.</p> <p> The Bill also provides for the transfer of unclaimed funds to the Dormant Accounts Fund.</p> <p> I stress that the idea is that all safe deposits will be recorded in chronological order, from the beginning of the banks in the late 18th century, and no safe deposit box held by a bank for less than 80 years will be opened.  The youngest age at which one is likely to be making such a deposit is 20, which means the safe deposit box would not be opened until that person is over 100 years of age.</p> <p> The Bill is broken into several Parts, if the Ceann Comhairle will afford me a little indulgence.  The first deals with preliminary and general matters, including the purposes of the Bill, the Short Title, the interpretation section, expenses and regulations and offences under the Bill.  The second Part provides for registration, notification and examination of historical property deposits.  The third Part provides for the retention by the State of unclaimed property.  The fourth Part provides for notification of other persons for the performance of statutory functions.  The fifth Part provides for the disposal of unclaimed property and the transfer of unclaimed moneys.  The sixth Part provides for miscellaneous matters.</p> <p> Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCeann Comhairle.

On Tuesday 15 March, I met the editorial board of <i>The Washington Post</i>to share the Government's priorities and exchange views on current events, including the ongoing war and suffering in Ukraine.</p><p>I attended a lunch for Congressman Richard Neal to recognise his long record as a friend of Ireland and to mark the conferring on him of an honorary doctorate from Dublin City University.</p><p>At the unveiling of a newly commissioned bust of John Hume, sculpted by artist Liz O'Kane, I spoke of the former leader and civil rights campaigner and on his lasting impact on peace on this island.</p><p>I also attended a Tourism Ireland reception, marking the opening night of the 25th anniversary American tour of Riverdance.</p><p>The following day, my visit included a series of economic engagements in partnership with IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, and Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, including a women in business executive round table and a US Chamber of Commerce and Science Foundation Ireland event.  During that event, I was pleased to present the SFI St. Patrick's Day medal to the Collison brothers for their achievement in building their business, Stripe, into a global success, and to Professor Donald McDonnell for his important work in developing new treatments for breast and prostate cancers.</p><p>On the same day, I spoke by phone with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine.  He expressed his gratitude for the support of the Government and people of Ireland, on which he was well briefed, and he expressed his condolences on the killing of photojournalist and camera operator Pierre Zakrzewski.  I expressed our strong support for his country in the face of an unprovoked and unjustifiable war.</p><p>I also had a telephone call with Vice President Harris discussing Russia's brutal aggression in Ukraine.  We also discussed US support for the Good Friday Agreement.  This was in place of the traditional St. Patrick's Day breakfast which was cancelled as the Second Gentleman had tested positive for Covid-19.</p><p>As was widely reported, I attended part of The Ireland Funds 30th anniversary dinner but departed early as I received a positive result to a precautionary Covid-19 test.</p><p>On St. Patrick's Day, I had a bilateral meeting by video with President Biden.  We had a substantive encounter, lasting approximately an hour.  We discussed important aspects of the US-Irish relationship, including the increasingly two-way dynamic economic relationship between us and the need to improve options for young people, especially, to move between our countries with greater ease.  I also raised with him the situation of undocumented Irish migrants in the US.  We discussed the situation on the protocol and political developments in Northern Ireland, and the President reiterated his strong commitment, and that of other senior US political figures, to the Good Friday Agreement.  On Ukraine, we exchanged views on the latest situation at that time, noting the bravery of the people of Ukraine in defending their democracy.  We were both committed to supporting the strongest possible sanctions against Russia and the earliest possible end to the war.</p><p>I also met virtually with Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Congressman Richard Neal, both of whom reiterated their commitment to implementation of the protocol and to the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>Although I was not able to be present, I was pleased that President Biden continued the long-standing tradition of the shamrock ceremony in the White House, and that the Speaker's lunch continues to be an important annual fixture on the Hill.</p><p>Throughout my visit, I highlighted the strong cultural and two-way beneficial economic ties between Ireland and the United States, and thanked our partners in the United States for their ongoing support for the Good Friday Agreement, in all circumstances.  The war in Ukraine was top of our shared agenda.  I made clear that Ireland stands with the people of Ukraine and I welcomed our co-operation with the United States both bilaterally and at the United Nations in defence of democracy in Ukraine, and of their rights under international law.</p></reply>

Will the Taoiseach outline the progress he and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have made in recent years in advancing supports, protections and rights for undocumented Irish living in the United States?  Government engagements with the diaspora when in the US are, of course, enormously important.  However, they will be viewed by many as shallow if not matched by visible efforts to advance the needs and rights of Irish immigrants.  There are, as the Taoiseach knows, tens of thousands of Irish people in America who need to regularise their status.  Will the Taoiseach give us an update on works to achieve that aim?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-04a.234" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050400018#S02700"><p>Two 80-year-old US military veterans, Mr. Ken Mayers and Mr. Tarak Kauff, were yesterday acquitted of criminal damage at Shannon Airport and acquitted of trespass, although some headlines read that they were convicted.  They were convicted for interference with the workings of the airport, which was a broader and more catch-all allegation.  They were acquitted by a jury on counts of criminal damage even though they admitted criminal damage because their defence was that it was justified to prevent a greater crime, namely, the crimes of the US military, of which the accused were former members.  The men had friends who committed suicide because of the terrible things they were forced to do as members of the US military in wars around the world.  Does the Taoiseach think that the jury has something to tell him about the need to condemn US military action and to stop using Shannon Airport as a site for US military aggression around the world?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-04a.235" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050400018#S02800"><p>I ask the Taoiseach to make a clear statement of criticism and condemnation of the US for its threats against the Solomon Islands.</p> <p>The Solomon Islands has done a security deal with China, which could allow China to establish a military base in that country.  Obviously, we are no friends of the authoritarian Chinese regime and do not recommend such a course but it is clearly the choice of a sovereign government.  This was the response of the US ambassador:</p><blockquote>	Of course, we have respect for the Solomon Islands sovereignty, but we also wanted to let them know that if steps were taken to establish a de facto permanent military presence ... then we would have significant concerns, and we would very naturally respond to those concerns ... </blockquote> <p>When asked whether that could include military action, the ambassador refused to rule it out.  The biggest imperialist global superpower on Earth is threatening a very small country of less than 1 million people, saying that if that country does not make decisions in line with its interests, it could face military action.  Will there be condemnation of that?</p></speech>

I commend him on his strong words condemning the recent Russian video purporting to show a nuclear attack on Ireland.  I am conscious, as we all are, that the war in Ukraine was a significant backdrop to the Taoiseach's visit to the US and was the subject of many of his engagements.  I also note his conversation with President Zelenskyy of Ukraine.  Given the recent developments and the growing evidence of Russian complicity in war crimes and atrocities in Bucha, the east of Ukraine and elsewhere, and given that so many of us have called for the expulsion of the Russian ambassador, did the Taoiseach receive any briefings from US intelligence in the course of his engagements in the US on the activities of Russian intelligence agents based in the Orwell Road embassy here?  The Taoiseach previously reported, in response to a question I asked, that the Government had moved to expel four senior Russian diplomats from the embassy here but quite a number remain.  Can the Taoiseach give us any information from US intelligence about their actions here?</p></speech>

The E-3 visa Bill was previously stopped in its tracks at the last minute by one Senator objecting.  Irish advocacy groups estimate that there could be up to 10,000 people in the United States whose position has not been regularised, who are referred to as "the undocumented".  We know how precarious that position can be when a pandemic hits.  Those people are working hard, contributing to society and rearing families in many instances.  It is very important that this issue is kept on the agenda.</p>  <p>  One other issue I would like to see kept  on the agenda is the need for President Biden to appoint a special envoy to Northern Ireland.  That intense contact and the development of bilateral relations will be for the benefit of the people of both Northern Ireland and the United States.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-04a.239" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1552" speakername="Se&aacute;n Haughey" time="16:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050400019#T00400"><p>Democracy as a form of government in the world is under threat.  Authoritarian regimes pose an ongoing challenge to the liberal democracies of the West.  We have witnessed a rise in global populism and the so-called strongman leader.  The Russian invasion of Ukraine, ordered by Vladimir Putin, has highlighted this conflict in a very stark way.  Recognising the threat to liberal democratic values in the world, President Biden hosted a democracy summit last December.  The President has talked about the battle between democracies and autocracies.  We are very clear as to what side Ireland is on.  We advocate free trade as well as a rules-based international order and the use of multilateral diplomacy for solving disputes.  Does the Taoiseach agree with President Biden's analysis of the geopolitical situation?  While the recent results in the French and Slovenian elections demonstrate the strength of democracy in those countries, does the Taoiseach agree that we can never become complacent about the merits of the liberal democratic system?</p></speech>

Wade judgment could open the door to abortion bans in half of all American states.  The victims of such a counter-revolution would, in the main, be working-class women and poorer women and women of colour in particular.  How many will be driven to the backstreets?  How many will have their health endangered?  How many will die?  An overturning of Roe <i>v</i>. Wade could even threaten rights to same-sex marriage and birth control.  In the 1960s and 1970s, civil rights for blacks, LGBTQ people and women were won on the streets.  There needs to be a return to the streets now in massive numbers to defend abortion rights.  I know this is not an issue the Taoiseach will have discussed with the US President at their most recent meeting but is it likely to be on the agenda of their next meeting?  This has implications not just in the US but worldwide.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-04a.241" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="16:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050400019#T00600"><p>We consistently raised the issue of the undocumented with the President and with many political leaders in the US.  I was somewhat taken aback by Deputy &Oacute; Broin's use of the word "shallow".  This has been a consistent approach by the Irish Government with different levels of the American Administration to get a change in what is fundamentally a policy issue for Capitol Hill, for Congress and for the Executive.  Over the years we have sought an Irish-specific visa scheme.  The bipartisan reintroduction of the E-3 visa Bill in Washington in mid-March was a very welcome development.  That is something we will be keeping a very watchful eye on to see if we can, in that context, deal with some of the issues pertaining to the undocumented.</p>  <p>  Through my own political career I have been very anxious to create legal channels for migration between Ireland and the United States, given our historic friendship.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs, I was involved in agreeing the working holiday authorisation agreement between the US and Ireland, which resumed on 1 November last year.  The J1 programme has been a tremendously successful part of the Irish-US bilateral relationship, with 150,000 Irish third level students and young people having participated in the programme over the past 50 years.</p>  <p>  I raised the issue of the undocumented with President Biden.  He has demonstrated his commitment to immigration issues, including possible pathways to citizenship for the undocumented, in his U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021.  Our embassy in Washington and the network of consulates across the US continue to engage with political leaders from both side of the aisle and at all levels to see if we can get an innovative solution to address the legal issues facing the Irish undocumented in the US.  However, in recent times those on the Hill have not looked specifically at one country or ethnic group alone.  They tend to want a comprehensive solution.  There has been significant opposition to migration and immigration reform in the US.  Our emigrant support programme penetrates very deeply and engages with many Irish and diaspora organisations in the US for a range of projects.  When I visited New York in September, I saw great evidence of that and met all the groups involved.  I went to the New York Irish Arts Center, which we have been supporting since 2008.  I was involved in initiating Irish grant aid towards the Irish Arts Center, which has now been dedicated and will provide a wonderful forum for Irish and Irish-American art, drama and theatre and so forth. </p>  <p>  Regarding the points raised by Deputies Boyd Barrett and Paul Murphy, I would agree with Deputy Haughey that President Biden is correct in identifying a growing number of authoritarian regimes that are out to undermine democracy.  I do not believe America is out to undermine democracy.  I do not see America as an imperial power in the sense Deputy Paul Murphy does.  In the middle of a war, when the Russian Federation has launched a very immoral and unjustifiable war on Ukraine, the US is doing everything it possibly can to defend the people of Ukraine and to give measured and balanced leadership in respect of that.</p></speech>

He was particularly appreciative of the Irish humanitarian response and the number of displaced persons who we have received from Ukraine, as well as other initiatives, including sanctions and support for Ukraine's European perspective.</p> <p> Deputy Brendan Smith raised the issue of the undocumented.  Our consulates and the embassy in Washington are doing everything possible to encourage representatives to progress migration reform, but it is a factor of US democracy and the US political system at the moment that migration reform is not easy.  We were close some years ago.  There was one vote in the difference on the E-3 visa.  We hope that we can get that back on the agenda.  The Speaker and others say they are determined to get that done and we will continue to pursue that.</p> <p> Deputy Haughey raised the issue highlighted by President Biden since he became President, that there is an essential struggle in the world to preserve and underpin democracies.  The war in Ukraine is a wake-up call to people that enough is enough.</p></speech>

It was a positive opportunity to engage with Irish community representatives and business leaders.  I met with Prime Minister Johnson during my visit.  We discussed the brutal Russian invasion of Ukraine and the profound global security, economic and humanitarian consequences.  Having just come from a meeting of European Union leaders in Versailles, I emphasised the strength and unity of the European Union response.  The Prime Minister and I welcomed the close collaboration between the EU, United Kingdom and other partners to hold Russia to account, to provide support to Ukraine and to address the humanitarian needs of its people, noting that in an uncertain world, the European Union and the United Kingdom are key partners, underpinned by shared values.</p>  <p>  We also discussed political developments in Northern Ireland, looking ahead to the Assembly elections this month.  We emphasised the need for the two Governments to work closely together to ensure a return to the full operation of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.  I highlighted the importance of ongoing engagement between the European Union and United Kingdom on issues relating to the Northern Ireland protocol and the importance of reaching durable, practical solutions for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.  My visit to London also gave me a positive opportunity to engage with a range of business and community groups and to participate in London's St. Patrick's Day festival and parade.</p></reply>

We know that these statements have everything to do with the British Prime Minister's political woes, but the reality remains that the Conservative party is fundamentally reckless and cares little about the North of our country or its people.  The Nationality and Borders Act is a case in point.  Not only is the legislation an affront to Britain's international obligations, but it will be very damaging to the North's economy and society.  The legislation also undermines the Belfast Agreement and the common travel area and creates significant restrictions of freedom of movement on the island.  Will the Taoiseach give us more detail about his engagement with Boris Johnson, whether they discussed these two Acts and what additional efforts the Taoiseach and his officials will make in advance of the opening of Parliament on 10 May?</p></speech>

People Before Profit is one of a few parties in this House that is also represented in the North, with an MLA in Belfast West.  We run candidates across the constituencies and will hopefully challenge for new seats in Derry, with a bit of luck.  People on the doorsteps are talking about the cost of living and the same issues that the Taoiseach's Government has failed to deal with, including the spiralling cost of living, energy prices and unaffordable rents.  Despite the attempts of the DUP in particular to divert people's attention back along the same old failed sectarian lines, people are talking about the need for action on the cost of living and rent controls, which we have being calling for North and South and which have been resisted by those in government both North and South.  Actual rent controls would make rents affordable.  There should be windfall taxes on the profits of energy companies and actual controls on the price of heating and energy fuel.</p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach agree that that is actually what is really concerning people and that Governments both North and South are failing to address the concerns that affect people, whether Catholic or Protestant or in the North or South, including the cost of living and housing?  Did he discuss with Boris Johnson the need to have a radical shift to address those issues in the way that People Before Profit candidates are campaigning for in the Assembly elections?</p></speech>

The UK holds 4% of voting rights at the International Monetary Fund, IMF, which is the biggest holder of Ukrainian debt.  It is due to pay over &euro;2.5 billion this year, which is equivalent to 16.5 million average pension payments in Ukraine.  In exchange for this money, the IMF imposed conditionalities on Ukraine, including liberalisation and promotion of foreign trade, the removal of price controls on essential commodities, the reduction of subsidies on essential goods, cutbacks in public services and the privatisation of state-owned enterprises.  People understand what IMF programmes do.  They are not in the interests of ordinary people.  The indebtedness of Ukraine is a consequence of the oligarchisation of Ukrainian society and the failure to tax the rich.</p> <p>It is odious debt; it is not the debt of the people.  It is a huge burden on the ordinary people of Ukraine in terms of the conflict with Russia and the attempt to repel the invasion but also in the context of rebuilding of the country.  This is why there is a demand from social movements in Ukraine and from the largest trade union there for the cancellation of the debt.  When I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, about the matter, I received quite an incredible response to the effect that "debt forgiveness by the IMF risks impairing the Fund's financial integrity".  Will somebody please think of the IMF's financial integrity and that fact that it is going to be in some way undermined by taking the absolutely necessary step of cancelling Ukraine's debt?</p></speech>

I had the pleasure of canvassing on Saturday in Belfast South with Matthew O'Toole and Elsie Trainor of the SDLP, along with Claire Hanna, the MP there.  The concerns that so many people share in the North are about what will happen after the election takes place and, in particular, what approach the DUP, which is likely to remain the largest unionist party, will take regarding the return of the power-sharing Executive.  Has the Taoiseach had any discussions with the British Prime Minister about how the Governments here and in London will address this matter?  What concerns has the Taoiseach raised with Boris Johnson about the potential for the British Government to, depending on how the elections in Stormont on Thursday turn out, introduce legislation to undermine or diminish the Northern Ireland protocol?</p></speech>

There were many dark days on our island during the era known as the Troubles, but that was darkest day of all because 33 innocent people were murdered and hundreds were badly injured.  Sadly, nobody has been brought to justice for those horrific crimes.  The Taoiseach will recall that in 2008, 2011 and 2016 this House unanimously passed motions calling on the British Government to give an independent legal expert access to papers relevant to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  Sadly, the British Government has not responded to the legitimate requests of a sovereign parliament.  This inaction on the part of the British Government is absolutely reprehensible.</p>  <p>  For many years, the Taoiseach will have heard me express concerns about the Belturbet bombings of 1972, when two young innocent teenagers, Geraldine O'Reilly and Patrick Stanley, were murdered.  Some time ago, I put on the record of this House information given to me by the University of Nottingham which showed conclusively that state forces in Northern Ireland colluded in the transport of the bomb from County Fermanagh to Belturbet on that fateful night.  Families have waited for decades to try to get to the truth.  In the Taoiseach's next engagements with the British Government and Mr. Johnson, these issues must be top of the agenda.  We must try to ensure that the truth is obtained for the families involved, who continue to suffer and grieve so much as a result of the actions of murderers operating on behalf of paramilitary organisations and some within British state forces.</p></speech>

They have also caused problems for British-Irish relations.  We should enjoy an harmonious relationship with our nearest neighbour, for so many reasons, but this has not been possible in recent years.  As we are aware, the Northern Ireland Assembly elections take place tomorrow.  Does the Taoiseach agree that it is vitally important that an Executive is formed fairly quickly once the election results are declared in order that normal politics can resume in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland?  Will he engage with the British Prime Minister on this matter in order that the British and the Irish Governments can, if necessary, intervene as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement?  In addition, would the Taoiseach agree that the Northern Ireland protocol issue needs to be resolved, once and for all, in the interests of the peace process and to ensure that normal British-Irish relations can be restored?</p></speech>

By way of a supplementary question, when does he next intend to meet with the British Prime Minister?  Does the Taoiseach believe that the formal arrangement of a monthly or fortnightly phone call between him and the Prime Minister is imperative?  We are entering the final few hours of the election campaign in Northern Ireland.  I would like to believe that everyone in this Chamber very much hopes to see an Executive established quickly.  That is going to require the direct involvement of the British and Irish Governments.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider that we would finally get formalised - not <i>ad hoc</i>- meetings between him and the British Prime Minister, and that such an arrangement be extended to include meetings between all Irish Cabinet Ministers and their British counterparts?</p></speech>

We all want the Executive up and running.  We all probably thought that some of what happened in the context of undermining the Irish protocol was possibly a sop to unionism.  We believed that there were bigger fish to fry for the British Government and the European Union.  The fear is that the British Government is willing to enter into a game of chicken.  We need to know what interactions the Taoiseach has had with Boris Johnson in dealing with this, and with the Nationality and Borders Act.  As was stated previously, we need a formal set-up to ensure that any issues which exist are dealt with.  Obviously, it must be stated absolutely explicitly to the British Government that this is not workable and is utterly ridiculous.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Broin raise the issue of the Nationality and Borders Act, and the recent leaks or articulation around Brexit and the protocol.  We decided not to take the bait entirely, given that people in Northern Ireland are in the midst of an election.  I was anxious that we would allow the election conclude without us wading in, so to speak, because that could be misconstrued.  That said, we are very clear that the protocol issue can be resolved between the United Kingdom Government and the European Union.  There is a landing zone there, and, in my view, there has been for quite some time.  I believe that European Commission Vice President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič has made very strong and valiant efforts to reach a compromise.  He did not produce a <i>fait accompli</i>, but he did produce significant advancements on the EU position which should, I believe, have been received more generously by the British Government.  The discussions continue.  The Foreign Secretary is now in charge of the British perspective in the context of engaging with Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič.  I anticipate that after the election an indication will emerge fairly quickly as to whether a desire to get an agreement is there or not.</p><p>In my view, it is very clear also that the protocol is benefiting Northern Ireland.  Anybody I have met, be it business or political, is very clear that they want to maintain access to the European Single Market.  Along with access to the market in Great Britain, this puts Northern Ireland in a relatively advantageous position for inward investment and also for indigenous companies to export, to develop and to grow.  The Nationality and Borders Act is not acceptable.  It would be very damaging to Northern Ireland.  Whoever conceived of this genuinely does not understand the island, or its impact on Northern Ireland.  We have made representations in this regard and will continue to do so</p><p>Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to the Northern Ireland Assembly elections.  With regard to the cost of living, I must disagree with the Deputy.  We have been far more advanced in responding to the cost-of-living issues than perhaps the Executive in the North has.  We have responded with &euro;2.1 billion in measures to mitigate the rising cost of living.  The personal income tax package is worth &euro;520 million.  The social welfare package is &euro;550 million.  In the budget the fuel allowance will increase the weekly rate so that &euro;114 is paid to eligible households over the course of the winter.  An additional lump sum of &euro;125 was paid to 370,000 households receiving the fuel allowance in mid-March, and a further &euro;100 will be paid in the coming weeks.  There has been a 55% increase in the 2021-22 fuel allowance.  We have reduced the excise duty on petrol, diesel and green diesel, saving motorists between &euro;9 and &euro;12 each time they fill their tank.  We have reduced VAT from 13.5% to 9% on gas and electricity bills from the start of the month until the end of October.  This will result in an estimated annual saving of between &euro;50 and &euro;70 for households.  Households are now seeing the &euro;200 energy credit appearing on their bills.</p> <p>We will reduce the annual public service obligation, PSO, levy from &euro;58 to zero by October.  We will reduce caps on multiple school transport fees for children, as well as reducing VAT on kerosene, which is the main type of home heating oil in Ireland, to 12%.  We did not do that because of the impact on the wider Exchequer, given that we would have to do something about a whole range of other goods and services.  We did take other measures as well, however, in terms of transport fares coming down.</p> <p> On Deputy Paul Murphy's question, I met with Prime Minister Shmyhal from Ukraine recently when he stopped off in Shannon.  He was actually heading to the United States to meet members of the Washington Administration and representatives from the IMF.  There are different mechanisms than the one the Deputy put forward in terms of debt cancellation that the Ukrainian Government is exploring with the IMF and others.  Ukraine will need the support of many member states to ensure that is current budget is supported and that there are continued supports for it on the current side and on the reconstruction side.</p> <p> Deputy Bacik raised the concerns about the position after the election.  Again, my view is that after the election, all political parties should take their seats and work towards the establishment of the Northern Ireland Executive, irrespective of the result.  The electorate want people to fulfil their mandate, take their seats and set up the Executive.</p> <p> I appreciate the comments made by Deputy Brendan Smith regarding the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  The views of this House were unanimously expressed in a motion in the context of appointing an independent person who would have independent legal access to the documents and work done at the University of Nottingham.  I have raised the broader issue of legacy consistently with Prime Minister Johnson during our bilateral meetings, not just in March but prior to that.  We have written to him to express our deep concern at the approach set out in the British Government's July command paper and to emphasise that any decision to proceed with UK legislation on that basis would have negative consequences for reconciliation for victims and for political stability in Northern Ireland.  That remains our position.  We do not favour unilateralism in the context of legacy.  We believe the British Government needs to respond to the views and concerns of victims, primarily in relation to the legacy issue, and follow through on the Stormont House Agreement, which was agreed in 2014 between both Governments and the parties.  That is the way forward.  It is a comprehensive framework.</p> <p> Deputy Haughey is correct in terms of the impact Brexit and the protocol are having on British-Irish relations.  We need to get the issues resolved in order that we can have a more dynamic post-Brexit relationship on a whole range of fronts.  We have many discussions on the way in terms of joining the shared island initiative, with an east-west dimension in respect of research projects, for example.  I think it would be well-received by all communities in the North if there was that east-west dimension.  The British Government has indicated support for research hubs on the island, which we are supporting through the shared island funding.</p> <p> To answer Deputy Richmond, we do meet regularly.  The meetings are formalised and have set agendas.  We continue to engage as issues arise.</p></speech>

The most recent meeting took place on Monday, 4 April, and the next is planned for Thursday, 12 May.  This committee oversees the implementation of Housing for All and the delivery of programme for Government commitments regarding housing and related matters.  Housing for All is the most ambitious housing plan in the history of our State, backed by the highest ever level of investment with more than &euro;4 billion in annual guaranteed State investment in housing over the coming years.  The plan contains a range of actions and measures to ensure more than 300,000 new homes are built by 2030.  This figure includes 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost-rental homes.</p>  <p>  On 7 April, the Government published the third quarterly progress report under Housing for All.  It shows strong progress towards the fundamental reform of the housing system, setting the course to significantly increase the supply of housing and provide a sustainable housing system into the future.  Of 213 actions in Housing for All, a total of 135 have either been completed already or are being delivered on an ongoing basis.  Data from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, shows that despite the disruption caused by Covid-19, a total of 20,433 new dwellings were completed in 2021.  Some 5,669 homes were completed during the first quarter of this year, representing the highest number of quarterly home completions in the State for many years.  In particular, there is a significant pick-up in apartment development.  There is also a strong pipeline indicated for 2022, with more than 34,000 commencements in the 12 months to March 2022.  This data shows that our Housing for All strategy is working in its focus to provide sustainable homes for people in the right places and we are confident that the target for delivery of 24,600 homes in 2022 will be met.</p>  <p>  The plan also contains measures aimed at addressing capacity issues in the construction industry, promoting viability and driving down the cost of construction over time.  Under the plan, Government has also implemented a number of measures to make homes more affordable to buy or to rent.  We are also continuing to support our most vulnerable, namely, those experiencing homelessness and who have more complex housing needs.  The situation arising in Ukraine and our commitment to house those fleeing the war makes the delivery of Housing for All more important than ever.  It also raises challenges such as inflationary pressures and supply chain issues, which will need careful monitoring to ensure we stay on track to deliver targeted housing supply.  The Cabinet committee will maintain focus on this delivery.</p></reply>

Let us take his city of Cork.  Since he became Taoiseach, rents have increased by 15% to &euro;1,400 per month.  Average house prices in Cork have increased 20% under his tenure to &euro;320,000.  Homelessness is up an astonishing 26%, which is the highest it has ever been and higher than the high point of September 2019.  Social housing need is approximately 7,000 households yet the Government's housing plan will only meet approximately 45% of that through to 2026.  The latest affordable housing figures just agreed with Cork City Council are going to provide just 75 affordable homes to purchase per year in the Taoiseach's city for the lifetime of this Government.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach's legacy will be the highest house prices and rents in the history of the State, a shrinking private rental sector, high homelessness levels and a failure to meet social and affordable housing need, and that was before we had the Ukrainian refugee crisis.  I urge him to put aside the misleading briefings that he is being given, reflect on the failure of his housing pan and put in place a new housing plan that means no person or family is left behind.</p></speech>

I find this a bizarre statement for him to make.  This seems like reckless deflection but with a potentially dangerous subtext, which some on the far right, worryingly, have already tried to pick up on.  The Minister needs to be completely disabused of his notions.  The reason the homelessness figures are going through the roof is because we had an eviction ban and a rent increase ban that were effective during Covid-19.  Then, the Government removed those things, and the situation has gotten worse since then.  The vast majority of people - and they are the ones coming into my clinic week in, week out - who end up in homeless services do so because they are evicted by landlords on grounds of sale when they have done absolutely nothing wrong, or because rents are absolutely astronomical and they cannot afford them, and the housing assistance payment, HAP, limits will not reach to those levels.  I appeal to the Taoiseach and the Minister not to engage in dangerous deflection tactics and admit that they need to bring in things like an eviction ban to prevent evictions and control rents to make them affordable.</p></speech>

New rents have increased by 9% over the last 12 months.  Homelessness has increased by 22% in the same period.  House prices are about to reach record levels, surpassing their Celtic tiger peaks.  Analysis by Dr. Lorcan Sirr and Mr. Mel Reynolds shows that the number of new homes available to individual buyers last year fell to just 5,698, the lowest number in several years.</p> <p>Home ownership levels are in freefall under the Government.  We desperately need more homes that are affordable; instead, build-to-rent is dominating the supply of new housing, especially in Dublin.  A total of 82% of all residential schemes that went for planning or got planning permission in 2020 in Dublin city were build-to-rent schemes.  Despite this, the Planning Regulator has told Dublin City Council it must drop its plans to curtail build-to-rent because it conflicts with national policy.</p> <p> Is it now national policy to allow build-to-rent to dominate the supply of housing?  What is the Government doing to enable local authorities to curtail the dominance of build-to-rent?</p></speech>

Otherwise, people are going to be put in incredibly difficult circumstances, having to make an instant repayment of arrears.  Between that and the fact they will be facing homelessness, we are making a bad situation worse.</p>  <p>  Along with that, will the Taoiseach update us on the issue of dealing with vacant properties from the point of view of it being one of the solutions to the housing issue?  Where do things stand in respect of an audit of State land to determine what is suitable for building on?</p></speech>

It is Government policy to keep people in their homes as long as possible.  I am working with a 103-year-old lady, who has an excellent family.  She had some minor work done in the past two years to have her home&rsquo;s roof and heating fixed, and she came to me a few weeks ago about getting her windows and doors refitted because of the cost of heating and her age.  The council has told me it will not carry out any more works, but I have told the council this lady is 103 years old.  If she had been living in a nursing home in recent years, it would have cost thousands of euro, and keeping people in their homes is part of our Government policy.  I ask that discretion is given to local authorities.  It is the same with housing adaptation grants in respect of children with disabilities, including autism.  Again, there is no discretion there and this has become one of the biggest issues I have faced in recent months.</p>  <p>  The other issue I raise relates to modular builds, which the Taoiseach and the Minister have spoken about.  Will the Taoiseach update us on it?  Many of these builds can be completed within 11 days and it is important we get them done as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

Bed and breakfast operators that previously catered for people are providing less and less accommodation, seemingly for two reasons.  The first is that as we move towards the summer season, these operators are deciding to prioritise tourism and, second, an increasing number of bed and breakfast providers are being booked by the international protection accommodation services, IPAS, to accommodate refugees from Ukraine.  The State must stop pitting refugees against other homeless people.  Solutions need to be provided that will benefit the victims both of the housing crisis and of Putin's war.  Will the Taoiseach please look into the local issue I have raised and take steps to ensure this problem is resolved?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-04a.326" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="16:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050400023#X00500"><p>I disagree with the assessment made by Deputy &Oacute; Broin regarding housing policy, and I have not seen from him or his party a substantive policy response to Housing for All.  It just does not exist.  Housing for All is a very comprehensive and substantive document, with a suite of measures that will take time.  There is no doubt Covid-19 has been a key factor over the past two years, which the Deputy ignored for obvious reasons.  Construction was closed twice, in 2020 and 2021, for three or four months each year, which slowed construction, but it has rebounded quite well.  The issue is we need to build about 35,000 houses, between the private and public sectors, every year over the next ten years.  The more we can accelerate, the better.  It will mean all house types - social, affordable and all other types - will have to be facilitated to meet the needs that exist.  I am very clear about that.</p>  <p>  To me, the biggest challenge now is the war on Ukraine and the inflation that has emerged coming out of Covid, in terms of the imbalance of supply and demand, which has been exacerbated by the energy crisis caused by the Ukrainian war but also by the impact of inflation more generally and on commodities.  As we all know, builders are now talking about much higher increases in the cost of materials for building.  The cost of building any building, including homes, is increasing because of the cost of materials, and even tenders for State works are being received in much smaller volumes because of the concerns arising from the inflation that has occurred because of the war.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding that, a range of schemes have been introduced to increase and help affordability and to promote the building of cost-rental and affordable homes.  Capacity and resources have been given to local authorities to build up their in-house resources to enable them to do much more, on both the affordable and the social housing fronts.  There is no other way but to build more houses and have greater supply across the board.  Given that the population continues to increase and has done so significantly in the past decade, that imperative of increasing supply still stands.  We do not have the luxury as a country of trying to oppose various other schemes, types of buildings, mixes of developments on certain sites and so on.  We just do not have that luxury because we urgently need a significant ramp-up and increase in the supply of houses across the board.</p>  <p>  To respond to Deputy Boyd Barrett, multiple factors underpin the homelessness issue and it is not simple, nor as simple as the Deputy presented.  I take on board what he said, but about six rental Acts have been brought in.  One of the features of the rental situation has been the exodus of small landlords, with one or two houses, from the market.  It is a market the Deputy and others say is very lucrative, yet many landlords have left it in the past two to three years.  That is a challenge.</p>  <p>  Deputy Barry referenced that some people are using their properties, whether bed and breakfast accommodation or whatever, for other purposes, all of which takes from the housing market.  My point about the smaller landlords issue is that we must balance all measures to ensure we continue to get supply into the market, both for rent and for house-building.  That is the key.  Furthermore, we have to have private sector investment as well as public sector investment.  Public sector investment is being provided for, with &euro;4 billion a year being provided by the State through various means for house construction.  In addition to that, we will need up to &euro;5 billion or &euro;6 billion from the private sector to get the level of house construction we require.  That is why I referenced build-to-rent, for example, and other issues.  The primary focus of the Government is social housing and affordable housing, and to get as much private sector development as possible on top of that in order that we will get a broad mix.</p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; raised the HAP issue.  As I said in response to him earlier, we will talk to the authorities about that and the background to it.</p>  <p>  On the housing adaptation grant, there is always some degree of discretion with local authorities and I will discuss that further with Deputy Murnane O'Connor.  The modular builds will take much longer than 11 days, depending on quality and so on, but that has been initiated.</p>  <p>  I think I have largely dealt with Deputy Barry's points.  I do not accept his point about pitting refugees against those on the housing lists.  We are not doing that at all.  The vast bulk of Ukrainian displaced persons have been in hotels and various other forms of accommodation sourced by the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the Red Cross through the pledging situation.</p></speech>

I thank the House for facilitating the taking of this motion. </blockquote> <p>Yesterday, the Government approved the Minister, Deputy McEntee's request to seek the approval of the two Houses of the Oireachtas to opt in to this EU proposal.  The proposal relates to the collection, preservation and analysis of evidence relating to genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes by Eurojust, the EU agency responsible for criminal justice co-operation.  The regulation seeks to expand the remit of Eurojust to allow it to become a central repository for evidence and to allow national and international judicial authorities to benefit from the fully fledged support that Eurojust can provide in the ongoing investigation of core international crimes in the context of the aggression against Ukraine.</p> <p> Ireland has joined with others in condemning Russia's act of aggression against Ukraine.  We are gravely concerned by credible reports of attacks by Russian forces that may constitute war crimes, including the targeting of civilians and civilian objects and indiscriminate attacks against Ukrainian urban centres, medical facilities and civilians fleeing the conflict.  It is essential that those responsible for war crimes are identified and prosecuted.  The International Criminal Court, ICC, therefore plays a crucial role.  Ireland and 40 other states parties have referred the situation in Ukraine to the prosecutor of the ICC, enabling him to immediately begin an investigation into alleged crimes currently unfolding in Ukraine and to commence the collection of evidence.  On 2 March 2022, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced he had proceeded to open an investigation into the situation in Ukraine.  The prosecution services in several member states, as well as in Ukraine, have also started investigations of core international crimes.  These investigations are supported and co-ordinated by Eurojust.  We welcome and support the investigation opened on 2 March 2022 by the ICC prosecutor, which represents an important judicial step in the response to Russia's aggression against Ukraine.</p> <p> National authorities are collecting evidence of the international crimes that may have been committed in Ukraine.  Due the ongoing hostilities, evidence cannot be stored securely in Ukraine, requiring that a back-up storage space be urgently secured by the EU.  Thus, in order to co-ordinate efforts currently deployed by member states to collect evidence, the Union has deemed it necessary to quickly set up central storage where evidence collected by Union agencies and bodies as well as by national, international and civil society organisations can be stored.  This is the basis of this proposals, which aims to expand the remit of Eurojust to allow it to become a central repository for such evidence.  Every effort should be made to support the prosecution of such crimes and this proposal will enhance the role of Eurojust in doing so.</p> <p> An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, through the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, has responsibility here for the investigation of core international crime and co-operates with EU authorities on such matters.  The Ukrainian prosecutor general and the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court have already welcomed the support of EU member states and the potential initiation of criminal investigations at a national level.  This ensures the professional gathering of evidence, much of which may be displaced among refugees, which may be relevant to subsequent prosecutions.  A strategy to identify and collect relevant information and evidence from Ukrainians who have fled to Ireland is currently under consideration by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p> <p> The main objective of the proposal before the House is to allow Eurojust to collect, preserve and analyse evidence in respect of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and related criminal offences and, when necessary and appropriate, to enable Eurojust to exchange it or otherwise make it available to the competent national or international judicial authorities.  Allowing for the collection of evidence does not amount to providing Eurojust with an executive role as an investigating authority, which would not be covered by its mandate.  Rather, it is meant to ensure that Eurojust can receive and centrally store evidence from different sources.  By doing so, Eurojust can support case-building work in national and international investigations in a more effective way and provide additional support to the competent prosecution services.  </p> <p> The amendment is concerned with the likelihood that war crimes are being committed in Ukraine.  The current data processing architecture does not allow Eurojust to collect, preserve and analyse evidence relating to core international crimes including those that are likely being committed in Ukraine due to the scale of the events and the vast amount of evidence that needs to be stored in the case that such crimes are committed.  The amendments proposed provide the power to Eurojust to collect, preserve and analyse evidence relating to the international crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes and, in this regard, to operate with the goal of supporting the actions of member states to combat those crimes.  This is the amendment of substance and that of greatest importance in that it widens the mandate and responsibilities of Eurojust.  Nonetheless, the recitals to the measure clarify that it is intended principally to facilitate closer co-operation with the ICC.  Thereafter, the purpose of the remaining amendments is to facilitate the establishment of an automated data management and storage facility outside the existing Eurojust case management system and to make provision for related data processing and data protection principles.</p> <p> In respect of the ICC, Ireland has responded positively to the request of the ICC prosecutor to provide assistance to his office.  During his trip to Ukraine on 14 April, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, announced that Ireland would provide &euro;3 million in additional funding to the International Criminal Court.  Some &euro;1 million will be disbursed immediately to the office of the prosecutor.  Officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs are currently engaging with the office of the prosecutor to complete the transfer of these funds.  The secondment of national experts in a number of areas is also under consideration.</p> <p> I am proud that Ireland is playing a strong part in the European Union-wide response to the major humanitarian crisis in Ukraine.  The pace with which Ireland has mobilised to respond to this unprecedented situation is amazing.  It really shows the generosity of spirit of our country.  Ireland stands in solidarity with our European Union colleagues in working to support Ukrainian people fleeing the appalling situation visited on Ukraine by Russia.  </p> <p> With regard to the Minister, Deputy McEntee's own response and the response of my Department, the Minister lifted visa requirements for Ukrainian nationals travelling to Ireland on 25 February.  This has helped to streamline and support the swift exit of both Ukrainian family members of Irish citizens and the family members of people from Ukraine who are resident in Ireland.  It applies as an emergency measure to all Ukrainians travelling to Ireland.  We also set up a one-stop shop at Dublin Airport, where the vast majority of people coming from Ukraine are arriving.  It is staffed by officials from my Department, the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Since we activated the temporary protection directive, more than 27,155 people fleeing Ukraine have arrived in Ireland seeking safety.  Almost 26,500 temporary protection permissions have been issued so far.  As part of a whole-of-government response, we will continue to work across Government and with our European Union counterparts on any further measures that might be needed to assist those fleeing Ukraine.</p> <p> With regard to the legal situation, this proposal uses the legal basis of Article 85 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  The views of the Office of the Attorney General were sought and the legal advice received confirms that, as this is a measure under Title V of the treaty, Protocol 21 applies and Oireachtas approval under Article 29.4.7&deg; of the Constitution is required for Ireland to opt in to the measure.  The Office of the Attorney General has advised that opting into the proposed decision does not create any constitutional or legal issues for the State.  This is a more expedited process than usual but, with regard to the speed of adoption under Protocol 21, I am sure that colleagues will agree that it is important that Ireland stand alongside all other member states in supporting Eurojust and member states in this extremely important work.  </p> <p> This proposal will not have a direct cost for Ireland but will have an impact on the Eurojust budget and staffing needs.  Within the legislative financial statement accompanying the proposal, it is estimated that a further &euro;15.705 million will be needed for the period from 2022 to 2027 to allow Eurojust to perform the task provided for by this proposal.  This includes the cost of setting up and managing the automated data management and storage facility and for the necessary human resources to handle it.  </p> <p> Ireland has been a participating member of Eurojust since its inception in 2002 and recognises that it is an integral part of Europe's security architecture and is key to co-operation across our law enforcement agencies in our fight against cross-border crime.  It is intended that Eurojust will play a key role in supporting investigations carried out by member states and international bodies into core international crimes committed in Ukraine.  </p> <p> In view of the gravity of the situation, the Union wishes to take all necessary measures as a matter of urgency to ensure that those who committed these crimes in Ukraine are held responsible.  Therefore, the Union proposes an expedited process for the final adoption of this proposal in order not to delay the Union's adoption of this important measures.  We recommend that Ireland opt in to this proposal under Article 3 of Protocol 21 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.  The Government has no hesitation in commending the motion to opt in to this measure in this House.</p></speech>

It is important we show our support to the International Criminal Court, ICC, in conducting investigations into war crimes anywhere, and certainly in Ukraine.  We are aware there are investigators on the ground in Ukraine who are operating under very difficult conditions.  Ireland, with all the people from Ukraine who have come here, has been very supportive of the Ukrainian community.  There has to be a real sense that Russia will be held to account for what is going on and for the terrible trauma so many people in Ukraine are suffering.  It is important we use every opportunity we have to express our outrage at what has happened and what Putin has visited on Ukraine and the world.</p>  <p>  As many have said, it has been a long time since we have had a war on this scale in Europe.  I think the Balkans in the 1990s was the last time we had something similar.  It is deplorable that in 2022 we are in this situation, with tanks and missiles and armies invading a country.  It is just an outrage that cannot be allowed to pass.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, visited Ukraine.  What has happened in many of the areas in Ukraine, which the world has witnessed through the technology of television, and the outcome of Putin&rsquo;s invasion have been a very clear breach of human rights laws and a tragedy for all of the people.  We see bodies on the streets with their hands tied behind their back and shot in the back of the head.  These are innocent civilians.  We have seen that across many areas in Ukraine.  Clearly, those who are responsible for that have to be held to account.</p>  <p>  On what is happening in Mariupol, it is just outrageous that the Russian army would continue to bombard a city knowing that practically the only people who are left there are civilians.  It continues to do that day in, day out, to practically wipe it off the face of the map.  It is an outrage.  We have to have a means of holding it to account because one day this war will be over.  One day that will come to pass and it will have to be sorted out and the sooner that day comes, the better.</p>  <p>  On the role of Eurojust and of gathering all the evidence, we have to have a proper mechanism with which to put it all together.  Ireland has a role to play in that.  Many of the refugees who are coming here have footage on their mobile phones of atrocities they have witnessed.  I think the Minister of State mentioned that there was a role for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, possibly looking to carry out investigations with people who come here.  That needs to be looked at as well.  We certainly need to gather evidence and feed that in wherever we can.  All of us know and have spoken to people from Ukraine who have come here and who have witnessed the most horrific of situations in their home country and want to see justice being brought to bear.</p>  <p>  On the issue of how we deal with Putin and this war in the here and now, I welcome the European Union&rsquo;s move to bring in more sanctions in regard to oil and all of that.  However, a little bit of me is thinking, &ldquo;What other despot will we buy oil from instead?&rdquo;  If we are not buying it from Russia, will we be buying it from Saudi Arabia or somewhere else where their bib is not clean in regard to their actions and respect for human rights?  It is the same in many of these situations.  All of this is worthy of very deep consideration in terms of how we can progress in a way that will work.  If oil and gas prices go up and Europe is not taking gas from Russia, Russia will start selling it to other countries at a higher price than it is getting from Europe.  It is difficult to see how sanctions can work to stop this from happening.  Internationally, that is one of the problems we have to try to work out in terms of how we are going to resolve this issue.  The authorities in Moscow are not for turning.  That is the problem internationally.  However, having said that, one day it will come to pass that these issues will have to be dealt with.  When that happens, we need to have the evidence and everything has to be done to ensure we have that evidence.  That is why Ireland should have no hesitation in adopting this measure and ensuring that we have it in place as quickly as possible.  We should co-operate with all of the other countries in Europe and the world to hold to account those who have carried out these terrible atrocities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-04a.334" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1488" speakername="Pa Daly" time="17:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050400025#Z00200"><p>This proposal to amend regulation 2018/1727 in regard to collection, preservation and analysis of evidence relating to genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes will be supported by us.  The EU agency for criminal justice co-operation, Eurojust, co-ordinates the investigations and prosecutions of serious cross-border crime in Europe and beyond.  Among other things, it investigates genocide and war crimes.  We know that the prosecutor of the international Criminal Court has announced an investigation into possible war crimes committed by Putin's regime.  The national authorities are collecting evidence of these crimes that have been committed in Ukraine.  However, evidence cannot be stored securely in Ukraine.  Therefore, a backup service or storage space must be secured.  This must be set up, and this proposal envisages the establishment of the automated data management and storage facility.  It is important that complies with the highest standards of data protection and cybersecurity.</p><p>It goes without saying that the details of the Russian invasion of Ukraine have been shocking and deeply worrying.  Putin's regime&rsquo;s contempt for international law is clear in the existence of the invasion itself, but in addition to illegal occupation and annexation efforts it has conducted in the past, there is mounting evidence it is committing war crimes as well.  A few sources have corroborated these suspicions.  Human Rights Watch interviewed a number of civilians from occupied areas.  It found evidence of summary executions and it is worth quoting it directly.  It stated:</p> <blockquote> 	These include a case of repeated rape; two cases of summary execution, one of six men, the other of one man; and other cases of unlawful violence and threats against civilians between February 27 and March 14 [of this year].  Soldiers were also implicated in looting ... including food, clothing, and firewood.  [They] are responsible for war crimes. </blockquote>  <p>The UN also expressed concern.  Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres visited a number of sites in Ukraine, calling it an &quot;obscenity&quot;.  The offices of the UN must be utilised as much as possible for ending the conflict and the Secretary-General&rsquo;s call for the Russian Federation to co-operate should be heeded.</p><p>I note what the Minister of State said on being proud of Ireland's response to the EU-wide response to the humanitarian crisis.  I, too, am proud of the Irish response and the pace at which Ireland has mobilised in response.  However, we must put a similar effort in to support the institutions in order to seek, negotiate and secure a peaceful solution.  Over the past number of weeks I note that has not been to the fore as much as it should be.</p><p>The International Criminal Court is the correct body, of course, to pursue the investigations and its investigators on the ground are facing numerous challenges.  Accordingly, this motion should be supported because the difficult and dangerous task of documenting should be supported by the international community.  Where European co-operation upholds international law and natural justice, of course, it should be supported.  Now is not the time to go into such matters in great detail, but the scandal within Frontex, the EU border agency, where illegal pushbacks of refugees were found to have occurred, stands in contrast to the intention of this motion.</p><p>International law should be upheld in all its aspects and it is only as good as those charged with enforcing it, which are frequently the rich and the powerful states.  Ireland is undoubtedly part of the wider western nations and we should reflect long and hard before sacrificing our military neutrality.  A militarised Ireland will not retain credibility when seeking to enforce international law, and as imperfect as the international institutions are, they represent a path towards peace and the upholding of human rights.  As I said, neutrality is not about isolationism but, rather, it is about active engagement in the global community and pursuit of global justice through peaceful means.</p><p>I welcome the recent poll where 75% of people support maintaining our neutrality.  I met a man recently in west Cork who said that he would be first protesting if there was any change to that.  Our neutrality needs to be defended, and all Deputies should state clearly where they stand on that issue - that they will fight to preserve and strengthen neutrality.  We do not want to pay the extra billions per year that it would cost if we abandon that and join military alliances.  Our status as a neutral state with no colonial baggage and independent foreign policy has stood us well and allowed us to play a valuable and honourable role in peacekeeping around the world.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-04a.335" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1620" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050400026#AA00200"><p><i>5 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>It seems that almost on a weekly basis the Minister of State brings a resolution before us to amend the justice co-operation arrangements we have in the European Union, all with very good reason.  Eurojust, which is 20 years old, is one of the most important institutions to facilitate co-operation on criminal matters for law enforcement across the Union and beyond.  As we repeatedly say in debates of this kind, criminality knows no borders.</p>  <p>  As has been indicated by several speakers, Eurojust is important in the investigation and prosecution of serious cross-border crime.  In the current context, the most important issues are those crimes that involve genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.  All of us have been horrified to our core at what is unfolding in Ukraine.  Putin's aggression in the illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine seems to be almost bestial in its horror and the suffering and pain that his regime is willing to unleash upon the civilian population of Ukraine.  What has been uncovered so far in Bucha and other satellite towns and villages of Kyiv is quite horrific.  What is even more shocking is what is happening this very minute in Mariupol, where it is thought that 20,000 or more people are already dead and the notion that portable crematoria are being brought in to dispose of the bodies.  This is beyond shocking.  It is something that we thought we had left behind us in the middle of the last century, in the Nazi regimes and the horror that they unfolded.  We certainly need to amend the capacity to ensure the perpetrators of such appalling crimes are held to account.</p>  <p>  I support the adjustments in the regulations that are proposed in the proposition before the House.  As other speakers have said, they will allow the collection, preservation, and analysis of evidence and to secure it in a safe way.  At other times we can talk about data security and cybersecurity because such a depository would be subject to cyberattack as well, in addition to the exact nature of the data to be stored.  That is for us to flesh out perhaps on another occasion.</p>  <p>  In the two minutes remaining, I want to mention another issue, that is, our own response to dealing with this issue.  The Minister of State has instanced our welcoming of some 27,000 refugees.  That is a really good thing.  The Minister of State is aware that communities, particularly our own community, have opened their hearts and arms to refugees.  A Bill I introduced, the Proceeds of Crime (Gross Human Rights Abuses) Bill, has been before the House for some time.  It passed Second Stage and the Minister of State responded to it.  It is before the committee, but it still has not received a money message authorisation from the Government.  This is more than symbolic, but it is symbolic as well.  I hear international commentators now talking about the legislation that is before our Legislature as an important part of the Magnitsky suite of laws that are being enacted everywhere, in particular on foot of the horrors unfolding in Ukraine.  The Proceeds of Crime (Gross Human Rights Abuses) Bill 2020 is before the committee.  I hope we will deal with it in the immediate future.  Will the Minister of State go back to the Taoiseach and the senior Minister in his Department and ask that the money message would be sent to the committee in order that this very important legislation can be enacted?  People might say it is not practical and ask how we link the human rights abuses to the perpetrator but that is true of all the investigations we are talking about in this context.  It is a signal that those who aid, abet or assist in any way gross human rights abuses will be held to account, either through the International Criminal Court or if any of them want to stash their loot here, we will hold them to account and we will take it from them in the proceeds of crime legislation that we have in our jurisdiction.  My final comment is to ask the Minister of State to take that back and perhaps to come back to me with clarity on the issue.</p></speech>

It is exactly the kind of area on which we should be working together.  I condemn in the strongest possible terms the war crimes being carried out by the Putin regime against the civilian population in Ukraine.  Soldiers have been implicated in looting civilian property including food, clothing, fuel and firewood.  There have been threats against civilians, unlawful violence, torture, sexual violence, repeated rape, summary executions, the use of cluster ammunition, indiscriminate attacks in densely populated areas and the shooting of refugees as they flee.  These are all repulsive and abhorrent acts.  There have been horrific reports of corpses found stuffed into wells with bags over their heads.</p><p>In war, it is always the civilian population that bears the brunt of military aggression.  We must stand in strong solidarity with the people of Ukraine and redouble our efforts to provide practical support.  I acknowledge the practical supports that have been put in place to date.  The response of people in Ireland has been very generous, with many opening up their homes to people fleeing war and communities rallying around to provide practical support and assistance.  People escaping from Mariupol have told of the hell on earth in which they have been living.  We have also had reports of people fleeing being directed by members of the Russian armed forces to go to Russian-controlled areas against their will.</p><p>A significant amount of work has been done on the documentation of war crimes to date by organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.  They are playing a crucial role on the ground gathering and documenting evidence of war crimes and they have already published evidence of war crimes.  Under international humanitarian law, civilians should never be the deliberate target of attacks, yet that is what is happening.  Following the atrocities at Bucha, shocking satellite images showed the bodies of murdered civilians that lay for weeks on the ground.  Human Rights Watch has documented numerous incidents, including where Russian forces pulled civilians out of vehicles and summarily executed them and shot at vehicles containing civilians attempting to negotiate the delivery of humanitarian aid.  In addition, it has documented harrowing reports of rape and repeated rape.  I will read out an account that was documented by Human Rights Watch:</p> <blockquote> 	On March 6, Russian soldiers in the village of Vorzel, about 50 kilometers northwest of Kyiv, threw a smoke grenade into a basement, then shot a woman and a 14-year-old child as they emerged from the basement, where they had been sheltering. </blockquote>  <p>The people of Russia have a long history not just of suffering under dictatorship but also suffering the consequences of war.  More than most, the people of Russia should understand the horrors of war and of war crimes and have a key role to play in opposing this war.  All of these abhorrent war crimes reinforce the importance of international institutions such as the International Criminal Court and international law.  They also underline the importance of multilateralism, co-operation, peace and diplomacy.  In that regard, we cannot be silent about countries that are not members of the International Criminal Court and have not signed up to it.  In addition to Russia, such countries include the United States, Israel and China.  In condemning the war crimes committed by Russia against the civilian population of Ukraine, we must be consistent and condemn all war crimes.  We cannot be silent about war crimes and atrocities committed by other countries.  We cannot be silent, for example, about the horrific war crimes that were committed in Iraq by US soldiers.  These include the horrific rape and murder of a 14-year-old child.  I reiterate in the strongest possible terms our condemnation of the war crimes carried out by the Putin regime against the civilian population in Ukraine.  The strength of this condemnation must be met by every practical action and assistance we can give.</p></speech>

Any efforts to hold them to account, to bring out the truth of those war crimes, to prosecute them and to deliver justice to the people who are victims of those crimes should be pursued.  We absolutely must do that.  However, I have little faith in the International Criminal Court.  I say this because previously, in most cases in which it has been charged to look at these things in other similar instances, it has failed pretty dramatically.  I do not see why we would trust it to do this.</p>  <p>  It is also interesting to look at who has signed up to the ICC and who has not.  The United States has not subscribed to the International Criminal Court because it does not want to be held accountable for its war crimes.  At one point, I believe it signed it but then it withdrew its signature and it never ratified it.  Israel did the same in order that it cannot be investigated.  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates refused to sign it.  Russia and Ukraine signed it but never ratified it.  That is interesting.  Many countries, including two of the countries that are directly involved in this, never wanted to ratify the International Criminal Court.  There is a problem, is there not, if we are serious about this? </p>  <p>  The whole point about war crimes and crimes against humanity is that they include any war crime.  They are not just war crimes that occur in a particular place at a particular time and that we decide we are going to investigate.  The whole idea is that a war crime is a war crime, no matter where it is committed.  As for a crime against humanity, the clue is in the name; it is a crime against any member of humanity that falls within the definition of a crime against humanity.  It seems we now have great enthusiasm, all of a sudden, to pursue the war crimes and crimes against humanity that are undoubtedly being committed by Vladimir Putin in his bloody and inexcusable war.  Yet, many of the people who denounce the crimes against humanity and the war crimes do not themselves want to be subject to this court.  They have avoided doing it because they might themselves be found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity.  Is anybody going to call out this hypocrisy?</p>  <p>  If it is to be selective in this regard, I do not see what credibility the International Criminal Court has.  If Putin&rsquo;s war against Ukraine is a war crime and a crime against humanity, then the US-UK War in Iraq definitely is a crime against humanity.  It was a war based on a pack of lies, with a million people being directly and indirectly killed.  There was the horror of Fallujah, to name just one terrible example.  There was the torture in Abu Ghraib.  What did the ICC do?  It had a preliminary investigation into possible war crimes that may have been committed.  They could not investigate the US because, as I said, the US has not signed up to it.  The preliminary investigation into the UK was closed down in 2006 with no prosecution.  Some new evidence was provided later.  They had a look at that and then they closed it down in 2020. </p>  <p>  Israel has just been indicted by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and a UN special rapporteur on the Middle East for committing war crimes, which come under the ambit of the International Criminal Court, as matters it should pursue.  Where are the announcements that this will happen?  There are none.  There is no announcement about the fact that they are being accused by the UN special rapporteur and two of the most respected human rights organisations in the world of ongoing, 70-years-long crimes against humanity.  As for the siege of Gaza, there has been no investigation.  There has been no clamour for the prosecution of the war crimes.  Therefore, I do not place much credibility in this.</p>  <p>  If we are serious about stopping war crimes and crimes against humanity, we have to be calling them all out.  We have to be demanding investigations into all of them and not just the ones where it happens to suit the geopolitical or geostrategic interests of the European Union, this or that power, the United States or whoever else.  We have to call out those countries that do not wish to be held accountable for crimes against humanity, which include many of Europe&rsquo;s allies.  </p></speech>

Having read the motion, I do not have any major difficulty with it and will be happy to support its passage through the D&aacute;il later on this evening.  I will do so for a number of reasons.  First, Eurojust has established itself as quite a credible and competent agency over the past 20 years, since its inception in 2002, in relation to the exchange of criminal justice information between law enforcement agencies.  All we are being asked to do here is to expand the mandate of Eurojust which, in light of changing circumstances, seems to make perfect sense to me.  We also all know what is happening in Ukraine at the moment.  It is being beamed into our living rooms every evening.  If even half of what we see is true, it is obvious that major numbers of war crimes, crimes against humanity and atrocities are taking place.  There are many investigators on the ground at the moment, both national and international, as well as from civil society.  It is important they have a central hub or co-ordinating point to store all their information safely.  Because Ukraine is an active war zone, it is not safe to store information there at present.  Therefore, it makes perfect sense to use Eurojust and its facility in The Hague, which is where I presume they will store this information.  This is particularly true in light of the fact that many of the personal testimonies are now scattered all over the European Union, because they have been brought by refugees into various European Union countries.  </p>  <p>  The second point I wish to make is on deterrence.  This is a point that should not be forgotten.  It is important that the belligerents on all sides recognise there is a system in place for the safe collation and preservation of data and evidence.  Into the future, they also should recognise that the chances of being prosecuted for war crimes as a result of their actions are increasing by the day.  That is a important point to make from a deterrence point of view.  </p>  <p>  My last point is on justice for the victims.  It is important that the European Union and Ireland in particular are as supportive as possible of the International Criminal Court in The Hague.  The Minister of State mentioned in his opening statement that consideration is being given to seconding Irish experts to The Hague to support the International Criminal Court.  I would be grateful were the Minister of State to elaborate on that during his closing remarks.  How many people are we talking about and what kind of expertise would they have?   When is a decision likely to be made?</p>  <p>  To conclude, I am happy with the motion before the House and will be happy to support it later on this evening.  I look forward to its swift implementation.  </p></speech>

However, the evidence and data that must be collected, collated and kept, in order to deal with these atrocities are important.  That is why Eurojust is doing such important work.  It also co-operates with the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.</p>  <p>  National authorities are collecting evidence of the international crimes that may have been committed in Ukraine.  Due to the ongoing hostilities, evidence cannot be stored securely in Ukraine, requiring that a backup storage place be urgently secured by the European Union.  Thus, in order to co-ordinate efforts that are currently being deployed by member states to collect evidence, it is necessary to set up quickly a central storage, where evidence that is collected by European Union agencies and bodies, as well as by national and international authorities or third parties such as civil society organisations, can be stored.</p> <p>However, while the Eurojust regulations provide for its support for member states' actions in investigating and prosecuting serious crimes, they do not explicitly allow Eurojust to collect, preserve and analyse such evidence relating to this purpose.  I do not want to eat into my colleagues' time so I will stop at that.</p></speech>

These are crimes Eurojust is competent to deal with.  There are reasonable grounds to believe war crimes and crimes against humanity have been and are being committed in Ukraine.  We all see, day and night, across our computer screens, our televisions, our newspapers and our phones the reality of these war crimes.</p>  <p>  However, as a country, we need to be more careful about how we treat refugees.  Initially, we had no plan for bringing thousands of people into our country.  We are now putting them into already overcrowded areas.  I said at the start of this crisis that community buildings should have been used to help.  I still believe that.  Why not bring some of the Ukrainian refugees to rural parts where we need more people?  Unfortunately, many of these places are already underpopulated and we would very much welcome refugees to them.  We also need more services in these areas, for example, transport.</p>  <p>  The proposal outlined in this motion will allow Eurojust to collect, analyse and preserve evidence relating to core international crimes and to process data, such as videos, audio recordings and satellite images, and share such evidence with the relevant national and international authorities, including the International Criminal Court.  The sharing of such evidence would only take place when appropriate and with full respect to EU data protection rules.  There must be a judgment day for the war crimes being committed.  Evidence is surely one way to have the people responsible held to justice whenever that day will come. </p></speech>

It is sure we must do everything we can.  It is very clear that what is going on are war crimes affecting civilians.  The way they are being treated, bombarded, hurt, maimed and killed, it is clear war crimes are being committed at present.  We must monitor and ensure that if it can happen, it should happen that this fella, Putin, will be prosecuted and get the proper penalty he deserves.</p>  <p>  In the past week, one of his lieutenants has suggested doing something to Ireland.  In that vein, there have even been calls in the Chamber this morning for the Russian ambassador to be sent home.  I say no such thing.  We should keep him here.  If Russia and Putin do anything to our country or to our people, if they suggest or do anything untoward to our people in our country, the ambassador should be the first fella to be targeted, locked up somewhere, the key thrown away, and an odd bite to eat thrown to him now and then to keep him barely alive.  We never did anything out of the way to Russia and it is wrong of it to target us here in the middle of the ocean.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the Russian ambassador does not go home, or his entourage and the people with him in the ambassador's residence, wherever it is.  Not one of them should be allowed to go home.  If they do any act or hurt Ireland in any way, he should be the first man to be targeted and minded to ensure we get some good out of him and do not let him go.  Certainly, do not send him home.</p></speech>

The fact that this proposal will be rushed through no matter what concerns are raised by Deputies today is an unfortunate trend that has been occurring at EU level in the past few years and is something we need to seriously consider in future.  The EU is supposed to amplify countries&rsquo; voices, not take them away altogether.  It is incredibly disappointing to come to the Chamber to discuss EU proposal after EU proposal, when it is clear that not only Opposition Deputies but Government Deputies have no real input to anything at EU level anyway.  The fact that discussions are going ahead today regarding the implementation of this proposal, before our national Parliament has even had the opportunity to consider it, is just proof of this.  That being said, it is important we voice our concerns regardless and I will continue to do so.  I hope we take into consideration that we are being blatantly ignored, however.</p>  <p>  I have been very disturbed to read about alleged war crimes that have occurred in Ukraine over the past couple of months.  Ukraine&rsquo;s prosecutor general&rsquo;s office has opened more than 9,300 investigations into alleged war crimes and has identified hundreds of suspects from Russia, with the true number expected to be much higher considering they have yet to access the east, where some of the most violent fighting has occurred.  The prosecutor general, along with the EU special representative on sexual violence in war, said this week that dozens of cases of sexual violence by invading forces are already under investigation.  In order to properly pursue these investigations, there is no doubt there is a real need for central storage for evidence relating to genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, which is what this proposal intends to address.</p>  <p>  It is clear that the process of holding Vladimir Putin responsible for these alleged war crimes will be very long and complex.  Ukrainian and international experts have stated that it will take years, if not decades, to collect evidence, build cases and prosecute people.  It is essential then that all evidence found is stored in centrally located, protected storage.  Given the incredibly violent situation in Ukraine, it is clear this evidence cannot currently be stored securely there and will have to be kept at a location outside the country.  It makes sense for the EU to offer a role in this.  There is no doubt a co-ordinated effort will be required by all states collecting evidence and it would not make sense for any one national authority to take on this role.  It also makes sense that this role will be given to Eurojust, which has the expertise and experience to support the investigations and prosecutions of such crimes.  Eurojust&rsquo;s current role is in supporting member states&rsquo; actions in investigating and prosecuting crime but it does not allow for the collection, preservation and analysis of such evidence, which this proposal intends to address by expanding the remit of Eurojust to allow it to become a central repository for such evidence.</p>  <p>  Although I am glad the proposal clearly states the collection of evidence does not amount to providing Eurojust with an executive role as investigating authority, I am wary that it states, "when necessary and appropriate" Eurojust will enable the exchange of evidence "or otherwise make it available to the competent judicial authorities, national or international".  Who decides when it is "necessary and appropriate" and who decides on the "competent judicial authorities"?  I have often talked of the importance of Ireland&rsquo;s neutral voice.  I believe our neutrality could be of huge importance in making sure that extremely important decisions, such as these, are made fairly.  This is where we can most effectively lend our highly respected neutral oversight and input.  Although the evidence storage role of Eurojust is suitable in Ukraine&rsquo;s situation, I have concerns about expanding its remit in general.  I would not like it to be the case that Eurojust is allowed to take and store evidence of any state should it be the request of a member state to do so.</p>  <p>  Overall, I support this motion in the context of the Ukrainian situation.  However, I am always concerned about proposals with an expedited negotiation process, especially at EU level.  Member states must ensure that all proposals are scrutinized adequately and concerns must be listened to and addressed. </p></speech>

Ireland has joined with others in condemning Russia's active aggression against Ukraine.  We have grave concerns regarding reports of attacks by Russian forces that may constitute war crimes, including the targeting of civilians and civilian objects, as well as indiscriminate attacks against Ukrainian infrastructure.  It is essential that those responsible for war crimes are identified and prosecuted.</p>  <p>  The current proposal will allow Eurojust to play a key role in supporting member states' and international bodies' investigations of core international crimes committed in Ukraine.  As has been outlined, the main objective of the proposal is to allow Eurojust to collect, preserve and analyse evidence relating to genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and related criminal offences and, when necessary and appropriate, enable its exchange or otherwise make it available to the competent judicial authorities, national or international.</p>  <p>  In view of the gravity of the situation, it is vitally important that all necessary measures are taken as a matter urgency to ensure that those who committed those crimes in Ukraine are held responsible.  The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court and the prosecution services in member states and in Ukraine, who have started investigations of core international crimes, need to be supported in the best possible manner.</p> <p>This proposal will allow for national and international judicial authorities to benefit from the fully fledged support that Eurojust can provide in the ongoing investigations of core international crimes in the context of aggression against Ukraine.</p> <p> National authorities are already collecting evidence of international crimes that may have been committed in Ukraine.  Due to the ongoing hostilities, evidence cannot be stored securely in Ukraine.  This requires that a backup storage place be urgently secured by the European Union.  Thus, in order to co-ordinate efforts currently deployed by member states to collect evidence, the Union has deemed it necessary to quickly set up central storage where evidence collected by Union agencies and bodies as well as national and international civil society organisations could be stored.  That is the basis behind this proposal which aims to expand the remit of Eurojust to allow it to become a central repository for such evidence.  It is imperative that every effort be made to support the prosecution of such crimes.  This proposal will enhance the role of Eurojust in doing that.</p> <p> Ireland stands in solidarity with its European Union colleagues in working to support Ukrainian people fleeing the appalling situation visited on Ukraine by Russia and in ensuring accountability for crimes committed.  Ireland has been a participating member of Eurojust since its inception in 2002 and recognises that Eurojust as an integral part of Europe's security architecture and is key in the context of co-operation across our law enforcement agencies in the fight against cross-border crime.</p> <p> Ireland supports the key role intended for Eurojust in this proposal in supporting member states and international bodies investigations of core international crimes committed in Ukraine.  The Government has no hesitation in commanding the motion that we opt into this proposal to the House.  Doing so under an Article 3 opt-in will ensure that we send a strong statement of solidarity to our European partners that we will take the necessary steps to support ongoing investigations of core international crimes and ensure accountability in the context of aggression against Ukraine.</p> <p> I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>

Section 46 of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 is amended, in subsection (1) by&mdash; <blockquote> 	(a) the substitution in paragraph (a) of &ldquo;at any of the rates specified in paragraphs (b), (c), (ca), (caa), (cb) and (d)&rdquo; for &ldquo;at any of the rates specified in paragraphs (b), (c), (ca) and (d)&rdquo;,<br /><br />(b) the substitution in paragraph (c) of &ldquo;subject to paragraphs (ca), (caa) and (cb)&rdquo; for &ldquo;subject to paragraphs (ca) and (cb)&rdquo;, and<br /><br />(c) the insertion of the following paragraph after paragraph (ca) <blockquote> 	 <blockquote> 	&ldquo;(caa) during the period from 1 May 2022 to 31 October 2022, 9 per cent in relation to goods of a kind specified in paragraph 17(2) and (3) of Schedule 3 on which tax would, but for this paragraph, be chargeable in accordance with paragraph (c);&rdquo;.&rdquo;. </blockquote> </blockquote> </blockquote>  </blockquote>  <p>The purpose of this amendment is to establish in primary legislation the legal basis for the financial resolution passed on 27 April to provide for a temporary reduction of VAT on gas and electricity.  The previous VAT rate for gas and electricity was 13.5%.  This had been reduced to 9% from 1 May to 31 October 2022.  In terms of revenue impact, this six-month decrease in VAT is estimated to cost &euro;46 million.  As discussed on Committee Stage, the Government recognises the impact of the current energy crisis and understands how it has contributed to a rise in the cost of living.  While the energy crisis is driven primarily by global factors, the Government has taken the decision to reduce VAT on gas and electricity to alleviate some of that impact, along with introducing a range of other measures.</p><p>As previously outlined, Ireland has maintained a historic derogation in respect of the VAT rate on gas and electricity since 1991.  This has allowed us to apply a rate of 13.5% but also prevented us from lowering the VAT rate below 12%.  However, following lengthy negotiations, amendments to the VAT directive were agreed in December 2021, with final sign off on the amendment text at the ECOFIN meeting last month.  The new arrangement came into effect on 6 April last.  It allows Ireland to apply a reduced rate of 9% to those products in line with other goods and services to which a reduced rate applies.  The Government made a decision to avail of this flexibility from 1 May, the start of the next VAT accounting period for change.</p><p>All this ties in with the various cost of living measures that the Government has introduced in recent months.  On budget day there were income tax and social welfare packages because this debate arises because of inflation and increasing costs borne by households.  Some of the cost of living measures that the Government has introduced to mitigate some of the worst aspects of those costs were announced on budget day and came into effect earlier this year.  One or two were brought forward more recently.  The income tax and social welfare packages introduced on that day cost &euro;1.07 billion.  The energy credit of &euro;200 inclusive of VAT, the 20% reduction in public transport fees and the &euro;125 lump sum on the heat fuel supplement allowance cost &euro;505 million in total.  On 10 February, the drug payment scheme threshold was reduced to &euro;80.  Only a little earlier, it was well over &euro;120.  That is a substantial decrease in the threshold.  An increase in the income threshold on the working family payment that was due to come in later in the year was brought forward to April.  The the cap on school transport fees has been reduced.  Excise duty was reduced on 9 March.  That cost in the region of &euro;320 million.  On 11 March, a &euro;100 per-week haulier support scheme payment was introduced.  That cost &euro;18 million.  The VAT reductions on electrify and gas were also introduced around that time.  The &euro;100 lump sum fuel allowance payment was brought in, and on 13 April the excise duty reduction was extended and there was a reduction in the public service obligation, PSO, levy.  The cost of these measures came to &euro;118 million.</p><p>In total, these measures cost approximately &euro;2.1 billion.  That is quite a significant sum for the short period involved.  No one can reasonably suggest that the Government can completely mitigate all the inflationary pressures within the economy, most of which are caused by factors outside the State.</p><p>Some have raised the Government gaining windfall revenues from rising energy prices.  That is a fair question which people often ask.  Excise on a unit of fuel is the same regardless of the price of fuel.  The tax is based on volume.  Therefore there is no extra revenue raised from fuel if the price increases.  Excise duty is an important revenue stream for the Government and collected &euro;5.8 billion last year.  More than &euro;2 billion of that came from fuel taxes.  The taxes help to pay for everything from the wages of teachers, nurses and Garda&iacute; to infrastructure like roads, schools and housing and all social protection payments.</p><p>The measures announced on 9 March reduced excise on motor fuel by approximately one third, which was extremely significant.  The Government has now provided for an extension of this reduction until the next budget in October.</p><p>The amendment relates to VAT.  There has been an increase in VAT receipts.  In 2020, VAT receipts for domestic energy and auto fuel amounted to &euro;755 million.  In 2021, the amount involved was &euro;933 million.  That represents a 24% increase in the VAT collected on the previous year.</p> <p>However, we must acknowledge that is not a normal year-to-year comparison when people are looking at these issues, as in 2020 we were very much dealing with the Covid situation and transport and many other things were much reduced at that time.  It is very important to note the increase in VAT receipts is still less than the Government expenditure to help households with the cost of living.  These include the various packages I have mentioned so far, such as the February package, the March reduction to excise duties and May VAT reduction on gas and electricity.  That does not even take account of the measures announced in budget 2022.  The idea of a tax windfall is therefore misleading.  According to the most recent stability programme update Ireland is still on track to have a &euro;2 billion deficit, so we are in deficit this year.  The additional revenue arising from VAT on domestic energy products is still less than either of the measures announced to help with the cost of living or Ireland's projected deficit for the year.</p></speech>

We are looking for a comprehensive report into the operation of the wage subsidy scheme.  As we know, the wage subsidy scheme itself was an incredibly significant intervention made in the economy to support jobs and businesses during a very difficult time in our economy and in respect of the significant public health measures that had to be introduced and that disrupted our society and economy.  From communications with the Committee of Public Accounts and correspondence it received from, for example, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Protection I am aware the latter is undertaking a formal examination into the operation of the wage subsidy scheme.  That in itself is to be welcomed but is not what I am looking for with this amendment.</p><p>The Minister of State knows the Minister for Finance has particular responsibility for the management of the scheme under the legislation introduced with the support, to the best of my recollection, of everyone in this House just over two years ago.  It is important given the enormous level of transfers the wage subsidy schemes represent - billions of euro were transferred to private enterprise and workers by the State - that there is a proper analysis of the operation of the scheme.  The Minister of State and everyone in the House know that when we were developing this legislation, which garnered cross-party consensus and support given the nature of the problems we were facing this time two years ago, we insisted there should be forms of conditions attached to the level of expenditure this scheme would involve from the State.  There was to be an unprecedented transfer of wealth from the State to private enterprise and workers and it was reasonable to expect there would be some conditions attached.  Those might have been conditions around a requirement for decent work, a no lay-offs policy and, significantly, a prohibition of the payment of dividends and distribution to shareholders where companies were benefitting from the wage subsidy scheme.  Unfortunately, those appeals fell on deaf ears.</p><p>Figures revealed to me through replies from the Minister for Finance to parliamentary questions last week show only 19 companies that paid dividends out to shareholders returned the full amount of the wage subsidy to the Exchequer.  The figures from the reply, based on information from the Revenue Commissioners, suggest at last count about 641 companies that benefitted from the wage subsidy scheme paid out dividends or other forms of distribution to shareholders.  That is a paltry amount of money paid back by companies that clearly did not require the support and largesse of the taxpayer at what was a difficult time for the economy.  I am not suggesting for a minute those companies did anything illegal.  They did not do anything unlawful because this House decided not to impose any restrictions in that regard in respect of the legislation governing the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, and then the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  At the time the argument with the TWSS was this was money we needed to get into the hands of employers and workers very quickly.  That is why no consideration was given to the attachment of any strict conditions, outside the 30% threshold and so on, for companies to qualify for the scheme.  However, knowing the performance of the TWSS and having knowledge about how it worked, we had time and should have had the space to impose some kind of conditions to drive better outcomes for the taxpayer and our economy more generally when we were awarding such large sums of money to companies.  These were companies that needed it to a very large extent.  Most companies needed it.  Most companies did not pay out dividends to shareholders but we know from Revenue 641 did and only 19 companies returned the full subsidy amount they received thanks to the taxpayer to the Exchequer.</p><p>It is in that context I ask the Minister of State to support the amendment.  It is reasonable given the sums of money involved that there be clarity and full probity.  Not only should the Department of Social Protection, supported by the Department of Finance and Revenue, undertake a formal examination into the operation of this scheme but there should be a full account of how that money was spent and how successful the scheme was.  We know it was successful in achieving its aims and everybody understands and recognises that, but we need a full examination of the operation of the scheme and the care and management of it under the auspices of Revenue and the Department in the guise of the Minister for Finance.  We need that undertaken.  We need it to be done quickly.  The scheme itself is coming to an end and it is in the interests of the taxpayer and of transparency and full accountability that an initiative of this nature is undertaken and a report be provided to this House, laid before both Houses and in time debated in the Chamber.</p></speech>

In response to the Covid-19 pandemic the Government introduced a range of supports for businesses including the TWSS and the EWSS.  The wage subsidy schemes were emergency support measures introduced and developed in extraordinary times.  Both the TWSS and the EWSS are statutory schemes underpinned by legislative provisions in the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020, as enacted the Oireachtas.  The wage subsidy schemes have been at the centre of the Government's response to the pandemic with substantial supports amounting to &euro;10.6 billion being provided to date.  Of that, &euro;2.8 billion is attributable to the TWSS, &euro;7.8 billion to the EWSS, &euro;6.78 billion to subsidy payments and &euro;1.03 billion to PRSI foregone.</p>  <p>  The TWSS was introduced in March 2020 to support viable firms and maintain the relationship between employers and employees.  At the outset, it was expected the TWSS would be in place for a period of 12 weeks but it remained in place until 31 October 2020, a period of five months, due to the public health restrictions.  The TWSS was replaced by the EWSS with effect from 1 September 2020.  The EWSS operates as an economy-wide support with the objective of supporting businesses, encouraging employment and helping maintain the link between employers and employees.  The current longevity of the EWSS was never foreseen or anticipated at that time.</p>  <p>  I am confident the Minister for Finance satisfactorily fulfils his duties and obligations required of his role and the Department as specifically set out in sections 28A(4) to 28A(6), inclusive.  The duties and obligations are to monitor and superintend the scheme, to carry out an assessment of the scheme at least every two months and after such an assessment to determine, following consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for Social Protection, whether it is necessary to exercise the powers conferred on the Minister to adjust certain aspects of the scheme.</p> <p>More broadly, and perhaps this is the issue the Deputy is endeavouring to touch on with his amendment, I am satisfied that the wage subsidy schemes were an efficient use of taxpayers' resources.  The employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, acted as an appropriate and necessary stimulus to the economy mitigating the effects of the pandemic on the economy.</p> <p> I am also satisfied that the wage subsidy schemes achieved their objective to support employment and maintain the vital link between employers and employees.  Putting this in context, 67,000 employers availed of the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, in respect of almost 690,000 employees.  That is a phenomenal number of employees that were directly supported by this scheme.  To date, 52,000 employers availed of EWSS in respect of 733,000 employees.  I am also confident that in these unprecedented circumstances the EWSS was appropriately calibrated in terms of supports to business.</p> <p> The Government adopted a prudent and phased approach to the extensions of any of these schemes.  As I said, it was never envisaged at the outset of these schemes how long they would be required.  The success of the schemes is clearly evident by how quickly our economy has adapted and recovered following the lifting of public health restrictions.</p> <p> Furthermore, without the support of EWSS many businesses might not be in existence today.  I am satisfied that the EWSS operated as an effective and responsive measure to aid economic recovery during these unprecedented times.</p> <p> Since the introduction of the scheme, it has been under active consideration and review in terms of its responsiveness, cost and impact which, in turn, inform the policy responses and any amendments to the scheme.  As I said, we moved from one scheme to the other because of the various circumstances.</p> <p> In addition, section 28A(5) of the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 provides that an assessment shall be carried out at least every two months.  While the legislation does not stipulate that a report must be prepared, my Department prepares bimonthly EWSS utilisation papers which capture the key analysis of the scheme.  These papers have been completed since the introduction of the scheme and the papers which have been furnished to me are published on the Department's website.  The information the Deputy is talking about is available on the Department's website and has helped consideration of the scheme.</p> <p> In relation to the companies which avail of the wage subsidy scheme which may have paid dividends to their shareholders, I would point out that the eligibility criteria of the wage subsidy scheme, as provided for in the legislation, do not include any conditions in relation to a company making a distribution to its shareholders.  Thus, there is no impediment on an employer paying dividends to its shareholders and this is a business decision for an employer to take based on the financial circumstances.</p> <p> As I have stated on many occasions, the overwhelming majority of companies that have participated in the wage subsidy scheme did so because they genuinely believed they would need support at that point based on the effect of the pandemic on their business.  The experience of both Revenue and my Department is that employers participating in the scheme did so in good faith.</p> <p> As regards the Deputy's amendment for a report on whether and to what extent companies paid a dividend while they availed of the wage subsidy schemes, I am advised that the Revenue recently carried out a short exercise to identify dividend withholding tax returns filed by EWSS claimant companies in respect of distributions in 2021.  The dividend withholding tax applies to a wide range of different types of distribution.  This includes both intra-group distributions and dividends paid to shareholders, both cash and non-cash distributions, for example, the use of additional shareholding by way of additional shares.  The dividend withholding tax, DWT, neither distinguishes between these different forms of distribution nor sets out the accounting period to which the distribution may relate.  Therefore, the Revenue advises that it is not possible to determine whether distribution payments relate to profit reserves earned before or during the pandemic.  It is important to put that on record.  Sometimes dividends might get paid at a later date and some of them may relate to profits that had existed prior to the introduction of the scheme.</p> <p> As the Deputy said, the Revenue's exercise showed that 641 employers out of a total of 51,900 which had received EWSS filled dividend withholding tax returns advising of some form of distribution during this period.  However, it is not possible to determine whether the distributions were cash or non-cash in nature or whether any dividends were paid to shareholders.  At the time, the 641 companies had received gross EWSS subsidies of &euro;267.8 million.  Nineteen of these employers have returned all subsidies received totalling &euro;27.9 million while 84 have partially repaid EWSS received amounting to &euro;5.8 million.</p> <p> I understand this information has already been supplied directly to the Deputy.  At least we are all speaking from the same factual basis.</p> <p> For the reasons I have outlined, I am not in a position to accept the Deputy's amendment.</p></speech>

That information should be regularly available.</p>  <p>  Sadly, the point I am making seems to be lost on the Minister of State.  We have spent over &euro;10 billion on an objectively successful wage subsidy scheme.  Nobody is saying otherwise.  The scheme has been objectively successful in doing what it was initially designed to do.  Everybody accepts and understands that.  What I am asking is that as the scheme winds down, given the scale of the resources allocated during the lifetime of the TWSS and the successor EWSS, we require a comprehensive, detailed report into the operation of the scheme from the point of view of probity and financial transparency on that significant transfer of resources from the Exchequer to private enterprise and on to workers.  That is not too much to ask.  It is a reasonable request.  That is the kind of assessment we need to inform public policy-making into the future because we do not know when we will require an intervention such as this again.</p>  <p>  I remember arguing in another House following the Brexit vote that we would require a form of wage subsidy scheme that was being floated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and others in response to the shock that Brexit might present to our economy, and especially specific sectors.  I have been making the case, for example, for a German-style wage subsidy scheme with various conditions attached that would be a permanent feature of the labour market to help us to deal with any shocks that may arise in the future and that we cannot anticipate.  From a public policy point of view and from a financial transparency and probity point of view, I fundamentally believe that an initiative such as this is required and that it should be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and debated here given the scale of the resources that, as I said, were transferred from the Exchequer to private enterprise and on to workers.</p></speech>

While the legislation did not stipulate that a report be prepared, the Department prepares bimonthly EWSS utilisation papers which capture all the information the Deputy is seeking.  The Minister has reviewed all of these and they are on the Department's website.  All the information that was originally suggested as part of the original legislation by way of a report is out there on the Department's website and that is helpful and beneficial.</p>  <p>  There is ongoing and active monitoring of EWSS by both the Department and officials, including the publication of the analysis, as I said, and the utilisation papers.  I do not consider that a further report is required at this time.</p>  <p>  Essentially, the Deputy is asking me to prepare a report on the information that is already on the Department's website.  I am saying it is there and everybody should be able to read it without the Department having to produce a report by another name.</p></speech>

It is there for everybody to see.</p>  <p>  I might also add, insofar as EWSS is concerned, the main purpose of the Bill was to give statutory effect to the enhancements that were agreed by Government that are currently being operated by the Revenue under the care and management provision.</p>  <p>  Importantly, the Central Statistics Office has recently issued a publication stating that 84% of enterprises survived at the end of 2021.  Looking at the 2020-21 period together, 10% of enterprises are at risk of closing.  Approximately 6% appear to have closed.  Of those engaged pre-Covid, 94.3% were with an enterprise that has survived.  I consider that a phenomenally high success rate.  Leaving aside the Ukraine issue, we were experiencing such a strong rebound in the economy following Covid because we kept businesses alive and kept the links with employees.</p> <p>The scheme was successful overall.  The information relating to the operation of the scheme is published on the Department's website on a bimonthly basis.  For those reasons, I am not in a position to accept the Deputy's amendment.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 3 provides the necessary legislative basis for the changes approved by the D&aacute;il under the financial resolution of 27 April.  This extends and enhances the excise reduction brought forward on Committee Stage of the Bill.  The background to this amendment is that the Government brought a financial resolution to the D&aacute;il providing for excise duty decreases on mineral oil taxes with effect from 10 March.  This provides for a 20 cent reduction in the excise rate for petrol and a 15 cent reduction in auto diesel, with a proportionate 2 cent reduction in the excise for marked gas or green diesel, as it is commonly known.  These measures were VAT-inclusive and are set to last until 31 August 2022.  This was estimated to cost &euro;320 million.  These reductions were then provided for on Committee Stage of this Bill.</p>  <p>  The purpose of these Report Stage amendments is to extend the excise duty decreases until 11 October 2022.  When this Bill was originally brought before the D&aacute;il, it was intended that these measures would last until 31 August.  This amendment is to extend the duty decreases until budget day on 11 October 2022.  We are extending the period during which the reduction will be applied.  Those reductions were discussed on Second and Committee Stages.  This is the Report Stage amendment.</p>  <p>  It also provides for a further reduction in the mineral oil tax rate on marked gas oil, which amounts to a VAT inclusive reduction of 3 cent effective from 1 May until 11 October.  This has already been done on a temporary basis by a financial resolution moved last week.  The Report Stage amendment is to provide for these changes in this Bill.  The excise reduction extension and the further reduction in the rate applied to marked gas oil will cost an estimated &euro;97 million, that is, &euro;80 million for the extension and &euro;17 million for the marked gas oil.  We have had many debates in the House in recent weeks about the ongoing energy price crisis and I have said before that it is not possible to offset all of the recent increases by just using the taxation system.  However, the Government is committed to doing what it can to provide significant mitigation against recent price fuel increases.  The extension of these excise reductions until budget day provides certainty to citizens and strikes a balance between passing on a significant benefit to consumers, managing the tax base and respecting the minimum rates allowable under the energy tax directive from the EU.  I commend this amendment to the House.</p>  <p>  Deputy Doherty has submitted amendments Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, which are grouped for discussion with amendment No. 3.  I will now deal with those Sinn F&eacute;in amendments.  The Deputy's amendments propose various further rate reductions from 1 May until budget day.  He seeks to reduce mineral oil tax rates on petrol and diesel to the minimum rates as prescribed in the energy tax directive and to further reduce the rate on marked gas oil by 2 cent.  The amendment also seeks to remove the carbon component of kerosene, reducing the overall rate of tax to zero.  The proposal is to remove the carbon tax component on kerosene, thereby reducing the rate to zero.  That is the essence of the amendments.</p>  <p>  The proposed mineral oil tax for diesel would not be compliant with the minimum rate set out in the energy tax directive at EU level.  The combined effect of the measures the Government has already provided means that the current mineral oil tax rate for diesel, in addition to the diesel rebate scheme, is effectively at the minimum level allowable under the energy tax directive.  Any further excise reduction, as the Deputy is proposing, would bring the effective rate below the minimum permissible rate.  To apply a mineral oil tax rate of 33 cent per litre would mean the Government would have to scrap the diesel rebate scheme, which is a targeted support for hauliers and public transport operators.  The mineral oil tax on kerosene for home heating has a non-carbon component rate of zero.  The carbon component is currently &euro;103.83 per 1,000 l.  In other words, there is only carbon tax on kerosene.  The Deputy proposes removing completely the carbon tax element, thus reducing mineral oil tax to zero.</p>  <p>  Similarly, the reductions the Government is providing for the rate of mineral oil tax on marked has oil means that the non-carbon component is now zero until 12 October.  As there will only be carbon tax on this fuel, the further reductions on mineral oil tax proposed by the Deputy would also involve reducing the carbon component of this fuel.</p>  <p>  Deputies will be aware that the 2020 programme for Government committed to increasing the amount that is charged per tonne of CO2 emissions from fuel to &euro;100 by 2030.  The Government has followed through on this commitment by introducing legislation in the Finance Act 2020 to provide for a ten-year trajectory of carbon tax increases to reach &euro;100 per tonne of CO2 by 2030.  This measure is a key pillar underpinning the Government's climate action plan to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net zero no later than 2050.</p>  <p>  A key further component of the Government's carbon taxation policy is the hypothecation of revenues, an issue the Deputy has raised before.  It is important to say that when revenues come in, we know we have a carbon budget and when we get funds from carbon, we are in a position to allocate it to various purposes to assist people in fuel poverty and take various other measures.  Without that tax, there would be a difficulty in funding the various other measures about which we are talking.  It is important to note that a significant proportion of carbon tax revenue is allocated for expenditure on targeted welfare measures and energy efficiency measures which not only support the most vulnerable households in society but also, in the long term, provide support against fuel price impacts by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.  The fuel allowance does not cover all the fuel needs of those availing of it and it never has.  It nonetheless provides a significant reduction on the cost of fuel.  People availing of the fuel allowance are receiving more than &euro;1,000.  As I mentioned earlier, there have been reductions in the cost of school transport.  There is also funding available for the various agri-environment schemes and for the retrofit schemes.  All those schemes have to be funded from somewhere and carbon tax is an element of that.  It is important that we are consistent.  If we want to pay for these schemes and reduce our carbon emissions, we should link those two elements.  For those reasons, I cannot accept the Deputy's amendments.</p></speech>

Given the deadline that was imposed for Deputies to submit amendments, it was not possible for me to capture all that was required but I think it is important to reflect on the extension of the debt warehousing scheme, which will now apply to directors and employees with a material interest in a company who will be allowed to warehouse tax liabilities relating to schedule E income from a company where their income is self-assessed.  Previously, if a company availed of debt warehousing for PAYE employers liability, any directors or employees who had a material interest in a company could not claim credit for taxes deducted if those taxes had been warehoused and not paid over to Revenue by the company.  This meant these directors and employees would be personally liable for these tax liabilities but it would only apply for income tax warehousing.</p>  <p>  Sections 72 and 73 of the finance Bill brought forward by the Government changed that arrangement by allowing individuals who did not qualify for income tax warehousing to warehouse tax liabilities relating to their schedule E income from that company.  We now know, and it has been in the media today, that high-wealth individuals who have a net wealth of &euro;20 million or more have through this scheme warehoused &euro;6 million in tax debt, availing of beneficial repayment and interest provision.  There are serious questions about how the D&aacute;il and the Government can stand over that arrangement.  I call on the Minister of State not to extend this part of this section to those individuals.  It should never have been allowed in the first place.</p>  <p>  Amendments Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, are in my name.  The purpose of the amendments is to provide further relief and support to hard-pressed households during this cost of living crisis.  As I have stated many times, and I will do so again, Sinn F&eacute;in recognises that the Government cannot shield everyone from every single price increase.</p> <p>The scheme was successful overall.  The information relating to the operation of the scheme is published on the Department's website on a bimonthly basis.  For those reasons, I am not in a position to accept the Deputy's amendment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-04a.370" nospeaker="true" time="18:30:00" ><p>I will deal with amendment No. 3 in the first few moments of my contribution and I will then, as part of the group discussion, deal with the Opposition amendments from Deputy Doherty.  Amendment No. 3 provides the necessary legislative basis for the changes approved by the D&aacute;il under the financial resolution of 27 April.  This extends and enhances the excise reduction brought forward on Committee Stage of the Bill.  The background to this amendment is that the Government brought a financial resolution to the D&aacute;il providing for excise duty decreases on mineral oil taxes with effect from 10 March.  This provides for a 20 cent reduction in the excise rate for petrol and a 15 cent reduction in auto diesel, with a proportionate 2 cent reduction in the excise for marked gas or green diesel, as it is commonly known.  These measures were VAT-inclusive and are set to last until 31 August 2022.  This was estimated to cost &euro;320 million.  These reductions were then provided for on Committee Stage of this Bill.</p><p>The purpose of these Report Stage amendments is to extend the excise duty decreases until 11 October 2022.  When this Bill was originally brought before the D&aacute;il, it was intended that these measures would last until 31 August.  This amendment is to extend the duty decreases until budget day on 11 October 2022.  We are extending the period during which the reduction will be applied.  Those reductions were discussed on Second and Committee Stages.  This is the Report Stage amendment.</p><p>It also provides for a further reduction in the mineral oil tax rate on marked gas oil, which amounts to a VAT inclusive reduction of 3 cent effective from 1 May until 11 October.  This has already been done on a temporary basis by a financial resolution moved last week.  The Report Stage amendment is to provide for these changes in this Bill.  The excise reduction extension and the further reduction in the rate applied to marked gas oil will cost an estimated &euro;97 million, that is, &euro;80 million for the extension and &euro;17 million for the marked gas oil.  We have had many debates in the House in recent weeks about the ongoing energy price crisis and I have said before that it is not possible to offset all of the recent increases by just using the taxation system.  However, the Government is committed to doing what it can to provide significant mitigation against recent price fuel increases.  The extension of these excise reductions until budget day provides certainty to citizens and strikes a balance between passing on a significant benefit to consumers, managing the tax base and respecting the minimum rates allowable under the energy tax directive from the EU.  I commend this amendment to the House.</p><p>Deputy Doherty has submitted amendments Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, which are grouped for discussion with amendment No. 3.  I will now deal with those Sinn F&eacute;in amendments.  The Deputy's amendments propose various further rate reductions from 1 May until budget day.  He seeks to reduce mineral oil tax rates on petrol and diesel to the minimum rates as prescribed in the energy tax directive and to further reduce the rate on marked gas oil by 2 cent.  The amendment also seeks to remove the carbon component of kerosene, reducing the overall rate of tax to zero.  The proposal is to remove the carbon tax component on kerosene, thereby reducing the rate to zero.  That is the essence of the amendments.</p><p>The proposed mineral oil tax for diesel would not be compliant with the minimum rate set out in the energy tax directive at EU level.  The combined effect of the measures the Government has already provided means that the current mineral oil tax rate for diesel, in addition to the diesel rebate scheme, is effectively at the minimum level allowable under the energy tax directive.  Any further excise reduction, as the Deputy is proposing, would bring the effective rate below the minimum permissible rate.  To apply a mineral oil tax rate of 33 cent per litre would mean the Government would have to scrap the diesel rebate scheme, which is a targeted support for hauliers and public transport operators.  The mineral oil tax on kerosene for home heating has a non-carbon component rate of zero.  The carbon component is currently &euro;103.83 per 1,000 l.  In other words, there is only carbon tax on kerosene.  The Deputy proposes removing completely the carbon tax element, thus reducing mineral oil tax to zero.</p><p>Similarly, the reductions the Government is providing for the rate of mineral oil tax on marked has oil means that the non-carbon component is now zero until 12 October.  As there will only be carbon tax on this fuel, the further reductions on mineral oil tax proposed by the Deputy would also involve reducing the carbon component of this fuel.</p><p>Deputies will be aware that the 2020 programme for Government committed to increasing the amount that is charged per tonne of CO2 emissions from fuel to &euro;100 by 2030.  The Government has followed through on this commitment by introducing legislation in the Finance Act 2020 to provide for a ten-year trajectory of carbon tax increases to reach &euro;100 per tonne of CO2 by 2030.  This measure is a key pillar underpinning the Government's climate action plan to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net zero no later than 2050.</p><p>A key further component of the Government's carbon taxation policy is the hypothecation of revenues, an issue the Deputy has raised before.  It is important to say that when revenues come in, we know we have a carbon budget and when we get funds from carbon, we are in a position to allocate it to various purposes to assist people in fuel poverty and take various other measures.  Without that tax, there would be a difficulty in funding the various other measures about which we are talking.  It is important to note that a significant proportion of carbon tax revenue is allocated for expenditure on targeted welfare measures and energy efficiency measures which not only support the most vulnerable households in society but also, in the long term, provide support against fuel price impacts by reducing our reliance on fossil fuels.  The fuel allowance does not cover all the fuel needs of those availing of it and it never has.  It nonetheless provides a significant reduction on the cost of fuel.  People availing of the fuel allowance are receiving more than &euro;1,000.  As I mentioned earlier, there have been reductions in the cost of school transport.  There is also funding available for the various agri-environment schemes and for the retrofit schemes.  All those schemes have to be funded from somewhere and carbon tax is an element of that.  It is important that we are consistent.  If we want to pay for these schemes and reduce our carbon emissions, we should link those two elements.  For those reasons, I cannot accept the Deputy's amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-04a.371" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="18:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050400033#GGGGG00500"><p>I want to reflect on sections 5 to 10, inclusive.  Given the deadline that was imposed for Deputies to submit amendments, it was not possible for me to capture all that was required but I think it is important to reflect on the extension of the debt warehousing scheme, which will now apply to directors and employees with a material interest in a company who will be allowed to warehouse tax liabilities relating to schedule E income from a company where their income is self-assessed.  Previously, if a company availed of debt warehousing for PAYE employers liability, any directors or employees who had a material interest in a company could not claim credit for taxes deducted if those taxes had been warehoused and not paid over to Revenue by the company.  This meant these directors and employees would be personally liable for these tax liabilities but it would only apply for income tax warehousing.</p>  <p>  Sections 72 and 73 of the finance Bill brought forward by the Government changed that arrangement by allowing individuals who did not qualify for income tax warehousing to warehouse tax liabilities relating to their schedule E income from that company.  We now know, and it has been in the media today, that high-wealth individuals who have a net wealth of &euro;20 million or more have through this scheme warehoused &euro;6 million in tax debt, availing of beneficial repayment and interest provision.  There are serious questions about how the D&aacute;il and the Government can stand over that arrangement.  I call on the Minister of State not to extend this part of this section to those individuals.  It should never have been allowed in the first place.</p>  <p>  Amendments Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, are in my name.  The purpose of the amendments is to provide further relief and support to hard-pressed households during this cost of living crisis.  As I have stated many times, and I will do so again, Sinn F&eacute;in recognises that the Government cannot shield everyone from every single price increase.</p> <p>However, we are fully aware that the Government can and should do more to support workers and families who, without support, cannot withstand the price increases without significant financial hardship.</p> <p> Amendment No. 4 would reduce the price of petrol by a further 13 cent, including VAT.  It is very important to make the point that the Minister of State gave no reason this could not be done.  This is simply policy and there is nothing preventing us from doing this.  We can do it today if we vote on it and reduce the cost of petrol for motorists.  Amendment No. 5 would reduce the cost of diesel by another 9 cent per litre, including VAT.  Both amendments are consistent with the requirements of the excise directive.  As I have stated on numerous occasions, amendment No. 5 would require the temporary suspension of the diesel rebate scheme but would ensure the benefits of that scheme continue to be enjoyed for those who qualify due to the excise reduction provided by the amendment.  The diesel rebate scheme is a way for the Government to reduce excise for a small, limited number of people.  It applies to some hauliers and some transport operators, although not all of them.  We are proposing to suspend that for the moment and give them the rebate or reduction directly at the pump, while giving all other motorists that rebate as well.  There is nothing preventing us from doing that, apart from political ideology.  Amendment No. 7 provides a further reduction in the price of green agricultural diesel, which is so important for our agricultural contractors who are not able to avail of the double carbon tax reliefs.  That would be a reduction of 3.3 cent per litre VAT inclusive, relative to the price in April of this year.</p> <p> Crucially, amendment No. 6 addresses the spiralling cost of home heating oil, which is completely out of control.  This impacts one out of every three houses across the State.  In places like my county of Donegal, it is two out of every three houses.  Right down the west coast, 66% of people, or two out of three households, depend on home heating oil as their primary source of heating.  In the last period, home heating oil has hit massive prices.  It cost &euro;1,700 in March to fill a tank with oil.  The price has more than doubled in the space of a year and many households cannot bear this cost.  With this amendment, we are proposing to reduce the cost of filling a tank by &euro;118.  Many households simply cannot bear these price increases.  Not only have they been forgotten by this Government, they have been punished by it.  Last week, the Government voted against a similar motion from Sinn F&eacute;in that would have removed excise duty on home heating oil and reduced the price from Sunday past.  Not only did the Government vote against our motion, it went one step further and jacked up the price of home heating oil, increasing pressure on one out of three households across the State and two out of three households across the west and north west who rely on that source of fuel to heat their homes and their families.  Amendment No. 6 is another opportunity for Deputies to do the right thing and reduce the cost of home heating oil.  I ask them not to blow it this time.  We are putting this amendment forward to give real relief to families in the middle of all this pressure.  Hopefully, the Government will have seen sense since last week.</p> <p> The Minister of State spoke about hypothecation.  I pulled him up on this last week.  There is no tax in Irish tax law that is hypothecated or ring-fenced.  The idea that if we reduce carbon tax we will not be able to fund other measures is nonsense.  The tax goes into a central pool.  This is an ideological issue.  It is a policy issue and policies can differ.  There is no legal impediment to funding retrofitting from VAT, income tax or anything else because the money all goes into a central fund.  This is about excise duty and carbon tax.  I am glad the penny has finally dropped for the Government that there is excise duty on these things.  In fairness to those in Fianna F&aacute;il, to give them their dues, they did not take out false, misleading, Trump-style attack ads about this.  It was Fine Gael that led the charge on that.</p> <p> I commend these amendments to the House.  They would have a real impact on a lot of people who are struggling with the costs of getting from A to B because of diesel and petrol and, crucially, would help all the households that are trying to keep their homes and families warm.</p></speech>

With regard to the issues he raised around the tax warehousing scheme, this scheme is an essential element of the assistance provided by the State with the EWSS and TWSS.  The tax debt warehousing scheme has offered valuable and practical liquidity support to businesses.  It has assisted businesses with their cash flow during difficult trading periods.  The objective of the scheme was to allow firms to recover, thereby helping them guarantee their long-term economic viability and survival.  The scheme applied to VAT, PAYE, PRSI, employer debts and certain self-assessed income tax debts, as well as overpayments of both the TWSS and the EWSS.  In the provision of the warehousing scheme, we acknowledged that there might be some overpayments of the TWSS and EWSS and there was a facility for warehousing of those payments on a cash flow basis.  To qualify for the debt warehousing, businesses must continue to file a tax return even though their liability cannot be paid.  This has always been a condition of the scheme.  Whether it is VAT returns or PAYE information, employers have to state the amount of tax they should be returning on a weekly or monthly basis.  They complete the form but do not have to return the cheque if they are not in a position to do so.  Revenue knows exactly how much is being warehoused on a company-by-company basis.  It is important to recognise that.  People have come to me locally who are running their family hotels and were not able to avail of the various schemes because they were a director and were self-employed on that basis.  The Deputy will be aware of this issue.  Sometimes there are two or three in the family running a hotel and they have been excluded from these schemes.  That is why they are asking for them to be extended.  I hope the Deputy is not saying hoteliers who run family businesses should not be included because they might be self-employed and making their own separate tax returns other than through PAYE.  I think he understands there was merit in extending the scheme to many people in those situations.</p></speech>

I understand the fact the amendments were directly opposite to each other.</p>  <p>  This is a missed opportunity for the Government and, indeed, this House to do the right thing.  We have a serious problem right across the board, in every village and every community, where families are hard-pressed as a result of the cost-of-living crisis.  The Government has its head in the sand about home heating oil.  For the life of me I do not understand how, when the cost of home heating oil has increased by 127%, the response of the Government, collectively, can be to increase that further while hiding behind the fact that it is a carbon tax.  The people who are struggling to keep their homes warm do not care what the tax is called.  They expect the Government and their representatives to represent them and address their interests in their time of need.</p> <p>The Government has again refused to support amendments that would have reduced the pressure on ordinary families across the board, not only with home heating oil, but with petrol, diesel and in support of our agricultural community.  It is an indictment of this Government, which is very much out of touch with ordinary people.  We did not oppose the most important part of this legislation, which was to reduce VAT temporarily from 13.5% to 9%.  I put on the record that we called for a VAT reduction about six months ago and for the Government to engage with the Commission.  The first formal engagement was this March.  Those letters still have not been published.  None of that engagement resulted in the changes, because these changes were in draft form as late as last year.</p> <p> Sometimes, I think I would be better off banging my head against the wall instead of asking the Government to respond to the real needs of ordinary families and workers, but I will do it once again.  The Government should reduce excise on home heating oil.  It should reduce the cost of petrol, diesel and agricultural diesel.  It should stop pushing up prices on necessities for families to keep their homes warm.  On Sunday, it allowed the cost to fill a tank with home heating oil to increase by &euro;20, which is nothing short of scandalous.</p></speech>

The amendments recognise the new powers that will be conferred on the commission by passing the legislation.  It will mean that the workload increases.  The concern is that unless money is provided to reflect the increased workload, important work will not be done, to the point that it affects the organisation's ability to carry out necessary functions.  I have tabled amendments and think that we need to have a belt, braces and baler twine approach to ensure that the commission has all the resources that it needs.  New powers are welcome, but they are effectively useless without the capacity of the organisation to back that up.  The two amendments are broadly similar.</p></speech>

I intend to address both amendments together, because there is considerable overlap between them.  I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy O'Reilly that it is important that the regulatory body is adequately resourced to coincide with any necessary legislative provision that gives it additional powers.  As I stated previously, my Department and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, recognise that significant additional resources will be required to implement the new legislation.  In the past two budgets, the CCPC has received an increase of over 30%.  It currently has 146 staff and it intends to increase the number to more than 200 by the end of this year.  If the CCPC assessment is that additional funding is required, based on the structures required under this Bill, it can submit an increased Estimate bid as part of the budget 2023 negotiations.  This bid is subject to agreement by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and if it is approved, it will be incorporated into the overall departmental Estimates package, which will be the subject of negotiation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the upcoming budget.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's amendments would be an unusual departure from the process, in that past spending would have to be accounted for rather than projected spending.  Accounting for projected spending has been the norm.  If the budgets were based on past performance in 2017 and 2018, the CCPC would not have received the additional 30% budget increase in 2021 and 2022, because those were based on projected activity, not past activity.  The best way is for the CCPC to come forward in advance of the budgetary process and put forward a business case for the funding it needs to carry out its future work.  That has been done in the past two budgets.</p>  <p>  We demonstrated in these budgets that we recognised that additional resources would be needed and those resources were provided.  I advised on Committee Stage that the Government is obliged under EU law to ensure that its competition authorities are sufficiently resourced.  Since then, I have given the points raised by Deputy O'Reilly further consideration, because I genuinely accept where she is coming from, particularly with regard to what options are open to the CCPC if it found itself under-resourced and unable to carry out its functions at any future date.  I consulted the CCPC and was advised that if such an event occurred, it has the ability to contact the European Commission's Directorate-General for Competition directly.  The CCPC has direct contact with Commission officials in the appropriate unit.  That would probably be the first point of contact if it had concerns about resourcing.  This means that the CCPC has recourse if a future Government did not adequately resource the commission or, as Deputy O'Reilly suggested on Committee Stage, a Government decided to slash its budget.</p>  <p>  While I genuinely appreciate the Deputy's concern and know where she is coming from with regard to belt, braces and baler twine, I believe that there is no need for these amendments so I do not propose to accept them.</p></speech>

What he pointed out about the Directorate-General for Competition is important.</p> <p>The legislation provides that "the Minister may give consideration".  It does not compel the Minister and nor does it compel the Minister to only look at the previous year and use that as the basis; it is just something to be considered.</p> <p> I have a particular concern about this because of the recruitment embargo.  When it was implemented, the way it was implemented essentially was to abolish existing vacancies.  When a job became vacant, that post was suppressed and the job was not replaced.  Its application was very uneven and I would be concerned that it would happen in this case.  Notwithstanding that, I welcome that the Minister of State has had a discussion with the commission and that it is satisfied that it would be able to take matters further, should it require.  The Minister of State can see where I am coming from in this regard.  It is an abundance of caution and knowledge of what happened with the recruitment embargo.  I will not go into the reasons it happened but it was very unevenly applied.  While it did not leave agencies unable to perform their functions, it really hampered them in being able to perform their functions.  As I have said, the clarification from the Minister of State is very welcome.  The Minister of State can see where we are coming from on this.  It is to be cautious.  We want to make sure that the maximum amount of resources are going to be made available.  The additional powers will mean the commission will have a huge amount of additional work, which is very important work.  I have that concern but I accept the Minister of State's response in that regard and again thank him for considering it.</p></speech>

When I introduced the Bill to the D&aacute;il earlier in February, I spoke about the imperative for fair and open competition for our businesses, our economy and our society.  We know that the vast majority of businesses do not engage in uncompetitive practices but there are some who do.  These practices drive out competition, drive up costs for ordinary citizens, and undermine the dynamic nature of our economy.  This is why I prioritised this legislation as soon as I took office and was determined to bring the Bill before the House for consideration.</p>  <p>  I sincerely thank the Deputies across the House for their overall support for the Bill to date and for the time they have taken to engage in depth with a Bill that, by necessity, is long and legally complex.  The Bill is weighty legislation that required much consideration and redrafting to get right, particularly in light of our unique constitutional position, the large volume of legislation the Oireachtas had to consider due to the pandemic and the Zalewski judgment.  It has been time well spent and I am confident that the Bill we discussed today is robust and will allow Ireland to effectively deal with anti-competitive behaviour at a national and European level in a way that is wholly in accordance with our Constitution.</p>  <p>  Anti-competitive practices affect everyone, make it more difficult for honest businesses to prosper and have adverse effects on consumers.  By strengthening the powers of our competition authorities we are taking an important step to ensure that Ireland's economy is open, fair and transparent.  While enacting the Competition (Amendment) Bill is about meeting our obligations as a member of the European Union, it is much more than that.  The Bill is about ensuring that Ireland's citizens are protected.  The Government is committed to taking a tough stance on white-collar crime.  As I said at the outset, most Irish businesses operate in a fair and honourable manner.  We have an obligation to those businesses to effectively and efficiently deal with anti-competitive practices in order that law-abiding businesses can thrive.  Competition benefits all consumers.  It drives innovation and efficiencies.  These efficiencies can be passed onto consumers in the context of competitive pricing.</p>  <p>  Again, I thank Deputies for their positive reception of this legislation to date.  I hope to keep the momentum going through the Seanad in order that the Bill can be passed sooner rather than later.  It is important that our businesses will have the certainty and that consumers can reap the benefits of a dynamic and competitive economy.</p></speech>

The latest Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, rent report shows that rents increased by 9% last year.  In 14 separate counties the rental increases for new rental tenancies was double-digit inflation.  The worst affected counties were Roscommon and Waterford, with rental increases of 25% for new rentals.  In Dublin we have seen the end of the Covid-19 flattening of rents, with a significant upward increase of 9% for new rents.  This means that the average cost of a new rental in Dublin today is &euro;23,634, which is an astonishing sum of money.  If one tracks back through the RTB reports, since 2011 rents in the capital have increased by more than 100%.  They have increased by approximately 15% since the Minister took office.</p><p>Behind all of these figures there are very real people.  The impact of these rising rents is very severe.  A significant number of renters, and particularly those who are losing rental tenancies and trying to secure new ones, are experiencing severe financial hardship.</p> <p>That is on top of all the other rising costs of living.  We saw today, for example, newspaper stories about how one in four households are having difficulty purchasing groceries.  Some 73% of households surveyed in the most recent RED C poll indicated that they were spending less each week on groceries to make money go further.  Of course, we know the impact of the rising cost of fuel, home heating, petrol etc.  We also have large numbers of people who are simply unable to save for a deposit or have to go through extraordinary measures to do that.  There are also those older renters and people who have lost a family home because of a relationship breakdown who are back in the rental market and are facing an increasingly precarious future.<br/><br/>The Minister knows only too well from Friday's homeless report that the crisis in the private rental sector is also driving levels of homelessness and leading to rising levels of presentations.  Approximately 50% of all notices to quit are vacant possession notices from landlords selling up.  It has also led to a dramatic collapse of more than 50% in exits in the last year as people simply have nowhere to go once they are in emergency accommodation.<br/><br/>The question we must ask is why is the rental crisis getting worse?  My clear view is that it is Government policy.  There has been an over-reliance on the private rental sector for social housing and the housing assistance payment, HAP, or rental accommodation scheme, RAS, placing enormous pressure on limited supply.  There has been a failure to deliver cost rental over the last three years with zero in the first year, 65 last year and possibly 700 this year depending on the numbers.  It is nowhere close to the thousands that are required.  There is an exclusive focus, particularly in Dublin, on high-end lower-design quality build-to-rent, which is saturating so much of the market.  Outside of Dublin, literally nothing new to rent is coming on the market.  Of course, as the Minister knows, single-property landlords are leaving in droves.<br/><br/>This cannot continue.  It must stop.  We need a radical change in direction.  The measures outlined in our Private Members' motion today signal just that.  We need the emergency ban on rent increases for three years.  Renters cannot take any more.  We must reduce rents by putting at least one month's rent back in people's pockets through a refundable tax credit, which is something the Minister was in favour of before the election but on which he has gone silent since.  We also need to introduce real tenancies of indefinite duration, not the smoke and mirrors change the Minister introduced last year.  Crucially, we need at least 4,000 cost rental tenancies annually.  For decades, housing policy experts and advisers to Government have been saying we need cost rental on scale.  The Minister is not even going to reach that scale at the end of 2026 because he is only targeting 2,000 units by then, which is nowhere close to enough.<br/><br/>With respect to the rising levels of homelessness, we urgently need the Minister to reintroduce the tenant <i>in situ</i>scheme.  I know he announced some increased level of flexibility.  I am not convinced that is what our local authorities need.  I would welcome if the Minister could expand on that.  Local authorities need to be told to use the capital budgets that have been allocated, subject to cost ceilings and the quantity surveyor's reply.  If any family with a HAP or RAS tenancy is at risk of homelessness, subject to the usual rules, the local authority should step in, purchase the home and prevent them from becoming homeless.<br/><br/>I must say, the Minister's record over the last two years speaks for itself.  He is not doing enough, and the crisis is going to continue to get worse.  One of the worrying trends in recent times is that the Minister keeps blaming everybody else.  He blames Covid-19, inflation and Ukraine.  On the Gavin Reilly show, he seemed to be blaming migrants coming into the State.  If that is the case, it is a very retrograde step.  Like former Minister Eoghan Murphy before him, the Minister's policies are the core of the problem.  They must change and if they do not change, we are going to have to get him out of office because that is what renters desperately need and rightly deserve.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Broin has put forward really important motions, which we implore the Government to take on board.  Speaking for myself, the housing crisis in Cork has never been as bad as it is now.  I am working with more than 20 families who are facing eviction from next week up to September.  There is no light at the end of the tunnel for those families.  People are living in fear not knowing where they and their families are going to go.</p><p>Every week now, desperate families come to me because they have nowhere to go.  The Minister has responsibility for housing.  He needs to provide solutions.  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, is bringing forward solutions.  That is what we need the Minister to do.  Instead, my constituents are being turned away when they go looking for housing because the Minister never delivered the supply he promised.  Young families come to me day in, day out.</p><p>To give the Minister an idea, I went onto <i>daft.ie</i>today.  There are 48 properties to rent in Cork.  That includes student accommodation for more than 27,000 students between University College Cork, UCC, and Munster Technological University, MTU.  Only two one-bedroom properties are available in Cork, and they are more than &euro;1,200 per month.  It also includes only one property that is under &euro;1,200 per month to rent.  That is a result of the Minister's policies and this Government putting landlords, speculators and vulture funds before ordinary people.</p></speech>

The housing market is almost broken beyond repair.  I agree with an Teachta &Oacute; Broin about the need to remove this Government from office, if that is what it is going to take, because it will not listen and do the right thing.</p>  <p>  I want to address remarks the Minister made on the Gavin Reilly show.  I will read out an extract from a statement issued by Fingal Communities Against Racism, which is a very active group in our constituency that does a huge amount of good work.  The statement said the Minister's "claims that a recent increase in homelessness is partly driven by the arrival of 'economic migrants', is a deliberate attempt to distract from his own government's failure to address the housing crisis".  The group is spot on and I 100% agree with it.  I sincerely hope the Minister takes the opportunity to walk back those remarks he made because they were wrong and hurtful.  The Minister knows what they were.  He knows exactly what a dog whistle is.  He knows exactly what he was doing.  I hope that he will take the opportunity to walk back those remarks.</p>  <p>  The Minister and I share a constituency.  I have two offices - one in Balbriggan and one in Swords.  I do not hold a single clinic in which I do not see someone coming in with a notice to quit.  Most recently, a couple in their 70s came in, and I will not say where they live because they would be mortified, who are a tiny little bit over the income limit.  They do not qualify for housing supports.  They are on a notice to quit.  They cannot find anywhere they can afford to live, and they are in their 70s.  There is indignity in dealing with this at any stage in a person's life but particularly after a lifetime of work.</p>  <p>  I am dealing with another case of a woman in her 60s who is sleeping in her car.  She cannot get anywhere to rent.  She is terrified of going into a hostel because of what she has heard and seen.  We have nothing else to offer her.  She cannot find anything that she can afford.  This woman is working.  She is lucky that she can find somewhere to get a shower in the morning, but she does not have anywhere to sleep.  That is what has happened.  That did not happen because of economic migrants or anything else.  That happened because of the Government's housing policy.  That is the result.  I urge the Minister to engage with the substance of this motion and listen to what an Teachta &Oacute; Broin said, pick up and take on board the positive solutions that have been offered to him this evening and implement them.</p></speech>

If the cost to rent does not lock people out of the market, it puts huge financial burdens on workers and their families.  People from all walks of life are struggling to pay the rent.  Families who need to rent a house for themselves and their children are struggling.  Young workers starting out in their careers are struggling to pay rent.  Hard-working people cannot keep pace with the cost of rent.</p><p>In Limerick, the rent increase in quarter 4 of 2021 was 14.1%.  The average rent in my home county is &euro;1,203 per month but in fairness, there is hardly anything to rent there.  With the rising rate of inflation of 6.7% in March, people are paying more in rent but with less income available.  The rising rents are one of the huge challenges facing renters.  The other is that there are almost zero properties available to rent.  The number of available properties in the market has been falling for five years.</p><p>On <i>daft.ie</i>, there were five properties available to rent in Limerick city this morning.  There was only one house available.  The cheapest of these properties was &euro;1,200 per month and that was for a studio in the suburb of Dooradoyle.  A three-bedroom apartment in the city centre was listed as &euro;2,750 per month.  These are outrageous prices that most families would struggle to afford.</p> <p> For too long, the Government has depended on the housing assistance payment.  It is not suitable.  The rates have not increased in a decade.  In my experience in Limerick, either it is an insufficient sum to aid with renting or, in many cases, a prospective tenant who is eligible for HAP will be simply not considered by the landlord.  HAP helps a little but what can and will help more is the speeding-up of the delivery of new social housing.</p> <p> Last week, I met John and Aoife, who have nowhere to live.  Their previous rental property was sold.  Both of them work and they have a young child in primary school.  The limit for social support from Limerick City and County Council is &euro;32,250, which is below what they earn, so there is no help for them.  There are thousands in a similar position and the Minister and the Government have failed to increase these limits.  Social housing income limits have not been changed since they were last set in 2011.  They must be raised at least in line with inflation.  Given John and Aoife cannot rent, buy or get social support, where are they supposed to go?  What is going to happen to them?</p> <p> What would help is an increase in the social housing income thresholds.  They are simply too low and far too many people are excluded from social housing or State support because they earn too much and, at the same time, too little to afford a mortgage or even rent.  The rental crisis is one the Government and its housing Minister seem incapable of resolving.  The crisis has a knock-on effect on homelessness and overcrowding and is an issue that simply must be addressed.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in believe renters can be rescued.  It is time the Government stepped up and ensured increased investment in the delivery of affordable and cost rental houses.  In the meantime, it could increase the social housing income thresholds and introduce a three-year ban on rent increases and a refundable tax credit of one month's rent.</p></speech>

The average rent in my area now stands at more than &euro;1,900 per month.  Ordinary workers and families are being pushed to the pin of their collar.  The increases in the cost of living have had a terrible impact on people in my community.  This week, there have been increases in the price of electricity by 24% and of gas by a whopping 32%.  The Government will say some of these increases are outside of its control and I agree, but how a government responds to the plight of its citizens is completely in its control.  Introducing a punitive carbon tax increase this week was the Government's choice.  It points to its retrofitting programme as the great panacea for saving energy.  Information I have received from South Dublin County Council states that of its current housing stock of 10,000 properties, approximately 9,000 need energy upgrades.  It expects to have funding for 300 properties to be upgraded this year, and at this rate it will take 40 years to complete the programme.  As energy prices go through the roof, so too will these tenants' heat for the next 40 years.  On top of this, rents are spiralling, with an increase of 9% in the past three months.  Rent in Dublin has increased by 100% since 2011.  How are ordinary Dubliners meant to remain in their city?</p>  <p>  This situation has not happened by accident.  It has been manufactured by policies that rely on the private market to solve public problems.  The Government has failed not only to supply the housing that is needed but also to adapt and change its failed policies.  Again, Sinn F&eacute;in and my colleague Deputy &Oacute; Broin will give the Government some solutions to fix the problems it created in the rental market.  We would ban rent increases for three years, introduce a refundable tax credit to put one month's rent back into every renter's pocket, dramatically scale up the delivery of affordable cost rental homes, resource the RTB properly to enforce rent regulations and introduce real tenancies of indefinite durations.  That is what Sinn F&eacute;in would do, and it is what the Government must do.</p></speech>

Nevertheless, before this increase in inflation and the war in Ukraine, we had the highest rents in Europe.  People were struggling with housing, with paying rent and even with finding accommodation.  All of this was known before the increase in inflation and the uncertainty arising from the war in Ukraine.</p>  <p>  What we needed to see from the Government was clear, swift action in respect of housing.  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, and our party have brought forward proposals time and again, and time and again what we see from the Government is a lack of action.  I have read the Government's amendment to the motion but people who cannot make ends meet and who cannot pay for the rents in Galway city or county, which have increased by 8.8% and 19%, respectively, do not need flowery language from the Minister or the Government.  What they need is action to tackle the cost of these rents.  They need a ban on rent increases and the tax break we have put forward budget after budget.</p>  <p>  Time and again, we hear the Government saying it knows there is a cost of living crisis and that people are finding it really difficult to make ends meet but that it cannot do everything.  Nobody is saying the Government can do everything but we are here to work with it constructively.  We are putting forward proposals we know will assist and help people who cannot pay their rent and who are looking at a notice to quit - there has been an increase in the number of notices of quit - and are wondering what they will do now because they cannot find a place to live in Galway city or county.  What they are seeing from the Government is that instead of it working productively with the Opposition, it is ignoring the suggestions of the Opposition and just offering flowery language.</p></speech>

It is not a shock to anybody that rents continue to spiral out of control for individuals and families.  As the Minister will know, rents keep growing every year and show no real sign of stopping any time soon.  As my colleague pointed out in respect of his area, the average rent for a new tenancy is &euro;1,900, although that depends on the area and, in some areas, it is up to &euro;2,000.  The most shocking figure is that average rents in Dublin have increased by 100% in ten years.  The worrying aspect is that we do not see any real change or anything happening to help people in those circumstances.  It is another steep increase that far outstrips what should be acceptable and it is a massive additional cost for workers and families to bear on top of rapid increases in other household bills.</p>  <p>  Rents such as those throughout the State are one of the main reasons we are going through a cost of living crisis; of course, that is if you are one of the lucky ones able to find somewhere to rent.  As public representatives, we all dread, on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday morning or whenever, those families and individuals coming in to our offices, telling us they are facing eviction and asking whether we know of anywhere they can get.  One of my colleagues referred to only two one-bedroom vacancies being available in his area, Cork.  On Daft this morning, the number of properties available to rent in Dublin 24, which includes more than just Tallaght, where more than 100,000 people live, 16 properties were available to rent.  That is the challenge we face.</p>  <p>  It is clear the Government's attempts are not working and clearly, the crisis is getting worse.  As I said, rents have been increasing for ten years and have gone up and up, and I do not think people have any confidence circumstances will change.  Rents and house prices are still increasing far in excess of what is affordable to workers and their families and that is the key issue.  The Minister cannot continue with the same approach and expect things to change, and that is the message I appeal to him to take on board.  He might have a look at the Sinn F&eacute;in motion and the proposals therein and meet us halfway.  Let us make some change and give some hope to people who are listening to this debate.</p></speech>

It is easy, and perhaps it suits Deputy &Oacute; Broin and others, to just dismiss Covid, two construction shutdowns, inflation, supply chain issues and what is happening in the rest of Europe and of the developed world.  It might not suit their narrative but people deserve an honest debate.  We should credit people with the intelligence they have to be able to understand the issue.  Moreover, we should not try to send people down rabbit holes or to paint a picture that is very different from what is happening.  Progress is being made and I welcome the opportunity to detail areas where it is being made, notwithstanding the very difficult situation in which many thousands of people find themselves.</p> <p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>I welcome the opportunity to provide details on areas where progress is being made, notwithstanding the very difficult situation that many thousands of people find themselves in.</p> <p> Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe outlined one of the big issues, namely, the lack of supply.  This lack of supply is down to a number of factors.  For the past two years, construction was very badly impeded by two severe construction shutdowns.  Even last year, however, we delivered more than 9,000 new social homes, an increase of 17% on the year before.  I will concentrate on social housing first because it is an area in which the Government and I absolutely believe.  We have a plan, Housing for All, that is fully funded to the tune of &euro;4 billion per year, which is &euro;1.2 billion per year more than Sinn F&eacute;in proposed in its housing plan.  It is important people know that too.</p></speech>

I will continue.</p>  <p>  This year, we have a target of 9,000 new-build social houses.  Should that be delivered, as we intend it to be, it will be the single biggest delivery of social housing in any year in the history of the State.  All I am saying to the Members opposite, including Deputy O'Reilly who is no longer here, which is fine, is that her colleagues in Fingal have objected to a housing scheme of 1,200 homes, including 253 social homes and 253 affordable housing with the remainder private.  Her party's councillors in that area decided that was not what they wanted.  I can give examples of that kind right across Dublin and right across the country.  One constructive thing Sinn F&eacute;in could do is to allow developments to happen and to allow public and affordable housing to be built.  It is very important that this happens because we have to catch up on supply.  Last year, there were just over 21,000 completions, which is approximately 12,000 fewer than are needed.  However, in the 12 months to the end of March, more than 22,000 new homes were completed, the highest 12-month total in the past decade.  More than 35,000 new commencement notices were received between April 2021 and March 2022.  This is also the highest rolling 12-month total since comparable data was first published.  Planning permission was granted for 43,000 new homes in 2021.  Supply of both public and private housing is crucial in tackling the rental and affordability crises.</p>  <p>  We brought forward the Affordable Housing Act 2021, the most comprehensive affordable housing Act ever brought forward in this House.  Not only have we done that but we have also opened the affordable housing fund, through which affordable homes for purchase will be delivered for hundreds of families this year.  We will be bringing forward our first home shared equity scheme from 1 July this year, under which the State will step in to help potential first-time buyers, many of whom are stuck in rental traps, to bridge the gap between the finance they have and the finance they need by taking an equity share.  The party opposite opposed that scheme vociferously but it will work for people who want to own their own home.  Another scheme that Members opposite vociferously opposed is that relating to help-to-buy grant, which has helped more than 30,000 people buy and own their own homes.  Inexplicably, the Members opposite opposed that.  We will continue that scheme because it is a direct support for people.</p>  <p>  We also need to resource our local authorities to build the homes we need.  We have plans in place, agreed with all 31 local authorities across the Twenty-six Counties, as to their housing delivery between now and 2026.  These cover social housing, cost-rental housing, affordable housing and private housing.</p>  <p>  We have delivered cost rental from a slow start.  It did not exist and was not here but we legislated for it, which Sinn F&eacute;in supported.  There are now tenants in place paying 50% below the market rent in many places.  We will deliver hundreds more such units this year.  I genuinely thank the Sinn F&eacute;in Members opposite for tabling their motion and giving me the opportunity to respond to it.  It speaks of dramatically increasing "investment in the delivery of large volumes of affordable Cost Rental" but there is no detail included.  There is no detail with regard to the capacity to deliver.  We have to build capacity in the construction sector to deliver the homes we need.</p>  <p>  I am thankful that, because of the Housing for All plan, the construction sector is back to its pre-pandemic capacity.  The plan itself will create at least 27,000 new jobs.  That is happening right now.  Again, that might not suit the narrative but things are turning in the right direction.  The roll-out of cost rental is happening and will continue.  We have funded more than 900 new tenancies for this year and, if we can do more, we will because resources are not an issue.  We now have a national cost-rental scheme in place along with a national affordable purchase scheme.  Our local authorities are delivering houses starting from &euro;166,000.  In this instance, the State also takes an equity stake in those homes through the local authorities.  That is helping people who have been locked out of the market for the last ten years to get back into it.</p>  <p>  While it may surprise some of the Members opposite, we need to increase the delivery of private housing.

We have brought in a 2% cap on rent increases, which Sinn F&eacute;in supported.  Sinn F&eacute;in has actually supported ten of the 11 pieces of legislation I have brought forward over the past 12 to 14 months.  Despite this, according to Sinn F&eacute;in, we are doing everything wrong.  There is a little bit of a contradiction there.  When Deputy &Oacute; Broin and his colleagues talk about dramatically increasing investment, does that mean more than the &euro;2.8 billion Sinn F&eacute;in said it would put in when we are putting in &euro;4 billion?</p></speech>

I had some things that I intended to say before I came in, but I need to respond to some of the nonsense that he came out with first.  As the Minister knows, the figure of &euro;1.2 billion is not accurate.  He is incorrect.  In regard to dismissing things, nobody is suggesting that we dismiss Covid-19 or that supply chain issues are not there.  We absolutely acknowledge those issues.  The problem is that it is six or seven years since the Minister started promising housing budgets for more every year.  Every year he declared victory and every year things got worse.  Pardon me and pardon the public for not believing him when he says that things would have been fine except for the interruptions we had over the course of the past two years.</p>  <p>  The housing crisis started because of the policies that were implemented by the last Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  That is a fact.  They encouraged local authorities to step back from building houses.  That is the truth of it.  That is the origin of this.  There were other factors, but that is a big part of the origin of this.  Fianna F&aacute;il came back and promised a housing budget every year but it never arrived.  It still has not arrived as far as I am concerned.  The Minister throws back at us that we support legislation.  What is it that he wants?  What exactly does he want from us?  Is it to oppose everything or to support everything?  We are in opposition.  We are going to offer critical support for good measures where they make sense.  When there is a Bill that contains good stuff and bad stuff, we will support the good stuff and we will oppose the bad stuff.  That is what we are here for.  That is what we are going to do.  We are not going to hold back good things where they make sense.  We are not going to do that.</p>  <p>  I want to deal with the matter of objections.  The Minister knows for a fact, in his heart of hearts, that where policies or proposals are on the table and people vote against them because they are unaffordable, that is different from the situation where Fianna F&aacute;il councillors vote against social housing out of snobbery.  The Minister knows that is a fact across local authorities throughout the State.  In Cork City Council, Sinn F&eacute;in has never voted against social and affordable housing.  Within the past two years, every Fianna F&aacute;il councillor, including the Taoiseach's brother - and I am sure they had a conversation about it - voted against social housing on the Skehard Road.  This also happened in Kanturk and in many other places.  Let us be honest.  The Minister talks about being honest.  I know in truth where these projects are voted against, it is not out of any snobbery.  It was not bouncy castles we wanted to be built on those sites; it was houses at affordable prices.  When Fianna F&aacute;il votes them down, it is out of snobbery.  That is the truth.</p></speech>

The latest report from the RTB paints in black and white the devastating impact this Government's housing policies have had on renters, with the average new monthly rent in Dublin standing at &euro;1,972.  Rent in Dublin has increased by 100% since 2011.  It is safe to say that in my constituency of Dublin Bay South, the average monthly rent is more than &euro;2,000.  Today, I saw a three-bedroom apartment in Capital Dock advertised for &euro;5,000 a month.  That is what they are looking for.  That is complete madness.  It is unaffordable for the vast majority of working families.  In Capital Dock, those involved let some of the units lie idle rather than reduce the rent.</p>  <p>  There does not seem to be any sign of a break for renters on the horizon.  While we see large numbers of developments being built and designated as build-to-rent, the pricing of rent for one of these units is completely out of the reach of average working families.  Some 3,500 new homes are due to be built on the glass bottle site but there is no good news for those on average wages because the cost of the new homes there will be between &euro;500,000 and &euro;600,000.  The Minister mentioned social and affordable houses.  It is unclear whether there will be any social and affordable housing on the glass bottle site.  He might indicate whether that will happen.  Residents there are very concerned that there will be no social and affordable housing on the glass bottle site.  That matter needs to be addressed.  The residents need to be reassured.  The cost of those homes, at &euro;500,000 or &euro;600,000 each, will make renting in their own community unaffordable for the vast majority of young families, even for those with good or average incomes.  I know who will be able to afford them.  Senior management in the high-tech companies and the big vulture funds will be able to afford them.  Senior legal professionals will be able to afford the rent, but not ordinary working families who made Ringsend the great community that it is today.  Those who stayed when it was not a popular place rebuilt Ringsend into a vibrant community.</p></speech>

There does not seem to be an end in sight to this crisis.  Since 2011, the cost of rent in Dublin has doubled.  The average rent is now just under &euro;2,000 according to the latest RTB report.  This Government and previous governments have failed people when it comes to affordable rents.  Rent pressure zones have made little or no difference, with rents shooting up regardless.  Last night I looked on <i>daft.ie</i>for properties available to rent in the Dublin Bay North constituency.  There was no two-bedroom property available for less than &euro;2,000.  Three- and four-bedroom properties had asking prices of more than &euro;3,000.  That is utter madness.  I ask the Minister how is the average worker expected to put a roof over his or her head with these prices?</p><p>We have put a number of solutions to the Minister on various occasions.  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, has presented more to him tonight.  Our asks are simple.  They are in the interests of those who are struggling and those to whom he could provide much relief.  The Minister needs to introduce a ban on rent increases for existing and new tenancies for three years.  He also needs to put in place a refundable tax credit up to the value of a month's rent in every renter's pocket.  It is time the Minister tried something different.  His policies are not making a dent in the current crisis.  What he is doing is clearly not working.  People are suffering because of him and his Government.</p></speech>

I suppose the Minister was getting frustrated that the Deputy was doing that.  If he finds that frustrating, I dare him visit every town and village throughout this State.  He will see that there are homeless people, people languishing on housing lists, people who cannot afford to rent and people who cannot afford to buy.  If he makes such a journey, he will find out what tetchy is.  The rental crisis is continuing to escalate.  Everybody has told the Minister that.  He still sits there.  The latest RTB rent index figures show a 7.7% year-on-year rise in County Louth between quarter 4 of 2020 and quarter 4 of 2021.  Throughout the State, rents for new tenancies grew by 9% in the past three months.  The rising rents in the shrinking private rental sector is driving people into homelessness.  We are now back to pre-pandemic levels of homelessness.  In March there were more than 7,000 adults and almost 3,000 children in emergency accommodation.  That is a 5% increase on the previous month.  It is shameful that this far into a housing crisis, six years since the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, promised to remove families from emergency accommodation, we are still looking at figures like this.</p>  <p>  Every morning I come up O&rsquo;Connell Street when making my way to Leinster House.  I pass people of all ages curled up in doorways.  Last week or the week before I saw a young lady who appeared to be in her mid-20s or who might have been 30 years of age.  She looked scared, cold, hungry and absolutely miserable.</p> <p>From one end of O'Connell Street to the far end of O'Connell Bridge, on average, you could count between eight and 12 people.  That is the Government's legacy.  It is not just people who rely on State supports who are falling homeless; working people cannot afford to rent.  People who are not eligible for State housing supports are out of options now.  They cannot afford rent and while they might be able to afford a mortgage, the asking price is beyond them.  The Minister already knows that and six years' on, he has done nothing.</p> <p> When I pass those people on the street, I literally ask myself how the Government can do it.  Does the Minister really have no idea of the utter misery the Government&rsquo;s policies have inflicted on those people for years?  Does he have no idea or is it the case that he is so aloof and caught up in his bubble that he could not give a damn?  Homeless people are in every town and village across the State.</p></speech>

To be fair, I do not doubt that the Minister is doing his best.  It would be good if we could take some of the heat out of this debate because it has become quite personalised of late.  I know we all have to robustly defend our positions in this House.  That is right and proper.  However, the personalised nature of the debate does not give comfort to the people who are on the housing list in my constituency.  If I was to characterise their experience at present, it is such that, historically, if you were on a housing list you were applying for a house from a rented house or a family home and you had a guarantee of a roof over your head.  Increasingly, however, we, as public representatives, are seeing more and more people coming to us in desperation because they are being forced out of accommodation through a notice to quit and they have absolutely no place to go due to the lack of supply.  That is acknowledged.  I do not want to politicise this debate.  I acknowledge the fact that the Government is seeking to do what it can through the Housing for All policy.</p><p>One of my worries is as follows.  Let us take a town like Mitchelstown in County Cork.  It is a typical rural town that has an agricultural hinterland.  There is a phenomenal demand for housing in Mitchelstown and there is also a capacity to build houses.  In spite of the pent-up demand that exists, however, there is a major issue in terms of the ability to provide essential services such as water and waste water treatment facilities.  For a couple of years, my constituency colleagues and I have all advocated for an increase in capacity for water and waste water services because, as we speak, we cannot build houses in the town of Mitchelstown because Irish Water will tell the local authority that the capacity is not there.  It is all well and good for us to talk about the supply that is coming on stream now.  Lands are being zoned in county development plans and we are seeing, theoretically, wonderful opportunities emerging on the horizon, but the pinch point is the fact that if we do not have the capacity to deliver basic infrastructure, such as is the case in Mitchelstown, then the policy fails.</p><p>Until such time as the nettle is grasped on that issue, I suspect that towns like Mitchelstown and my native town of Mallow, where there is a strategic housing development application for 299 residential units before An Bord Plean&aacute;la with a decision date due for 23 May, will fail to provide sufficient housing.  In the event that the planning permission is granted, I guarantee that Irish Water and the local authority will turn around and say that the planning may have been received but the commencement will not be given until such time as there is capacity to deal with water and infrastructure.  If those issues were dealt with as a top priority the Minister could pick off a lot of low-hanging fruit.  He knows that anyway.  I know for a fact that he is very much aware of the infrastructural issues relating to Mitchelstown in particular.  I understand that he might visit the town in the not-too-distant future.  I ask him to use his good offices to lean in to Irish Water.  If some capacity was delivered in Mitchelstown, it would have a tremendous effect, as it would throughout the country.</p><p>We support the motion put forward by Sinn F&eacute;in.  In the few short minutes remaining, I would like to speak about the tenant <i>in situ</i>scheme advocated by the Labour Party.  I urge that we lift the cap on the ability of local authorities to purchase when there is a HAP or RAS - some people are still on the latter scheme - supported tenant <i>in situ</i>.  The limit on local authorities' buying second-hand homes and competing with first-time buyers is having consequences whereby people who are getting social housing support through HAP are then being evicted by smaller landlords who are leaving the housing market.  That has been well signalled to the Minister.  Because of these limits, there is an unintended consequence of forcing people who require social housing support into homelessness.  That is what I spoke about at the top of my intervention here tonight.  I ask the Minister to look at greater flexibility around a tenant <i>in situ</i>scheme and to allow local authorities to purchase housing where there is a tenant <i>in situ</i>getting social housing support.  I am sure the Minister will have an answer to that.  I would welcome a reply.  If he is favourable to that, it would be good.</p><p>The other point I wish to raise relates to the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe scheme.  If the Minister is responding to the debate-----</p></speech>

However, I have taken a note of Deputy Sherlock's point.</p></speech>

I want to put it on the record that I asked him about this scheme on 5 April and I received a reply from him today.  I asked the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage if he will report on a new Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund under Housing for All to increase owner-occupier apartment developments in city centres.  I know it is a city-focused scheme.  In his reply, the Minister stated his Department is currently working with the Housing Agency on finalising the operational basis for the new fund and it expects to engage with prospective proposers in the call for proposals in the second quarter of 2022.  If the Minister or his officials are listening, I would be pleased if I could get greater clarity as to when that is happening because it would facilitate a lot of accommodation opportunities over the shop or commercial premises to turn them into residential spaces.  What is not known out there is the number of schemes that are available for towns.  The biggest impediment to somebody in a town or city converting what was a commercial premises into a residential premises, where there are perhaps intergenerational owners, is that they are not going to make the leap towards converting to residential with all of the attendant grants that are available because the capital cost of doing so is still too high.  They may be asset rich but cash poor and they are at pains to take the risk of borrowing.  There are hundreds of towns throughout the country where we have lost capacity on the main street, where shops and commercial premises have closed.</p> <p>There are many people who would like to live in towns, people who are downsizing and want to be closer to services on the main street, which would free up many houses.  Yet, people do not perceive that there is anything in place for them to be able to do that.  We need more schemes that are fasttracked.  There should be a treatment in planning that could facilitate that and that could allow for better funding of it.</p> <p> On the Labour Party's Residential Tenancies (Tenants' Rights) Bill 2021, there remains a huge imbalance in power between renters and landlords.  Our Bill focuses on issues relating to quality of rental accommodation.  We need to get solid commitments when it comes to security of tenure.  That is ultimately the bedrock upon which renters&rsquo; rights are based.  I will return to the issues on which I spoke in relation to Mitchelstown and Mallow, for instance.  These are two examples of two typical towns.  The capacity constraints and the infrastructural constraints will require that more people will be in rented accommodation for longer.  That market trend for rent is going upwards.  The housing assistance payment, HAP, is not meeting pace with demand.  There needs to be a rights-based approach for tenants for the duration of this housing crisis.  That is what we advocated for in that Bill.  I ask that that Bill would be looked at again.</p></speech>

There is a problem with some politicians and some public representatives opposing housing.  There could be other instances, but I am only aware of one where councillors voted to de-zone land that was earmarked and needed for social housing.  We all know that it is needed, because of the crisis we are in and because of the huge increases in homelessness.  There was a 22% increase in homelessness in the last year.  There was a 30% increase in the number of children who are homeless in the last 12 months.  I am only aware of one instance, which happened recently in South Dublin.  A thin majority of councillors voted to de-zone residentially-zoned land that was earmarked specifically for social housing.  It was needed for social housing.  It would have provided 100 social homes.  I call on the Minister and on every Minister to call on their Government councillors in south Dublin, from Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, who voted to de-zone these residential lands that had been earmarked for social housing, to reverse that decision.  They can do that as it has not yet bedded in as it is part of the draft development plan.  The Government should show leadership in that by calling on its councillors to act in the right, responsible way and to re-zone those residential lands that were earmarked and needed for social housing.  If that call was made publicly, it would be very useful.  It would show good leadership on this.</p>  <p>  I want to talk about the human cost of the rental crisis.  I will give one example of how this is affecting people.  One of the costs is that when renters are in terrible conditions they do not have the choice and ability to move out and find somewhere better to live because things are so constrained at the moment.  Recently, my office has been helping one group of renters who have been in terrible conditions.  They would like to move out and rent somewhere else if there was choice, affordability and availability.  However, they cannot.  This group of renters lives in a rental building with different units in it.  It is owned by one landlord.  They were living without hot water for three months over the winter, including over the Christmas period.  They then, within their rights, took a case to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, about this.  The tenants do not have the address of the landlord, which creates a particular difficulty for the Residential Tenancies Board in following up on this.  The Residential Tenancies Board says it is limited in what they it can do in trying to assert the tenants' rights.  They ring the landlord because they have a phone number.  However, as soon as the landlord realises who it is, the landlord hangs up.  Because the tenants do not have the address of the landlord, the RTB says there is not a lot more it can do to proceed with the case.</p>  <p>  It does not end there.  In retaliation for the tenants starting this case with Residential Tenancies Board, the apparent landlord or their agent entered the property, shut off the electricity, ripped the curtains off the wall and destroyed the bathrooms to the extent that there is no functioning toilet or shower.  This is all on video.  The landlord also left a note to the tenants which confirmed that the electricity would be switched back on if they dropped their case with the Residential Tenancies Board.  All of this is happening while the tenants are holding down stressful and demanding jobs in key industries where we need them to work.  This is what they have to come home to every evening.</p>  <p>  A common loophole that some of the most exploited tenants face is that they are not in possession of the landlord&rsquo;s address and the RTB saying there is little it can do.  I know from speaking to people with experience in Threshold that this has caused problems for many people.  Some of the worst landlords and offenders are exploiting this loophole.  Obviously, for more responsible landlords this will not be an issue.  I call on the Minister to do what he can to shut down this legal loophole as quickly as possible so that tenants can no longer be exploited because of this.  We should have zero tolerance for this gross exploitation of renters by a minority of landlords who are using this loophole to flout the law.</p>  <p>  The Social Democrats is happy to support this motion.  We thank Deputy &Oacute; Broin for highlighting it.  New rents have increased by 9% over the last 12 months on average.  However, it has been far worse in some areas.  One of the effects of this has been an increase in homelessness.  I echo the comments that were made in the Chamber earlier today.  When we are talking about homelessness and the cause of homelessness, we need to be very careful and responsible in the language that we use.  I call on the Minister to reflect on the comments he made on radio during the weekend.  He should be very careful not to be deflecting-----</p></speech>

Behind these numbers are individuals and families who are struggling to maintain some semblance of normality and routine.  They are doing their best to keep up the school routine for their children, despite living miles away from school in emergency accommodation.  They are living miles away from jobs and in emergency accommodation where they do not feel safe.</p>  <p>  Of course, we should have the same standards for all providers of emergency accommodation, whether these providers are not-for-profit or private.  We should have HIQA inspections to ensure that proper standards are in place.  The shocking figures relating to the increase in homelessness in the last 12 months show not only a Government that is failing to stem the rising tide of homelessness, house price increases and rents; they also show a Government whose housing policies are failing.  To see an example of that, we need to look no further than how the Government is failing to miss its targets for building social, affordable and cost-rental homes.</p>  <p>  In 2021, we were promised 9,000 direct-build social homes by the Government.  Instead, the figure that was delivered was in the region of 5,000.  Most of these were turnkey purchases.  There were just 1,726 direct builds.  We were promised just 350 cost rental homes, only 65 of which were tenanted and fully delivered last year.  We were promised thousands of affordable homes through various initiatives last year and zero were delivered.</p>  <p>  We are seeing build-to-rent becoming the dominant supply of new housing, especially in Dublin.  Some 82% of all residential schemes that had been applied for, or that were granted planning permission, according to analysis carried out with the executive of Dublin City Council in 2020, were build-to-rent schemes.</p> <p>Despite this, the Planning Regulator is telling Dublin City Council it must drop its plans to curtail build to rent as this conflicts with national policy.  Let us be very clear, under this Government, build to rent and investment funds are dominating and controlling the supply of new homes to the detriment of new and affordable supply for individuals.  This has been borne out by the analysis done by Mr. Mel Reynolds and Dr. Lorcan Sirr, which shows the amount of new and affordable homes available for individual purchase fell last year and was at its lowest level in years at under 6,000.  This is what is happening under this Government.</p> <p> We are seeing a growing number of people stuck with renting who would like to be able to afford to buy their own homes.  We are seeing house prices about to reach record levels, surpassing their Celtic tiger peak.  Home ownership levels are in free fall under this Government and home ownership among adults at prime working age between 25 to 54 has collapsed, according to the Parliamentary Budget Office.  Since 2012, we have seen wages grow by 23% while house prices have increased by 77%.  In fact, since the 1980s, average house prices have increased by 230% in real terms after adjusting for inflation.  The average age of a person who leaves home in Ireland is now 28.  If we go back to the early 1990s, two thirds of people aged 28 owned their own homes.  </p> <p>Renters cannot continue to pay more and more.  We have some of the highest rents in the European Union that are a major cost to individuals and families and also have a significant economic cost.  We need a radical increase in the supply of cost rental and affordable homes to meet the housing needs of people as well as a ban on rent increases and improvements in security of tenure for renters. </p></speech>

We can bandy around alternative policies and plans until the cows come home but seeing is believing.  I want the Government to understand, if it does not already, that the situation has got decisively worse in the past few months.  It needs to grasp that.  There is real human misery.  I emphasise that worsening situation predates the significant arrival of Ukrainian refugees, the outbreak of the war and Putin's brutal invasion.  It was getting very significantly worse and towards the end of last year things started to get very bad again.  There had been a temporary break during the Covid pandemic because of the eviction ban and the temporary freeze in rent increases.  That actually made a difference.  It did not solve the problem but it started to improve things.  The numbers going into homelessness were falling because evictions were banned.</p><p>I want to plead with the Government at present.  The main reason people come into my clinic, are facing and then end up in emergency accommodation and, increasingly, are people who are working, have jobs and families and end up in homeless accommodation, is because they are evicted by landlords on grounds of sale.  That is why they get evicted.  If the Government stopped that, as it did during Covid, it would stop people going into homelessness.  I am pleading with the Government to do that.  It did not solve all of the problem but it had an impact and since the Government removed that measure the situation has got worse again.  Since rents were allowed to increase, it has got worse.</p><p>If someone is in that situation where his or her landlord is selling up and the eviction of that person is allowed, he or she has to look for a rent that is affordable.  If the Minister of State goes on <i>daft.ie</i>any day of the week, he will see I am not exaggerating in saying that, in my area, he will not find anything costing less than &euro;2,200 a month.  Seriously, that is not affordable by about 80% to 90% of working people.  It is completely not at the races.  People are goosed if they are looking for accommodation at that level of rent.  They are facing despair.  That is what people are feeling because there is nowhere to go. </p><p>When they go to the council, they are told they are not allowed look for anything costing more than &euro;1,950 because of the housing assistance payment, HAP, limit.  That is the highest they can get and before that, if they are not on the homeless HAP rate, the highest they can look for is, I think, &euro;1,250.  Imagine how hopeless it is for people checking <i>daft.ie </i>or <i>myhome.ie</i>who are told they are not allowed look for a place that costs any more than &euro;1,250 when everything costs &euro;2,200.  They can only get the homeless HAP rate weeks before actually becoming physically homeless.  That is another thing I appeal to the Minister of State to change; once people have a notice to quit, give them the homeless HAP rate to give them some chance.  They still do not really have a chance but they have some outside chance.  They might find the needle in the haystack if they get the homeless HAP rate.</p><p>The Government has got to do something because it is just not fair.  It is mental torture to say to people they have to find a HAP tenancy because there has been no social housing for 15 or 20 years and there is no social house for them, and that they are not allowed look for anything more than &euro;1,950 if they are on the brink of being homeless, when there is nothing available for less than &euro;2,200.  That is mental torture.  That is what the Government is doing to people with families, children and so on.  If they do not find somewhere, which we know they will not, in one case they are going into a hostel in town when one child is going to school in Ballybrack and another is going to school in Shankill.  That family will be in a hostel in Gardiner Street.  Give me a break.  That is torture.  It is abuse of those children to put them in that situation but that is what is going on.  We have to do something about that.</p><p>I am not in favour of giving loads of HAP money to these landlords but, to be honest, the HAP rates have to be raised to at least the levels of the rents that are around.  That has to be done otherwise people have no chance whatsoever.  I agree with Deputy Sherlock, and I have also made the point, that if people are about to be evicted from a HAP tenancy the council should step in and buy the place immediately.  The council is inflicting suffering on itself by evicting people in that situation because they will be knocking on the door of the council saying, &quot;Will you please give me somewhere to live?&quot;, when they are evicted from a HAP tenancy.  How long has the review of income thresholds been going on for now?  Is it five, six or seven years?  I know of one woman, as does Deputy &Oacute; Broin, working for a State agency who has spent three and a half years in emergency accommodation and is no longer entitled to income support or HAP support because she has just gone over the threshold.  That is now happening to people all the time.  They are completely banjaxed because their income will not allow them to afford anything.  They will not even get HAP, never mind a social housing unit, and they could potentially be, and some are, evicted from homeless accommodation.  It is just unbelievable.</p><p>This goes slightly further than Sinn F&eacute;in's motion, which I support, but could we possibly do what the French have just done?  They have brought in a body that will set rents in each area at a level that is affordable and based on people's incomes.  The French have just done it because all the other measures were not working.  I propose we do the same.</p></speech>

Many of these families are ending up in emergency accommodation, including the family hubs.  Some time ago, People Before Profit Councillor Hazel Norton reached out to families in one of these hubs in Dublin and was shocked to be told that residents were only allowed out three nights per month, had to ask in advance to do so and had to be home by 10 p.m.  Last weekend, journalist Mr. Martin Beanz Warde, interviewed two young single mothers in a hub elsewhere in the country.  The young women said they felt they were constantly being watched.  They said that if they came to their front doors at night, when their children were asleep, they were told they were neglecting to supervise their children and warned they could be reported to Tusla.  They said that if they called into a neighbour's house at night, they were immediately phoned and told to go back to their own places.  Mr. Warde highlighted reports of security checks with flashlights and residents constantly being told by staff that this was not their home.</p> <p> There is a history of rotten and misogynistic treatment of women in institutions in this State.  Look at the mother and baby homes and Magdalen laundries.  I could be all night listing them.  People know the story.  This journalist, it seems to me, is asking the question as to whether some of the spirit of that tradition lives on today in some of the State's homeless services and family hubs.  That is a legitimate question to ask.  I look forward to hearing the other interviews he conducted, which he will post on social media during May.  Any person who has experienced poor treatment of this kind is free to contact my office.  I advise the Minister to keep an eye out for this issue.  I suspect that this may not be the last we hear of it.  </p> <p> At the weekend, I went on a housing protest march and the Cork May Day march.  I spoke to housing activists about this debate.  An anti-dereliction campaigner asked me to say that 90,000 homes were identified as vacant by GeoDirectory with the addresses known.  Surely these are ideal for compulsory rental.  Some 22,000 homes were identified as derelict.  Given their addresses are known, surely these homes are ideal for compulsory sale.  Revenue has the owner details.  Why can this not happen now?</p> <p> An organiser with Community Action Tenants Union, CATU, Nora Labo, asked me to highlight that people are automatically removed from the housing list when they go on to HAP.  Many of those who are evicted after a year on the HAP scheme find out only then that they are no longer on the housing list.  There are more points I would like to make on that issue but I have gone over my time.  I will return to this issue soon in future debates.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-04a.499" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1600" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="20:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050400044#SS00200"><p>In recent years, I have raised the rising cost of rent and property and the lack of rental properties.  Trying to find a property in my area is like looking for hen's teeth.  The problem is countrywide and affects every county.  In my home town of Dundalk the rental cost of a standard three-bedroom house is between &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,600 a month.  It is much more that someone would have to pay for a mortgage for the same property.  Why are the tenants paying these rents not able to get a mortgage for the same property?  This is one of the main reasons for the crisis we are in and it makes no sense.  It is not fair and needs to be addressed.</p>  <p>  New homes and apartments are still being purchased in bulk by real estate investment trusts and institutional investors.  This is a major problem.  Ordinary people trying to bid for a new house have no chance.  This is driving up the prices of houses, which, in turn, is driving up the cost of renting.  High prices relative to incomes are pushing potential buyers out of the market and into rental accommodation, which is pushing up demand.  People come to my constituency office and tell me they would be better off on social welfare.  They pay between &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,600 on rent.  These people are working and want to work but they come home with a salary of between &euro;25,000 or &euro;30,000 after they have paid their taxes and universal social charge.  They are left with nothing after rent.  They cannot afford to put food on the table or clothes on their children's backs and they have no help with their rent because local authorities have not changed the housing list thresholds for the past ten years.  That is not fair.  If people in that position gave up their jobs tomorrow morning, they would get &euro;1,320 in HAP towards their rent.  They would get medical cards and everything else they would be entitled to and their rent would cost them only &euro;50 per week or &euro;100 per month instead of &euro;1,600 per month.  It would, therefore, make sense.</p>  <p>   The overarching goal of housing policy should be affordability, sustainability, equality and social inclusion.  The high cost of housing can lead to deprivation, exclusion and poverty at household level and low levels of consumption and economic growth at national level.  The standard of rental properties is poor.  Landlords refuse to carry out repairs and if tenants complain, they are asked to leave the property.  If they do not pay their rent, they are evicted from the property.  It is impossible to get a rental property for a family.  Many families in my area are moving back to live with their parents.  Some are sleeping on sofas.  It is either sleep on the sofa or go on the homeless list.</p>  <p>  The Minister is always looking for solutions.  I propose that he put in place support to increase the supply of housing through affordable rent and purchase.  There are various ways of achieving that.  There is an untapped supply of vacant and derelict housing throughout the country, in both rural and urban areas.  According to the GeoDirectory residential buildings report, there are more than 90,000 vacant dwellings across the country.  Every year, up to 4,500 people leave behind an empty home when they go into long-term nursing home care, yet just 400 of these homes are subsequently rented out.  The nursing home support scheme, fair deal, charges older persons three separate times if they decide to rent out their home.  The Government needs to reform the fair deal scheme to remove the financial barrier to renting out properties, thereby releasing vacant family homes in cities, towns and rural areas.</p>  <p>  The Government also needs to do something for older people.  For example, it should develop clustered bungalow housing close to services, which would allow older people to downsize and free up family homes.</p>  <p>  The Government also needs to establish a framework for the supply and installation of prefabricated 3D volumetric modular homes which can significantly reduce the construction time for social and affordable housing.  It also needs to review the housing grant limit in light of rising construction costs.  It needs to address supply-side constraints, including skilled labour shortages, rising costs of construction, including materials, and excessive lead-in times, which are limiting the development of affordable new dwellings.  In my constituency, all that families want is a home for their families. Whether it is through buying, renting or living in social houses, they want stability.  They want their families to feel safe and their children to be able to play with their friends.  Everyone deserves a home.  There is a shortage of housing which needs to be addressed as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  We need rent freezes with no loopholes for investment companies. We need stronger powers for the Residential Tenancy Board, including the power to spot-check residential properties, and we need confirmation that retrofitting and substantial renovations will be removed as a reason to evict.</p>  <p>  Everyone needs a home.  Last week, when I spoke at Leaders&rsquo; Questions, I was given a commitment from the Taoiseach that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, would contact me about vacant properties in the Dundalk area.  I have yet to hear from the Minister.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State would ask the Minister to contact me.</p></speech>

I would have liked the Minister to be here to listen to what I have to say.</p>  <p>  I have previously made statements about housing that may have fallen on deaf ears.  I have just come from a meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight at which I raised an issue with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe.  He does not agree with me that we should support first-time buyers or homeowners who want to buy second-hand or derelict houses.  We might disagree but the Minister has made no progress in trying to get these houses occupied.</p>  <p>  I heard the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage talking last week about Ukrainian refugees coming into the country and what would have to be done in the immediate, short, medium and long term to try and help them, and rightly so.  He talked about introducing emergency legislation to deal with planning.  If he is to do that, let him do it for everyone.</p>  <p>  A survey by the Northern and Western Regional Assembly identified some 45,000 vacant houses in the northern and western area.  If half of those properties were put into use as homes, we would make progress.  One of our biggest problems is a deficit in infrastructure to enable houses to be built.  In my constituency, many towns and villages are effectively locked out of development for the simple reason that they do not have a municipal waste treatment plant.  Galway County Council will not give planning permission and An Bord Plean&aacute;la will refuse to give planning permission, which means we cannot build.  Craughwell, Abbeyknockmoy and Corofin have development land right in the centre of the village but development is deemed to be premature until a municipal treatment plant is put in place.  As a result, we end up with nothing happening in these areas.   At the same time as we are trying to prohibit people from building in rural areas, we cannot build in towns.  What do we do?  One proposal from my local authority is that we build houses in clusters of five.</p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>We would have a small hamlet of five houses in some place - we do not yet know where - with their own individual septic tanks to try to get over the issue of not having a municipal wastewater treatment plant.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, might have something to say about us putting septic tanks in our towns and villages instead of building wastewater treatment plants.  It is important we do things in a joined-up way.</p> <p> Rents are rising all over the place because we do not have the supply coming on.  We hear talk that this year housing starts are up and are very near targets, or whatever.  They are not really being delivered in the places they need to be delivered in.  Many of these houses are being delivered as social housing for the local authorities, which is fine, though not enough are being delivered.  However, what about the people who want to build their own houses, get a mortgage and could take over an existing property and do it up?</p> <p> The HAP scheme is not working properly.  One of the things that has not been said tonight is if you have a landlord who rents his or her second house and the tenant does not pay the rent, then all the rent is stopped.  Therefore, the landlord is left without any rent either.  We need to ensure tenants and landlords are treated properly and fairly when houses are in the HAP system.  Constituents have told me they cannot find a HAP house because when they go into the letting agent, they are told the agent's clients will not take HAP because they are afraid of it.  We must ensure whatever system we have in place is fair to both.  We need to look at this in such a way that we are providing houses.  At this stage we have an emergency.  We should short-circuit the planning on a temporary basis for the next two to three years to give us a chance to build something rather than be engaged in the planning, with An Bord Plean&aacute;la, with judicial reviews and with all that kind of a charade without actually building houses.  We also need to remove all these procurement gateway approvals that have to be given before houses can be built in the public sector.  It is incredible the way it is going on at the moment.</p> <p> I hope the Minister of State takes on board some of what I am saying I thank the Acting Chair for her indulgence.</p></speech>

I declare an interest in this whole matter but I feel I am very well equipped to talk about it because I see the problem as being the demonisation of people who have property to rent out.  That is not an answer to the problem.  We must try to ensure there is enough availability of the product.  If we do not have enough of the product and it is scarce, people will not have the properties to rent.  Not every Deputy would be willing to stand in the D&aacute;il and say this because they would nearly be afraid to, but last night I spoke to one of the finest developers we have ever had in this country, who has been building homes for between 40 and 50 years, probably.  He is a highly respectable individual.  He told me that when we are at a stage when the garda and the nurse cannot afford to buy a house anywhere in this country, we are in serious trouble.  He said the Government must be willing to sit down with people like him.  He meant the developers and the builders, who are not bad people but people who have the brains to borrow money and the ability to acquire land and provide homes.  However, they are not allowed to do so because everything is set up against them.  With all due respect to people who talk about developers and property owners and so on, they talk as if there is something wrong with them.  For God's sake, there is nothing in the world wrong with a builder.  We had small builders, medium builders and big builders and we do not have any of them now because the sums simply do not add up for them and they are demonised for doing what they doing.  I wanted to put that on the record.</p></speech>

We have parties on the left, and some on the middle left, that are demonising landlords.  Some landlords are accidental landlords and never wanted to be.  We cannot keep demonising the developers, builders and others as bad people.  There were some rogues but there are bad apples in every area.  All day today and yesterday people were demonising the sisters who provided the maternity care in this country for generations.  Now we want to demonise them.  We are getting a 300-year lease.  Where would you get the like of it?  Do we want to pay the going rate for it?  If we do, we should buy the land.</p>  <p>  Getting back to housing, the same people are objecting to this and objecting to that and demonising the landlords.  We must have the people with the wherewithal to borrow and the brains to finance this.  They have the brains and skills and are able to build the houses.  We must deliver more housing; it is as simple as that.  There must be private housing.  The local authorities are not building the houses.  They fell off the cliff long ago when it comes to providing housing.  We must go back to that but we must also support the small builders.  N&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.  We must allow people build houses of their own.  We must bring down rents that way because when the commodity is scarce, the cost goes up and up and up.</p>  <p>  We have passed more regulations in here in the last ten years, and I did five years on the housing committee, and all we were doing is passing legislation making it more difficult and more people who provided houses and flats were getting out of the land.  We closed all the bedsits in Dublin.  Would many people not be glad of them now?  We closed all of them with mad legislation too.  We do not think beyond our nose, beyond the Pale or beyond what we are doing today and the implications this legislation and these rules are having.  It is time we had a wake-up call in this House as well.</p></speech>

Yesterday, I received an email from a man living in Clonakilty informing me of some steep rent increases that have been imposed on tenants in the last few days in an estate in Clonakilty.  They were all informed their rents were rising by 25% and were given three months&rsquo; notice to get their heads around this increase.  This man and his wife work full-time but they are finding the cost of living very hard to cope with.  This added increase in rent, which adds up to &euro;3,000 extra per year, makes it impossible for them to continue in their home.  In the middle of a national cost-of-living crisis, there are landlords hiking up the rent and taking advantage of the demand for housing.  This man would be very angry but he says he does not have time as he must now try to find somewhere for himself and his wife and children to live.  This morning I received an email from a man asking for my help as he has nowhere to live in west Cork and is staying in his car.  Unfortunately, that is what I find at my clinics every Friday, Saturday and Monday.  It is the same crisis.  People say they have not anywhere to stay and they are staying in their cars.  As I said, at clinics I have families coming in to me begging for help with rent, HAP, accommodation and housing.</p>  <p>  Those lucky enough to get this once-off, farcical planning permission, given the way things are gone, are then left with the building costs that are crippling Ireland.  The price of materials is crippling everyone and even if the client can pay it is hard to get your hands on the materials.  The Government stands by and issues press release after press release and statements that come one after the other on what is being done to fix the housing crisis in Ireland.  It would do well to remember every policy taken so far has failed.  This is why we are where we are today.  The unfortunate thing I find in my constituency is so many people getting eviction letters.  I do not want to tar every landlord with the one brush because some of them are very good and have been very fair to tenants down through the years.  However, there is a crisis out there and it must be addressed.</p></speech>

The cost of rent is exorbitant in Kerry as well, in places like Killarney, Tralee and Dingle.  It is also hard to find places to rent because there is no availability.  While I, like everyone else, welcome the Ukrainian people here, we need to be inventive about where we can house them because we certainly cannot lose.  There are people on Kerry who have been on the list, like youngsters I know, for 15 or 16 years and still have not got a house.  We need to be more inventive.  There are places like St. Finan's Hospital.  There are vacant houses around.  The Minister of State should delegate the local authority to send out people to investigate why houses are empty or if there could be a deal done with them.  Some people are coming forward but they do not know who to come forward to.</p> <p>There is no direct line they can contact.  Already, our hotels and guesthouses are full.  It will jeopardise our tourism product.  We cannot ask our people on the housing list to wait any longer.</p> <p> Landlords are selling up and getting out of the business because they are paying 52% tax.  The number of voids, according to Kerry County Council, is at an unacceptable level.  The local authority states the tenant purchase scheme used to generate money for the local authority to do up houses, but tenants cannot purchase houses until they are tenants for more than ten years.  That is unacceptable.</p></speech>

That cap should have been increased because students are facing a crisis in terms of spiralling rents.  That was definitely a missed opportunity by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and I want to put that on the record.</p>  <p>  We have a crisis with rent.  There is no longer any doubt we are in a state of complete and overwhelming emergency when it comes to our housing needs and the inability of people to pay rent.</p>  <p>  It is simply incredible to think the average rent nationally now stands at &euro;1,516 per month.  As I understand it, that is a spike of 6.8% and marks the 36th consecutive quarter where rents are higher than they were in the previous 12 months.</p>  <p>  Our recent analysis of trends in the Irish residential sales market shows the biggest year-on-year increases in the State are in my county of Offaly, where it is up almost 18%.  The designation of Tullamore as a rent pressure zone provided limited support and limited financial certainty to tenants in the medium to long term.  That was badly needed because, at the time, the latest figures from the Residential Tenancies Board rent index showed an increase of almost 10% in Laois and 6% in Offaly.  That meant many of my constituents in Tullamore, Edenderry and Portlaoise were paying at least &euro;1,000 every month before the current crisis erupted.</p>  <p>  We need to take urgent action here.  We have a deep crisis but I also call on the Government to look at the issue around the cap on students' earnings to allow them that little bit of flexibility to pay the spiralling rents.</p></speech>

However, we are truly at a crisis now and I cannot stress enough the urgency of the matter.</p><p>The situation for renters is truly shocking at present.  Failed housing policies have created generation rent, who do not have the option to buy their own home and, as a result, are being forced into the rental sector.  With a significant reduction in rental properties available and with the price of those few properties skyrocketing, people have been left abandoned with literally nowhere to go.  It is clear the Government's two recent rent caps are not working.  None of the Government's policies are working.  How many different ways must this be pointed out before it is finally accepted?</p><p>We have had discussion after discussion in this House, stating the same over and over again, but nothing seems to be getting through and the people are starting to lose hope.  We have watched rent report after rent report come out over recent months outlining the exact same sad reality: rent is rising, Government policy is not working and something needs to be done now.</p><p>The latest report, the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, rent index mentioned in this motion, shows new rents have increased by 9% State-wide in the last three months of 2021.  The index showed that, in my constituency of Donegal, rents for new tenancies have increased by a massive 16.6%.  We have seen the recent <i>daft.ie</i>report which showed that overall rents increased in Donegal by an astonishing 24.3%, the highest rise in rent nationally.</p><p>Week after week I have people in my constituency office in dire situations, unable to afford to buy but unable to find the rent either.  I have seen families unable to meet the rising costs of living and struggling to hold on to their homes.  I have seen young people forced to put their life on hold, with many not seeing any hope of ever living independently in the foreseeable future.  I have seen people nearing retirement age, worried about how they will continue to make rent payments once they take a dip in income.  I have seen mica families paying mortgages on crumbling houses while trying to come up with rent money on top of this.  Yet we see that Airbnb has grown exponentially in the county.  Nothing has been done with enforcement so that Airbnb properties will be rental properties for citizens.</p><p>As a board member of the North West Simon Community, I have seen, sadly, the shocking rise of homelessness in my region, which does not even take into account the incredible number of those in hidden homelessness across Donegal.  In a single week in March, 97 individuals in the north west were provided with emergency accommodation.  This included 62 single adults and 13 families comprising 15 adults and 20 child dependants.  These are only the people who come to the service.  I am not talking about those who are couch surfing or anything like that who are not included in any of the figures the Government talks about.</p><p>There is no justifying the situation.  No child should ever have to face homelessness.  The State has failed these families.  We should all feel ashamed when hearing these statistics because the truth is these are not just statistics; this is real life and real people.  They should be treated with respect and with dignity and not as another number on yet another homelessness report.</p><p>Where is the compassion of this Government?  Where is the empathy for our constituents who are literally pleading for help?  It gives me no joy to stand here and relay these stories and statistics to the Minister of State.  It should not have to be done.  The people of Donegal and Ireland deserve so much better than this.  We should not have to do it repeatedly before it will sink in.</p></speech>

We have a Minister who thinks it is a debating competition and scoring points across the floor at Sinn F&eacute;in in a manner that is not befitting the D&aacute;il when we have a housing crisis.</p>  <p>  One can quote any report.  There are many.  I am taking the Simon report because Simon has consistently done a snapshot every quarter over a number of days.  Their latest one, in March, told us this is the 25th snapshot study.  The Minister stood here and told us all of the facts, that things were improving.</p>  <p>  The March 2022 Locked Out of the Market report shows yet another stark decline in the availability of affordable properties.  The report goes on to mention, in particular, the end of Covid-enforced renter restrictions having a particular bearing.  It states, "The private rental market is affected by an ongoing contraction in supply, increase in rental prices, and an overall lack of affordability", and "There was a strong decrease in the number of properties available to rent within the standard or discretionary HAP rates."</p>  <p>  The report looks at Galway city and Galway county.  In Galway city, there were seven properties available for rent.  Not a single one of them came under the housing assistance payment, HAP, criteria.  There were no properties affordable under the standard or the discretionary HAP rates for any of the households examined.  There was only one property available to rent during the study period, at &euro;1,430 a month - a one-bedroom property.  Rents for three bedrooms ranged from &euro;2,440 to &euro;2,875.  I wish I had more time to repeat the figures because they are stark and they make a mockery of what the Minister has told us.</p>  <p>  Rents in Galway county rose at an extraordinary rate of 19%.  That was up 122.9% from the trough.  In Galway city, ours rose by 8.8%.  While it might seem a little smaller, it was 115.5% from the trough.</p>  <p>  Homelessness has increased in Galway.  We have 280 adults in official homeless emergency accommodation.  The figure nationally is, once again, approaching 10,000.</p> <p>I am absolutely at my wit's end walking in Dublin and Galway and seeing people on the street when we are spending billions on a housing policy that is not relieving the situation but adding to it.  I say that because at a conservative estimate, more than &euro;1 billion per year is going straight into landlords' pockets.  Never in my life have I decried landlords because we need them.  We certainly need small builders.  I have a conflict here because my father was a small builder in the past, among the many jobs he had.  We need more small builders.  What is absent here is a recognition that the Government is ideologically committed to the market to the point where it is putting billions into the private market to keep rents artificially high.  The consequence of that is homelessness, high rents and a continuous lack of security for people.  It is impossible for anybody in that situation to participate in democracy, make their views known or look after their children.  The most crucial and fundamental thing is security of tenure in a house.  A government, whoever is in government, has to commit to being in the market.  It has to be i l&aacute;r an aonaigh, in the middle of the market, providing public housing with absolutely no division between public housing, private housing and cost rental.  There should be no such division.</p> <p> There has been a housing task force in Galway for years and I have not seen a single report that has analysed the cause of the problem in Galway.  In my limited experience, which was 17 years on a local council, I saw what was happening.  From 2009, not a single public house was constructed.  I repeat that not one single public house was constructed in Galway.  All of the eggs went into the basket of the housing assistance payment, HAP.  We were told in plain English that HAP was the only game in town.  I saw a crisis build up year after year and it is still building up.  The only difference is that we are now putting more money in for the wrong reasons.</p> <p> Where is the audit from the Land Development Agency?  It was set up on a non-statutory basis prior to the legislation and one of its first tasks was to give us an audit of all the public land available.</p> <p> In the last minute of my available time, I am going to once again highlight that Galway city, one of the five cities destined to see an increase in population of 50%, has no plan for the common good.  We have developers developing Ceannt Station.  We have developers developing the docks, with a view to selling off property.  There are other developments near the university and there is no overall plan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-04a.515" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="20:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050400047#VV00200"><p>I thank Deputies for contributing to this debate and the discussion of the rental sector.  I look forward to the real changes that Housing for All will make for landlords and tenants alike.  However, the motion generally addresses the RTB-ESRI rent index as published last week and calls for a number of actions from Government which have been debated numerous times in both Houses.</p><p>The Government's counter-motion outlines achievements to date and the plans that are in train through Housing for All.  The Government's housing plan to 2030, Housing for All, is a multi-annual, multi-billion euro plan which will improve Ireland's housing system and deliver more homes of all types for people with different housing needs.  The Government believes that everybody should have access to good quality housing to purchase or rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard and located close to essential services, offering a high quality of life.  </p><p>As we can see, real progress is being made.  The latest figures for housing completions and building commencements indicate strong construction activity and increased housing supply, which is critical to alleviating pressure.  In the year to March 2022, 22,004 units were commenced outside Dublin, up 78% on the number of units commenced in the year to March 2021.  Some 1,842 units were commenced in Dublin, which is an increase of 139% on the same period to March 2021.  The Land Development Agency is advancing plans for thousands of cost rental homes on its portfolio of lands.  Cost rental delivery is being rapidly ramped up to provide 18,000 homes over the course of the Housing for All plan at an average of 2,000 per year.  </p><p>Over the past two years, the Government has not been found wanting when it comes to protecting renters, nor will it be going forward.  It introduced a ban on evictions in all but limited circumstances in order to mitigate, where practicable, the effect and spread of Covid-19, introduced enhanced protections for tenants economically impacted by the pandemic, extended rent pressure zones to the end of 2024, restricted upfront payments by tenants to one month's rent and one month's deposit, capped rent increases at 2% per annum where inflation is higher and will introduce, from June, tenancies of unlimited duration.</p><p>In the time I have remaining, I will address some of the other topics which were raised in today's motion.  The RTB rent index for quarter 4 2021 was published on 27 April 2022 and showed that, year on year, new rents increased nationally by 9%.  The growth rate was higher than that of the previous quarter, when it was 8.8%, and was the highest since quarter 4 of 2017, which recorded a growth of 9.3%.  It should be noted that the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic were still strongly impacting the rental sector during the fourth quarter of 2020, the comparison period.  The national standardised average rent remained static in quarter 4 of 2020 and overall there had been a significant trend of moderation in rental inflation relative to previous years.  The annual increase of 2.7% in 2020 represented the lowest annual increase in rent levels since 2012.</p><p>I also note that the analysis carried out by the ESRI and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, published earlier this month, suggested that ongoing pressures in the general housing market and the robust macroeconomic recovery would mean that without rent pressure zones, rental inflation would be notably higher.  </p><p>The Government is committed to supporting the continued participation of small-scale landlords in the rental market.  The management of tax issues is a matter for the Department of Finance and under Housing for All, a specific action has been set for that Department to review the policy options proposed by the 2017 working group on the tax and fiscal treatment of landlords.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, working in collaboration with the RTB, will assist the Department of Finance in carrying out this review in quarter 3 of this year.  </p><p>The review of taxation of rental income will take account of the trends in landlords exiting the private rental sector.  The aim is to ensure that the residential rental sector represents a viable investment option within a stable regulatory environment, with a fair and effective balancing of tenant and landlord rights and responsibilities.  </p><p>The exiting of small landlords from the private rental sector is a consequence of multiple factors.  A changing regulatory environment which has been necessary to ensure a fair and effective residential rental sector that balances tenants' rights and landlords' responsibilities has resulted in a challenging compliance framework for some.  The recent rise in house prices has also prompted some landlords to sell their rental properties in the absence of negative equity.  Some of the key findings from the RTB rental sector survey published last year included that, of the landlords surveyed, only one in five acquired the rental property with a buy-to-let mortgage, while 54% acquired it with an owner-occupier mortgage and one in ten inherited the property.  Most became landlords ten to 15 years ago, during the Celtic tiger era, and 60% previously lived in the property they rent out.  All of this would appear to strongly support the anecdotal reports of accidental landlords as key players in the sector heretofore.</p><p>Any measures such as a rent freeze that impacts private property rights requires detailed consideration and scrutiny, having regard to the provisions of Article 43 of the Constitution and the associated legal complexities.  The current rent pressure zone arrangements, under which the rent increases are capped at 2% <i>pro rata</i>where inflation is higher, were introduced as a balanced set of arrangements which recognised the need to intervene in situations of high and significantly increasing rents while at the same time taking account of constitutional property rights and the need to avoid disincentivising the provision of rental properties.  The Government needs to strike a balance between restricting the level of rents tenants are paying and keeping ordinary landlords in the system.  It is unclear how the motion as drafted would reconcile the desire to freeze rents for tenants while simultaneously seeking measures to stop the exit of landlords from the market.  A blanket rent freeze will simply not grow or maintain the supply of much-needed accommodation in the rental market.  It is highly likely that a blanket ban on rent increases for a significant duration would be the subject of legal challenge and would almost certainly deter continued investment in the rental accommodation market.</p> <p> Regarding a tax credit for renters, the matters raised in the motion have arisen before now.  The previous tax relief in respect of rent paid was abolished in the 2011 budget and it is no longer available to those who commenced renting for the first time from 8 December 2010.  This followed a recommendation in a 2009 report by the Commission on Taxation that rent relief be discontinued.  The view of this independent commission was that, in the same manner in which mortgage interest relief increases the cost of housing, rent relief increases the cost of private rental accommodation.  Accordingly, the result of reintroducing this relief would be a transfer of Exchequer funds directly to landlords, which would not have the intended effect of reducing pressure on tenants.  Pumping more money into the rental sector in a way that will just inflate prices will not help renters.</p> <p> In order to ensure the RTB is fully resourced to deliver on its every-increasing mandate, &euro;11 million current funding was secured for the RTB's operational costs in 2021, which is an additional &euro;2 million on the previous year's funding of &euro;9 million.  Some &euro;11 million current funding has also been secured for the RTB's operational costs in 2022.  The RTB received sanction for an additional 41 staff since 2019 to ensure that its enhanced powers and the new legislative provisions are fully implemented and enforced.  This includes the sanctions granted in 2021 by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for two new full-time permanent senior posts at principal officer level, and also for the remuneration of the director or CEO to be set at assistant secretary level.  The authorised staff complement for the RTB is now 106.4 whole-time equivalents.  The Department continues to engage with the RTB to guarantee that it has the funds and staffing it requires to effectively discharge its functions in the residential tenancies sector.</p> <p> In accordance with both the programme for Government and Housing for All commitments, the Government has provided for tenancies of unlimited duration through the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2021.  All new tenancies created on or after 11 June 2022 will become tenancies of unlimited duration once the tenancy has lasted more than six months and no notice of termination has been validly served on the tenant.  This will enhance security of tenure for tenants and simplify the operation of the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2021 through a transition to tenancies of unlimited duration.  This provision respects the landlord&rsquo;s constitutionally protected rights to terminate a tenancy in accordance with section 34 of the Acts.  The Government is fully committed to tackling high rents and ensuring an increase in the supply of affordable, high-quality rental accommodation through continued significant capital investment, including cost rental and other means, in a manner that respects security of tenure for renters by ensuring equity and fairness for landlords and tenants alike.  Above all, we urgently need the supply of all tenures of housing to keep up with demand in the market.  The supply is now ramping up and we have a plan to deliver that in Housing for All.</p></speech>

I find that absolutely shocking.  The housing rental sector is a mess and I cannot believe for a second that the Government does not see that or thinks its plan is working.  Every single measure that is used to gauge how good or bad it is for workers and families trying to access social and affordable housing is telling us that it is beyond horrific.  I will give a couple of examples, in case the Minister of State does not read his emails.  I know of a family of four that have been 13 years in a RAS house and got a notice to quit.  It is their fifth time moving as a family.  The council is blocked from buying this house and allowing this family, which has strong roots in the community, a chance to finally settle.  This house has now gone on the open market.  Ironically, it could come back to the council in the form of a long-term lease if that is what the owner wishes to do.  A young woman contacted me today.  She has one child and is living in an overcrowded house.  She has been approved for HAP - that transfer of wealth to landlords the Minister of State spoke about earlier - but even though she sent out 100 emails, she only got one response.  One person wrote:</p> <blockquote> 	I am writing to you again to vent my desperation with regard to my housing situation and ask for some help.  I am born and raised in Dublin 15.  I am in senior management.  I have worked hard all my life.  I am living with my parents trying the last two years to save for a mortgage but increasing house prices have meant I am still stuck here.  I feel there is no hope left here in this country.  I am emigrating. </blockquote>  <p>Another said:</p> <blockquote> 	We thought we had somewhere to go when we were made homeless on Saturday but also getting onto the housing list and approved for HAP.  We find ourselves having to rely on my wife's friends letting us sleep on the couch. </blockquote>  <p>It goes on and on.  The Government must treat this housing crisis the way we rightly treated the pandemic and the way we are rightly treating the crisis of refugees from Ukraine.  It must take emergency measures.  That is what we are talking about because that is what is needed.  It should introduce a ban on rent increases and a refundable tax credit, putting a month's rent back in people's pockets.  It must massively increase the investment in the delivery of affordable homes, and introduce real protections for tenants.  That is what people are asking for.  That is what people are demanding.  What the Minister of State talked about earlier is not working.  Every single person here is saying it is not working.  The Government needs to start listening. </p></speech>

This morning, I was contacted by a constituent in her 60s who told me she slept in her car last night.  Every housing case coming into my constituency office in north Kildare is just getting worse, with every one more unbelievable than the last.  Eviction notices are arriving thick and fast.  I have had more people with notices to quit coming into my office in the last month than I have had since I got elected.  I was not a bit surprised by the dramatic increase in the RTB figures.  The Minister must implement the Focus Ireland motion, which passed through this House unchallenged, without delay.</p>  <p>  I have lost count of the number of people being asked by the system that was created to house them if they have friends or family they can stay with.  Here they are, citizens of this State, and they are meant to depend on the luck of having somebody who might be willing to put them up.  I know another woman aged 60 who is camped out on a sofa.  The family dog had to be moved from his spot to make room for her to have a place to sleep.  Older people are being made homeless and the stuff they have gathered through their lifetime is being dumped or stacked in a friend's damp shed - the sheer cruelty of it.</p>  <p>  Rents are rocketing in north Kildare.  The &euro;1,400 cited by the RTB is way lower than what is being asked in the northern part of Kildare, in my constituency.  One would not have a snowball's chance in hell of getting a place for under &euro;2,000.  A house in Mullen Park recently went for rent for &euro;3,500.  It is the same desperate people chasing the same shrinking number of properties available to rent, and they are desperate.  This is all the Government's doing and it is hard to believe we tolerate it.  The Government has turned housing, something that every human needs, into a profit commodity for investors.  All this mess is of its making.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-04a.519" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="21:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050400048#WW00400"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his comments.  At least he had the good grace to deal with the substance of the motion, although we may disagree on the points.  His speech was in stark contrast to the earlier speech of his senior Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, which hardly mentioned either the private rental sector crisis or the specific points in this motion.  He had nothing to say about what he was going to do to stop rising rents.  He had nothing to say at all about how he was going to reduce the cost of renting.  He had nothing to say about increasing real security of tenure and nothing about the very low output of affordable cost-rental housing this year, next year and into the year after.  Again, he completely avoided responding to requests for clarification about the crucial tenant <i>in situ</i>programme to stop families on HAP and RAS with notices to quit becoming homeless.  There was nothing at all about the rapidly shrinking private rental sector as accidental and semi-professional landlords leave in droves.  Interestingly, he also had nothing at all to say about his deeply regrettable comments about migrants on &quot;On the Record&quot; with Gavan Reilly on Sunday.</p><p>I intended to say this while the Ceann Comhairle was still here.  The debate earlier got heated but that is because, in our constituency offices, there is so much fear, anxiety, frustration and anger at the deepening housing crisis.  I am sure it is the same across the Chamber.  It would be strange if that did not spill over into our debates at times.  What really frustrated me about the Minister is that he made a series of misleading claims, so I will correct the record.  I would have preferred it if he were here for this.  I appreciate that he is a busy man but it is important that his claims do not go uncorrected.  Supply in and of itself will not fix the problem.  It is not only about supply.  We need the right kind of supply in the right place at the right price.  If we do not have sufficient affordable supply, particularly in the coming years, then an increase in the number of homes will not necessarily reduce rents and house prices, or tackle homelessness.</p> <p>The Minister repeated the claim that the Government is spending &euro;4 billion on public housing this year.  That is not true.  One can look at the budget book.  There is just under &euro;1.5 billion of direct capital investment through Government programmes for the delivery of social and affordable homes.  I do not know why the Minister keeps misleading the house.  He again claimed that the Government delivered 9,000 social homes last year.  That is not true.  One can look at the Department's website.  There were just over 5,000 new builds and just over 1,000 acquisitions, which is just over 6,000, which is 30% less than what the Minister claimed.  The Minister repeated the untruth that the Opposition opposes the building of social and affordable homes.  He was corrected by <i>The Journal's</i>excellent fact-check on the matter and knows very well that what the Opposition had opposed is the gifting of public land at low or no cost to private developers where the affordable homes on those sites will sell for more than &euro;400,000.  We make no apology for that.<br/><br/>The Minister claimed that Sinn F&eacute;in is against home ownership.  The irony is that the Minister of State, Deputy English, used to have battles with the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, when Deputy English was at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, because Deputy English rightly used to point out that home ownership falls most rapidly under Fianna F&aacute;il Governments.  In our alternative budget, we would have delivered more than double the number of affordable purchase homes funded by this Government.<br/><br/>I strongly disagree with the Minister about the Constitution.  I do not believe there would be a constitutional or legal challenge.  We will continue to have that debate.  He is right that rent relief in and of itself would be inflationary, which is why we called for a three-year ban on rent increases, along with the rent relief, to make sure that that does not happen.<br/><br/>The number of commencements has increased.  The problem is that many are large apartment developments that will take two to three years to complete.  Are we seriously saying that people will have to wait for two to three years before that supply starts to come online?  Planning permission numbers have increased but last year we had more than 80,000 active planning permissions, but only a fraction were being built.  Planning permission does not guarantee the delivery of much-needed homes.<br/><br/>The Minister misrepresented our position on shared equity and help-to-buy.  We oppose them because they are inflationary.  We are not the only people who think that.  The only people who have not got the memo on that are the Government.  Almost all independent agencies share our concerns.<br/><br/>On Sinn F&eacute;in's proposals, we put together a detailed alternative budget each year.  We will do so again in September.  We set out clearly how to fund the delivery of 20,000 public homes, including 4,000 affordable cost rental homes and 4,000 affordable purchase homes, which is more than double what is in the Government's proposals.  In the meantime, renters need a break.  We have to stop rents from increasing, to put money back in renters' pockets, to give tenants real security of tenure, to end inferior build-to-rent design standards and, crucially, we have to develop thousands of cost-rental units, not the hundreds that the Minister spoke about earlier in the debate.  That is not in the Government's plan and until it is, this rental crisis will deepen.  That is why I commend the motion to the House and oppose the Minister's amendment.</p></speech>

I hope the Minister of State has put in for overtime, because he is putting in long hours today.  We are lucky in east Cork, because Youghal has a good secondary school, Cobh has two, Midleton has four and Carrigtwohill has two, although one is in temporary accommodation.  They have extraordinary staff and professional and caring principals.  The education and training board, ETB, does a good job.  The difficulty is that, every year, all of these schools are oversubscribed, mainly because of double, triple or quadruple applications from parents.  This leads to a situation where, when places are offered, there are extremely long waiting lists.  They fall off as time goes on and people choose schools.  Just today, I had calls from three parents whose children were high on waiting lists in some schools already.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that the Department of Education has done great work over the years in making resources available to these schools.  We have new buildings in CBS Midleton, St. Coleman's College in Midleton, in Youghal and at a new school that is about to start construction in Carrigtwohill.  The Minister of State might arrange for information to be provided to me about when shovels will be on the ground.  It is all ready to go and planning has been done.  One can imagine a child in sixth class in primary school where all of his or her friends have places and he or she does not.  That child then goes home to ask his or her parents what is wrong and why there is no place for him or her.  Many kids are still not sure whether they will have places, despite the great work that principals are doing.</p>  <p>  We need to ensure that schools get extra resources to provide extra classes.  I know St. Coleman's already has one of those for 24 students, but I do not think that is enough.  We need to expand the schools more.  We also need to talk about a new second level school in east Cork.  Given that Carrigtwohill's second level community college has taken 12 years to get to this stage, I contend and hope that people from the Department of Education are listening that planning for a new second level school in east Cork should start soon.  The schools there are at breaking point.</p>  <p>  I want to ensure that, when and if the schools take on extra students, they do not have to wait until the following September to get resources.  They should get the resources this September.  I also point out that many Ukrainian teenagers have moved into the area.  They are welcome and it is great to see them.  I am delighted that we are able to help and support them, but they will need extra school places.  I emphasise the need for action by the Department to support the schools.  Perhaps we need a common enrolment system such as there is in Limerick.  I am not sure if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is aware of this.  The Minister of State might be.  There is a central application system for secondary schools, so there are not waiting lists.  There is clarity for parents about where their children are going and they do not have to apply to three, four or five schools.</p>  <p>  I want the Minister of State to pass on the message that when schools take on extra students next September, they need the resources to match.  Extra classes need to be made available as required so that every child has a school place.  We also need to look at this system so we are not here again next year making the same points.  I know my colleague in the constituency who is here, Deputy Buckley, would have a similar concern.</p>  <p>  Long-term planning for a new second-level school in east Cork needs to start now.</p></speech>

I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, who is unavailable this evening.  As the Deputy may be aware, for school planning purposes, the Department of Education divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system to anticipate school place demand.  Information from a range of sources, including child benefit data, school enrolment data and information on residential development activity, is used for this purpose.  In addition, Project Ireland 2040 population and housing targets inform the Department's projections of school place requirements.  Having considered the projected requirements in each school planning area, the Department then makes an assessment of existing capacity in that particular area and its ability to meet the increased demand.  Where data indicate that additional provision is required at primary or post-primary level, the delivery of such additional provision depends on the circumstances of each case and may be provided through one of, or a combination of, utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools, extending the capacity of a school or schools or provision of a new school or schools.  The Department's projections of post-primary school place requirements in east Cork show an anticipated continued growth in enrolments in the short to medium term.</p> <p>In response to meeting the projected future demographic demand in the area, a new post-primary school, Carrigtwohill Community College, was established in 2016.  A project to deliver a new, modern 1,000 pupil permanent school building for the school is under way.</p> <p>The Department issued a letter of intent to the preferred tenderer on 15 February 2022.  This allows the preferred bidder to put in place the bond, insurance and confirmations of all legal arrangements required under the contract.  Following receipt of all the necessary documentation, the Department will be in a position to issue the letter of acceptance, which will allow the contractor to mobilise on site.  It is expected that the letter of acceptance will issue shortly after receipt of all the necessary documents.  Once the successful contractor is appointed, the Department's project manager will liaise with the contractor to ensure that the community college is prioritised and delivered as early as possible within the contractor's programme of works for the campus.</p> <p> In the meantime, additional accommodation has been approved for Carrigtwohill Community College for September 2022, which includes six general classrooms, a home economics room, a special educational needs class, and ancillary accommodation.  This accommodation is being delivered by Cork Education and Training board, CETB.</p> <p> The Department's capital programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, including accommodation for pupils with special educational needs, if required, for schools where an additional enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed.  An extension at St. Colman's Community College, Midleton, was completed recently, which will cater for up to 1,000 pupils.  A number of other large-scale building projects are also in train to cater for similar pupil numbers.  This includes expanded capacity at Christian Brothers Secondary School and St. Mary's High School, Midleton.  In addition, St. Aloysius College, Carrigtwohill will expand to cater for 1,000 pupils, Pobalscoil na Tr&iacute;on&oacute;ide in Youghal to cater for 1,200 pupils, and Col&aacute;iste Mhuire and Carrignafoy Community College, both in Cobh, to cater for 600 and over 700 pupils respectively.</p> <p> Under Project Ireland 2040, the Department continues to make progress to increase the infrastructural capacity in the schools sector to meet demographic and other demands.  It is expected that the enrolment pressures in east Cork, and other areas will reduce in the short term as such planned additional capacity comes on stream and as demographic demand moves past its peak.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-04a.530" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" time="21:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050400050#YY00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, and the Department of Education for a very comprehensive reply.  I note that the letter of intent was issued on 15 February by the Department for the school in Carrigtwohill Community College.  That is almost three months ago.  I would expect that this would be sorted pretty soon.  The Minister is already on record stating that she wants this school to be opened by September 2023.  I do not believe this is going to happen now.</p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Burke, is aware of the plans to build thousands of houses in east Cork.  The Minister of State is also aware of the fact that the Minister for Transport has blocked the road project there, which puts all of these houses at risk.  This is a concern to me, to my colleagues and to the people in the area because housing is at a premium.  If these houses go ahead we would need extra places.  This is why I am saying that we will need to start planning for a new school now.  Also, St. Mary's needs clarification from the Department with regard to extra accommodation that has already been granted.  This is very welcome but it needs to be nailed down pretty soon for September, otherwise we will have another problem.</p><p>These schools are doing a tremendous job.  The Minister has called out the enrolment of all these schools.  There are more than 1,000 pupils in some of the schools, which is very big and growing.  They cannot grow much further, however, as they do not have the space.  We really need to act here pretty soon and start planning for the future.  St. Mary's is completely landlocked at this stage and has permission to move to a new site.  This needs movement pretty soon.  St. Aloysius' College in Carrigtwohill also has permission to expand and build a new school there, which is badly needed.</p><p>There is so much to be done, but I must get back to my original point that when a child does not have a second-level school place at this time of the year - and this is not just one child, it is many children - it leads to stress, worry and consternation.  We can see why parents would apply to more than one school because of the worry they have of not getting any place.  I also raised the issue previously about the bus.  Quite often a parent will take the school place that is not the nearest school because they are told that there is not a place nearer and that they are on a waiting list, which is a <i>de facto</i>refusal.  If they get a place in the school that is further away then they may not qualify for the school transport there.  I had asked the Department about this previously, and I am asking again now, that Carrigtwohill would be made one area and one school education centre for school transport purposes.  The schools are only a couple of kilometres apart.  That would solve another problem.</p></speech>

From the briefing documentation here I am aware that the Department is at one with the Deputy's concern about capacity of the area.  The Department will work closely to resolve it.  A number of projects are in the offing, as we have spoken about previously.  From the documentation here I know that the letter of acceptance for Carrigtwohill will be imminent.  There is confidence that those documents are now coming in or are near completion.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also raised very valuable issues about funding, which one does need in advance to prepare for the additional growth in school capacity, and also the CAO-type application process that was carried out in Limerick.  Parents and students need certainty at a very stressful time when trying to get into post-primary schools.  I appreciate that it can be very difficult.  I will bring the issues raised by Deputy Stanton to the attention of the Minister for Education.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-04a.534" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1572" speakername="John Lahart" time="21:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050400050#YY00600"><p>There is probably no huge reason to elaborate on that, but I will.  I first raised this issue in Opposition about three or four years ago.  The rate of ASD places nationally is about 94 to 1.  For every 94 mainstream class places nationally, there is one ASD place.  In Dublin 4, Dublin 6, Dublin 6W and parts of Dublin 16 - Dublin 6, 6W and 16 are in my constituency - that ratio is as high as 650 to 1.  For every 650 mainstream class places there is one ASD place.  This leads to a disproportionate amount of pressure on schools in Dublin 12, which is also my constituency, and in Dublin 24 to take students and pupils from the other postal districts.  As a consequence, it can sometimes lead to these schools turning down students from within their own catchment areas and their own postal code areas.  I acknowledge that I did not believe I would be back here but I was at a public meeting recently and the situation at primary school level is becoming acute again.  I will not even begin on the post primary level situation.</p><p>A grandmother called me yesterday on behalf of her grandson.  She was distraught and exhausted and she still has not reached the end of the process in securing a place for her grandson.  Her son wrote to me and said: </p> <blockquote> 	I am writing to you as we are desperately trying to secure a primary school place in an ASD class for our son...  He was diagnosed with ASD in 2019 and is currently attending an ASD preschool class in the Good Shepherd National School in Churchtown. [They speak very highly about the Good Shepherd National School]  Unfortunately, they do not have any ASD facilities in their primary school.  We have applied to the following schools... </blockquote>  <p>He goes on to outline the following schools, and this is not an exclusive list: Scoil &Iacute;osa (rejected); Educate Together, Ballinteer - no place; the Marist school - no place; Educate Together Firhouse - no place [and I know this is becuase they already are taking a disproportionate number of children in their school]; Educate Together Stepaside [which is miles away] - no place; St. Damian's National School, Crumlin - no place; Scoil Mhuire - they already have two ASD classes; St. Kevin's, Kilnamanagh [which is miles away] - no place; St. Clare's National School - no place; the Muslim school in Clonskeagh - no place; Our Lady of Good Hope - no place; Educate Together, Harcourt Terrace - no place; Scoil Naomh P&aacute;draig - no place.  The list goes on.  I want to be clear that some of those schools are already operating ASD classes but most of them are not in Dublin 6W or Dublin 16.</p><p>The father goes on:</p> <blockquote> 	We have spoken to the two special educational needs organisers, SENOs, in our area .... and they have provided the names of some of the schools above.  They have mentioned numerous times the home schooling option but this is not viable as my wife will need to return to work as we are on a single income at present.   </blockquote>  <p>Due to the very long waiting lists and the lack of services in the public sector the family is paying for private occupational therapy and speech and language therapy at the moment, and also had to get a private ASD assessment for their son in 2019 to allow him to obtain a place in preschool.</p><p>The letter goes on and on.</p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>I want to listen to the Minister of State's initial reply before I add some other points to it, but I think he gets very clearly the drift of where I am coming from on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-04a.536" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1595" speakername="Peter Burke" time="21:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050400051#ZZ00200"><p>In the first instance, I send the apologies of the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley.  Like Deputy Lahart, I have experienced some of those same issues, unfortunately, in my own constituency.  I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  It provides an opportunity for the Department to outline the current position regarding provision for children with special educational needs, including autism.  Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education appropriate to their needs is a priority for this Government.</p>  <p>  This year, the Department of Education will invest in excess of &euro;2 billion, or more than 25% of the Department's budget, in the area of special educational needs support.  As a result, the numbers of special education teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, and special class and school places are at unprecedented levels.  Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased from 548 to a current total of 2,148 for the 2021-2022 school year.</p>  <p>  Recognising some of the difficulties experienced by parents in securing appropriate school placements, over the past two years, the Department of Education and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined-up planning process.  This has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school year.  Overall, this intensive intervention has seen an additional 300 special classes providing 1,800 new places already opened nationwide for the 2021-2022 school year.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has responsibility for co-ordinating and advising on the education provision for children with special educational needs nationwide.  It has well-established structures in place for engaging with schools and parents.  The NCSE seeks to ensure schools in an area between them can cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements.  The Department and the Minister, Deputy Foley, and Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, continue to prioritise and support this work.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education recognises that it can be a stressful experience where parents have difficulties in securing an appropriate school placement for a child, particularly a child with additional needs.  The Department is working hard to ensure there are sufficient school places appropriate to the needs of all children available on a timely basis nationwide.  It is also envisaged, in line with demographics and as part of forward planning, that special classes will be required at most, if not all, post-primary schools in Dublin.</p>  <p>  A range of measures to meet additional special educational needs, SEN, capacity demands have already been put in place, including the utilisation of spare capacity in existing schools and delivery of additional SEN capacity within the scope of existing building projects.  Additionally, it is general practice to include a SEN base in the accommodation brief for new school buildings unless exceptional local circumstances indicate it is not required.  The extent of provision made at these schools is informed by the level of demand in the area as well as the size of the school.</p>  <p>  Looking specifically to the Dublin South-West postcodes of Dublin 6W, 12, 16 and 24, there are currently 65 special classes for students with autism in this area.  This comprises 54 autism spectrum disorder, ASD, special classes at primary level, including five ASD early intervention classes, and 11 special classes at post-primary level, providing 390 placements for students.  Both the Department of Education and the NCSE are always grateful to schools that express a willingness to open a special class to meet the educational needs of students in their local communities.</p>  <p>  There are special educational needs organisers, SENOs, located throughout the country who have a key specific remit in helping and supporting parents in accessing the additional education necessary for their children, including identifying suitable school placements.</p>  <p>  The NCSE is currently engaged in a process of establishing new classes for the 2022-2023 school year and beyond and is looking at the information relating to projected demand for future special education places, especially to cater for students with autism who have associated complex needs.</p></speech>

The bulk of the 65 special classes for students are in Dublin 12 and Dublin 24.  There are notable exceptions in Dublin 6W such as Bishop Shanahan National School and Bishop Galvin National School, which are new to the system.  I would like to say I had a little involvement in that and very much welcome it.  Trojan work is being done at Scoil Mhuire, Ballyboden, which has two units, but all the others are in Dublin 12 and Dublin 24.  Again, they are taking a disproportionate number of students.</p><p>Going back to the letter, the parent goes on to write that:</p> <blockquote> 	We were forced to apply far and wide to schools that put priority on children in their own catchment areas.  Preschool has made a massive positive impact on our son and our ability to handle the long days.  He's very happy in preschool and it has made a huge difference to him.  He's very happy going in every morning and the socialisation aspect is essential for him. </blockquote>  <p>It can be seen, therefore, that this child is doing very well developmentally and for this to be brought to an end will obviously cause a setback and regression to him.  As I said, I was contacted not just by his father yesterday but by his grandmother.</p><p>This is what I would like the Minister of State to do because clearly, and I would like to say I again played a little part in this, the Government is doing its job in terms of resources.  I would like both the Minister, Deputy Foley, and Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, to write to all those schools in Dublin 6W and Dublin 16, some of which are very new schools, to ask them what obstacles are in the way of enabling them to provide ASD places for students in those postal codes.  If every school in the four postal codes mentioned took an ASD class, we would never be having a debate in this Chamber about the provision of ASD places for children with special needs.</p></speech>

It is not something that should be happening in society.  As the Deputy alluded to, there is significant funding behind the provision of education in the State.</p>  <p>  I think the Deputy may have put his finger on the pulse in terms of the two postcodes he referenced, however.  I will raise this with both the Minister and Minister of State.  Obviously, I do not have the data in front of me to give the Deputy exactly everything he needs at this point.  I will genuinely bring it up with the Minister for Education, however, and in reference to the letter, the need to see potentially what obstacles are in place.  The script I have been provided with also states that planning is very actively under way to ensure every student who is under pressure now gets a place.  Again, I promise I will raise the issue with the Minister, Deputy Foley.</p></speech>

Go minic, b&iacute;onn muid ag tabhairt faoin taobh m&iacute;cheart d&rsquo;fhadhbanna.  Seachas mealladh a thabhairt do dhaoine, leagaimid an dl&iacute; anuas ar dhaoine nach bhfuil m&oacute;r&aacute;n rogha acu.</p>  <p>  The recent controversy about smoky coal, fuel and turf has focused almost totally on the distribution and sale of these fuels.  The question that does not seem to have been asked, however, is who are the people who predominantly buy these fuels and why do they do it?  I would like to focus in particular on a section for which the Minister of State is directly responsible, namely, local authority houses that are fuelled by solid fuel.  It is fair to say many people have a stove in their house they use occasionally but have some other main source of fuel for cooking, heating water and heating the house.  My experience, however, is that many local authority houses are mainly dependant on solid fuel ranges and solid fuel for heating the house and heating water.  In that case, of course, people must keep the solid fuel burner going all day.</p> <p>Although I cannot get the figures because no one will provide me with them, at least in my experience of dealing with my constituents, it seems a totally disproportionate number of the people in my constituency who are dependent on solid fuel as their main source of heating and cooking live in local authority houses.  That is true in Galway city as much as it is true in Galway county.  We cannot blame these people for buying turf, the fuel they are familiar with.  There is also the issue of the cost of smokeless fuel.  In any event, all those fuels produce emissions.</p> <p> I suggest, and I hope I get a positive answer, that the Department find out from each local authority how many houses in its stock are dependent on solid fuel as their primary source of energy.  Without that information, the Department cannot solve the problem.  Having found that out, it should begin an urgent programme that would be completed within five years, allowing for the difficulties in procurement and so on, that would replace all these homes with sustainable systems and not only deal with the emissions issue of smoke but also that of carbon.</p> <p> I have to say, I was disappointed when I tabled a parliamentary question in the House to get a reply stating the Department did not know, and not even indicating it would find out.  Perhaps we could have a two-step programme to find out how many houses the issue relates to and then to resolve the issue.  Instead of punishing people, we should assist people who are in fuel poverty.</p></speech>

Like him, I come from a large rural constituency that is heavily dependent on fossil fuels, so I very much understand the need to have an alternative in place before certain public policy measures are pursued.  If that is not the case, we will lose people along the way and we will not reach our targets in the long run.</p>  <p>  The Department launched the energy efficiency retrofitting programme in 2013 with the aim of funding the retrofit of social homes requiring insulation and energy upgrade works.  Since the programme commenced in 2013 up to the end of 2021, more than 75,000 units of social housing stock were retrofitted, with a total Exchequer spend of &euro;183 million under the scheme.  The programme was revised in 2021, with an increased budget made available to local authorities.  A significant part of the programme is focused on minimising heat loss by upgrading the external fabric, walls, roof space, windows and doors and heating systems.  The funding available under the terms of this new, deeper retrofit programme does not, however, provide for fossil fuel heating systems or inset stoves in place of open fires.  If appropriate, local authorities can install such systems using funding from their own resources.  The revised ten-year programme will see a significant upscaling to a retrofit deeper than what has been completed by local authorities in previous years.  A strong emphasis on fuel poverty and the need to improve thermal performance in the social housing stock remains a top priority for the Department.</p>  <p>  In 2021, more than &euro;21.7 million of Exchequer funding support was provided for retrofit work carried out on 1,584 dwellings.  The Department acknowledges the difficult environment within which local authorities had to work in 2021, with a construction shutdown and supply chain problems impacting on delivery, and I look forward to significantly improved output under this programme in 2022.  The newly revised and enhanced programme will benefit not only local authorities in assisting them in the upgrade and maintenance of their housing stock but also, more importantly, homeowners and householders in many ways.  Their homes will be warmer, easier to heat and more comfortable, it will enhance the air quality in the home, and those currently using oil or gas will see a significant saving on their energy bills.  The scheme will also stimulate employment.  The retrofitting of homes is a highly labour-intensive sector that can create high-quality, sustainable jobs in local communities and it has the capacity to play an important role in our economic recovery.</p></speech>

It does not address my first question, that is, whether we are going to ascertain how many houses in local authority ownership are fuelled mainly by solid fuel.  It is a "Yes" or "No" question.</p>  <p>  On the second issue, the Minister of State said, "Their homes will be warmer, easier to heat and more comfortable, it will enhance the air quality in the home, and those currently using oil or gas will see a significant saving on their energy bills".  The question I asked related specifically to solid fuel because the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications keeps telling us that 1,300 people die every year because of particulate matter pollution, which is not caused, according to him, by oil and we know it is not caused by gas.  We know those forms of energy produce carbon-based emissions but they do not have particulate problems.  On the one hand, that Minister is telling us we are killing people while, on the other hand, the other side of the Government will not even find out how great a cause of pollution it is and the extent to which it contributes to the problem by insisting on not changing as a priority houses that are fuelled by solid fuel to using a much more sustainable form of heating.  That seems to show a total lack of joined-up government in respect of the matter.</p>  <p>  My questions are quite simple.  Is it intended to find out how many local authority houses are fuelled mainly by solid fuel?  Second, is it intended to have a special programme focused on changing the fuel source in those houses to something more sustainable?  They are the two big issues.  It is my observation that the vast majority of houses in Galway city that face this problem are either local authority houses or, in a smaller number of cases, private houses owned by people who are not well off and are very disadvantaged.  It is time------</p></speech>

To be clear, between 2013 and 2021, a retrofit was completed in respect of 75,000 local authority homes.  Moreover, there is a scheme in place specifically to deal with local authority housing and to give them a deep retrofit, and that scheme was revised last year.  It will aim to bring 100,000 houses up to a BER of B2 or a cost-optimal equivalent rating.  That will give people who are reliant on fossil fuels an alternative in the future, but it will take time and the Government has to be honest about that.  We are now at capacity in our construction sector, higher than in pre-recessionary times.  A massive retrofitting scheme is under way, as are some of the largest ever capital infrastructural projects in this country, with a value of &euro;165 billion to be delivered over the next decade.  The Government is working at pace to deliver those 500,000 homes.</p>  <p>  In summary, the largest retrofitting scheme in the country since the State was formed is under way and will involve 500,000 homes.  A total of 75,000 homes from our local authority stock have been completed since 2013.</p>  <p>  As for the parliamentary question the Deputy asked the Minister, I will revert to the Minister to get the figures on the specific volume of stock that is reliant on fossil fuels and will relay the response directly to the Deputy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-05-04a.548" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1452" speakername="Pat Buckley" time="21:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022050400052#AAA00800"><p>I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter.</p> <p>I suppose the question is again in the heading.  It is about the boil water notice that has been in place since November 2019.  There was a little bit of a break of a week or two.  On 25 December, Christmas Day, another boil water notice was issued.  We are now into May.  As far back as March, Irish Water put out a statement that &quot;Irish Water and Cork County Council would like to remind customers supplied by Whitegate Regional Public Water Supply that the Boil Water Notice issued on 25 December 2021 remains in place&quot;.  This is affecting more than 10,000 people and has been going on for a number of years.<br/><br/>I have submitted a number of questions to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications but those questions were unfortunately not allowed, which I found strange.  I am a bit fearful tonight when the Minister of State is standing in for the Minister, who was not allowed to receive my questions a number of weeks ago.  I have contacted Irish Water with him.  In fairness, I will always give credit where it is due but the response was firm.  These 9,500 or 10,000 people are all on the southern side of east Cork, a huge area covering Whitegate, Aghada, Churchtown, Ballycotton, Saleen, Shanagarry, Ballinacura and Cloyne.  We are heading into the tourist season and this will affect businesses.  It was discussed here a while ago with regard to housing issues as well.  If Irish Water cannot support the people who are <i>in situ</i>in this area of east Cork, how is it going to deal with additional demand for water supply and sewerage in the future because there are long-term plans for the whole of east Cork and that side in particular?<br/><br/>Even as I speak, there is another area, on the northern side of my constituency, which is now the subject of a second boil notice.  I refer to Kilavullen.  Approximately 800 people are affected.  I worked in sewerage and water a long time ago and at that time, you would never hear of a boil water notice.  You would hear of a broken water main.  Some fella in the town who was lucky enough to have a phone - an ordinary phone, rather than a mobile phone - would ring somebody to say the water was out and would be told in response that it would be fixed within an hour.  The council went down with a JCB, a concrete saw and a couple of G clamps and the job would be done.  For some reason, since Irish Water took over, there has been boil water notice after boil water notice.  <br/><br/>The excuse given to the people using the Whitegate system one year was that, for some reason, additional rain was causing the problems at the plant.  Irish Water should be delighted when it rains.  Another time, they were told the problem was silt entering the plant.  There may be an issue with height; I am not too sure.  When Irish Water found out that the issue was silt, it did not have the capability to remove it.  It has now said, in one of the replies I got, that &quot;Until a long-term solution has been implemented, there is a possibility that further Boil Water Notices may be imposed&quot; and there is also mention of &quot;our 25 Year strategy&quot;.  The gang below in Whitegate who are on this water supply may have a heart attack tonight because I cannot get a definitive answer.  That is my issue here.  On behalf of these 10,000 or more people, I am trying to find out whether the Minister of State or his Department can get a definitive and honest answer from Irish Water so that we can tell the people of east Cork who are on the Whitegate regional supply that, although the water supply is not working and has not been working, we at least have a final date.</p></speech>

I thank him for raising this very important matter.  This is an issue of both national and local importance and I fully appreciate the concerns of the 10,000 people in the Deputy's community whom he referenced.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the operation of the Whitegate regional public water supply is a matter for Irish Water which, since 1 January 2014, has had statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local level.  In turn, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, as the environmental regulator, is responsible for setting quality standards and enforcing compliance with EU directives and national regulations for the provision of drinking water.  However, from inquiries I made directly with Irish Water, I understand that the boil water notice currently in place for the Whitegate public water supply was issued on 25 December 2021, Christmas Day, following consultation between Irish Water, Cork County Council and the Health Service Executive.  This boil water notice was issued to protect approximately 9,500 customers in Whitegate, Aghada, Churchtown, Ballycotton, Saleen, Shanagarry, Ballinacura and areas of Cloyne.</p>  <p>  The notice was issued as a result of increased turbidity in the raw water, which can happen at this source as it is susceptible to raw water quality issues after rainfall events.  Boil water notices have been issued in respect of Whitegate public water supply a number of times over the past few years.  Upgrade works to the filters began in January 2022 and these works are still under way.  To complete the upgrade works, additional parts are required.  These parts have been ordered from abroad.  Due to the global issues with supply chains, delivery is not expected for a few more weeks.  When these parts are delivered, and provided that installation is successful, a further two to three weeks of compliant operation will be required before discussions take place with the HSE regarding the lifting of the boil water notice.  The current estimate for completion of these works is May or early June.</p>  <p>  The delivery of a new water treatment plant as a permanent solution to issues at Whitegate is under way.  The purchase of land is progressing and the project has been handed over to Irish Water's asset delivery team.  Depending on planning and construction constraints, it is anticipated that construction could start in 2024 but completion of this permanent solution is a few years away, as we can appreciate.</p>  <p>  My Department's priority is to ensure that people's health is protected and that adequate water is available for all customers.  We want to see this notice lifted urgently and without delay, as the Deputy quite rightly points out, but only when the HSE and EPA have confirmed the water supply is safe after these works have been carried out, which we expect to happen shortly.  Additional information and advice in respect of boil water notices is available on Irish Water's website.</p>  <p>  Both our water and wastewater systems require substantial and sustained investment to bring the systems up to the quality and resilience standards required of a modern service, to provide for population growth and to build resilience in the face of climate change.  As part of budget 2022, funding of over &euro;1.57 billion to support water services was allocated.  This includes &euro;1.459 billion, comprising current expenditure of &euro;629 million and capital expenditure of &euro;830 million, in respect of domestic water services provision by Irish Water.  This overall investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and wastewater services, support improved water supplies right across Ireland, including rural Ireland, and support a wide range of programmes delivering improved water quality in our rivers, lakes and marine area, making a significant contribution to addressing Ireland's needs.</p></speech>

The devil may be in the detail or perhaps there is a hidden message in it.  I welcome the fact that Irish Water has given a date of May or June for the completion of the works in respect of the silt or, as it calls it, the turbidity.  However, many people will not be too happy and will be stocking up on water for the next couple of years if the completion of the permanent solution is that far away.  I am surprised to have been given the answer now.  I welcome it because at least it is a reply and a response, which is a lot more than I have got before.  However, if these parts are to be ordered from abroad, I hope we are not getting them from the likes of Wish or Alibaba because Brexit and everything else seems to be used as an excuse when they cannot issue something.</p>  <p>  In my brief time, I will also welcome the mention the reply makes of the capacity issues and that Irish Water is looking ahead because it is a very significant factor.  Without losing the sense of what I am saying, there is an emergency in housing and so forth countrywide.  I know there is not capacity.  I recall that, under Cork County Council's 2012 county development plan, there were plans for a village in Monard, out beyond Blarney.  The issue at the time was that Irish Water would not bring a water main in to the area.  As a result of issues with capacity, the plan fell through.  </p>  <p>  The issue I want to highlight is that people are under severe pressure because of this and have been for nearly three years.  It is causing issues for families with young children, people with complex needs and so on.  I also acknowledge that there are capacity issues in Mitchelstown in my constituency.  I welcome the progress in Mallow.  The waterworks in Midleton have always been there.  I live in the heart of Midleton and the waterworks are behind me, yet I get my water from the Glashaboy scheme at Glanmire, which says enough about capacity issues.</p> <p>As I said, overall I welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.  I am certainly looking forward to working with him.  I would rather work him than whichever Member I asked the last time, because at least I got a reply from the Minister of State.</p></speech>

It is a very frustrating thing, especially on Christmas Day, when you run into trouble or you are being advised of a boil water notice.  I think of the four Topical Issue matters tonight, Deputy Buckley is definitely in front because he has an interim solution, which hopefully will be ready by latest at June, as I have in my briefing document.  Second, the Deputy has a permanent solution, which is in the Irish Water capital budget.  Upon reviewing my four Topical Issue matters tonight, to be told that works could start in 2024 with an interim solution in the meantime probably is not a bad day&rsquo;s work.</p></speech>
