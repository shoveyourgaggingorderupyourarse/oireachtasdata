Last week, Energia became the third energy supplier this year to announce a price increase for its customers.  The increase will come into effect next month and it will add &euro;427 to the yearly household bill.  This is the fourth price hike announced by Energia in the past year and it comes just a week after Bord G&aacute;is announced a massive price increase that will add a &euro;775 additionality to the yearly household bills of its customers.  These are frightening numbers and they come after 35 energy price hikes announced last year.  Without action, low- and middle-income households face an income squeeze that they will struggle to withstand and, indeed, many are already unable to cope.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has seen requests for help soar, with households facing an impossible and unacceptable choice between keeping the heating on and doing the weekly food shop.</p>  <p>  Last week, the Central Bank told an Teachta Pearse Doherty that households would see energy and food costs rise by &euro;1,900 this year.  Workers and families cannot bear these costs without very significant financial hardship.  They need help.  We recognise the causes of this cost of living crisis and we know that households cannot be fully insulated from these costs, but they can and they must be supported as much as possible.  The good news is that more can be done.  Indeed, the responsibility of the Government is to ensure that more is done.  Caithfear n&iacute;os m&oacute; taca&iacute;ochta a thabhairt do theaghlaigh.  Is f&eacute;idir n&iacute;os m&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh agus is &eacute; c&uacute;ram an Rialtais cinnti&uacute; go nd&eacute;antar n&iacute;os m&oacute;.  T&aacute;imid tar &eacute;is insint don Taoiseach cad is f&eacute;idir a dh&eacute;anamh.</p>  <p>  For five months now, we in Sinn F&eacute;in have been calling on the Government and the Minister for Finance to work with the European Commission to remove VAT from household energy bills, and for months that proposal has been dismissed.  I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach has now changed position and that he is now, finally, engaging with the Commission to allow for a reduction or a removal in the level of VAT applied to fuels, just as we have been calling for.  The conclusions published after the meeting of the European Council last week provide scope to engage with the Commission further on the issue of VAT.</p> <p>What specific ask has the Taoiseach made of the Commission?  Has he sought scope for the Government to reduce VAT on domestic energy bills to zero for a period of time, as we have asked?  Has the Government applied for a derogation from the current VAT rules?  When does the Taoiseach expect this process to be concluded so customers can get the break they need?</p> <p> The Government could take measures now to reduce the cost of home heating oil for hundreds of thousands of households.  This month the cost of filling a tank rose to more than &euro;1,600.  Many households cannot afford this.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have called on the Taoiseach to remove excise duty on home heating oil.  Up to now he has ruled this out but given the pressure so many workers and families are under, will he change his position and provide them with additional support by removing excise duty from home heating oil?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-29a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032900004#B00200"><p>I thank the Deputy, all Members of the House and many well-wishers for their kind remarks in the aftermath of my brush with Covid.  Thankfully, it was a light brush and probably points to the value of vaccination.  I urge anybody who is not vaccinated to get the booster.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt that there has been a severe increase in the cost of living in recent months.  As we emerged from Covid we had an initial inflationary cycle which was described by the Central Bank as a pandemic cycle of inflation because of the imbalance between supply and demand.  There was huge demand as people and societies emerged from Covid.  Economies rebounded, supply chains were under strain, manufacturing could not keep up with the demand and prices rose.</p>  <p>  Prior to the war on Ukraine, the energy market was being manipulated, in our view, to create spikes in prices and challenges around energy.  There is no doubt that the energy question is being leveraged by the Russian Federation in respect of the conduct of the war.  The war itself is significantly adding to and making worse the inflationary pressures on our economy, particularly on households and people generally.  That is across the board, particularly in energy, but it will be manifested in food and other commodities, particularly certain metals.  Russia and Ukraine account for about 30% of global exports of wheat, 7% of maize and more than 50% of sunflower seed oil.  Together they produce 12% of calories consumed globally.  Ukraine supplies about a quarter of the European Union's cereal and vegetable oil imports.</p>  <p>  There will be ongoing impacts from the war, over and above what we have witnessed to date.  Transport routes have been disrupted because of the war so the cost of trade is increasing.  For example, rail freight between Asia and Europe via Russia or Ukraine is interrupted.  Trade has switched to sea freight, which is slower and more costly.  Sea freight routes through the Black Sea are affected.  The annual rate of inflation in Ireland rose to 5.7% in February.  Euro area inflation was 5.8%.  Wholesale oil prices are up 40% compared to January, on average, and gas prices are up 60%.  The cost of base metals and agricultural commodities has also surged.  A barrel of oil costs $114 today on international markets, up from $96 on 23 February.  UK natural gas on wholesale markets is trading at around &pound;2.45 per therm today.  This day last year a therm of gas cost 47p.  Wages went up 4.7% in 2021, following a rise of 5.2% in 2020. </p>  <p>  This dramatic and phenomenal increase in prices is having impacts.  The Government has, from the budget on, produced close to &euro;2 billion in income supports and targeted measures around energy, in particular, and other areas through welfare payments, in response to the increase in inflation.</p> <p>We have also targeted measures for hauliers, tillage farmers and the pig meat sector and we are looking at other sectors.  Regarding the EU, we sought an amendment to the conclusions to create the opportunity for flexibility around the VAT and energy tax directives, which restrict us now.  We were not ignoring anything.  We simply pointed out at the time that what Sinn F&eacute;in was asking for could not be done then because of the regulations.  We do not want to go back to 23% in respect of oil once this crisis is over.  On home heating-----</p></speech>

The Taoiseach must recognise, as I am sure he does, the struggle that means for households and families right across the State.  The Taoiseach did not answer a series of very straightforward questions.  On the issue of home heating oil, we want the excise duty removed from it.</p></speech>

That is the question.  I believe the Government should do that and do it urgently to give relief to those who cannot now fill their tanks and are struggling.  I also asked the Taoiseach what specific request was made of the European Commission.  Have we sought a derogation in respect of the VAT directives?  How long will this process take?  What ask has been made?  As the Taoiseach is aware, we believe we should look for a zero rate for a defined period of time.  Is that what has been sought?</p></speech>

I said that to her already.  We have sought a derogation in respect of the application of the rules around the VAT directive and the energy tax directive, which covers excise.  Basically, we have sought that if we reduce our VAT rate, because we have an historical derogation already in this regard and already have one of the lower VAT rates on energy now, of 13.5%-----</p></speech>

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I appreciate that.  I also welcome the Taoiseach back.  F&aacute;ilte ar ais.  I pay tribute to my colleague, and the outgoing leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Kelly, for his immense work, commitment and contribution to the party, to the House and to public debate over many years.</p>  <p>  My solidarity and that of the Labour Party is with the people of Ukraine, who for the past month have been enduring the horrific war crimes and the brutal Russian invasion and bombardment.  I have just come from the funeral of Pierre Zakrzewski.  I was honoured to receive an invitation to attend from Michelle and his family.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, was also there.  I pay tribute to the immense bravery of Mr. Zakrzewski and that of his colleagues, war reporters and journalists, who have brought us news of the atrocities and shone a spotlight on the war crimes being committed daily in Ukraine by Russia and Putin's brutal regime.  </p>  <p>  There is a moral and political imperative on us to do more to support the people of Ukraine through all the peaceful and humanitarian means at our disposal.  </p> <p>We have supported Ukraine's application for accession to the EU, which is very welcome, and we have moved with a number of EU states on that.  We have opened our doors to refugees fleeing Ukraine and I pay tribute to the many people across Ireland welcoming refugees and doing so much to support refugees coming here.</p> <p> I call again for the expulsion of the Russian ambassador from Ireland.  If EU member states do not act in concert in such action, as would be ideal, we should move to do it unilaterally.  The time has come when we see the horrors of Mariupol and the horrors being rained down on the people of Ukraine.  It is now incumbent on us to do this.</p> <p> Remaining conscious of the carnage and loss of life in Ukraine, I believe the Government should be doing more to support people through the fallout of the war in Ukraine, which has compounded the three crises facing people across the country today.  There is a crisis in the cost of living, with rising inflation; a crisis in fuel and energy security and supply; and, of course, the existential climate emergency or crisis.  The effects of the terrible war in Ukraine are, among other things, posing a threat to the limited but nonetheless welcome gains we saw at an international level in reducing emissions at COP26 and our own welcome ambitious targets in the climate action Act.</p> <p> We know European countries are seeking ways to reduce reliance on Russian oil and gas and I have called for Ireland at an EU level to do more to push for a full embargo on Russian oil and gas.  In order to do that, we must ensure we do not look to other fossil fuels in that period as that is not the approach we should be taking.  For example, there are reports that nine liquefied natural gas terminals are due to be constructed on this island, with eight in this jurisdiction, over coming years, and that is concerning.  It would be concerning to see us locking ourselves into that when instead we should be looking at ramping up our renewables and our capacity in renewables.  We are seeing concerns being expressed by Wind Energy Ireland and others about how we can achieve those targets.</p> <p> What is the Government doing on a process to expel the Russian ambassador?  What is the Government doing to ensure we can have energy security without further reliance on fossil fuels?</p></speech>

I pay tribute to the Deputy's predecessor as leader, Deputy Alan Kelly.  Notwithstanding the odd spat we enjoyed a good relationship.  His heart was always in the public interest and of that there can be no doubt.  I appreciated his constructive leadership in the teeth of the Covid-19 crisis.</p>  <p>  I concur with much of what the Deputy has said in respect of the Ukrainian crisis.  I express my sympathies to Pierre's family.  I was invited to the service but was at Cabinet so my aide-de-camp and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, represented the Cabinet.  His death illustrates the vital importance of modern media and the bravery and courage of journalists in battle zones.  They shine a light on atrocities and the barbaric attacks on civilisation, including citizens and households, the indiscriminate bombings of towns and people and the horrendous human trauma visited on the women, children and men of Ukraine.  We do not often reflect on the degree to which members of the media put their lives literally on the line to bring the truth to us.  We see in authoritarian regimes, and in Russia itself, what happens with the suppression of anybody who voices dissent: it is savage, it is severe, it is imprisonment.  It is important we remind ourselves of the importance in our society of the tenets of democracy, including separation of powers, including on the judicial side, the freedom of media and the necessary tension between all the different pillars.</p>  <p>  On sanctions, we sought to act in unison all along with our fellow European member states in the belief that this has the greatest impact.  To date, the economic sanctions have been severe and unprecedented.  The fact they happened with the United States, the European Union and others was powerful.  Last week we saw very strong unity from the United States and Europe together, along with Japan, Canada and the United Kingdom, saying we are democracies and we stand with the people of Ukraine.  That is impactful.</p>  <p>  On the diplomatic side we have also sought to work with others and will continue to do so.</p> <p>We will keep all of those issues under review in respect of diplomatic sanctions or initiatives to illustrate the country's dissatisfaction, to put it mildly, or outrage at the war.  I refer also to other activities that are under way in the name of diplomacy but may not necessarily be bona fide diplomacy.<br/><br/>On climate change, perhaps the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will also give me a few extra seconds.</p></speech>

I also appreciate his comments about the importance of war reporting.  I absolutely agree with him that this is an attack on democracy.  It is a brutal and unprovoked attack on a peaceful sovereign state.  We have to be absolutely clear in our condemnation of Russian action and our solidarity with Ukraine.  It is in that spirit that I offer constructively my view that we should be doing more as a neutral country through non-military means to express that condemnation.  Just as we have seen Ireland moving along with other nations to support Ukraine's application for accession to the EU, so too should we be moving with like-minded nations, even if we do not have full agreement across the EU, on more stringent diplomatic measures such as expulsions of diplomats.  I think that is one way, along with the other things we are doing, that we as a neutral State can show our outright condemnation.</p>  <p>  On the issue of climate, I ask the Taoiseach again about how the construction of new gas-fired plants is compatible with meeting our targets on renewables, particularly as there are already so many concerns about whether we can, in fact, meet those targets with offshore wind development.</p></speech>

We are making good progress on the contribution of renewables to electricity where I think we are at 41% or 43%.  The point is that gas will be a transitional backup fuel for a long time, behind our renewables effort.  The Deputy is correct that this war means we have to double down on renewables.  However, alongside and parallel with renewables, we will need gas.  We have to be clear about that.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications has been working for quite some time on an energy security review.  The war has thrown into sharp focus our dependency on imported fossil fuels but also vulnerabilities across Europe in terms of security of supply.  That is why Europe is moving strongly on liquefied natural gas now to stop its dependency on Russian gas and oil.  The German Government is making it very clear that it is going to reduce its dependency and it is very highly dependent.  We are going to have to watch the energy security side of the equation as well.  We are focused particularly on next winter.</p></speech>

Gu&iacute;m gach rath ar cheannaire nua an Lucht Oibre freisin.  It is hard to remember any time since the Good Friday Agreement when the political infrastructure in the North of Ireland was in such chaos.  In the North today, there are 44,000 people on housing waiting lists and 250,000 people have been on health waiting lists for more than a year.  That is one in seven people in the North of Ireland.  Some 300,000 men, women and children are living in poverty in the North.  A cost-of-living crisis is engulfing families every day yet the Executive charged with fixing the situation is crashed.</p>  <p>  For the government of any society that is dealing with such a confluence of crises to be suspended would not be tolerated in any other democracy in the world.  The truth of the matter is that the Good Friday Agreement has been gutted.  The Executive is not working at all.  The North-South Ministerial Council, which was a significant reason for nationalists to support the Good Friday Agreement, is not working either.  There is no sign of resolution.  The DUP states that if nationalists hold the position of First Minister after the elections, they may not hold the position of Deputy First Minister.  Shockingly, even after the people of the North get to cast their votes on 5 May, the DUP is stating that it may not return to any Executive.  The DUP has approximately 8% of the vote in the island of Ireland.</p> <p>It is polling at about 19% of the vote in the North of Ireland at the moment.  A total of 85% of the population of Ireland, North and South, voted for the Good Friday Agreement.  Such an obvious violation of the democratic will of the people would not be tolerated in any other democracy on the planet.  Right now, in the streets, the UDA and UVF are still active, yet British Government officials are still meeting with them and the DUP considers them stakeholders.  Today, we learned that the Northern Ireland Secretary, Brandon Lewis, has said he will not bring forward Irish language legislation in Westminster before May's assembly elections.  This Irish language Act has been promised for 15 years.  Indeed, Sinn F&eacute;in returned to Stormont in January 2020 after previously collapsing the Executive because it said it had achieved an Irish language Act.  In a combination of bad faith by London and naivete from Sinn F&eacute;in, we found out this morning that the commitment was hocus-pocus all along.</p> <p> The British and Irish Governments are co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement but both Governments are not co-guaranteeing anything at the moment.  The Government is sitting on its hands, keeping its head down and hoping the crisis will go away.  It cannot be ignored any longer.  The Taoiseach was in Washington two weeks ago.  The White House is one of the few cards we have in terms of leverage to protect the Good Friday Agreement.</p></speech>

In my meeting with the President, he was very strong on that.  I briefed him on the current situation in Northern Ireland in respect of the Executive and the fact it was not operational, given what had happened, that elections were pending and that, from our perspective, a lot of work will be needed in the aftermath of those elections to restore the institutions.</p>  <p>  On the socioeconomic front and the political front, I always have been very consistent in saying that the institutions should never be undermined and should never be collapsed by anybody or by any political party.  If the people elect one to the assembly and then to the Executive, one should take one's seat and one's position on the Executive and discharge one's duties on behalf of the people for the full duration of that parliamentary cycle.  Unfortunately, the history of the Good Friday Agreement, the assembly and the Executive is that, too often, the default position has been either to withdraw for periods from the Executive or to collapse it when different crises emerge.  That has been a very significant problem in terms of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement which, in turn, has weakened people's respect and esteem for the institutions.  If we compare consistent surveys in terms of opinion on the assembly versus the Scottish Parliament, there is a marked difference.  I would put forward that the basis for this is that, in Scotland, there has not been a similar interruption and the Government there is perceived to be working for its people.  I acknowledge that the Scottish Parliament has some more powers, but the North has been interrupted too much by collapse.  This recent collapse is unacceptable.  It should not have happened and it is wrong for it to occur.  I have been very consistent about that.</p>  <p>  There have been numerous commitments at this stage regarding the Irish language Act.  The Secretary of State committed to Sinn F&eacute;in that he would bring it in at the Westminster Parliament.  In my view, that promise should be fulfilled.  When agreements are made, agreements should be honoured.</p>  <p>  We have been working extremely hard in endeavouring to create the right environment and framework for a resolution of the protocol issue, which stems from the Brexit issue.  Brexit was passed and we accept the decision of the British people but no one, particularly on the British Government side, properly thought through the implications of Brexit for the Good Friday Agreement itself or for relationships within the island of Ireland.  The protocol was designed to be a resolution mechanism for those issues.  In our view, the evidence now is increasingly showing, from talking to people in Northern Ireland industry, business, farming and agriculture, that the protocol is actually helping economic development in the North, particularly in terms of potential foreign direct investment, FDI.  The signs are good and, in fact, investment queries are increasing because of the fact the protocol gives access to the European Single Market and the UK market.  No one within Northern Ireland has said to us they want to be cut off from the Single Market.</p> <p>I met Vice President &Scaron;efčovič in Washington and had lunch with him and Mr. Richard Neal, head of Friends of Ireland, again going through the efforts and initiatives of Vice President &Scaron;efčovič of this issue.</p></speech>

It is gutted and needs to be fixed, but not with a sticking plaster to get it up and running with some pretend compromise that will never be implemented.  The current arrangements are a recipe for dysfunction and instability.  The political institutions in the North have to be reformed.</p>  <p>  I take the Taoiseach's fine words on the fact that the Stormont Executive and Assembly should never be collapsed, but I want to know from him how it can be stopped from being collapsed.  What the people of the North of Ireland want to know is how to stop the Executive in the North from being collapsed.  The only way that can be done is through the reform of the political institutions in the North of Ireland.  The North&ndash;South Ministerial Council is collapsed at the moment.  That is illegal according to a recent court judgment.  There must be a penalty for that illegality.  We have to change the law relating to the political institutions to prevent a party on 8% of the vote on the island of Ireland from bringing down the institutions.  What steps will the Taoiseach take to make the reforms real?</p></speech>

Today saw the release of the latest<i>daft.ie</i>sales report, which shows that the average listed price nationwide in the first quarter of 2022 was &euro;299,000, up 8.4% on the same period in 2021, with the largest increases in Connacht&ndash;Ulster, where prices rose by 20.1% in the year to March.  This is indicative of the systemic failure of the housing policies being pursued by the Government that the Taoiseach leads.</p><p>The social media commentary on this issue consistently refers to the stories of people who are locked out of the market through their inability to access mortgages.  A combination of high prices and low wages resulting from the extremist ideological position pursued by the Taoiseach and his partners in government to satisfy their free-marketeer masters comes at the expense of ordinary citizens and it is unsustainable.  Let us consider the knock-on effects of this failure and the most vulnerable in society.  It is a real test of how Government policy is working, or, in this case, not working.</p><p>Just an hour ago, I received an email from parents and friends of people with intellectual disabilities in south Donegal.  They provided me with the names of 17 people in my immediate area for whom there is no provision for sheltered accommodation.  One man has been on the social housing list for 16 years.  Many of the elderly parents of those affected are sole caregivers and worry about their children's future beyond their lifetimes.  Can you imagine the stress this puts on parents and the anxiety associated with wondering every day who will care for their loved ones when they are gone? </p><p>Approved housing bodies operating in Donegal have told me that financial viability modelling constrains their ability regarding project approval in towns and villages across the county outside Letterkenny.  There is housing need but the bodies are not allowed to meet it.  This is compounded by housing assistance payments, HAPs, that have been stagnant for six years in the face of a 20% rent increase in Donegal over the same period.  I raised this three weeks ago with the T&aacute;naiste.  It is pushing people into poverty, yet we see no action.</p><p>The income limits for social housing eligibility have not been reviewed since 2011.  It is depressing to read the litany of parliamentary questions tabled by Members on this topic and the ministerial responses that blatantly ignore the questions asked.  Will the Government urgently review the HAP and social housing income thresholds to address the cost-of-living crisis?</p> <p>Will he explain the Government's policy on the provision of sheltered accommodation for vulnerable adults so that I can go back to my constituents, many of whom are watching this debate today, with an answer for them regarding the long-term care of their adult children?</p></speech>

Access to housing is fundamental to people's sense of well-being, security, stability and health, and for us as a broader society in terms of our progress as a nation.  That is why we have, on a whole-of-government approach, developed the Housing for All strategy, with significant resources put at the disposal of that strategy, namely &euro;4 billion a year every year over the next five years and beyond.</p><p>I am in no doubt as to the scale of the challenge and the need to, at a minimum, get to 33,000 or 34,000 houses built per annum in this country.  That will take a variety of forms, from social housing to private housing, affordable housing, cost rental and the HAP initiative.  We are building more social housing now and reducing, over time, dependency on HAP.  For the time being, given the scale of the HAP provision over the past decade, it will be necessary to enable people to access social housing.  </p><p>The decisions we have taken represent watershed interventions in the housing market.  Covid impacted us over the past two years, with the two lockdowns in 2020 and 2021.  On the positive side, the number of new builds commenced in 2021 was 31,000, the highest figure since 2008.  Approximately 20,000 houses were completed in 2021, notwithstanding the lockdown.  That is not enough.  Until we get an adequate supply of houses, we will not be able to deal with all of the manifestations of the housing crisis in all their forms.  </p><p>Approximately 40,000 planning permissions were granted in the year to quarter 3 of 2021.  The challenge for 2022 is to maintain that momentum.  Inflation has proved to be problematic.  As we discussed earlier, the massive increases in the cost of living and construction materials are now having an impact on the pricing of house construction and the price of housing more generally.  </p><p>Regarding approved social housing bodies, I ask the Deputy to send the detail of what he has raised to me because we have the capital and we are supporting many approved social housing bodies in respect of the provision of social housing.  I am not <i>au fait </i>with the specifics of the sheltered housing problem to which the Deputy referred in Donegal, but funding is there for approved social housing bodies to complete projects.  Our approach is a constructive and proactive one, operating with approved social housing bodies to get as many projects as we can started and completed.  That is our objective.  We do not want to frustrate people and we do not want any barriers to frustrate organisations and approved social housing bodies in that regard.  </p><p>On HAP, there are flexibilities within the scheme in terms of increases over and both the normal threshold in given situations.</p></speech>

That is true, but the Government has failed miserably, and is continuing to fail miserably, to solve or deal with the issue because it has focused entirely on the private housing market to solve this issue, and the private sector will not do it.  The only way to deal with this issue is through a public building programme.</p>  <p>  A family of four earning &euro;28,000 a year cannot get on the housing list in Donegal and will never, ever be able to buy a house in Donegal.  That is the reality of the situation.  That is what the Taoiseach is missing in everything he is saying and the facts he is throwing out regarding what is being done.  These people are continuously being left behind because the Government is not dealing with them.  None of its housing policies will deal with those people and they will not get on the housing list because they are not allowed onto it.  The Government's policies stop that.  The reason the Government will not let them on the housing list is because the housing list would balloon through the roof straightaway, and that would be a massive failure that would expose the Government housing policies for what they are.  The reality is that the policy is not working.  Public housing bodies and solutions led by local authorities are the only way to deal with the issue.</p></speech>

There is a very strong social housing construction component in Housing for All.  It is the largest component.  In 2022, we will deliver close to 12,000 social homes, the highest number ever, of which 9,000 will be new builds.  In addition, since the Government came into office more than 18 months ago we have focused strongly on voids, as has the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  In the past 18 months, 5,500 social homes have been brought back into use.  Again, we have put effort into that and we wanted an urgency attached to that.  In the current context, we are saying to local authorities that there should be no excuse for houses being left vacant.  When people leave homes for different reasons, those houses should be reoccupied very quickly thereafter.  There will be no toleration.  We are saying to local authorities that they cannot allow social housing stock remain idle.  This year, we have provided funding for 1,500 void homes to be remediated and brought back into use.  There is a very strong social housing component.  In addition, there is cost rental, which will be a significant measure.  It will take time to ramp up.</p></speech>

If the Taoiseach cares to see them, members of the industry who are protesting outside the gates of Leinster House.  They are not known for protesting but their family lives, incomes and their industry are on the line.  The paltry &euro;7 million offered by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, is an insult to them.  They need a package of &euro;50 million and a further &euro;50 million that they intend to pay back.  What other group in society has paid back money it got in Covid supports?

We can all agree that women have waited long enough for these services.  Certainly, Irish language speakers have waited long enough.  As the Taoiseach will know, the British Government has again demonstrated bad faith on these matters.  Will he tell us whether he has spoken to or will speak to the British Government to establish the dates on which it will deliver on both of these commitments?  In his recent meeting with the British Prime Minister, did he ask about an tAcht Gaeilge or the British Government's intentions to honour the very clear-cut commitments made not only to Sinn F&eacute;in, but also to the Irish Government and all of the parties in the North?</p></speech>

The Minister for Foreign Affairs has already discussed it with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  It is my understanding that the Secretary of State is committed to putting the legislation in place but not until after the election.  I will say that the commitments that have been given in respect of the language Act should be honoured because, when governments give commitments on such important matters, they should follow through on them.</p></speech>

Last week, I met with Councillor Robert O'Donoghue and representatives of Welgro Produce, a young company of growers which is at the cutting edge of this industry and which has won awards for its sustainable practices.  They are the kind of people who are going to bring our growing sector into the 21st century.  The company is being crippled by energy costs which may see it go out of business within weeks.  If we are to get where we need to be with regard to food security and a climate-resilient growing industry, we need to protect such companies through the transitional period we are now in, which the Taoiseach referenced in response to a question from Deputy Bacik earlier.</p> <p>What is the Government doing for these growers?  What is its plan?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-29a.111" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032900015#O00200"><p>As the Deputy knows, the Government more broadly has moved to reduce excise and VAT on energy products in the last package.  We have also taken specific measures for hauliers and have a separate tillage initiative related to the growth of protein crops, grain and mixed-species swards.  The Deputy is talking about the horticultural sector, in essence.  As I have said, the Government has taken broad measures on taxation more generally.  We continually review different sectors of the economy to see what we can do to be of assistance to them.  The Government cannot keep coming forward with measures every week.  We need to look at this over the medium term.  We now believe the impact of this war will be a medium-term one.  We need to take an annual prospective of expenditure, revenue and the whole fiscal situation as it is affected by all of this.</p></speech>

We all watched on with a sense of dismay and bewilderment at the scenes of would-be travellers crammed into the departure lounge, some unable to go on their holidays owing to the absence of security staff.  What assurances has the Government sought from the Dublin Airport Authority that these scenes will not be repeated?  Although 1,000 redundancies were offered to security staff in Dublin Airport during Covid, only 100 people have been rehired.  There is a rehiring process going on at the moment, offering &euro;14.40 per hour for 20 hours guaranteed and another 20 hours of flexibility.  That will not be enough to secure the essential staff needed to ensure the airport is secure and well managed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-29a.113" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032900015#O00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, in the Department of Transport will be engaging with Dublin Airport in respect of this.  There are issues with recruitment.  Notwithstanding all the challenges facing the economy, the reality is we have never had so many people employed.  We have had real challenges with recruitment of staff in key sectors of the economy since we emerged from the latest Covid crisis.  We will do everything we can.  There are existing workplace arrangements to deal with the latter point the Deputy raised.</p>  <p>  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I beg your indulgence and that of the House.  Deputy Bacik asked me earlier about diplomatic expulsions.  I do not want to be accused subsequently of not fully informing the House.  As her question was coming through, the Department of Foreign Affairs had indeed summoned the Russian ambassador.  I was loath to override what would be normal diplomatic protocols.  Under the 1961 Vienna Convention, four senior officials of the Russian Embassy have been asked to leave the State because their activities are not in accordance with international standards of diplomatic behaviour.  I received security advice yesterday and the Minister for Foreign Affairs also received security advice.  Yesterday I met our national security team.  Under Article 9 of the 1961 Vienna Convention, we have taken these actions.  However, we believe that diplomatic channels between the Russian Federation and the State should stay open in the interests of us conveying our abhorrence of the war, maintaining diplomatic channels as a principle and protecting Irish citizens in Russia and elsewhere.</p></speech>

I will not hold my breath on that, obviously.</p>  <p>  I again ask about the &euro;1,000 that was promised to healthcare workers.  The applause given to those healthcare workers for the work they did during the Covid pandemic - and are still doing - rings hollow now when the Government still has not paid these healthcare workers the &euro;1,000 promised.  Community swabbers have contacted us and I asked questions about that.  It seems that community swabbers may not be getting this payment.  There have been suggestions that phlebotomy nurses will probably not get the &euro;1,000.  The Government seems to be penny-pinching and that is why these negotiations are dragging on.  </p> <p>The Government is looking for reasons to exclude healthcare workers, every one of whom deserves as an absolute minimum the &euro;1,000 payment that was promised.  Why has the Government not paid it and why is it trying to exclude healthcare workers from benefiting from this payment?</p></speech>

It is intended that the payments process will be instructed to commence this week.  The Government has committed very significant resources.  The Government wants to do this.  We are not holding back at all.  I will engage again with the Minister and the HSE in this regard.  It is &euro;1,000 and it will not be subject to income tax, USC or PRSI.  The announcement also made provision for a <i>pro rata </i>application of the payment.  It will be extended to those equivalent healthcare workers in private nursing homes and hospices, who also experienced very severe outbreaks and burdens during the pandemic which staff have had to manage.</p></speech>

A growing number of employers in the healthcare, food processing, hospitality, agriculture and transport sectors are battling through a system that is fraught with long delays and refusals based on minor human errors on their applications.  This triggers an appeals process that is taking up to 18 weeks to complete.  The vast majority of these errors could be rectified by simply communicating directly with the applicant.  I have been inundated with calls from exasperated people in all of these sectors across Tipperary who are unable to secure staff in Ireland or within the EU.  The lack of a workforce is having a negative impact on productivity, curtailing production, damaging exports and suppressing economic growth.  Unless a way is found to fast-track these non-EU work permits, many businesses in these sectors face collapse.  I call on the Government to introduce a system that will both simplify and expedite the process of obtaining work permits for the sectors whose survival depends on them.</p></speech>

A plan of action is being implemented by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to meet the challenges of this increased demand and to reduce the processing time, which has built up recently, as the Deputy said.  Staffing actions include recruitment of additional permanent and temporary staff which will increase the permanent processing capacity by over 100% and overall capacity by over 200% from November levels.  Some 898 employment permits were processed last week, which is more than triple the 259 processed in the same week last year.  Waiting times for critical skills employment permits are seven weeks for trusted partners and nine weeks for standard applications.  These waiting times stood at 14 weeks for trusted partners and 21 weeks for standard applications only seven weeks ago, so progress has been made.  The backlog continues to fall and it is now at 8,851, which is over 2,000 below its Christmas 2021 peak.  The rate of applications in 2022 has stabilised at a rate of 32,000 applications per annum, which is considerably higher than the 27,000 received in 2021, which itself was well up on previous years.  I spoke to the T&aacute;naiste yesterday and to the Secretary General of the Department.  We want those numbers down as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

Since then, I have raised it with the T&aacute;naiste; the Minister, Deputy Humphreys; and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, among others, in trying to find a solution before the world-famous Dursey cable car ceases operations this Thursday evening for 240 days due to the urgent repairs to be carried out on the towers following storm damage.  This is a cable car, I may add, opened by the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, in 1969.  As we stand right now, on Friday morning of this week islanders, farmers who have land on the islands and holidaymakers will not have a service of any type from the island to the mainland or from the mainland to the island.</p>  <p>  A proposal from the local authority for funding for a temporary ferry service was made to the Department of Rural and Community Development at the end of last week for the 240 days the cable car will be out of operation.  I fully respect that the Taoiseach would not have had the time to hear of these proposals but, for the sake of the residents, farmers and tourists who visit the world-famous Dursey Island and the Beara Peninsula, will the Taoiseach meet with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and find the funding to secure a ferry service to the island by this Thursday?</p></speech>

I welcome the fact community welfare officers are at the airports, welcoming and resourcing Ukrainian refugees.  Given the urgent needs people are going to have in the future, particularly with another increase of 6.7% in inflation over the next couple of months, we must bring in a fund like this, separate to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is for a different purpose.  We are talking about a specific hardship fund so people can access community welfare officers for food and fuel in the community.  It is very important that we do this and the Government should respond.</p></speech>

Even though those people have taken their case to the Residential Tenancies Board, the landlords of those apartments are employing intimidatory and illegal tactics to force them to leave their homes.  The tactics include sending in heavies to change the locks unilaterally and ordering people to get their furniture together and get out on the street within 30 minutes.  Some of those tactics have worked and some of the more vulnerable people have actually left.  The Taoiseach will be aware that these tactics are not only reprehensible and immoral, but highly illegal and reminiscent of the behaviour of the absentee landlords during the great Famine of the 1840s.  This is not the 1840s.

I do not need to remind the Taoiseach that we are in an energy crisis, that we have introduced one of the most ambitious energy retrofit schemes seen anywhere in Europe and that we have agreed the feed-in tariff scheme.  What we need now are the planning exemptions on solar panels.  We have potentially up to 2 GW of solar in this country on farm buildings, community buildings, schools, houses and apartments - everywhere.  There is massive potential.

There are almost 7,000 people on the housing list in Kildare and there is a ten-year to 12-year wait for allocations.  There is no sense of urgency in dealing with this issue.  We need to build public homes on public land.  If there is not enough suitable public land, we need to acquire it through compulsory purchase order.  It is not acceptable for families with young children to live long-term in substandard accommodation or in hotels and emergency accommodation.  We need urgent action and a strong constitutional amendment which drives an ethos of cost rental and publicly funded housing to deliver it.

There are 2,065 retained firefighters operating out of 197 stations across the State and there is a problem in relation to staffing.  I have raised this before because there needs to be a sense of urgency around this.  In May 2021, the management board of the National Directorate of Fire and Emergency Management was mandated to set up a review of the model of retained fire services.  That is still dragging on.  We are nearly a year into that.  A private company was procured to do it.  The last reply I got on it stated that the expectation of the project team is that the final report would be submitted to the management board of the national directorate by the end of the year.  For God's sake, it is a year and a half.  There is a staffing issue in smaller stations in outlying areas like Rathdowney, Stradbally, Mountmellick, and Abbeyleix.</p></speech>

What is the update on the module building the Government is looking at?  I heard the Taoiseach speak about HAP today.  As the Taoiseach knows, if you qualify to go on the local authority housing list, you get HAP.  I checked <i>daft.ie</i>in Carlow recently.  Five properties are available.  By the way, it is &euro;1,200 to rent.  The biggest issue is between rural towns and cities.  There is a discretion in the local authorities and in Carlow and other rural towns it is 20%.  In Dublin or any of the other cities, it is 50%.  That is unfair and not right.  I ask that all local authorities get the 50% discretion.</p></speech>

The key issue with housing is supply.  We simply need to get more houses built more quickly.  That is key to dealing with the housing crisis.  Regarding HAP, there are different rates across the country.  They are not all uniform and the cities have much higher levels of rent, unfortunately, which have necessitated more flexibility around HAP payments.

Kerry, Carlow, Wicklow, Dublin, Sligo and the Mourne Mountains are locations where firefighters were called out to tackle wildfires in the past couple of weeks.  It is the time of year when we see a spate of upland burnings, even though the legal season ends on 1 March.  There have been none, thankfully, so far in the Comeraghs in my county of Waterford.</p>  <p>  I recognise and accept there is a distinction between the burning of agricultural waste and upland burning, but we are in a biodiversity crisis.  In this context, every habitat matters.  I have half an eye to the nature restoration loans coming down the tracks from Europe.  Eoghan Daltun's Twitter account shows what our hills and mountains could and perhaps should be like.  Is the necessary enforcement in place to make sure these restrictions are observed?  Are fines being issued?  Probably more important, are we moving quickly enough to make sure farmers are supported in moving to better land management practices in upland areas?</p></speech>

However, a substantial portion of the sector has been excluded.  This week I have been contacted by Gleeson Concrete, which operates in Donohill, County Tipperary, as well as north Cork and Limerick.  They are reliant on their hauliers but pointed out that while some delivery fleet personnel in the industry hold a haulage licence and will benefit from the emergency measure, the majority of International Coaching Federation member companies are own account operators and therefore not required to hold a haulage licence.  As a result, they are ineligible for the Government's support measures despite incurring the same level of cost increases as licensed hauliers.  Coach and school bus operators have also fallen foul of this with school transport operators locked into contracts of up to five years at a time.  Is the Government giving consideration to extending the measures to the many operators in the State that do not meet the limiting criteria it has set down?  Over 6,000 people are directly employed in the sector.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, we cannot do everything.  There are limits to what governments can do and they cannot 100% compensate every situation.  We have to bear that in mind.  We are conscious of the impact of the war, the issues arising from supply chain difficulties and inflationary pressures.  We have to look at this over the 12-month cycle.</p></speech>

The Government response has been far too slow and underwhelming.  For pig farmers, those escalating input costs have been compounded by depressed prices.  They are in a battle for the survival of the sector.  They are protesting at Kildare Street today and pleading with Government to intervene further.</p>  <p>  This is not a month-old crisis.  I have been raising it with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine since September, as have many other Deputies.  Does the Taoiseach accept the Government needs to do more?  I welcome the limited moves that have been made but much more needs to be done.  The sector has said it requires a &euro;100 million package, about half of which can be provided in loans.  Will the Taoiseach utilise the Brexit adjustment reserve, the EU crisis reserve and any other measures at his disposal to save the sector?</p></speech>

It is a good industry in terms of viability and had been doing well.  Some market distortions arose.  There is a perfect storm at the moment with the war in Ukraine.  We have taken initial steps to assist the industry.  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, is in constant engagement with the farming organisations and State entities to see what can be done to respond further to the situation and to help.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the Cork-Limerick road.  The route selection tomorrow will be an important milestone in relation to that project.  Anyone who has travelled that road knows there are too many bottlenecks, including Buttevant, Charleville and many others.

My Department continues to work at the centre to ensure that policies developed support the Government's commitment to develop Ireland in a sustainable way which supports economic development and social progress.  It achieves this mainly through the Cabinet committee structure.</p>  <p>  Through the work of the ten Cabinet committees, supported by my Department, a range of cross-government work has been advanced during 2021 under the new strategy statement, including: management of the whole-of-government response to Covid-19, including the national vaccination programme roll-out; the economic recovery plan, which was published in June, and implementation of which is helping to drive a jobs-rich recovery and which will support the economy in transitioning towards a decarbonised and digital economy; publication of the Housing for All plan, an ambitious and far-reaching plan to address the provision of housing, to increase the supply of housing and to provide a sustainable housing system into the future; supporting cross-government work to manage the ongoing economic and political impacts of Brexit; driving the delivery of our commitments on a shared island on a whole-of-government basis, through the shared island unit in my Department and the shared island fund; supporting Ireland's role in Europe and the world, including through my participation in the European Council, Ireland's seat on the UN Security Council and with respect to continuing EU-UK discussions on the Northern Ireland protocol; delivery of an initial well-being framework for Ireland and a supporting information hub, which are being developed to better understand and measure our progress as a country; the establishment of a social dialogue unit in my Department, which is working to co-ordinate and support the Government's overall approach to social dialogue; work on the Future of Media Commission, which has now concluded its work; completion of the work of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality; the launch of the revised national development plan, setting out the roadmap for investment of &euro;165 billion in new and upgraded infrastructure over the decade ahead; supporting the development of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act  2021 and the Climate Action Plan 2021, which are key elements of a suite of measures introduced to fundamentally alter Ireland's approach to climate  change; and three legislative programmes published during 2021 setting out priority legislation across government.</p></reply>

I understand these four senior officials have been identified as carrying out activities not "in accordance with [...] standards of diplomatic behaviour".  Will the Taoiseach inform the House who these senior officials are and what behaviour marked them out for expulsion?  We all dearly hope there will be positive progress at the talks in Istanbul today.  We know that the war must end and that peace and diplomacy must prevail but we have said to the Taoiseach for quite some time that as this illegal war continues and as Russia breaches international law so viciously and with such brazenness, Ireland must exert all possible pressure.  The call had been for the expulsion of the Russian ambassador and all the staff.  Russia should not be left with the cloak of respectability and any diplomatic footprint in Europe.  Will the Taoiseach please set out for us the facts around the expulsion of these four officials?</p></speech>

Does he not have to accept now that it is failing disastrously?  From my clinic, I can tell him about the number of people and families coming in, most of whom are working and who are facing eviction or who are already homeless.  They have no prospect of finding rented accommodation under the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme or social housing.  The numbers are going through the roof.  I will give one example.  A man, his ill wife and their family of five are facing eviction on 2 April.  He is working in one of our Dublin hospitals.  I have another young man who works for D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and he is living in his car.  Another woman, who was previously homeless and is now in a homeless HAP tenancy, is being evicted.  The Dublin place finder service cannot find her a place. She will not go to a hostel, so she is going to end up sleeping in her car.  Another mother, with two kids, is on the housing list.  She works part time and is in receipt of the working family payment.  She has been told that she is over the limit for social housing.  The list goes on.  What does the Taoiseach intend to do for these people who are working but for whom the Government's housing policies have totally failed?</p></speech>

Seven months on, not a single cent has been paid out and now many workers are finding out that they either will not qualify for the full bonus or they will not get anything at all due to the Scrooge-like terms and conditions being applied.  One such group is the Covid-19 community swabbers, who helped to run our testing facilities throughout the country before vaccines were even available and without personal protective equipment, PPE, back in the early days of the pandemic.  They put themselves at risk to help to control the virus, but now many of them are being told they do not count as front-line workers.  I will quote a short excerpt from an email from a woman who worked as a community swabber.  She made the point that "We are the people who worked on the front line, day in and day out, throughout the entire pandemic, at times with sub-par PPE, and for many of us in suboptimal conditions, working in temporary structures, such as army tents in freezing cold snow and blistering heat".  Will the Taoiseach intervene to ensure these people get what they deserve at the very least?</p></speech>

Many people in the North, however, are precluded from accessing that content because of issues around intellectual property rights.  It is particularly the case on the RT&Eacute; Player.  Examples include the Olympics, which are important.  It is the matter of the All-Ireland championships, though, that I want to raise.  We are now only weeks away from them commencing and many people in the North will be unable to access those programmes.  I believe the shared island fund exists to fight cross-Border issues in respect of infrastructure.  Will the Taoiseach's Department identify or examine how the national broadcaster and the shared island fund might work together to create an Internet protocol that will allow everyone in the North to access the RT&Eacute; Player?</p></speech>

The first was to keep the examination as is, the second was to go for a mix of examination and assessment and the third was to abolish the examination and introduce a policy of open access to third-level education, based on increased investment and offering a place to all who wanted one.  Following the student protests of recent years, the first option was never a serious runner.  The students did for that one.  The Government was then left with the option of either reforming or abolishing the examination.  I believe the Government has made the wrong choice.</p>  <p>  To be clear, I welcome the introduction of drama, film and theatre studies onto the curriculum, as well as climate studies.  I am not so mad about there being no proposals to teach more Black and Traveller history, and that there is still no comprehensive, objective sex education.  I put it to the Taoiseach, however, that the Government is choosing here to patch up an examination system that deserves to go and failing to take the opportunity to genuinely open up third-level education now to all who wish to go.  </p></speech>

I certainly did not expect to have such an immediate response to my first set of Leaders' Questions as the leader of the Labour Party.  I thank him and commend him, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, on acting to expel four senior Russian diplomats.  Does this mean that the position of the Russian ambassador is now under threat?  I very much hope the Government will see fit to move to expel him too.  My party, the Labour Party, as an internationalist party and a member of the Party of European Socialists, PES, has consistently stood with the people of Ukraine, and with the people of Syria when they endured horrific bombardment and attack from Putin through the al-Assad puppet regime.  We have also stood with the people of Yemen and Palestine.</p> <p>We can see daily the sort of horrendous suffering people are enduring in Ukraine.  The people of Mariupol are enduring that now just as the people of Aleppo did when it was under siege.  We have a strong track record of solidarity with people under assault and threat from the sort of brutal regime that Putin personifies.  Will the Taoiseach now take further steps to expel Putin's ambassador here, having moved so swiftly and in such a welcome fashion to expel four senior diplomats?</p></speech>

We are doing this under Article 9 of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.  I do not want to divulge the security briefing we received in respect of these individuals but in my view, it is the correct and the right decision in terms of our own national security but also in terms of sending a very clear message about our abhorrence of the war in Ukraine.  The decision is primarily informed by the briefings we have received from security officials in respect of the behaviour of these individuals.  That is why the Department of Foreign Affairs summoned the ambassador today.</p>  <p>  We also wanted to take initiatives of this kind with our colleagues in the EU.  Some of the Baltic states and states on the eastern side of Europe have already taken steps in sending officials back to the Russian Federation.  No member state has yet expelled an ambassador.  We have carried out these measures relating to officials with some countries today and although we worked with other countries on this initiative, it has not been possible to get the full 27 states working on the same agenda.</p>  <p>  With regard to the ambassador, we are anxious to keep channels open and we believe that is important for the protection of citizens and in maintaining a channel to communicate our abhorrence of the war directly to the Russian Federation Government.  This also will enable humanitarian assistance if it is required for Irish citizens in Russia or certain areas of Ukraine if we need to engage with the Russian Federation Government or officials to facilitate humanitarian responses to situations that may arise.  It is important that diplomatic channels are maintained and kept open.  That is the motivation behind the decision not to expel the Russian ambassador at this stage.</p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked a question relating to Housing for All.  I do not accept Housing for All has failed as it is less than a year since its publication.  The Government has been in office now for 21 months and a lot of progress has been made.  We were held back by Covid-19 as the two lockdowns had an impact on construction.  There were nonetheless 31,000 commencements last year, which augurs well for increased supply.  Our aim this year is for 12,000 social houses, 9,000 of which will be built.  We have also brought back 5,500 empty houses or voids within the local authority system.  We have kept a strong focus and resourced local authorities so as not to have houses idle.</p>  <p>  The cost -rental model we are developing is very important.  We need to ramp it up and it will be a very significant feature of giving opportunities to people for affordable rents in future.  That goes along with supply and we must build far more houses than we have been doing as a country.</p></speech>

Again, the Government has given the resources to do this to the Department of Health and HSE.  These are major employers but I am anxious that the front-line workers are suitably provided for with the &euro;1,000 payment we have agreed.  The Government decided this and the implementation is about to begin.  There has been a lot of consultation with unions in respect of this and it is time for it to be implemented.  We are not adopting in any shape or form a Scrooge-like mentality towards it.</p>  <p>  I will engage with Deputy Paul McAuliffe again as he raises a very fair point in respect of the RT&Eacute; Player and the difficulties that citizens in Northern Ireland have in accessing it.  I will engage with him to see what we can do to work with the national broadcaster with a view to being of some assistance if that is possible.</p>  <p>  Deputy Barry raised leaving certificate reform and today's announcement by the Minister, Deputy Norma Foley, is radical and a watershed moment in the history of the leaving certificate.  There will clearly be continuing engagement with stakeholders.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has published the various principles governing the reform.  To have 40% of the process dealt with via continuous assessment is a massive change and it will require much in-service training as well on models of assessment and the science of assessment, which is quite involved.  Teachers used to a State exam may not have had the same level of in-service training as will be required with this process.  It is very exciting that there is to be a new subject of climate change coming to the curriculum, along with drama and film and so on.</p></speech>

It contained recommendations for the social and economic regeneration of Dublin's north-east inner city.  This report has been supplemented by the publishing of the North East Inner City Strategic Plan 2020-2022.</p>  <p>  In June 2017, an independent chairperson was appointed by the Government to the north-east inner city programme implementation board.  Members of the board include representatives from relevant Departments and agencies, businesses and the local community.  The board is assisted in its work by six subgroups.  They are enhancing policing; maximising educational, training and employment opportunities; family well-being; enhancing community well-being and the physical landscape; substance use, misuse and inclusion health; and alignment of services.  The board and its subgroups continue to meet monthly to oversee and progress the implementation of the Mulvey report and the North East Inner City Strategic Plan 2020-2022.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department work closely with the board, the subgroups and the dedicated programme office based on Se&aacute;n McDermott Street.  The chair of the board reports to an oversight group of senior officials chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach.  This group supports and oversees the work of the north-east inner city programme implementation board, ensures strong and active participation by all relevant Departments and agencies in the north-east inner city initiative and deals with any barriers or issues highlighted by the chair of the programme implementation board.</p>  <p>  The Cabinet committee on social affairs and equality provides political oversight of the north-east inner city initiative.  The Government is committed to supporting and investing in the north-east inner city community.  From 2016 to 2021, inclusive, the Government provided more than &euro;30.7 million in funding to ensure the board had the necessary resources to achieve targets and fulfil its ambition.  In 2021, the Government provided funding of &euro;6.5 million to the initiative and for 2022 this funding has been increased by a further &euro;1 million to &euro;7.5 million.  On 2 December last, I launched the 2021 progress report for the north-east inner city initiative, which highlights all of the work progressed throughout the year.  This report, along with all of the progress reports since 2017, is available on the north-east inner city, NEIC, website.</p>  <p>  The programme implementation board continues to implement the remaining actions set out in the Mulvey report and the North East Inner City Strategic Plan 2020-2022, as well as adopting a greater focus on long-term sustainable outcomes while operating in an integrated framework and adding value to the existing service infrastructure.  The Government remains committed to supporting and investing in the north-east inner city community and ensuring that the chairperson and programme implementation board have the necessary resources to help make the area a better place to live and work.</p>  <p>  I very much welcome today's announcement of Government approval of high-level proposals for a national centre for research and remembrance, which will be situated on the site of the former Magdalen laundry on Se&aacute;n MacDermott Street.  The centre will stand as a national memorial to honour all those who were resident in mother and baby homes, industrial schools, Magdalen laundries and related institutions.  It will also involve social housing and an early education provision.  This is very positive news for the north-east inner city.</p></reply>

More to the point, I look forward to seeing the detail of what is proposed for the Magdalen laundry site on Se&aacute;n McDermott Street.</p> <p>This will be a very significant development locally but also nationally and internationally.  It is essential that we get it right in terms of the archive, the site of conscience and the whole area of social housing.  That will mean there has to be a collaborative approach and spirit, and a willing ear to listen not least to the local community and, of course, to the entire community of survivors.  </p> <p> In September 2020, I raised the issue of a review of the NEIC with the Taoiseach.  Initially he was warm towards the idea but he cooled on it.  I want to pitch for it again with him.  It is absolutely imperative that this initiative be reviewed and measured.  I believe the time is ripe for that to happen.  With the outworkings of Covid, the housing crisis and shortfalls in healthcare, particularly in addiction services and supports, and now with people fleeing from Ukraine coming to the north east inner city, the need is more acute than ever for supports, enhanced funding, review and real attention to the community and community development.</p> <p> I wanted to raise the issue of our drugs task force, which disgracefully has been spancelled by people within the HSE.  I have raised the matter with the Taoiseach previously.  I will stop talking now because my minute is over.</p></speech>

While not in my constituency, it is a matter we dealt with many times on Dublin City Council.  It is a site with a significant legacy.  It is also a site where we can demonstrate how we can tackle disadvantage and how early intervention can make a real difference.  The Taoiseach's Department has been doing work in the north inner city for some time and &euro;30 million is a substantial intervention.  It is also the access to senior officials that allows issues to be identified and resolved.</p>  <p>  Has the Department of the Taoiseach considered how that model might be extended outside of the north east inner city?  I have been calling for it in my own area in Ballymun and Finglas.  There are communities throughout Dublin, for example in Darndale, and in Limerick, that could benefit from a targeted approach in tackling the impact of the illegal drugs industry and breaking the cycle of disadvantage.  It is something Fianna F&aacute;il has been committed to for a long time, including when we were in government in the past.  I would like to see us deal with it in this term.  The north east inner city has been getting significant attention.  We now need to see how we can provide those same solutions to other communities throughout the country.</p></speech>

It is something survivors have sought for a long time.  It is very good news.  I also ask for more clarity on the future plans for ongoing funding for the NEIC initiative and, indeed, whether it will or could be expanded to cover other areas.  It is a model that has been effective.  I am grateful to my colleague, Senator Marie Sherlock in Dublin Central, who has brought to my attention the report, No Child Shall Suffer, published last year by the Dublin City Community Co-operative, which is active in the north east inner city.  It really illustrates the impact of child and family poverty and social exclusion, particularly on families and children.  It includes 14 stories, which are pen pictures of the lived experiences of children in the north east inner city communities, showing the need for investment in early years, after-school care and youth work as a critical part of addressing the needs particularly of children and families.  I ask the Taoiseach to commit to ongoing funding for the north east inner city initiative and to tell us if it is envisaged that a similar model might be rolled out in other areas where the needs are very dire.</p></speech>

I have often heard Government spokespeople pay lip service to the idea that we need to move away from the criminal approach to dealing with this problem and take a health-related approach but, in fact, we have not done that at all.  I wonder when we are going to realise that the so-called war on drugs is a disastrous failure and that we need to start to deal with this as a health issue.  We cannot bemoan criminal activity if simultaneously the State effectively criminalises huge cohorts of our young population.  That is what we are doing and the consequences are a total failure that particularly impacts on the most disadvantaged areas.  When are we going to get serious policy change in that area?</p></speech>

The national centre will involve a collaborative spirit.  I will come back to that later.  In terms of the review of the north east inner city initiative that Deputy McDonald has asked for, I have not gone cool on it but we wanted to work through it.  We did the progress report, which in a way is a review of its own.  I think the Deputy is looking for a more comprehensive review.</p>  <p>  I have asked senior officials in my Department, including an assistant secretary on social policy, to look nationally at areas that need interventions of this kind or to map what is out there in different communities.  Deputy McAuliffe raised issues pertaining to Ballymun.  I have met with groups there.  Other communities have also said they could do with a more community-based intervention somewhat similar to the revitalising areas through planning, investment and development, RAPID, programmes of old.  A very good presentation was made to the more recent social affairs Cabinet committee on that issue and how, along with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, on the communities side we can develop a model that would take the best of what is there at the moment and apply it without duplication.  Many different community groups and bodies are involved.  The challenge is to knit that together into a cohesive focal effort and impact on the ground and to have real community capacity on the ground that would be supported by the State, targeted to the areas that need it most.  That is what I am endeavouring to do.</p>  <p>  A review of the north east inner city in that context could be useful for other areas but also of course for the north east inner city itself in terms of moving forward from the base we have now established.  I was recently at the launch of a unique educational project there; the acronym escapes me right now.  It relates to the leaving certificate.  Students in the senior cycle in the college on Se&aacute;n McDermott Street have the capacity to do third-level modules in second level, which equips them for the world of work in technology.  It is very impressive and shows how innovation in education can work in these type of community initiatives as well.  There were young people saying to me that they want to be the next Elon Musk in robotics.  It was fantastic to see the progress they have made.  The private sector was involved with the initiative in terms of technology supports and so on.  There are a lot of lessons to be learned from how this model has worked in some aspects and maybe where it could do better in others.  It seems to me that the implementation side of it is strong and that the personnel charged with implementing it have driven it well.</p>  <p>  I take Deputy McAuliffe's point that a lot of it has to do with providing access to senior officials and that matters in getting things moving on the ground, not just in the north east inner city but in other areas that need this type of approach.  I will come back to the Deputy in respect of the review.  I have not gone cool on it.  I will also revert to the Deputy on the issue around the HSE and the task force.</p>  <p>  I favour a health-based approach to drug addiction as opposed to a criminalisation approach.  There is always a balance to be struck in approaching it.  Essentially we need stronger supports for people who are addicted across the board, be it to alcohol, gambling or drugs.</p> <p>We have to develop a supportive culture but we also must enhance and increase professional capacity to deal with addiction in the strongest possible way.  Health services should be front and centre in that approach.  That is where we are heading as a Government and it is where our policy is focused.</p> <p> I have dealt with Deputy Bacik's points on using this model for other areas.  She referred to the issues raised in the report, No Child Should Suffer.  My view is that we need consistent, long-term funding of areas of disadvantage, to use that phrase, where the metrics are not right, early school-leaving is still too high and patterns of educational attainment are not similar to the average across the country.  As a country, we have very high levels of school completion, but in certain areas of the country, that is not the case.  Therefore, we need consistency.  There has been too much of a stop-start approach.  Initiatives happen, they work for five or ten years and then they are pulled back.  Sometimes, they are pulled back if they are successful, whereas I think we should keep them going if they are successful.  Sometimes, we pull the rug from underneath the providers.</p></speech>

I apologised for the profound generational wrong visited upon Irish mothers and their children who ended up in a mother and baby home or county home and for the shame and stigma to which they were subjected.  As part of that apology, I acknowledged that the State had failed in its duty of care to the mothers and children who spent time in these institutions.  This apology was one of the first steps taken by the Government to respond to the findings of the report.</p>  <p>  The overall response is being driven by the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, who is now working to advance the action plan for survivors and former residents of mother and baby homes and county home institutions.  The plan commits to a suite of 22 actions across eight key themes, namely, a survivor-centred approach, a formal State apology, access to personal information, archiving and databases, education and research, memorialisation, restorative recognition, and dignified burial.</p>  <p>  Today, the Government took a decision to publish the legislation pertaining to the mother and baby institutions payment scheme along with the national centre for research and remembrance related to institutional trauma, which will be strongly resourced by Government.  The information and tracing legislation is making progress in the Oireachtas.  The burials legislation also has been published.  We spoke earlier about the decision that the former Magdalen laundry on Se&aacute;n McDermott Street will be the location of the new national centre for research and remembrance.  The Secretary General of my Department did a lot of work in that respect and there already has been a great deal of collaboration.  That needs to continue.</p>  <p>  People sought information on this earlier.  The intention is that the centre will be a museum and exhibition space, for which the National Museum of Ireland will have responsibility.  It will be an archival, repository and research centre forming part of the National Archives of Ireland.  The latter will be responsible for, and will be resourced so to do, to bring together all the archives pertaining to mother and baby homes, industrial schools and Magdalen laundries.  It will become a centre for academic research, allow for access and will be a centre for solemn reflection and remembrance.  Remote access to digital records will be made available because we are conscious that there must be access to these records from all over the country.  That availability will be made easy.  We will work further with Deputies on this.</p></reply>

The way the State treated Grace was utterly shameful and represents, perhaps, one of the greatest scandals of modern Ireland.  Is the Taoiseach aware of the Alice report, which deals with a case bearing a striking resemblance to the Grace case?  The primary difference is that Alice can speak while Grace is non-verbal.  Alice was removed from her home eventually, after allegations of sexual abuse.  She was placed in a foster home, where there was further physical and sexual abuse.  That abuse was reported repeatedly to social workers and to the Garda but no investigation was undertaken for years.  A total of 16 children were then fostered by the same family.  It is a harrowing case.</p>  <p>  I have the Alice report in my hand only because Alice gave it to me.  I assume the Farrelly commission is focused just on the Grace case.  The real question is how many cases like it are there?  Will the Taoiseach establish a commission to examine the State's response to all historic allegations of abuse of children in State foster care?  Will he apologise to Alice and meet with her?</p></speech>

The homeless figures are accelerating disastrously once again.  Despite all the talk about Housing for All and all the policy measures the Government claims it is taking, the number of people going into homelessness is increasing.  There now are more than 2,500 children who are homeless.  Are they not owed an apology?  They will be marked for life by being in homeless accommodation.</p>  <p>  Will there be an apology for working people, as I mentioned earlier, who are working in our hospitals, local authorities and in Tusla?  I have cited cases in this regard today and on other days.  These people cannot, on their earnings, afford the rents that are out there and, in many cases, they are denied social housing support and are in emergency accommodation.  I met a council worker last week who is sleeping in his car.  He is working for D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and is sleeping in his car.  This is a disastrous failure by the State to meet its most basic obligations.  Does the Taoiseach seriously not think these people deserve an apology from the State for its failure to vindicate their right to secure, affordable housing?</p></speech>

We on the Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth have been working through a number of issues in this area, including improving the information and tracing legislation to deal with many of the concerns and issues of survivors of mother and baby homes and those who were adopted.  I welcome the announcement of the new national centre on Se&aacute;n McDermott Street.  I also welcome the Taoiseach's provision of more detail in this regard, including that the National Museum of Ireland and the National Archives of Ireland will have a strong role in it, which is very important for survivors.</p>  <p>  Will he consider an apology on behalf of the State to another group that has long awaited such an apology or acknowledgement?  I refer to the thalidomide survivors of Ireland.  Last 26 November was the 60th anniversary of the international withdrawal of thalidomide, but this State has failed to offer any acknowledgement of the circumstances in which the drug was not withdrawn in Ireland at that point and continued to be prescribed after that date, with consequent harm caused to children.  Having met with many members of the Irish Thalidomide Association, I am conscious of how anxious they are that their parents, many of whom are now very elderly, would receive a formal acknowledgement from the State as a matter of urgency.  I have sought support from colleagues of all parties and Independent groupings for a cross-party motion expressing our co-ordinated and collegiate response as a parliamentary House to the concerns of thalidomide survivors.  I have heard from Irish Thalidomide Association members on the need to support resumption of mediation between the association and health authorities to address their real and ongoing healthcare needs and ensure all outstanding issues can be resolved.</p></speech>

From what the Deputy has just said to the House, it represents a shocking situation.</p> <p>I will engage with the Deputy again on the issues and see what I can do in respect of meeting Alice and so on, if the Deputy feels it would be of assistance.</p> <p> On the broader question, the establishment of a commission to examine the case of everybody abused in foster care would, in itself, be an enormous undertaking.  One would have to give it very serious consideration before embarking on it.  Commissions, as a model, take an extraordinary length of time to reach conclusions, and that remains the case.  In this regard, I am referring to a number of commissions of investigation that are under way and that have been extended and extended, for different reasons.  By its very nature, the matter in question would be a particularly difficult one because it does not pertain to institutions as such.  It would take an enormous amount of, dare I say, fieldwork.  One would have to consider the vast number of fostering cases down through the years.  That is my initial response to that.  While there are issues, that does not mean we should not examine issues.</p> <p> I believe strongly that we have existing State agencies that should be the first resort in following through on allegations and abuse of the kind in question.  One of the best things we did &mdash; I was involved in it at the time &mdash; was to set up HIQA, for example.  It is an example of a body that exists to do the quality control, if you like, in this day and age to protect people right now and to improve standards in the areas under its remit.  The establishment of commissions has become the first thing we resort to.  It seems to be the fallback position to almost excuse existing agencies for not thoroughly doing the work they are legislatively charged to do.  We have a range of bodies that should be getting to the bottom of these matters much faster and much more efficiently rather than having us raise them in the House, inevitably leading to a commission of inquiry that takes years to complete its work.  It becomes even more difficult for all involved.</p> <p> With regard to homelessness, homelessness is not entirely the fault of the State.  It is more complex than that but the State has a responsibility to provide housing and give people shelter.  It does have that obligation, in my view.</p></speech>

Over the years, there has been a significant Government response.  There was compensation at the time that people felt they were bounced into or pressurised into accepting, but I hear what the Deputy is saying and will continue to reflect on the matter.</p></speech>

They are aimed at amending provisions in the principal Planning and Development Regulations 2001 concerning development that is exempt from the requirement to obtain planning permission.</p><p>Under the Planning Acts, each House of the Oireachtas is required to approve draft planning regulations relating to exempted development by way of positive resolution before they can be made by me, as Minister of State.</p><p>As the Deputies will be very much aware, the Planning and Development Act 2000 (Section 181) Regulations, which were enacted in March 2020, currently ensure any temporary facilities required to respond to the Covid-19 emergency can be developed, without the need for planning consent, for the temporary period of the emergency.  These facilities include hospitals, isolation units, step-down facilities, testing centres and vaccination centres.</p><p><b></b>The duration of the 2020 planning regulations is linked to Part 3 of the Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Act 2020 and as such will expire on 31<sup></sup>March 2022, when this Act ceases to have effect.  When the 2020 planning regulations expire, the exemptions provided for will no longer apply, and any developments listed in the Schedule will become subject to the normal provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000.</p> <p>Community testing centres and community vaccination centres have been and remain an ongoing cornerstone of the national response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  Accessibility to these centres for people living around Ireland is an ongoing necessity and ensures people can access these fundamentally important services.</p> <p> Notwithstanding the expiry of the main Covid-19 emergency response legislation, the Department of Health has confirmed the HSE is required to continue to operate testing and vaccination centres in the months beyond the end of March.  The proposed Planning and Development Act 2000 (Exempted Development) (No. 2) Regulations 2022 will replace the existing Planning and Development Act 2000 (Section 181) Regulations.  The replacement regulations are more limited in scope and relate to vaccination and testing centres only.</p> <p> The draft regulations amend class 20 of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the principal planning regulation to allow the HSE to temporarily use specific existing public building as public vaccine and infection testing centres without having to apply for change of use planning permission.  Following consultation with the HSE, the buildings to which this applies comprise schools, colleges, universities, training centres, social centres, community centres, non-residential clubs, art galleries, museums, libraries, reading rooms, sports clubs, stadiums, gymnasiums, hotels, convention centres, conference centres, shops, Defence Forces barracks, light industrial buildings, airport operational buildings, wholesale warehouses or repositories, local authority administrative offices or any structure normally used for public worship or religious instruction.  I am advised the HSE aims to ensure people have access to a testing centre within a 45-minute drive of their residence, a figure which is currently in excess of 90%.  The inclusion of a broad list of buildings in the Schedule will facilitate the continuation of the HSE's Covid-19 vaccination and testing programmes without interruption.  It is important the HSE can provide access to testing centres in as many locations as possible so that, if needed, people have access to them as close as possible to their homes.</p> <p> I point out that the draft regulations do not propose to provide a blanket exemption.  The following specific conditions or limitations will apply to the proposed exemption.  The change of use is limited to a period of up to 12 months, and the exemption only applies to a change of use for the purposes of preventing and alleviating the risk to public health posed by the spread of specific infectious diseases listed in the Infectious Diseases Regulations 1981, for example, Covid-19.</p> <p> It is proposed that the draft regulations will expire two years following commencement.  If a further use of buildings as testing or vaccination centres is anticipated after the two-year period, the normal planning application procedures for change of use should be followed.  In addition, any change of use will be subject to general restrictions on exemptions set out in the planning Act or regulations.  For example, the change of use shall not be exempted if an environmental impact assessment or an appropriate assessment is required.</p> <p> I commend these draft regulations to the House.  I look forward to hearing the contributions of Deputies.  Given their importance and the benefits arising from them, I very much hope the regulations will receive approval from the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-29a.240" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="16:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032900023#W00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  Sinn F&eacute;in will be more than happy to support these draft regulations.  It is an eminently sensible proposition from the Government.  By way of a response at the end of the debate, if the Minister of State has time, or, if not, by way of correspondence with the Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, it would be useful to clarify whether the purpose of the regulations is to continue to facilitate those facilities currently availing of the exempted development regulations passed previously or if there are any plans to have new facilities.  That will not change our mind in terms of supporting the regulations, but it would be very useful to know.</p>  <p>  I commend our planning authorities, the HSE, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and approved housing body voluntary homeless service providers for the very speedy way in which they took these exempted regulations previously, in particular in terms of ensuring the very vulnerable homeless population in our urban hostels were kept incredibly safe during Covid-19.  I want to bring one category of exempted development to the attention of the Minister of State and I would like to make the case for him and his officials to consider facilitating the permanence of those facilities when these exemptions expire.</p>  <p>  One of the particular innovations of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and the HSE were facilities known as medical shielding units for people who were single and homeless and generally in congregated settings.  Not only were people moved out of congregated settings during Covid-19, they were put into very specific bespoke facilities because they were at an even higher risk of contracting Covid and possibly because of other underlying conditions that would have had serious consequences.  In these facilities, people were not just congregated into their own rooms but additional medical facilities were also provided.  That is why they are called shielding units.  What is really interesting is that not only did the units provide greater protection from Covid-19 for the people who moved into them, in recent conversations I have had with some GPs supporting those individuals, they have noticed a remarkable improvement in all aspects of their lives.  Their mental health, addiction management and general sense of well-being has improved enormously.  There is a strong case for those facilities, in particular, to be made permanent if possible.</p>  <p>  I fully support a standard change of use planning application if, for example, an environmental impact assessment or appropriate assessment is required.  That is probably not the case for these facilities.  I am raising this issue because it might be something the officials could consider, rather than those facilities having to go through a formal change of use process in a year or two.  If they did not require an environmental impact assessment or appropriate assessment and instead some other mechanism was still in existence to deal with that, it would be eminently sensible.  Sinn F&eacute;in is happy to support the proposition in front of us and will continue to work constructively with the Minister of State on these or other necessary emergency measures while we are still living with Covid-19.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-29a.241" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="16:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032900023#W00300"><p>On behalf of the Labour Party, I will be happy to continue to support these particular exemptions, the reasons for which are very clear.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Broin that elements of the exemptions in terms of planning regulations and law may need to take on a degree of permanence.  I know there is an ongoing discussion within the Department, and across society and the country more generally, regarding vacancy rates in town centres and villages throughout Ireland and how we can bring more vacant commercial properties back into use for residential purposes.</p>  <p>  Any Government that is serious about revitalising our towns and city centres would look in closer detail at the kind of exemptions that might need to be provided to make it easier for a change of use to transform vacant commercial properties into residential use.  I looked at some figures earlier.  The Minister of State will know commercial vacancy rates hit their highest level in nine years and there are many reasons for that.  In total, there were almost 30,000 vacant commercial units dispersed across Ireland in quarter four of 2021.  Many of those units could provide decent, affordable and appropriate housing for people throughout the country on council housing waiting lists or who want to buy properties.</p>  <p>  As the saying goes, we often only manage what we measure.  One of the best ways of measuring vibrancy of our urban centres is through the Heritage Council's collaborative town centre health check scheme.  For quite some time, I have asked why the largest town in Ireland and my home town, Drogheda, where I live and which I represent, has not been included in the collaborative town centre health check scheme to date.  It is the intention of the Heritage Council to do that, but I believe funding for the scheme is not available and it needs to be.  We have serious issues with dereliction and the provision of housing in my constituency, especially in Drogheda and Dundalk.</p> <p>It has the highest rate of commercial vacancy in County Louth, with nearly 20% of properties lying empty.  One of the reasons we could establish that was because of the collaborative town centre health check proposition.  That is something we want to do in Drogheda, Ireland's largest town, but we have not managed to do it yet.  We need resources to do so.</p> <p> I am taking this opportunity to speak more generally about planning exemptions, how the system can innovate and how we can think a little more laterally about bringing vacant commercial properties back into use for citizens who need them to have a decent roof over their heads and to revitalise town centres.  I know the Minister of State gets that and it is something on which he will wish to focus.  I ask him to elaborate on that in his response.  </p> <p> As I stated, the Labour Party is happy to support the continuation of these exemptions.  They are in place for obvious reasons and we will continue to support them for as long as they are needed.</p></speech>

On the other specific issue he raised, relating to permanency, it is absolutely the current intention for this to be temporary and emergency in nature.</p>  <p>  As regards the remarks of Deputy Nash, vacancy is a significant issue and I absolutely get that.  That is why through our town centres first programme we are aiming to have all the vacant homes offices established full-time within the local authority network, in all 31 local authorities, by quarter 2 of this year.  We have increased the funding by 20% to make that a reality.  Many of the vacant homes officers are sharing tasks with other services right across the local authority and that dilutes their sense of purpose in terms of the work they have to do.</p>  <p>  Obviously, the Housing Commission is doing a significant body of work relating to the Constitution and property rights within the State.  That is a key focus that will be worked on.  County Louth has an exceptional record in terms of compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, for vacant properties and bringing them back into use.  It is one of the leaders in the local authority network.  I understand the balance of risk and where the risk lies in terms of a local authority issuing a CPO for a property and even putting it onto the derelict sites register which we are trying to reform through this process.  I await what the commission will say.  We are trying to use the carrot approach by ensuring we have funding to unlock the potential of these properties.  It is to be hoped that Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe will this year provide a mechanism involving a call to provide a grant for the owners of these properties to bring them back into residential use.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is working diligently to make that a reality this year because it will be very important.  When you have a stick in the background, it is important to try to bring people with you.  We are trying to achieve that.</p>  <p>  As regards the specific regulations, I reiterate that specific conditions or limitations will apply to the proposed exemptions.  These are that the change of use is limited to a period of 12 months and the exemption only applies to a change of use for the purposes of preventing and alleviating the risk to public health risk posed by the spread of specific infectious diseases listed in the infectious diseases regulations 1981, including Covid-19.  It is proposed that the draft regulations will expire two years following commencement.  If further use of these buildings as testing or vaccination centres is anticipated after the two-year period, the normal planning application procedures will follow their course.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Nash for their co-operation in bringing these regulations to the House.</p></speech>

(A Minor) v Assessment Officer and Anor, J.A. (A Minor) v the Health Service Executive 2022 IEHC 131, which found that the 2020 Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) adopted by the Health Service Executive (HSE) was causing its Assessment Officers to &quot;err in law&quot;, and that the HSE do not intend to appeal this case;<br /><br />&mdash; that the HSE is in breach of the rights of children with disabilities, as set out by the Oireachtas in the Disability Act 2005, when it does not conduct an Assessment of Need (AON) which identifies the nature and extent of a disability and the corresponding level of service need;<br /><br />&mdash; that the HSE has not submitted a report as required under Section 13 of the Disability Act 2005 since 2015, despite being required to do so annually;<br /><br />&mdash; that, when questioned about the deficit in Section 13 reporting, the HSE have blamed &quot;the outdated database we are currently using&quot; which &quot;was developed by a small software development company, which no longer provides maintenance or technical support for the system&quot;, and acknowledged that &quot;the database is 20 years old and has not had the necessary upgrades or technical changes in recent years&quot;, but stated that they intended to complete the outstanding reports by year end, in response to Parliamentary Question No. 762 of 1st March, 2022; and<br /><br />&mdash; that fears have been raised by activists, families, and members of the Oireachtas that a review of the Disability Act 2005, as advised by the HSE, could lead to a dilution of the rights of children with disabilities;  reaffirms its commitment to upholding the rights of people with disabilities; <br /><br />agrees with the assessment of the Ombudsman for Children that the review of the current AON operating procedure is now redundant, and the current procedure is untenable; <br /><br />further notes the passage of the Sinn F&eacute;in motion in relation to Assessment of Needs for Children with Disabilities on 8th March, 2022, with the assent of the Government, which called on the Government to:  	&mdash; establish Children's Disability Network Teams (CDNTs) in full;<br /><br />&mdash; report to the D&aacute;il on how it intends to ensure that all children have a proper AON and real access to the services which they need;<br /><br />&mdash; publish a costed and timebound implementation strategy for the Disability Services Capacity Review and a cross-departmental strategic workforce development plan; and <br /><br />&mdash; transparently publish all waiting lists for these services; and  calls on the Government to:  	&mdash; ensure that the rights of children with disabilities are not undermined and, that, if the Disability Act 2005 is to be reviewed, the existing rights of people with disabilities are not diluted and that children with disabilities have access to the services they need;<br /><br />&mdash; immediately ensure that the Assessment Officers' System Database which is used to manage and report on AON and access to children's disability services is updated to reflect changes in policy, operational practice and user requirements;<br /><br />&mdash; engage in proactive, joined-up workforce planning to develop a cross-departmental strategic workforce plan for the breadth of health and social care services, streamline the recruitment process, and work to entice health and social care professionals who have recently left the HSE to return to the public service;<br /><br />&mdash; review the critical skills list in the context of demand for health and social care professionals, while remaining cognisant of the State's international obligations;<br /><br />&mdash; urgently implement the Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) allowing individuals and families means to challenge the Irish Government on any current or future failures to guarantee the rights contained within the UNCRPD;<br /><br />&mdash; provide a job guarantee to health and social care graduates and proactively engage with them during their degree to advise on employment options in the public health service;<br /><br />&mdash; lay a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas within three months outlining in full the number of Whole-Time Equivalent staffing posts that will be provided to children's disability services for 2022, including the details of the package of supports to provide CDNTs with additional resources to address the backlog of AON and AON which were conducted incorrectly, and to provide additional therapeutic supports as indicated by the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, in her address to the D&aacute;il on 8th March; and<br /><br />&mdash; report back to the D&aacute;il before the summer recess on how it intends to fully address the matters in this motion and the motion of 8th March, 2022, and lay each outstanding Section 13 Report before the Houses of the Oireachtas by the end of the year.  </blockquote>  <p>The focus of a recent motion on disability services was to call on the HSE to stop using the standard operating procedure, SOP, which involves carrying out preliminary team assessments and implying to parents of children with disabilities and additional needs that this was fulfilling the statutory right of a child to a full and proper assessment of need.  We indicated that this is not the case and that the HSE must stop trying to avoid its obligations under the Disability Act 2005.</p><p>Our call has been further vindicated by the recent High Court ruling in C.T.M. (A Minor) <i>v.</i>Assessment Officer and Anor, J.A. (A Minor) <i>v</i>. the Health Service Executive which found that the standard operating procedure adopted by the HSE in 2020 was causing assessment officers to err in law.  I welcome the fact that the HSE does not intend to appeal this case but urgent measures must be taken to ensure that all children with disabilities are getting access to a proper and comprehensive assessment of need which would identify the nature and extent of disability and the corresponding level of service needed.  Children are entitled to this assessment within a period of six months from when they first apply, with an additional month to allow for a service statement to be drawn up which will outline the precise services and interventions that they would require, going forward, to address their disability or additional need.</p><p>There is a serious problem among the 91 children&rsquo;s disability network teams, CDNTs, because it seems that none of them is fully staffed and in fact many of them are operating on a 50% to 60% staffing level.  Even if the staffing level was at 100% of the level currently resourced, it has been relayed to me by numerous staff within the CDNTs, including management, that this would still not be sufficient to meet the level of need among children requiring assessment and services.  Parents are very aware of this, with one parent responding to a survey from Down Syndrome Ireland by saying that there are not enough therapists to deal with the increased numbers, that there is already a major shortage, and that their client load will now be completely unmanageable.</p><p>It is this shortfall in staff and resources that has led to the long delays that parents of children with disabilities face, the extent of which is reflected in a recent report from Inclusion Ireland which states that many parents have reported that their children have spent a significant time on waiting lists for services.  Some 85% reported that they had waited or continue to wait for more than a year.  Of these children, 27% were waiting two to four years, 16% were waiting four to six years, and 5% for six years or more.  We need to see a fully costed implementation strategy and a strategic workforce development plan within a specific timeframe indicating precisely how the shortfalls in the disability sector are going to be addressed.  </p><p>There are very significant problems within the recruitment procedures for therapists and clinicians to the disability network teams.  The recruitment systems to me seem to be archaic and take an inordinate amount of time to actively recruit someone to a position.  We need to see an end to the national panels and instead look at recruitment on a regional basis within a very short space of time.  Many therapists have left this sector as they would not and could not agree to the preliminary team assessments.  Now that the High Court ruling means that this practice must cease, perhaps some of those who left could be enticed back to the sector if offered positions at suitable grades.</p><p>The disability sector is receiving bad press due to the preliminary team assessments and the long waiting lists that are ever-growing for assessments and therapies.  This was reflected recently in a survey conducted by AsIAm which found that 54% of respondents felt very dissatisfied with the support services from the HSE for their autistic children, with as many as 65% of respondents going on to express dissatisfaction with the broader disability services.  This is unfair on the very dedicated staff working within the disability sector where teams are under-staffed and under-resourced to carry out the tasks that they have been set.  This negative publicity has become so bad that people are reluctant to work in this sector.  This must be addressed.  The blame for this lies entirely with Government policy and with years of neglect of this sector.  There is a need for a long-term plan to address this to ensure CDNTs are fully staffed and fully resourced in the years to come.</p><p>I am very concerned about the children who require intervention and therapies now.  Early intervention is vital for children to progress in life.  Many who do not receive early intervention cannot progress to be the best version of themselves and will require more interventions and supports in later life, meaning that they will be less able to lead a fully active and independent life.  The Government needs to look at urgent measures to address the immediate requirements within the sector to ensure that all children&rsquo;s needs are met. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-29a.248" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032900025#Y00300"><p>This is the second motion in three weeks that Sinn F&eacute;in has brought forward on this issue and the reason we have brought it forward today is because of a High Court ruling that has taken place since we moved our previous motion.  We warned the Government that the HSE and indeed the Government itself were operating outside of the law when it came to providing children with disabilities with the comprehensive assessment of need that they are entitled to and that they deserve under the Disability Act 2005.  That is what we have been saying for some time.  The Government ignored our calls and those of parents and forced many parents to take the HSE to court, some hundreds of whom have done so.  In this case, two parents took a test case and they won.  Fair play to them because they were standing up not just for their children but for all children.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, is nodding his head in agreement.  We are all in agreement in this House that more needs to be done.  We also have to be honest, however, and say that it should absolutely fill every single one of us with shame that time and again parents have to go to court to get basic assessments done, to get services for their children or to get the HSE to operate within the law.</p>  <p>  This is not only the case when it comes to assessments of need.  Under the 2005 Act, the HSE is legally obliged to furnish the Minister for Health every year with what is called a section 13 report which outlines the aggregate need of all of the children in terms of therapies, supports and services.  Not one of those reports has been submitted since 2015.  When I raised this with the head of the HSE and its officials at the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the casual approach by senior management in the HSE was absolutely shocking.  I am dumbfounded when it comes to the lack of accountability and transparency in the HSE.  When it comes to disability services for children, where the HSE has been found on numerous times to be in breach of the law and of its statutory obligations, one would imagine that the head of the HSE and the head of disability services would come into an Oireachtas committee, put their hands up, apologise, admit it was shameful and say that they were going to fix the problem.  </p> <p>I hope the Minister and the Government would say the same and start to fund children's disability services properly so children can get the assessments and services they need.</p> <p> The Minister of State at the Department of Health has been telling us for months in the House, and I know she is sincere when it comes to this issue, that we are reducing the waiting times for assessments and that we have almost cleared the waiting lists.  We were asked to give this information to parents.  We took that information to the parents, but they tell us this is not the case.  As it turned out, it was not the case.  What we had was a sleight of hand with children thrown from one list to another.  More than half of all the children who had a preliminary team's assessment have seen that set aside by a High Court judge as it was operating outside the law.  Half of the children who had this preliminary teams assessment needed a multidisciplinary team assessment and have now gone onto a separate waiting list.  After going through all the agony of waiting for an assessment only to find out it was not an assessment but a screening and then to be put on a different waiting list, it is heartbreaking for parents.  I have met many of them and I cannot tell the Minister of State how angry they are that they do not see action by the HSE and the Government.</p> <p> Can the HSE and the Government please stop breaking the law when it comes to children's disability services?  There is no other area where the HSE is on multiple occasions and in multiple areas in breach of its statutory and legal obligations.  Why is it tolerated when it comes to children's disability services?  Stop breaking the law and cutting corners.  It must provide the disability teams with the staff they need.  We are setting out solutions in the motion, and we did so on the last occasion.  We want children to have a comprehensive assessment of need.  That means we must recruit staff to build up assessment teams.  Equally, there must be a workforce planning strategy that deals with training more therapists and support staff and recruiting more and retaining more.  If we do not do that, we will continue to fail children.</p> <p> I will conclude with a final comment.  I have spoken to many children who have not received the services and I have also spoken to young adults.  They feel they have been failed.  They are young adults and they did not receive early intervention and the supports they needed.  The developmental opportunities that were there for them have passed them, and they are angry.  They do not want to see that happen to any more children so, please, stop breaking the law, properly resource the services and stop letting down the parents and children with disabilities.  It is shameful.</p></speech>

The Government and the HSE are required by law, as Deputy Cullinane said, and by decency to protect the rights of children with disabilities.  The motion calls on the Government to fulfil the law, to uphold the rights of children with disabilities and to provide them with the services they need.  Under the Disability Act 2005, an assessment of needs must be provided and it must be completed within six months of application.  This month, the High Court ruled that the assessment of needs process of the HSE was operating outside the law and that it denied children with disabilities their rights.  It is a shameful episode and a vindication for so many children and their families, who have been failed in respect of what they were entitled to.  They deserve much more from the Government and the HSE.</p>  <p>  The court found that the current operating procedure being carried out by the HSE, which was introduced by the Government in 2020, effectively allowed it to breach its obligations.  The HSE has repeatedly breached parts of the Act passed by these Houses.  It consistently failed to submit reports to the Minister.  The Government and the HSE must live up to their obligations under the Disability Act 2005.  They have to live up to the law of this State when it comes to children with disabilities.  Waiting lists for children's disability services and interventions are out of control.  They are failing children and families.  In Donegal, there are currently seven vacancies and more than 1,000 children awaiting assessment for occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and psychological services.  Some 580 of these children are awaiting primary care speech and language therapy and have been on a waiting list for more than eight months.  Many of them are waiting for more than a year.</p>  <p>  This motion calls on the Government to act and to develop and implement a strategy whereby staff can be recruited and retained to deliver services.  It commits to a review of the Disability Act to ensure it is not undermining the rights of children with disabilities or scaling back on provision.  Crucially, it says the Minister has to start complying with the law, and the HSE has to do the same.</p></speech>

This process has denied children with disability the right to a proper assessment of needs.  Standard operating procedure is leading assessment officers to err in law, often leading to catastrophic consequences for children.  It is absolutely astounding that this process could continue for so long in this manner.  It is an additional affront to the parents of children with disabilities that the annual report required by the Disability Act has not been submitted by the HSE since 2015.  No report in six years and no action being taken in this regard is absolutely scandalous.</p>  <p>  The High Court decision must be heeded and the Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities must act urgently to address the shortcomings in the assessment of needs process for children with disabilities.  My colleagues brought forward a motion on this matter on 8 March last and, quite correctly, the Government did not oppose it.  Now, it must implement the calls made in that motion so this denial of rights can be rectified.  Nothing short of this will do.  The rights of children with disabilities cannot be denied any longer.  As I said previously on this matter, parents should not have to contact their local Deputy in an effort to have their child seen by an assessment officer.  Unfortunately, in many cases this is what they have to do.  The Minister must act swiftly.  One of the most important elements is to ensure the current assessment of needs process is binned as it is not fit for purpose.  The IT system and data bases blamed by the HSE must be upgraded immediately to accurately maintain and report on the data, as required under the Disability Act, since 2015.</p>  <p>  We must see action from the Government now.  We must ensure that children are not waiting and that this court decision is heeded.  The Department must act on that as a matter of urgency.  Children cannot wait much longer for that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-29a.252" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1469" speakername="Mark Ward" time="17:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032900026#Z00400"><p>Representatives of the HSE, including Mr. Paul Reid, appeared before the children's committee last week.  Under questioning from Sinn F&eacute;in, the HSE admitted that it was in breach of the law when it comes to providing children with disability an assessment of needs.  This should come as no surprise to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  I first raised this issue with the Minister of State when the comprehensive assessment of needs was changed to a 90-minute desktop assessment.  At the time, she assured the committee that this change would lead to children getting a better service and receiving the life-changing interventions in a timely manner.  This did not happen.  Waiting lists for occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, psychology and physiotherapy are growing every day.</p>  <p>  Does the Minister of State accept that the change that led to that breach in the law happened under the watch of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte?  Does the Minister of State accept that this change only happened under the current Government's watch, not that of the previous Government?  Who is going to be held accountable?  Will it be the Minister of State, the HSE, both or nobody?  We have seen the circling of the wagons by the HSE after the scandal in south Kerry child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in which children were over-medicated to the extent that they lost their personalities.  Nobody in a senior position in the HSE, or in the Government, has been held to account for that so far.</p>  <p>  The breach of the law this time has failed children with disabilities, to the extent that they may not reach their full potential.  They may not reach their developmental milestones.  Is there anything more heartbreaking than a child not being given every chance possible just to grow as a person, physically, mentally and emotionally?  Who is going to answer for these failings under this Government's watch?  I agree with the Ombudsman for Children, who has said that the HSE is deploying the old-fashioned, three-card trick by moving children from list to list without getting the service they need at the end.  Moving children through the alphabet soup of HSE disability lists, such as standard operating procedure, SOP, assessment of need, AON, children's disability network teams, CDNTs, individual family support plans, IFSPs, early intervention teams, EITs, occupational therapists, OTs, and speech and language therapists, SLTs, is simply not good enough.</p>  <p>  Parents demand a service that provides children with disability with the care they need, when they need it and where they need it.  Apologies at this stage will not cut it.  Children and parents deserve the services they need, and children deserve the interventions they need in a prompt manner.</p></speech>

I commend Deputy Tully on tabling the motion.  We are returning to this issue because in the intervening period since we last raised it the Government has been found to be in breach of the law.  It is in breach of the Disability Act.</p>  <p>  We need to think of this issue more than in terms of systems, teams and clinicians.  There have been far too many in the HSE and perhaps the Government who have thought of it only in these terms.  They have not tried to stand in the shoes of the parents and the children affected by this.  I get phone calls, as I am sure the Minister of State does, from parents who are encountering this new system but have no idea how to navigate it.  Children are being discharged from the system without parents being informed.  They are being moved from area to area and from list to list.  Parents do not know how to navigate this.  They find that they cannot get an assessment of need.  They get appointments for another waiting list.  Even after all of this, the time that people are waiting for therapies is absolutely scandalous.  This is about children not being able to reach their full potential.  This has implications for us all.  It has implications for society as a whole.  It has particular implications for those children and their ability to thrive in education and in life and to enjoy school and society so they have the best impact possible.</p>  <p>  Last Friday, I visited a school in County Waterford.  An example was given to me of someone who received an occupational therapy appointment three and a half to four years following the previous appointment.  The person was asked whether they wanted the appointment.  This is the level of service some children are getting.  There are years between therapies.  During that time there could be regression or all sorts of issues.</p>  <p>  The teams are completely understaffed and they were completely unprepared for the change in policy.  In one instance a parent was told by a member of staff in the HSE to get onto the local Deputies to raise it because the team was completely swamped.  This is the reality.  There are excellent clinicians working on the ground but they are completely demoralised by being on teams that are totally under-resourced.  They see children being let down and they know they do not spend the time that they should with these children.  It has been stated clearly in black and white that the Government is in breach of the law.  This needs to end.  We need proper AONs and we need the therapies these children deserve to ensure they reach their full potential.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to restate the Government&rsquo;s commitment to children with disabilities and their families.  It was just three weeks ago that children's disabilities services were also the subject of a Private Members' motion.  On that occasion, my colleagues, the Ministers of State, Deputies Rabbitte and Butler, articulated the challenges, merits and, indeed, faults in the provision of disability services for children in Ireland today.  I can say without fear of contradiction that everyone in the House strives to improve access and reduce waiting times for children who require therapy supports.  The AON process can be a part of the journey families take in obtaining these supports.  Recent events have caused the approach taken to date to be reconsidered.  For this reason, the Government is not opposing the motion.</p>  <p>  Later on in his contribution, the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, after listening to the contributions of all the Deputies in the House, will address the substantive issues surrounding the recent High Court judgment concerning the SOP for children as regards the assessment of need, the provision of section 13 reports by the HSE to the Department of Health and his vision of the roadmap ahead for children's disability services.</p>  <p>  We all want the best for our children.  We want the best education to give them the best start in life and the best health services to be available for children when they need them.   For those parents of children with complex needs, we want the best disability services to support each child to achieve their full potential in life.  It is incumbent on the Government to constantly endeavour to improve services for children with developmental disabilities and their families.  We must seek to develop the most appropriate models of therapeutic responses and supports so that children with complex needs have an environment whereby they can thrive and achieve their potential.</p>  <p>  It would be wrong to ignore the fact that there have been difficulties in certain parts of the country in the implementation of the progressing disability services programme by the HSE.  These issues have resulted in delays for some families in accessing much-needed assessment and intervention services for their children.  The Government is fully committed to ensuring timely access to high-quality health and social care services for all children and young people who require them.  We must work together to find suitable means to overcome the constraints affecting service delivery.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is addressing this with the urgency that is required.</p>  <p>  One of the criticisms of the family-centred practice model is that parents are now being asked to take on the role of therapist for their children.  It is important this issue be addressed as there has undoubtedly been a great deal of confusion around it.  I understand there is existing and growing evidence that more traditional models of service may provide limited skills retention and transfer into the child's everyday life.  Supporting and empowering families and others to work with the child in their natural everyday environment is, however, considered to be more effective.  The child or young person is no longer solely reliant on one-to-one input from specialists; rather, those who surround him or her day to day are empowered to maximise opportunities for growth and development in their everyday environments.  The current clinical thinking on this issue is that it provides an holistic approach to the provision of therapy supports.  However, as stated publicly by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, the HSE's messaging around this has not been clear and it has been perceived as shifting more responsibility onto parents.  While all families are willing to do their very best for their children, parents or guardians are not therapists.  The family-centred approach must be underpinned, supported and facilitated by specialist therapy personnel.  Nobody is trying to remove clinical supports from children.  We need to bolster them, not reduce them.</p>  <p>   The family-centred model is a complementary approach to providing therapeutic supports, rather than an alternative approach which has been suggested.  As children journey through childhood, different approaches and models of intervention may be recommended at different times to meet the individual child's emerging needs.  It is vital that there is buy-in to this approach.  This is why it was important that the HSE facilitated two national conferences in advance of the reconfiguration of the network teams.  These were themed on partnership and family-centred practice respectively.  They were for staff and, more importantly, for families.  These conferences highlighted the move from the previous uni-disciplinary service provision to an authentic child and family-centred model of service.  I note that the two events were attended by 750 and 1,500 participants, respectively.  This is a collaborative approach to address the needs of children with complex needs and will require commitment and co-operation between families, educational institutions, healthcare providers and professionals and other stakeholders.  This is all with one single unity of purpose and objective to ensure each child with a disability receives the best and optimum level of therapeutic supports required to meet his or her needs. </p>  <p>  While accepting that significant levels of health and social care services in the community were curtailed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, I understand the HSE has confirmed that the restoration and continuity of services has been progressed in a safe way in line with the significant investment made by the State and funded agencies.  The HSE continues to work with service users and their families and carers to ensure that we achieve this aim.</p>  <p>  We need a collective approach along with renewed ideas as to how services can be consolidated effectively and enhanced.  Not one of us here this evening wants to see a child waiting any longer than necessary to access therapy supports.  I assure all that the Government and, in particular, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will remain focused on providing the best possible services we can to ensure those with disabilities and their families receive assistance.</p></speech>

Similar to all Deputies, my office has received countless contacts from parents of children with disabilities who have experienced serious issues in accessing the services they deserve.  The lack of resources for services for these children amounts to neglect.  The State has an obligation to these children.  They are entitled to care under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, and domestic law.  Children who need these services but cannot access them are being left behind.  As do all parents, parents of children with disabilities want the best for their children.</p> <p>They want to give them the best opportunity in life but parents are having to fight tooth and nail to get the access to services their children need.  Parents have gone through the courts to get such access, as seen in the recent High Court ruling that found that the Government was in breach of the Disability Act.  It is appalling that these children are left to wait so long for intervention.  It is completely unfair and it is an injustice.  </p> <p> Early intervention is key.  These kids cannot wait any longer for access to services and they should not have to.  We need targeted investment in this area and we need to work to retain the staff who work in it.  It is on the Minister of State to act in the interests of these children and their families.  That is Deputy Rabbitte's job and it is time she got on with it.</p></speech>

I am speaking on behalf of my exhausted constituents across Kildare North who fight day in, day out for the services their children with disabilities need.  They are hanging on by the proverbial thread like Aisling is for her son, Jack, and like Lourdes is for her son, Conor.  These are mothers who have become advocates.  The services they seek are the right of their children as citizens of this State but they are still only granted as if they were favours or wishes come true.  This idea of services coming as favours is evident in the number of people who have contacted me about difficulties they have had with the services they are getting.  I will not mention their names in this, their D&aacute;il, tonight lest they be deemed troublemakers and their complaints held against them.  If only the State was as diligent in its provision of services and assessments of need as it is in keeping lists of the number of times troublesome or annoying parents made contact, we would at least be going in the right direction.  I know this because it happened to a constituent of mine in Kildare North.  HSE staff could give her a blow-by-blow account of the number of times she had to make contact with them as if she had been doing it just for the fun of it rather than out of sheer desperation.</p>  <p>  We are here because the High Court deemed the State to be breaking the law by acting outside the Disability Act with regard to AONs and rights guaranteed in law.  Instead of acting on the High Court&rsquo;s findings the other week and thereby abiding by the law, it emerged in a committee meeting that a HSE official had suggested that the State amend the law so it could not be sued by young children who were losing function and movement in their young bodies while the HSE ducked and dived from its duties, which is absolutely outrageous.  Let us make something very clear: children with disabilities are every bit as equal to children without disabilities and they are just as much citizens of this State.  They do not exist so that people without disabilities can feel better about themselves or feel that they are being good Samaritans in granting favours to them.  They are citizens in their own right.  We call on the Minister to implement the optional protocol and to guarantee that any review of the Disability Act will not be manipulated to undermine the current rights of people with disabilities.  We need that.</p></speech>

The fear people feel when they find out their child is neurodiverse is heartbreaking because they know so many people in their situation who have been failed and they know that the same is in store for them.  I know the Minister of State gets that but it seems the Government has no handle on how to get services up to an acceptable standard.  It knows the questions but it is not delivering the answers that parents of children with disabilities need.  When I hear Ministers speak in the D&aacute;il or in the media, if feels like they have no power to change the way that business is done.  They sound more like interested commentators than actual Ministers.</p>  <p>  The number of autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes in Dublin 6 is a very significant issue.  The process under section 37A of the Education Act 1998 has delivered no extra places.  Advocacy groups such as Involve Autism have highlighted the failure of this process in delivering ASD classes in Dublin 6 and Dublin 6W.  More than &euro;70,000 is spent every day bussing autistic children out of their communities to go to schools a long distance from their homes.  In the morning, one child in a family will turn right while another will get onto a bus and have to leave their home.  It is absolutely bonkers.  A child in Pearse Street has to get on a bus or in a taxi and travel to Clontarf, on the other side of the city, to get to school.  How does that make any sense?  </p>  <p>  This is ultimately the Minister's responsibility.  The Department does not have the information it needs to plan for school places.  The process of diagnosis starts with the Minister.  The diagnosis of children is very important because, without such a diagnosis, children regress and cannot access the services they need to reach their full potential.  If we are going to meet the demand for school places, we need children to be assessed as early as possible.  The Minister needs to ensure that the HSE fulfils its obligations under the Disability Act.  Families feel abandoned and Government is ultimately responsible.</p></speech>

We tabled this motion to demand that the Government and the HSE protect the rights of children with disabilities and to ensure they can access the services they need.  The situation at the moment is dire.  Children are not getting an appropriate AON procedure and they are not accessing the services they need.  Waiting lists for therapies and interventions are out of control and children's disability services are seriously understaffed.  Frankly, it is disgusting for a Government and public health service to treat some of the youngest and most vulnerable members of society like this.  We have heard excuse after excuse from the HSE and nothing ever changes.  The Government sits on its hands and has allowed the HSE to become a law unto itself.</p>  <p>  We all know how important early intervention is but the Government and the HSE are content to leave thousands of children and their families to languish without any support or help.  Parents are at their wits' end.  As it stands, both the Minister and the HSE are breaking the law.  We know this from the recent High Court ruling that found that the current assessment of need procedure is not in line with the Disability Act.  Most of us already knew this.  Parents and those who work in disability services knew.  The Minister for Health has to have known this all along and yet did absolutely nothing about it.  The Minister of State has said that the Government is accepting our motion.  He also said that it accepted our motion on this issue on 8 March.  What we are calling for is action.  I see a pattern here of the Government accepting motions we table because it does not have the balls to oppose them.  Just look at this Chamber today.  Let any parent who has a child who suffers with a disability look around this Chamber.  Not one bloody member of the Government could be bothered to come in to listen to the debate and to what those parents and their children are enduring at their hands.  They ought to be ashamed of themselves.  We are looking for action and, by God, they better deliver it.</p></speech>

I note that the Government is not going to oppose it.  If I may, I will quote directly from my copy of the Minister of State's speech.  When talking about making the services more effective and the CDNTs, he referred to what the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has said, which is that:</p> <blockquote> 	...the HSE&rsquo;s messaging around this has not been clear and it has been perceived as shifting more responsibility on to parents.  While all families are willing to do their very best for their children, parents or guardians are not therapists.  The family-centred approach must be underpinned, supported and facilitated by specialist therapy personnel.  Nobody is trying to remove clinical supports from children.  We need to bolster them, not reduce them.  The family-centred model is a complementary approach to providing therapeutic supports, rather than an alternative approach, which has been suggested in some quarters. </blockquote> <p>I am glad that the Minister has at least clarified that, but it leaves a question over the constitution of the children's disability network teams.  I note the presence of the senior Minister and I am glad to have the opportunity to address him directly.  Where the teams have been created, there is acknowledgement that this is not a perfect model.  Some work is ongoing internally on how those teams will be rolled out.</p> <p> I can understand a proposal to bring families into the therapeutic process.  However, the evidence shows that there is still a massive waiting list not only for assessment of needs but also for psychological services.  I am not talking about CAMHS; I make a distinction between access to child and adult mental health services.  There are 9,554 children waiting for psychological services at the moment; 14,619 waiting for occupational therapy; 8,666 waiting for physiotherapy; 33,106 waiting for some form of speech and language intervention or assessment; 5,590 waiting for access to dietetics sister; 16,838 waiting for ophthalmology services; and 8,457 waiting for audiology services.</p> <p> I do not want to become excessively rhetorical about this because we are talking about children here.  I am trying to understand how the CDNTs will evolve.  The challenges therein have been well articulated.  Parents and public representatives have pushed back on the HSE on that issue.  The Government or the HSE did not buttress those teams with the resources to allow for the follow-on services such as I have mentioned.  It is not just about the AON.  The assessment is a vital element to get the child in the door but they then need the follow-on services.  I have been around these Houses for a reasonably long period.  I am confused over how the supply of professionals who will deliver these services will match the demand.  I still cannot see how the Government will do that.  We have not seen an articulation of that yet through what are supposed to be the children disability network teams.</p> <p> I take the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, in good faith, as we all do.  We all welcomed when she pushed back on the HSE in the recent past in respect of the CDNTs.  However, once a child gets through the AON, how do the follow-up services such as psychology, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and all have the other services wrap themselves around the same child with that need?  That is the missing piece of the jigsaw.</p> <p> I could give the Minister chapter and verse about the HSE's apparent lack of internalisation as an institution culturally of its need to be transparent about how it spends resources.  The HSE does not seem to have internalised that obligation it has.  We saw evidence of that at the Committee of Public Accounts in recent weeks where the Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted the lack of transparency - my words - in respect of how budget lines are spent right down to provision of the services we are discussing.  I do not want to make political hay out of this issue.  All I want is for the children in my constituency who require the services to be able to get the services, as we all want in all our constituencies.  Somebody needs to come up with a plan to bridge that gap without trotting out the same lines, day in day out about recruitment issues.</p> <p> For people living in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's region, CHO 2 covering Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, only two children are waiting more than two months or three months.  However, in my area, CHO 4, covering County Kerry, Cork north, Cork north Lee, Cork south Lee and Cork west, it is 500 children.  I am sure the Minister is aware of this.  In some places, the system can be made to work to deploy the resources across geographical locations and county boundaries if needs be or across the CHO areas so that they follow the child where there is spare capacity in one part of the system.  That is what the Sinn F&eacute;in motion calls for; that is what we have all been calling for, including Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies.  If that can be made to work, that would be a good day's work.</p> <p> I do not doubt the bona fides of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, in seeking to push the HSE along.  Having been in government, I know what it is like to sit at that side of the table and I know what it is like to be held accountable for my actions.  The same applies to us all if we are line Ministers.  Sinn F&eacute;in Members will also be accountable when they are in government.  I look forward to that time.  We all are accountable ultimately as the makers of policy.  We cannot keep hiving it off to the HSE.  At some point there must be political accountability for these decisions as they affect our fellow citizens and children.</p> <p> I ask the Minister for Health to redouble his efforts to bridge the gap so that we as a nation do not have 16,838 children waiting for follow on ophthalmology services and 14,619 waiting for occupational therapy.  All of these figures come from the HSE's replies to parliamentary questions.  In fairness to the HSE, it is extremely good at answering parliamentary questions.  It will provide chapter and verse, line by line of all the details.  The additional layer that I would see being put on top of that and I think we will all start asking these questions fairly quickly is: where is the expenditure to match the needs?  Ultimately, that is what this motion is about.</p> <p> I support the motion and I am glad it has been brought before us.  Collectively, we have all been talking about this issue.  I would like to take the heat out of it and let in some light if we can.  I know the Minister will want to achieve much along with his ministerial colleagues to address these issues because the law now demands it.  There is a corpus of law and the High Court has adjudicated on it.  I am glad to see the shift in respect of what was an extremely flawed model relating to the CDNTs.  How will the Minister underpin and buttress those teams across the country so that we can have that kind of complementarity between families and therapists to deliver for the child?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-29a.265" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1525" speakername="Holly Cairns" time="17:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032900029#CC00200"><p>I welcome this motion and thank Deputy Tully and Sinn F&eacute;in for giving us the time to discuss this vital matter.  It has been three weeks since the most recent motion on disability services for children and young people.  Since then, things have got worse, not better.  The High Court judgment has found that the 90-minute assessments are unlawful under the Disability Act 2005, affecting more than 10,000 children and their families.  It was revealed that none of the 91 CDNTs were fully staffed.  It has also come to light that the HSE is using an outdated database to track needs identified in assessment reports.  These revelations are piled on top of the already substantial failures to properly assess and treat children with disabilities in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Services are a geographical lottery.  Children are waiting months for therapy appointments.  Countless families are forced to pay privately for services and communities need to fundraise for supports the State should be providing.</p> <p>Among all of this, two overarching issues need to be addressed immediately: the waiting lists for assessments and therapies, and the geographical variation in services.</p> <p> The NGOs working in this area provide incredible support to families but they have also assembled research into the experiences of progressing disability services which further establishes the current failures of the system.  Down Syndrome Ireland&rsquo;s recent survey of 433 members, nearly one third of its members with a child aged zero to 18, found that 44% had received no therapy of any kind in the last year.  Some 44% of children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome received no therapy, and this is just the national average.  There are regional variations, with the Cork-Kerry area, CHO 4, being the worst.  Some 64%, almost two thirds of children in this survey, did not receive any therapy - no speech and language therapy, no occupational therapy, no physiotherapy &ndash; and those figures are even higher for each therapy.  A survey from AsIAm last year, with 454 responses, found that 42% of families have had to wait more than two years to receive an autism diagnosis for their child, while 79% said they were not in receipt of any support from either the early intervention or school age teams.  Inclusion Ireland&rsquo;s recent survey on progressing disability services found that 85% of over 1,000 families have waited or continue to wait for more than a year for a service.  Each one of these statistics is a child or young person who is entitled to therapies and supports.  Each one is a family that is distressed and frustrated.</p> <p> In response to a question of mine last week in the children committee, the HSE revealed that not one of the 91 children's disability network teams was fully staffed.  As I pointed out then, a partial team is not a team.  The latest figures I have for the Cork south-west community disability network teams, CDNTs, from December, show that the Kinsale-Bandon-Carrigaline team is short a physio, two occupational therapists, 0.5 of a speech and language therapist and two psychologists.  In fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, she has secured funding for additional staff but the HSE is now citing recruitment issues.  The CEO described how recruiting health and social care professionals is a real challenge.  He outlined a plan to recruit 190 staff this year but, at the same time, only one specific CDNT speech and language therapy post was advertised on the HSE website.</p> <p> Working conditions and strains mean the recruitment and retention of staff is difficult.  The treatment of student healthcare staff is very poor, and student nurses, midwives, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and others receive very little or no pay.  There needs to be a larger review of how the HSE attracts and values clinical staff.  However, there is a very real chance that teams staffed at the planned levels will not address the significant challenges.  Even when the HSE was carrying out the much shorter 90-minute assessment, there were substantial waiting lists.  The HSE will now have to return to the proper assessment of need clinical process, which takes up to 29 hours on average.  This will obviously require more resources and staff time so will the HSE be recruiting more clinical practitioners?</p> <p> The HSE basically told the children committee that this will result in substantial impacts on the provision of therapies.  It contends that meeting its legal obligations on assessment, which it has failed to do for more than two years, will take away from therapeutic services.  This is a truly terrifying prospect for families.  According to the HSE position last week, things are going to get much worse for children and young people with disabilities.  The Minister might clarify in his closing response whether the current planned staffing levels will have to be adjusted to cater for the provision of full assessment of needs.</p> <p> Communication is another major issue for families.  Rare and infrequent contact from the HSE only adds to the worry of parents.  Down Syndrome Ireland&rsquo;s survey found that 40% of respondents had no communication from the HSE in the past 12 months.  The letters which do arrive are described as system focused rather than child and family focused.  Families need clear information on when their child will receive services and supports.  Inclusion Ireland has recommended that an external agency or parent steering group could &ldquo;parent proof&rdquo; letters and communication to families to avoid further distress and confusion.  Often, it is online groups and informal networks which offer the best advice and guidance for families, not the HSE.</p> <p> This situation also highlights the need for family forums.  Despite the aspiration towards making disability services more family-centred, it is not the case.  Family forums are supposed to be a part of progressing disability services but these forums are not functioning.  The Cork parents' advocacy network contacted me after repeated failed attempts to meet with the head of disability services for counties Cork and Kerry.  Many family forums in CHO 4 have yet to even be established.  Can the Minister provide clarity on when all of these forums will be established and the plans to support their effective running as meaningful measures?  </p> <p> Parents are distressed and angry; they are tired and despondent.  Every service, every appointment, every piece of equipment is a struggle.  As well as the 100 other things a parent has to worry about, they lie awake at night anxious about the therapies and supports their child is not getting and the impact it will have.  Parents save and sacrifice to get private appointments because they know that public service is inadequate.  They are exhausted.  One parent in the Down Syndrome Ireland survey summed up the situation for so many families: &ldquo;The whole process around PDS has been extremely stressful and the fears I highlighted have become a reality and my child is left without supports at an age when there is so much potential to support her if right supports are given.&rdquo;</p> <p> Part of the problem is the fractured nature of services.  Therapies are with this Department, transport with another and school supports with another.  Each one has a different form, a different phone number, a different policy.  Parents are overwhelmed with the number of offices and bodies with whom they have to interact.  Today&rsquo;s motion rightly calls for a joined-up cross-departmental strategic workforce plan across health and social care services.  Families, parents and grandparents should all know they will be supported.  They should know that the State and HSE have their backs.  Instead, they have to fight ten different offices for basic services.  The changes required here are massive and radical.  They need substantially more staff and a new way of supporting children and families.  However, these improvements will be hard won.  The 90-minute assessment of need was opposed by clinicians before it was introduced.  Families and advocates quickly highlighted its shortcomings.  A D&aacute;il motion condemned the practice but it took a High Court case for the HSE to implement correct procedures.</p> <p> Another worrying indicator is the absence of the Minister for Health in these debates.  I am glad he is here to contribute to this one as it is a very pressing issue that affects many families.  Especially after a major High Court ruling showing how the HSE failed more than 10,000 children, it is good to see him here.  I am not sure what his priorities are in his brief but, so far, disability does not seem to be among them.  That in no way detracts from the leadership and dedication the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has shown in this area.  However, it is clear from the challenges facing the health service in this area that the senior Minister needs to be more involved and present.</p> <p> Progressing disability services was supposed to replace the previous system where accessing services often depended on where people lived and how rich they were.  The HSE has unfortunately replicated this system.  It is still a geographical lottery and families that can afford it turn to private providers, while those that cannot have to wait, potentially for years.  Children and young people are entitled to the services they need.  That is not only our commitment under international law; it should be our moral code as a society.  Families and communities are doing all they can.  It is time the HSE and the State did their part as well.</p></speech>

We have debated for a considerable amount of time over the period I have been in this House the issue of disability services for children.  From my point of view and that of my colleagues, we have always tried to be constructive rather than destructive and tried not to make politics of it.  It is sometimes difficult not to make politics of issues but, on this issue, we try to be as constructive as possible.</p>  <p>  This issue goes back a considerable amount of time.  As with many other issues, there are legacy issues in regard to how we treat children and how we treat public health in this country.  What we are talking about is children being denied very basic services and very basic civil rights, in my opinion and, I believe, in everybody else's opinion.  Once those services are denied, a child's development can be greatly affected in regard to life expectancy and so forth.</p>  <p>  What we had in the past 17 years was a quite incredible situation where the Government was breaching its own laws around the Disability Act.</p> <p>It got more absurd when families trying to access these services had to go to the High Court.  Two hundred families went through that process to access basic services.  That situation got even more absurd when a High Court judge a couple of weeks ago said the standard operating procedure was not compatible with the Disability Act and the Government is basically breaking its own law.  Families have to go before the judge in the High Court to say they are not getting the services they need.  It is a ludicrous situation.  Will the Minister review the Disability Act 2005?  It was passed 17 years ago and was, in its essence, a good Act.  It gave a timeframe of six months within which families could get an assessment of needs.  We would all say that if people could get those services, we would be doing well.  The reality is so different.</p> <p> As I have said many times, when somebody comes into my office and the first thing they say is about assessment of needs, my head drops to the ground because I know how useless I am in that situation.  That family is going through this mechanism and has to wait years.  If families are coming to Deputies, then the system is completely flawed.  They should never be coming near Deputies.  They should be coming through the HSE early intervention team and using the procedures in place to get those services.  Families and children are denied and left to their own devices.  They sometimes have to go private, which is expensive.  Even if they go private now, there are huge waiting lists.  The situation is as grave as it can get, and is coupled with the situation in relation to the Disability Act.  In real life, families have to wait up to three and a half or four years for basic services, such as speech and language therapy or occupational therapy.  You would want to have a heart of stone when somebody says their child who is four will be seven and a half before they get the services.  This is a wealthy country.  It is not poor by any means and should have the provision to treat children in a civil way.  Will the Minister review the Disability Act because, by my reckoning, it is not fit for purpose?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-29a.271" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032900031#EE00200"><p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for using its time on this issue again.  It is ironic.  In the past couple of months every time the Opposition demands a debate on something, the Taoiseach, in particular, likes to say the Opposition has all this Private Members' time to use and if Opposition Members want a debate on Yemen or the national maternity hospital, they should use that time.  If the Government and the State agencies at the HSE did not break their own law and force Sinn F&eacute;in and the Opposition to use Private Members' time to raise the same issues repeatedly to pursue the basics for children with special needs to get what they deserve and need instead of being messed around, and if the brains of the HSE were put to resolving problems people have and providing assistance people need rather than fiddling around with the figures to try to cover up what was going on, then the Opposition might have more free time available for some of the other issues we want to debate.  This should not be necessary.</p>  <p>  For the second time in a month, the Government will pass an Opposition Private Members' motion on children with special needs and the assessment of needs.  Okay, it is better that it pass it than that it does not.  That is grand.  However, what the families and parents want to see is not just the D&aacute;il passing motions.  They want us to pass motions to put pressure on the Government to do something about the issue.  They want concrete action.  There are concrete demands in the motion they want to see happen.</p>  <p>  There is no excuse for Ireland not to sign the optional protocol.  The only reason not to sign it is to avoid providing people with a route to ensure their rights under the UNCRPD can be vindicated.  We need to see that immediately so that if the Government does not do what it is meant to do, people have a route to vindicate their rights.  We need a full and transparent publication of all the waiting lists so we can see the truth of what is happening.  That truth is being consciously covered up and distorted by the HSE, contrary to the law as it currently exists.  Then - it is not rocket science - we need investment to ensure kids get the support they need.  The latest figures I saw show that 34,000 children are waiting for community health supports, including speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and all the therapies people need to access.</p>  <p>  Every time I meet families on this issue, it strikes me they have enough going on in their lives and enough pressure in trying to support and do everything they can for their children.  Then the Government and State leaves them with no alternative but to spend a huge amount of time fighting for things that should be basic rights.  I pay tribute to all those involved in activism around this issue despite the fact they have no time for it and to those who take the State to court, all the way up to the High Court, to vindicate the rights of their children.  They should not have to do it.</p>  <p>  I will raise one case illustrating the criminal failure by the State of children with special needs.  I was talking to a woman yesterday.  She was happy for me to use her name, Sharon Saunders.  Her child has Down's syndrome.  I have three refusal letters for 2020, 2021 and 2022 wherein everybody accepts he needs a space in a special school but, year on year, he has rejection letters from the school because there is not enough space.  He is on a waiting list and, year on year, it never happens.  That is no criticism of the school.  It is a criticism of the insufficient investment in our education and healthcare to ensure children get the support they need.  We pay all this lip service to early intervention, but the practice is extremely late intervention.  The consequence of the lack of investment is that this 12-year-old is sitting in a mainstream fifth class primary school at the back of the class getting assistance from a special needs assistant,  SNA.  The school is doing everything it can to support him but it is not where he needs to be.  He needs to be in a special school.  That is the best thing for him but we have failed to invest in resources to ensure the spaces are available.  That is a political choice.  A different political choice can and should be made.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, more than 50% of the families of children with disabilities surveyed by Inclusion Ireland reported they were not receiving any medical therapies.  A separate survey undertaken by Down Syndrome Ireland, DSI, confirms this finding, with almost half of its respondents reporting they have received no therapy of any kind in the past year.</p> <p> Let us put ourselves in the place of the parents of these children.  They love their children.  They want the very best for them, for them to learn and achieve everything they possibly can and to have access to everything they require.  The parents certainly do not want to have to fight or beg for essential services for their children or to scramble for their children's entitlements.  It is a battle that is lost before the struggle begins.  This is the stark reality for families of disabled children.</p> <p> Down Syndrome Ireland recently released details of a survey carried out with 400 of its members on the services they received over the past year.  Of those surveyed, 65% had received no speech and language therapy, 70% had received no physiotherapy, 87% had received no occupational therapy and 95% had received no psychology services.  Overall, 44% of those surveyed had received no therapy service of any kind.  It is an appalling vista.  When the results of this survey were put to the HSE, the response was "there are 91 Children's Disability Network Teams, CDNTs, across the country and that these teams ensure children with complex needs can access child and family centred supports based on their need rather than their diagnosis".  When questioned at the Oireachtas joint committee, it emerged that the HSE is functioning at 75% of its capacity.  Therefore, the truth remains that the organisation has an understaffed service where overworked professionals cannot meet demands.</p> <p> When we hear these figures and statistics, they alarm us.  They are frustrating and annoying.  To really grasp what these figures mean, however, we must look beyond the numbers.  We must fully comprehend how the lack of services has an impact on those left without them.  These children and young people are not numbers.  They are young girls and boys and sons and daughters.  They are people who need support, but that help is being denied to them.  To deny them the necessary supports is to deny them the chance to live their best lives.  It prevents these young people and their families from reaching their maximum potential.  It confines them to a life controlled by disability rather than providing them with the means to live in which disabled family members can contribute the very best of themselves.</p> <p> Not providing essential therapies is a form of neglect.  By being denied speech and language therapy, children are not only being deprived of the help they require with communicating but also being denied help with eating, drinking and swallowing.  These skills fall within the remit of a speech and language therapist.  Occupational therapy allows children to develop their fine motor skills, improve hand-to-eye co-ordination and to perform the tasks associated with everyday life.  Physiotherapy helps to improve movement and function in the body and address issues caused by problems with muscles, bones or the nervous system.</p> <p> Every therapy recommended for children with disabilities is vital for those children.  The therapies help them to gain coping skills, to learn self-regulation, social skills and social thinking, to understand their own strengths and weaknesses, to connect with their emotions and to improve their self-esteem.  To deny them this help is to deny them their basic fundamental rights as individuals.  It prevents them from achieving their full potential.  The HSE has stated it is seeking to address the shortage of staff required to provide services to all children with disabilities, and that it is working to identify gaps and to develop a comprehensive workforce plan for the sector.</p> <p> I call these responses platitudes.  The Minister needs to ask the HSE to provide evidence of exactly what it is doing to provide services for vulnerable children and young people.  How much time will it take to identify and address the gaps?  What is the timescale involved?  When can we expect to see an efficient and effective service in place?  Children in Tipperary and in every town and village in the country do not have the time to wait for the HSE to seek and to identify.  They need these services urgently.  As children, this is their window of opportunity to access the help they need.  Further excuses and delays must not be tolerated.  Parents and their children demand and deserve a proper professional service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-29a.279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1622" speakername="Verona Murphy" time="18:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032900032#FF00200"><p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for its work in putting together and tabling this motion.  I recently submitted four parliamentary questions relating to disability services in Wexford.  I asked the Minister to state the number of occupational therapists employed as part of the CDNT in Wexford.  The response stated three occupational therapists were currently in posts across the County Wexford CDNT, that a total of nine occupational therapists had been approved for Wexford and the HSE was experiencing significant staff recruitment challenges, which were having an impact on service delivery.  The HSE and the Department of Health have identified the need for nine occupational therapists and yet we have just three employed in the county.  That is 33% of what is required for the children of Wexford.</p>  <p>  During my first month in this House, I raised the question of training and of how the HSE advertised its staffing requirements across every area and communicated that need to the third level institutions.  The Ceann Comhairle intervened at the time with the Minister and demanded an answer.  The Minister's response was the issue would be rectified and it would be fixed, yet we still see only three colleges accrediting courses for occupational therapists, OTs.  The starting salary for an OT is &euro;37,000.  That will sound like a lot of money to the parents seeking intervention, but it is only 9% of the salary received by the CEO of the HSE, Paul Reid.  Perhaps there could be a re-examination of the pay scales to reduce some of the obscene salaries paid to top executives.  Allocating funds to better starting salaries for front-line areas might help with recruitment.  It would certainly be a more beneficial and effective use of funds.</p>  <p>  In another parliamentary question, I asked the Minister to outline the number of children awaiting an appointment with the occupational therapist in the CDNT in County Wexford and the time they had been waiting.  Unfortunately, the HSE did not provide an answer to either of those questions.  I can tell it the answer, though.  One of my constituents, Amy, has a little son who has been waiting since he was two years old.  He is six years old now and has had no appointment yet.  That would mean the waiting time is four years.  This is not early intervention.  It is pure and utter neglect.</p>  <p>  I asked another question about the number of children awaiting an assessment with the CDNT in County Wexford and the time each child had been waiting.  My last question was about the number of children aged under 18 waiting to be seen by the CDNT and the autism services in County Wexford and the length of time each child had been waiting and had been on a waiting list.  The response I received was the number of children waiting in County Wexford before the reconfiguration of the services was 445 and this number was likely to increase.  The response was unclear as to whether this figure was an answer to my first question, my second question or to both queries.</p>  <p>  This is pretty infuriating.  Almost all the dealings I have with HSE services involve some major issue.  Sometimes it is a staffing problem and sometimes a funding problem or a problem of capacity or physical resources.  All these issues combined demonstrate clearly to me the HSE is in crisis and is being poorly led.  The organisation's CEO, Paul Reid, earns more than the Minister and the Taoiseach put together, and what do we have to show for it?  I do not see any evidence of improving outcomes for patients and I do not see value for money for the taxpayers.  What I do see are waiting lists getting longer and longer.  I am pretty sure Paul Reid does not have to wait four years for anything.</p>  <p>  People in these situations, who have been on waiting lists for years, have been caring for children whose needs it is incredibly difficult to meet without support from experts and specialists, which those parents and their children currently cannot access.  People are at their wits' end trying to cope with no help in sight.  I receive heartbreaking phone calls daily from parents like Amy who plead with me to help and to see if anything can be done for their children.  These are the very people who deserve to go to the wellness conferences, but they are not earning enough money to do so.  Their tax payments contribute to the very large salaries of those in charge, but these parents are barely keeping their heads above water and trying to do right by their children.  All they want is timely help and early intervention, but they are not getting that.  Why can we not get it right for once?  Why are we ignoring court rules that state it is wrong?</p> <p>Are we just going to ignore it and give somebody else a pay rise that might deflect from the seriousness of this matter?  This is utter and total negligence by the hierarchy of the HSE and, more so, by the Government for allowing the executive to get away with it without accountability.</p></speech>

It is also horrendous that parents must fight tooth and nail for these basic and essential services.  We have a very serious problem in the State.</p>  <p>  In my constituency of Laois-Offaly, those therapies are virtually non-existent.  I am aware of the case of a seven-year-old child who has never received a session of speech therapy.  It is absolutely shocking, and the child in question has profound disabilities.  I am asking for something to be done fast and for urgency to be applied to this unacceptable crisis, particularly in Laois-Offaly.  I ask for the recruitment of speech and language therapists and occupational therapists to be given top priority because this has gone on for years.  I remember being here as a newly elected Deputy in 2016 raising these same matters.</p>  <p>  My offices across Laois and Offaly are inundated with calls from desperate, upset and frustrated parents who seem to encounter barrier after barrier when it comes to accessing speech and occupational therapy or even the assessment of need.  There is a terrible number of barriers that must be overcome and these parents and children need assistance.  They will not be able to reach their educational potential if they are not given that vital, basic and necessary support when they are young children in the system, either through early intervention or the school-age teams.  This must happen urgently.</p>  <p>  All of this represents an appalling indictment of the State's capacity to understand what its legal obligations were and are with respect to the assessment of needs process.  The High Court judgment referred to in the motion has staggering implications and we can consider how the process adopted by the Health Service Executive caused its assessment officers to err in law.  The HSE does not intend to appeal the High Court case and is in breach of its obligations to vindicate the rights of children with disabilities.</p></speech>

It is the third time, I think, a motion like this has been before the D&aacute;il recently, as Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies indicated when presenting the motion.  They indicated that this motion has been moved because of the many High Court challenges.</p>  <p>  What is going on in the country that the HSE, including Mr. Paul Reid and others in the top management under the Minister's watch, can do as they like without being accountable to anybody?  The Minister can fly out to Dubai or Abu Dhabi or wherever he was; it could be Timbuktu and I hope he might stay there.  It is all these people are fit for.  They are not accountable to anybody and they do not respect the people.  They do not respect children, na daoine &oacute;ga.  Before Covid-19 I knew of people waiting two years for a service and now they are waiting four or five years.</p>  <p>  Have the people responsible for this no shame?  We are meant to cherish people equally - mol an &oacute;ige and tiocfaidh s&iacute;.  Our children are being denied their rights and people are being forced to go to the courts, where the State has seen loss after loss.  It does not cost the Department or the HSE anything but it costs the taxpayer to fight each of those cases.  Nobody seems to be accountable.</p>  <p>  I heard the Taoiseach comment when he was in America that if there is to be an inquiry into the appalling way Covid-19 was handled, he does not expect Mr. Reid or Dr. Holohan to be brought before it.  Why would these people not hide and scurry and blackguard people when they have got away with the likes of this for decades?  There is no accountability and they are on shocking money.</p>  <p>  Young people need speech and language therapy and assessments.  I meet dozens of people every week who say they are looking for jobs as speech and language therapists but cannot get them.  What is going on?  It is a con job and the people know it.  The Government has no shame and its members will try to run and hide.  They have no place to hide.</p></speech>

The Government, the Department of Health and the HSE are really letting down children with disabilities.  It is a tough cross to bear for these parents and the children when they do not come into this world 100% and are lacking what they need.  An assessment of needs takes forever and they do not get the speech and language therapy they need so much.  There is also occupational therapy, physiotherapy and all the other therapies.</p>  <p>  I know parents of children who are going mad because they cannot get orthodontic treatment.  The children's little gums go too strong and their teeth go wrong so they need treatment.  They must wait four years.  Please, Minister.  There are also cases of scoliosis and spina bifida, and we see little children crying on television telling their stories about their spines going crooked.  Please, Minister.  The Taoiseach has said the Government was allocating &euro;5.2 million to this but then the Government statement indicates the sum as &euro;4 million per year.  Who is right or wrong?  Who is the Government trying to kid?  Children with Down's syndrome dearly need the July provision but there is a lack of such services every year when it comes to July.  Those children need routine and continuity in schooling.  If they miss July, they can lose an entire year.</p>  <p>  There is no accountability in the Government, the Department of Health, the HSE and the services that are supposed to be provided.  The entire process is going wrong.</p></speech>

Only a couple of months ago I was fighting in here to save the Kilbrittain early intervention unit in west Cork.  It was fully intended to close that unit and, luckily enough, parents sat down within hours of hearing the story and I had it back before the D&aacute;il within a couple of days.  Okay, the decision was reversed, but unfortunately for the intervention unit, it faces the same problem of closure this time next year.  I had to fundraise for it a number of years ago.  It is an excellent unit run by the school in Kilbrittain.</p>  <p>  There is also a lack of SNAs in west Cork.  I attended a fundraiser last week and I thought it shameful that we had to attend such a fundraiser for a special needs assistant in Ballydehob.  Is that what the system in our country has gone to?  We cannot get the services for the young people and they must go out fundraising.</p>  <p>  It is the same issue with the recent closure of the Castletownbere CoAction centre.  Pay parity is the issue and CoAction has told me it cannot get staff.  That ends up with services for people being closed.  We have an entire system mired in difficulty that has been left unattended.  Unfortunately, people suffer as a result.</p>  <p>  Care workers and those who help at home, as well as others looking after people with disabilities, such as the Irish Wheelchair Association, thought they would get some respect with the &euro;1,000 payment from the Government but many of them will not get it.  Perhaps some of the home help personnel will get it.</p>  <p>  I must raise the matter of an adult who fell last week in Bandon.  I apologise to the family for not raising it before now but the entire system is failing and cracking at the seams.  The lady in question fell at 2 p.m. on Monday, 21 March, and waited 14 hours for an ambulance.  She had a fractured hip and broken shoulder and imagine she had to wait 14 hours for an ambulance.  There is something wrong in the HSE and the system.  It is creaking at the top.  That lady had to wait 14 hours at her house before an ambulance attended to her at 4 a.m.  That was after falling at 2 p.m. the previous day.</p></speech>

I saw what the Minister said he did not see at the hospital because I was there for 24 hours.  There were trolleys on corridors everywhere, with nurses and doctors trying to do their jobs.

I was there for 24 hours.</p> <p>On the night that I was there the staff could not do enough for me but I witnessed a health hazard and fire hazards of trolleys on both sides of corridors putting patients and staff at risk.</p> <p> I also know of a person who took their child with scoliosis to a hospital here in Dublin.  They had been preparing for this operation for six months and they had the child on the bed waiting to go to surgery, only to be told the operation was cancelled because they did not have a bed for the child after the surgery was finished.  These are the most vulnerable people in our society.  I need the Minister's help.  I need accountability within our hospital system.  The Minister should come and meet me in Limerick on a surprise visit.  I will bring him around the hospitals and he will be able to see at first hand what is happening.</p></speech>

At the end of last year I submitted a question to the HSE and got a very detailed six-page reply on CDNTs, the SOP, preliminary team assessment, resources and so on.  According to that reply, all our problems were solved.  It stated that the SOP for the assessment of need process sought to ensure children with disabilities and their families access appropriate assessment and intervention as quickly as possible, and that the approach to assessment of need is consistent across all areas.  It broke down what the primary team assessment is as a guideline, and talked about setting up the CDNTs.  Clinicians were being brought back from their reassigned Covid-19 roles, overtime was being given, and all this was being done to deal with the SOP.  The reply went on to give details of the composition of the teams and stated that they would all be set up and running by the end of 2021.</p>  <p>  We have always known the reality for parents because we are dealing with them every day of the week.  It is totally different.  We know from the Joint Committee on Health last week that not one of the CDNTs is fully staffed and there is an average vacancy rate of about 25% across the teams.  Professor Malcolm McLachlan, clinical lead for people with disabilities, said some of the CDNTs are only staffed to around 50%.  The CDNT in Armagh Road in my area of Dublin 12 needs 11.7 whole-time equivalents.  When that question went in at the beginning of March there were 8.8 staff.  They had just recruited two and the two left within a matter of two weeks.  That was for occupational therapy and physiotherapy.  In Br&uacute; Chaoimh&iacute;n, which is also in my constituency, there are nine vacancies.</p>  <p>  Families are extremely frustrated and children are open to developing secondary disabilities as they spend longer on waiting lists.  The new Our Lady of Hope special school has no on-site therapist and this is scandalous as it leaves teachers, SNAs and children in very difficult situations.  CHO 7 is at 60% of the capacity it should be at.  This did not happen today or yesterday.  It happened when the Minister was putting questions in as an Opposition Deputy in the last D&aacute;il.  It was the same thing.</p>  <p>  One parent went through the assessment of need procedure.  She put a complaint in because her son was still waiting.  They have absolutely no supports for their son.  They were advised as to what the parent can do but she has absolutely no support.  The reply that came back was very simple: that the staff were not there and her son was going to have to wait until they got staff in the next period.  It is very demoralising for the parent.  The reply stated that recruitment continues to be a major issue, and while all the teams are doing everything possible, which I know they are, the parent's complaint was being closed on the recommendation that the CDNT would continue to engage with her in relation to her child and that clinically appropriate interventions and therapies would be provided when the appropriate clinicians are on board and her child is reached on the waiting list.  These families were given a great buzz about the fact that things were changing, they were going to get their assessment of need, and they were going to get their access to therapy.  It has just been smacked in their faces again.  That is the terrible outcome of this.</p>  <p>  The court case is just damning.  I will read a few of the judge's points in my last minute.  The judge made a ruling in two test actions brought on behalf of minor children who in judicial review proceedings brought against the HSE sought to quash reports compiled after they underwent SOPs.  They wanted their assessments quashed on the grounds that they did not comply with the requirements of the 2005 Act.  It was further argued that the SOP findings did not amount to a proper diagnosis or assessment of their needs, which amounted to a breach of their rights.  In her decision, the judge said that in order to comply with the time requirements of the 2005 Act, the HSE developed the SOP which was implemented from January 2020.  The SOP, she said, provides for preliminary or triage type assessment instead of the full assessments which had previously been carried out.  She said the SOP came about because in a significant number of cases the statutory time period fixed for completing the assessment of need was not respected and this in turn led to delays in completing assessments and associated litigation.  It is a damning judgment of the HSE.  I would really like to know exactly how it affects the 10,000 children who underwent that SOP.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-29a.290" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1605" speakername="Marian Harkin" time="18:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032900034#HH00300"><p>I thank Sinn F&eacute;in and Deputy Tully for giving us the opportunity to discuss and hold the Government to account on the deteriorating situation in regard to services for children with disabilities.  It is most concerning that just over two weeks ago the High Court decided that the HSE is in breach of the rights of children with disabilities as set out in the Disability Act 2005.  That is 17 years ago.  The assessment of need that is conducted is simply not adequate to identify the extent and nature of the disability or, crucially, the corresponding level of service that is needed to assist those children in living their lives, in supporting their families and in helping to ensure the children have the best possible chance to live their lives and to maximise their quality of life just like every other citizen of the State.</p>  <p>  I am shocked by what has happened.  I have sat in this Chamber and heard time and time again that real progress was being made in the assessment of needs of children with disabilities.  When I heard of this supposed progress I was happy to hear it but in the back of my mind I was hoping they had the services in place to deal with all of these successful assessments.  Little did I think that the first step, the assessment of need, was not being adequately dealt with.  I was concerned about the second step, the meeting of those needs and the services to address them.  Are we moving children from one list to another?  Can the Minister clarify the difference between screening and assessment?  I listened carefully to what was being said here in the D&aacute;il.  Can the Minister tell me why I thought this assessment was taking place and was virtually completed?  I do not refer to pre-assessment and screening; I thought it was done and dusted.  I do not know what is happening.  I listened to the response earlier and we were told that the Minister would tell us what is happening.  I am very anxious to hear that but to be honest I am really disappointed because I believed what I heard and thought we were making progress.</p>  <p>  In my own constituency in the last 12 to 15 months I have calling for the CHO 1 area of Sligo, Leitrim, Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan to be included as part of the school inclusion model which delivers a range of in-school supports and therapies including speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and so on.  The idea is that special needs assistants, SNAs, would be fully trained and allocated as needed and that additional professional supports would be available to schools.  Three years ago the Government approved the setting up of the first pilot programme.  I understand Covid intervened.  This pilot programme was in CHO 7 and the Minister's constituency is part of that.  We were told that the programme would be extended.  Time and time again I have asked for this to be extended to CHO 1 and we are still awaiting a response.  The reason I have done this is on foot of information I have to hand, for example in regard to the recruitment of speech and language therapists.</p> <p>There are 32 whole-time equivalent positions allocated but only 19.4 filled.  It is not as bad, but it is a similar story in the case of social workers, physiotherapists and occupational therapists.  Many positions remain unfilled.  If the region were included in the next phase of the pilot programme, it would make a real difference.  I do not need to tell the Minister that the numbers of children who are awaiting services under CAMHS increases year-on-year.</p> <p> Yesterday, I received one of the saddest letters I have had in a long time.  It was about the total inadequacy of youth mental health services in Sligo and Leitrim, including the lack of beds, the lack of communication between professional teams and the neglect of young people in urgent need of such services.  It is dreadful that Deputies or any public representatives have to say to a parent who rings them trying to get a child into CAMHS that the only advice they can give is to bring the child to an emergency department and not to leave until he or she is taken into the service.  From the bottom of my heart, I hate doing it because emergency departments are full of people who need immediate help.  However, there is nothing else I can say to those parents.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, wanted to be here this evening and she apologises for her absence.  As she said in the House three weeks ago to the day, the matters being discussed at that time, and which are raised again in the Private Members' motion, are hugely important and require a ruthless and ambitious focus on our health services and on the implementation of the progressing disability services programme for children.</p>  <p>  There is considerable work to do.  When I was on the other side of the House, I made very similar contributions to those I have heard today.  One of the many reasons I asked to be Minister for Health in the incoming Government was to be able to provide funding, focus and resources for children who need help.  It simply is not acceptable in our republic that children should have to wait for an assessment of need.  It simply is not acceptable that having been assessed as needing help, they should have to wait any length of time to receive it.  We all have friends and family, we all know children who need a service and we all know how important those services are and that children need to access them as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  While some areas of the country are doing well, particularly in some therapeutic areas, the reality is that far too many simply are not.  We will have to redouble our efforts in this regard.  We have invested the money in assessment and hiring therapists.  I assure the House that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has worked tirelessly on this issue.  She has driven around the country since she was appointed, CHO by CHO, meeting one therapeutic team after another and asking what money and staff they need and what are the barriers to hiring those staff.  I, too, have had many of the same conversations.  We all know that, unfortunately, there still is a long way to go.  The money has been invested and the policy for a national network, namely, the progressing disability services model, although not perfect, is a good approach.  There is a very good relationship between the Minister of State, the Oireachtas committee and those of us in this House who are really passionate about this area.</p>  <p>  Before addressing some of the technical issues raised, the court ruling and the content of the motion, I repeat that there is a lot more that needs to be done.  We all are aware that in every one of our constituencies, there are mums and dads who are desperate to get therapies for their children, whether occupational therapy, psychology, speech and language therapy or whatever it may be across the range of therapies.  We are not going to stop until we have made sure the teams are in place at entry, senior and management level to ensure that when a child gets an assessment, it is the right and appropriate assessment, and that when a need is identified, he or she gets help.  I know that nobody on either side of the House will stop until we achieve that.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the content of the judgment that was issued by the High Court on the SOP.  It is important to state that in terms of the rationale under which the SOP was introduced, the overarching principle was to establish the needs of children rather than providing a diagnosis.  It was about establishing needs and ensuring a quicker route to intervention services.  It never was intended to prevent or reduce children's access to their legal entitlements.  The SOP was developed following a lot of engagement with expert stakeholders, there was an extensive industrial relations process involved and legal advice was taken on it.  The procedure was agreed at the start of 2020 and I allocated money towards the second half of that year to the Minister of State to ensure as many children as possible were assessed.  There was a very large backlog of children waiting for assessment and we needed to make sure as many as possible of them were seen.</p>  <p>  The question rightly has been raised as to what was done to put the therapies in place.  We invested a very considerable amount of money in increasing the workforce.  However, as has been pointed out by colleagues this evening, by the Minister of State and by the HSE, it is currently challenging to hire, not just in children's disability services but in acute services, adult services and primary care services right around the country.  There are a lot of good things happening, the money is there and the posts have been sanctioned across the board.  We are hiring many thousands of therapists but it is a challenge and it is one on which we must continue to work.</p>  <p>  The court judgment puts the HSE in a position whereby, obviously, it now must consider the assessment of need process.  I note the comments by Mr. Paul Reid in regard to the consideration of an appeal.  I believe the judgment provides the State with an opportunity.  We need to build on the elements of the process that work and we need to eliminate or amend the elements that do not work.  I know the Minister of State made similar comments three weeks ago.  We need to assess the full picture and gather a lot of information.  In this regard, I am conscious of a case in the Court of Appeal, a ruling on which is expected shortly.  An independent review of the SOP is under way and is now being finalised.  Needless to say, the legal framework for the State takes precedence but it is prudent to gather as much other information as possible.</p>  <p>  The core of any future action has to be the delivery of services to children as quickly and effectively as possible in line with the legislation.  While addressing the judgment of the courts, which is important and must be resolved, it is worth saying that the assessment of need is only one part of the service delivery.  We are very determined to address the standard of that assessment but we also must create a model that ensures the therapies identified, as we have discussed this evening, can be delivered.  In that context, the HSE is consulting the chief executives of the organisations designated under sections 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004, the lead agencies and other stakeholders.  In the meantime, the assessment of need will no longer be issued on the basis of a preliminary team assessment.  Where appointments have been scheduled, they will form the first step in the assessment of need process.</p>  <p>  The initiatives mentioned in the House recently will continue to be developed.  As many colleagues will be aware, they include the development of parents' forums.  The Minister of State has advised me that she intends to commence the countrywide forums next week, starting in Cork.  A major focus for her will be on developing enhanced communication with parents and seeking to build trust in the services provided.  We need to listen very carefully to the parents.</p></speech>

My figures will not be exact.  From a briefing note I read earlier this morning, I believe about one third of the target was met in the first year that the number in question was allocated.  I am saying this just to give colleagues a sense that the money is available and that the posts have been sanctioned, but it is proving difficult to hire the therapists.  Obviously, we are working on expanding the number of graduate positions and the number of graduates coming through.</p> <p> In addition to these actions, the Department has agreed to funding of &euro;1.5 million for approximately 1,000 ASD diagnostic assessments.  The HSE has said that initiative is now under way.  Regardless of any process that the HSE considers to address the concerns over the standard operating procedure, the developments I have mentioned will enhance the capacity of the CDNTs.  It is expected that the measures will translate directly into enhancing services to the child and his or her family.</p> <p> Regarding section 13 reporting, which was also raised, the HSE has presented annual reports for 2007 to 2014 to the Department of Health and is currently working on the annual reports for 2015 to 2020 to bring the process up to date.  The HSE intends to submit the outstanding reports by the end of the year.  The HSE and officials in my Department are scheduled to meet shortly to discuss the section 13 reports in greater detail.  While the HSE has stated it has experienced delays due to the cyberattack last year and found limitations in the assessment officer system database, which was referred to earlier, the lack of reporting cannot be deemed acceptable.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has sought assurances on the nature of the statistics and has been advised that the delay has not affected the HSE's calculation in establishing additional resources.</p> <p> I assure this House and all colleagues that the Government is as determined and committed as ever to providing timely access to high-quality health and social care services for children and young people who need them.  This includes appropriate assessment and the right interventions.  We now have an opportunity that we must grasp.  We must focus relentlessly, invest, and prioritise to give the children the assessments they need and the therapeutic interventions and supports they need following those assessments.</p></speech>

The High Court has ruled that the HSE's AON process is operating outside the law and denying children with disabilities their rights, as set out in the Disability Act.  Let it sink in for us all that an Opposition party is introducing a Private Members' motion that essentially asks the Government to stop breaking the law, allowing an agency under its control to break the law, and denying children their rights.</p>  <p>  I do not doubt for one second doubt the sincerity of the Minister or Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, on this issue, but the crux is accountability.  HSE representatives appeared before the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and Deputies Tully and Cullinane were in conversation with them.  The officials were asked what they needed and their answer was that we should actually scrap the little protection that our children with disabilities have - the legal provision.  As the person responsible and approved by this House to oversee our health services, the Minister should drag all those officials in and threaten them with their jobs unless their attitude changes.  If I am correct, he noted the remarks of the head of the HSE on a potential appeal of the High Court ruling.  I suggest that he tells the CEO of the HSE that if he wants to appeal the ruling, the cost can be met from his wages.  I suggest that the Minister, as overseer of the Department that gives the HSE its budget, tells the CEO and every senior manager in the HSE that the next time they decide to drag family a child with a disability through the courts, they can do so at their own expense because they do not have the authority of this House to spend the money of the taxpayers of Ireland to drag families of children with disabilities through the quagmire of the legal system.  The message from this House should be unanimous, clear and heeded by the HSE.  It should stop breaking the law and treating children with disabilities with disrespect and start providing them with their rights and entitlements under the Disability Act and the services they deserve.</p></speech>

She has done so because the Government cannot be trusted to live up to its responsibilities to children.  It is great to hear that the Minister understands the position.  These are famous words we hear over and over from the other side of the floor regarding everything that comes up but families want action, not statements that the Government understands and knows what needs to be done.  Our children have been failed owing to unmet obligations on the part of the Government and HSE through the manipulation of the system that is meant to put children's interests first.  There has been a betrayal of trust that was supposed to be reinforced under the Disability Act 2005, which placed a duty on the HSE to provide a comprehensive AON within six months.  To avoid its obligations, the HSE introduced a preliminary team assessment in 2020, its purpose being to skirt around the obligations set out under the Disability Act.  This created another waiting list that does not fall under the Act and lacks any legal requirement to provide the comprehensive assessment within the timeframe set.  The recent High Court ruling showed that this is in breach of the Disability Act 2005.  This reflects what parents, disability organisations, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Ombudsman for Children have said, but it does not stop there because not a single one of the 91 CDNTs around the country is fully staffed, which results in children going without the full suite of development services they need.  Can the Minister now see why neither families nor we believe the Government when it says it understands and wants to do what is required?</p>  <p>  The Association of Occupational Therapists of Ireland, the Psychological Society of Ireland and the Irish Association of Speech and Language Therapists have said a significant number of front-line clinicians have left or intend to leave their posts in child disability services as a result of the implementation of the new assessment procedure.  That paints a picture of children's disability services under the Government.</p>  <p>  We introduced this Bill to ensure the Government and HSE would stop breaking the law and cutting corners and provide children with the services they need.  Given the seriousness of the High Court finding, we want an assurance that any review of the Disability Act will not be used to undermine the current rights of people with disabilities.  We demand that the Government live up to its moral and legal obligations.</p></speech>

All of us have children and families in our constituencies who have been waiting for years for services and assessments.  We have heard from parents who have letters telling them their child will be seen for an appointment in November 2024 or four years' time.  That is outrageous and has to be urgently addressed.</p>  <p>  While I welcome the fact that the Government is not opposing this motion, can I assume it is supporting it?  I wish to reiterate what we are calling for in the motion.  The Minister talked about the High Court ruling, the preliminary team assessment and the reason the latter was introduced, namely to assess the needs of children to ensure they receive therapies or interventions quickly.  That was not happening, however.  Children were getting the preliminary team assessment only to be put on another waiting list for a proper, full assessment of need and services and interventions.</p>  <p>  Some Members have talked about a review of the Disability Act.  I agree it should be reviewed to bring it into line with the UNCRPD and to ensure it is based on a rights-focused model, but the rights of children must not be undermined or deleted in any way when reviewing it.  In fact, the review should be used to strengthen the right of children to gain access to services and interventions.</p></speech>

That needs to be addressed urgently.  The Minister mentioned that the reports up to 2014 were published but that those since then have not been.  We are calling to have the outstanding reports in the autumn session, in September.  We will return to this if they are not provided.</p>  <p>  We have talked about engaging in proactive and joined-up workforce planning to develop a strategy to address the staff shortages in all the services.</p> <p>Something should be done to try to entice those health and social care professionals who left services because of their discomfort with the preliminary team assessment.  Many of them have stated that is why they left the services.  Now that a High Court ruling has stated that preliminary team assessments will not be continued, we should consider whether people can be enticed back to services.  </p> <p> I have heard of problems with CORU and the time it is taking for it to accredit the qualifications of people coming from the North to work in the State.  The process is taking up to ten months.  That is something that could be addressed quite quickly.  </p> <p> We need to talk to people not just in third-level colleges but in secondary school about working in the sector and do something to entice them into the sector.  Perhaps there could be a reduction or waiver of fees.  A job guarantee with a contract that ensures that those who qualify need areas do not export their skills and knowledge is vital.  We are also looking for a report before the summer that outlines in full the number of whole-time equivalents that will receive jobs in 2022 and the other supports and resources being given to the children's disability network teams to address the backlog of assessments, carry out proper assessments and provide the therapies children require.</p> <p> Every effort needs to made to ensure that the networks are up and running at full capacity without delay.  The Minister mentioned family forums, which are important.  The Minister of State, Deputy Burke, made a reference to parents having to do training to support therapies.  Parents are not objecting to doing training in any way whatsoever.  However, they are objecting to doing it alone.  Children are not receiving therapies.  Some parents have told me that even though they have done the training, they are being asked to do it again, and are being told if they do not do it their children will be removed from waiting lists.  That is absolutely outrageous and should not happen.  </p> <p> The ongoing disparity between staff in section 39 organisations and those working directly for the HSE has to be addressed.  Those agencies are haemorrhaging staff to the HSE and cannot retain staff in any form.  Staff need the same pay and working conditions across the sector.</p> <p> I also want to use this opportunity to call on the Government to ratify the optional protocol to the UNCRPD, something that is still outstanding.  Refugees are coming to Ireland from other countries.  We are expecting a large number from Ukraine, many of whom may be qualified in these professions.  We to examine whether we can engage those people and allow them to work here.  They will have PPS numbers and be allowed to work.  Let us get them into our teams to fill the need that is there.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-29a.307.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1607" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032900037#LL00500"><p>I want to ask the Minister about the roll-out of community CCTV programmes across the country.  In many rural areas it has been an issue.  In County Sligo, an elderly man was recently attacked in his home.  Many people said there is a need to have preventative measures around the country, one of which is, of course, CCTV, not just in rural areas but also in many urban areas where drug dealing and other such activities are taking place in broad daylight.  It is a measure that would assist garda&iacute; in preventing such crimes from occurring.  I would like the views of the Minister on how that is progressing.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-29a.308" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032900037#LL00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  As he will be aware, community CCTV schemes play an important role in local communities the length and breadth of the country.  They provide valuable reassurance and help people to feel safer in local areas.  It is not just about making sure we can use them to detect crime and support garda&iacute;; they play a role in helping to keep and make people feel safe.  This is why it remains a priority for my Department to ensure community groups continue to be supported in developing their local CCTV schemes, while balancing this with proportionate oversight of important data protection statutory considerations.  That is an important element.</p><p>Since 2017, my Department has administered a grant aid scheme, supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area.  Eligible groups, including community groups and local authorities nationwide, can apply for grant aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum total of &euro;40,000.  The CCTV grant scheme was extended in 2019 to cover not only new CCTV systems but to also provide funding for the extension or upgrade of existing CCTV systems that are incomplete or have become obsolete.  Applicants may now also seek a once-off grant of up to &euro;5,000 for minor maintenance costs.  Support and assistance for those running CCTV schemes is available by contacting my Department at a dedicated email address available from my its website.</p><p>To date, a total of 35 locations have been approved under the community-based CCTV scheme, with a total of almost &euro;950,000 committed to these projects.  Community-based CCTV is currently governed by section 38(3)(<i>c</i>) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (CCTV) Order 2006.  This legal framework requires that any proposed community CCTV scheme must be approved by the local joint policing committee, have the prior support of the relevant local authority, which must also act as data controller, and have the authorisation of the Garda Commissioner.  Communities, therefore, need to take a number of steps.  This is the legal basis for all community CCTV schemes, regardless of how they are funded.  These key legal requirements have not changed since 2006.  My Justice Plan 2022, which I published this week, commits to the publication of a new Bill that relates to Garda powers to modernise digital technology, and this will include CCTV where there need to be updates.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that some work on this has been done and progress has been made.  However, we are all also aware of the difficult situations in some areas where CCTV cameras have been in place and people have been asked to take them down because they did not meet the standards required.  They were installed with the very best of intentions.  There have been also been difficulties around the country for years where local authorities have found it difficult to fit into a space whereby they become data controllers and have to monitor footage and all of that without any additional funding.</p>  <p>  In vast areas of rural Ireland there could be a convergence of roads, crossroads or a bridge on a river where it would be very useful to have CCTV to monitor the movement of traffic.  Communities in such areas will not be able to come up with the resources to meet 40% of the required cost of installing cameras.  That needs to be recognised.  The 60% grant aid is too low and needs to be reviewed.  When the Minister is reviewing that, she needs to ensure that adequate funding is in place so that people can meet that criterion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-29a.310" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022032900037#LL00800"><p>To finish my last point and touch on the Deputy's next point, the legislation needs to be updated due to the fact that the Act dates from 2005 and we have since had European GDPR legislation that supersedes the previous Act.  That is why I am working to try to make sure that the digital recording Bill is brought forward as quickly as possible.  I hope to be able to bring it to colleagues in a matter of weeks, and we can then progress that as quickly as possible.  Part of that is the ANPR legislation around number plate recognition, which would allow garda&iacute;, in certain circumstances, to take that type of data and information, which is extremely helpful not just in terms of road traffic incidents but also in cases where people are fleeing the scene of a crime and would be helpful to be able to upload that information.</p>  <p>  With regard to the link between local authorities and garda&iacute;, we are trying to set out greater clarity around the role played by each in the legislation.  That is something that has prevented some communities from putting forward requests for local CCTV.  At the same time, I stress that we cannot just put up cameras anywhere.  There always has to be collaboration with garda&iacute;.  We all have a right to privacy and to make sure that there is not a camera outside our front door.  Cameras are in place for a specific and strategic reason.  That corroboration and collaboration will be set out clearly in the legislation.  It is to be hoped it will encourage more people to avail of these types of scheme.</p></speech>

Nobody wants cameras everywhere or for the whole country to be covered in them but there is a recognition that they have a key role to play.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na recognises that and so does the public.  The slow and difficult roll-out of these schemes across the country has dented public confidence in the commitment of the Government to ensuring this is done.</p>  <p>  I welcome the legislation the Minister is proposing.  When the cost of up to &euro;40,000 in this regard is considered, 60% of that sum is to be provided but the communities will have to find the other 40%, amounting to &euro;16,000, which will be quite a lot for small communities to fund.  That needs to be reviewed.  More funding needs to be put in place to ensure this can be done.  If more CCTV is rolled out, there will be benefits in the context of economies of scale.  It would not cost communities as much as it would otherwise.  If the Government were to tender for this equipment, rather than each individual community doing so, that may also lead to cost savings.</p></speech>

It is important to note that the Deputy's question relates specifically to community CCTV and there is a separate programme specifically for An Garda.  In areas with high crime levels or a large number of incidents, the Garda can go through a process of setting up its own CCTV.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to certain issues that have arisen recently in respect of the general data protection regulation, GDPR.  There are steps communities have to undergo, working with local authorities and the Garda.  Obviously, the Garda undertakes those steps as well.  In general, community CCTV plays a role but it is about everything working together.  It is about community text alert, communities engaging with local community garda&iacute; and making sure there are enough garda&iacute; on the ground.  I am very pleased that more than 10,000 people have applied to the most recent recruitment campaign.  It is to be hoped that they will start to go through Templemore soon.  We have the new operational model that will ensure there are more focused specific teams and it is hoped they will be able to target this type of crime in rural areas and where people are concerned.  There are many elements to making sure we keep people safe.  Community CCTV is an important element of that and I hope that when the legislation is passed, there might be more clarity for people regarding being able to access further funding.</p></speech>

Care and rehabilitation are core aims of the Irish Prison Service.  Sentences are managed to encourage and support prisoners in their efforts to reintegrate into society and live law-abiding lives on release.  My Department and the Departments of Education and Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science engage with the service to ensure a range of education opportunities are available to those in custody and those who have served their sentence.  This is in line with goal 3 of Justice Plan 2022, which sets out our commitment to developing and supporting policies to reduce reoffending and help safely reintegrate those who have committed crimes back into their communities.</p>  <p>  The provision of education is an important prison-based service and key to improving outcomes for prisoners and reducing recidivism.  Poor literacy skills, a history of previous educational difficulties or failure and negative educational experience often combine to create powerful barriers to engaging with prison education centres and, therefore, the curriculum offered must be broad, flexible and attractive.</p>  <p>  Although opportunities up to third-level qualifications are available, a priority for the service is ensuring targeted supports and initiatives are in place focused on basic literacy and numeracy education, including English as a second operating language.  Delivered in partnership between the Prison Service and education and training boards, ETBs, opportunities focus on providing quality-assured and student-centred education that facilitates lifelong learning.  There is also emphasis on the role of non-accredited learning in enabling adults to return to learning at their own pace and equip them to explore their full potential.</p>  <p>   The Building Bridges joint national project led by the Prison Service and SOLAS and sponsored by the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science is under development and will build on the well-established infrastructure in place between the ETBs and the prison.  A collaborative partnership with Maynooth University, entitled Unlocking Potential, is aimed at increasing access to higher education for people with convictions.  As part of this, a &euro;100,000 scholarship fund entitled KickStart was recently announced.</p>  <p>   The Prison Service is also engaged with Dublin City University to conduct an audit of literacy and numeracy across the prisoner population with a view to informing future development within the services. </p></speech>

It is shocking that so many people who have clearly been failed by the education system end up in prison.  What is going to be done about that in a joined-up way?  I recall a former prison governor indicating that the vast bulk of the inmates in that prison were drawn from an identifiable number of postcodes.  Does the Minister of State consider he has a responsibility to reduce the numbers that end up in prison?  Does he regard the focus on literacy and numeracy in education as a critical component in that regard or is it nothing to do with the Department of Justice but entirely a matter for the Departments of Education and Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science?</p></speech>

It is doing so.  I agree with the Deputy regarding the concerns.  While in opposition, I raised the fact that if all the inmates who cannot read or write were taken out, the number of prisons would be substantially reduced.</p></speech>

We now have a hardcore statistic in that regard.  It is a matter of which I am very aware, as is the Minister, Deputy McEntee.  That is why there is this level of collaboration with the Departments of Education and Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to try to address this issue.  Obviously, education is primarily a matter for those Departments but we in the Department of Justice have an important role in that regard.  As Minister of State with responsibility for youth justice, I have that role in particular.  That is why education is a very important part of the youth justice strategy we launched last year.  Keeping those kids in school, particularly through the transitional phase when they move from primary school into secondary school at 13 or 14 years of age, is key.  Some kids can get into serious difficulty at that stage.  It is certainly a matter of which I am very conscious, as is the Minister, Deputy McEntee.</p></speech>

What I hoped would be focused on, which he indicated he was focused on it while in opposition, is preventing people ending up in prison in the first place.  A collaborative effort between the Departments of Justice and Education is needed to deal with that.   What sort of resources and what level of priority are going into that prevention phase of the work?  It is like health education in the Department of Health - it is never regarded as a great priority.  In health, they treat the disease rather than prevent it.  It would be a really important part of the work of the Minister of State if we could have a co-ordinated and well-resourced strategy to stop people ending up in prison in the first place.</p></speech>

That prevention piece is critical.  One of the things I have been doing since lockdown ended is visiting youth diversion projects, initially mostly in Dublin, but subsequently widening that circle across the country.  With the funding for youth diversion projects we received in the budget in October, we will now be able fund the new role of family support workers, as well as additional youth workers.  They are not only working with the families to try to strengthen the environment at home, but working with schools as well.  I have been very impressed with the level of engagement of youth diversion projects, including youth workers, family support workers and juvenile liaison officers, with local schools.  I want that strengthened and I have had several conversations with the Minister for Education in respect of that piece and, in particular, the issue of reduced class timetables, which puts vulnerable children very much at risk.  She is aware of that and has been working on it and putting many policies in place.  It is certainly a matter of which I am very aware.  My initial response to the Deputy's question was written very much from the perspective of the Department of Justice but, as Minister of State with responsibility for youth justice, I am acutely aware of this issue.  I know the Deputy has long been a crusader on it.</p></speech>

It is some time now since Ashling Murphy, unfortunately, was killed.  That was a significant time in Ireland when people re-examined and looked again at this issue of violence against women everywhere throughout the country and in all its aspects, both in the home and in public spaces.  We have to do everything we can to prevent violence against women but we also have to provide services for people who, unfortunately, are in danger or are at risk.  I know the Minister has taken on responsibility for that role and I would like to gain an understanding of how much progress she has made.  There are no domestic violence refuges at the moment in the county I live in or the surrounding counties.</p></reply>

It is my goal that everyone who needs a refuge space will get one.  It is an ambitious one but I am deeply committed to working with everyone in this Chamber, our partners in the sector and my Government colleagues to try to achieve that.  We have prioritised tackling domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in all of its forms, ensuring people, particularly women and vulnerable people, feel safe and are safe in our communities.  That means ensuring we address this issue in a number of ways, and providing refuges and accommodation is a very important element of that work.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware and has mentioned, I am currently leading work on a new whole-of-government strategy to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. This new plan will have a particular focus and emphasis on prevention and ensuring victims are better supported.  It is my intention to publish the final strategy and accompanying action plan as soon as possible in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, and I also commissioned an independent audit of how responsibility for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is segmented across Government.  On foot of this, it has been agreed that my Department will assume that responsibility, as the Deputy has mentioned, for services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence as well as the policy responsibility and overall cross-departmental or Government co-ordination of implementation.  A detailed plan setting out how this will work is in preparation and will be outlined as part of the strategy launch.</p>  <p>  On the specific issue of refuge spaces, in February, the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, and I published the review by Tusla.  We set out in Tusla's report the focus on the accommodation for victims of domestic violence.  It highlighted the gaps that exist in the coverage, the inadequate provision of services for safe accommodation, including refuges, and what we need to do to meet that population need.  It recommended an approach to address this with the immediate, medium and the long-term action required and it has a list of priority areas where additional services would address much of the most immediate initial need.</p>  <p>  While the review says a minimum of between 50 and 60 new refuge places are needed as a priority, we did a further analysis and identified 82 refuge spaces where this would have the most impact if prioritised, that is, additional to the spaces set out in the report but also including a number of other areas.  I have asked my Department, in addition to those areas, to include as part of that a number of other counties, including the county represented by the Deputy.  I will return to the Deputy with a further response as to where we are at in this work.</p></speech>

We understand this is an issue that is not just about the spaces, the bed and the roof over a person's head, or a family in many cases.  It is more than just a woman who has to find refuge because it is often also her children.  It is also about the services around them and ensuring there is both adequate space for them to recover from the trauma they have gone through and somewhere for them to move on to.  There is all of that together with issues for local authorities and housing, Tusla and social services.  It is an across-the-board issue.</p>  <p>  We are also dealing with another issue.  I have been on the phone already today talking about people coming from Ukraine and trying to find spaces for them because they are also in an emergency situation.  We also have people in Ireland who are homeless and we have a homelessness crisis.  We have all of these factors bearing down on us but we cannot, at the same time, lose sight of the issue in question because it is one that affects so many people every day.</p>  <p>  I did not get from the Minister an indication of what progress has been made.  I understand what plans have been made and that the review has been done.  I also know the needs are being identified, but what concrete progress has been made to provide spaces and services?</p></speech>

There are many other elements to it and the strategy is a very significant part of that.  I appreciate the accommodation piece is very significant.  I assure the Deputy and others that while we are dealing with a great crisis in Ukraine, we are certainly not taking our eyes off this.  It is a very significant priority for me and will continue to be so.</p>  <p>  The locations we have identified, from the 82 to the additional counties, have been chosen on the basis of required proximity to a refuge as well as the need for the spaces per head of population.  They represent areas where there is the most significant underprovision.</p>  <p>  We now have a high-level interdepartmental group looking at the current system for the provision of refuge spaces and identifying the changes that can be made to the system to try to deliver the additional spaces in the short term, which is the 82 plus the initial counties. It is also looking at the lifetime of the next strategy, which will be in a number of years and beyond that, which will be more like a ten-year plan, and which will bring us to the Istanbul Convention.</p>  <p>  My intention is that the timelines for delivery of these places would be set out in those three phases.  They will be outlined in the third national strategy, and the detail as to how that is going to be done will be set out in the strategy.  The progress we are making will all become clear when we publish the strategy in a matter of weeks.  We are doing this work through the interdepartmental group that is bringing together my Department, Tusla, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We have already engaged with a number of groups that are developing new plans themselves and we are trying to iron out where the problems are and how we can improve the overall system and process.  We have had a number of meetings and it is going very well.</p></speech>

That is the reality today.  Is the State proposing to build or buy or look at existing Government-owned facilities that can be renovated or used to provide refuge spaces?  What is the plan to provide those spaces and the services around them?  I know the Minister has mentioned spaces that may be adjacent to existing services.  That is all well and good, but there are no services at all in some counties.  That is a key problem that needs to be examined.</p>  <p>  This is a very significant problem in the larger urban areas in particular.  As we know, accommodation is practically non-existent and many of the voluntary organisations that have done so much in this regard - charities, basically, that go out rattling a bucket to get a few bob to do it - depend on finding bed and breakfast accommodation.  They cannot get these facilities any more because they are gone.  We have another crisis that has overshadowed all of that, so that needs to be recognised.</p></speech>

Working with Tusla, we have an opportunity to look at the structure and system, see where it works and where it does not, how we can improve it, where we need to step in as a Government, how we do that, and how we ensure we have it done in a planned way so that, when we are developing new refuge accommodation, we have all the ancillary supports and resources people need and the spaces are fit for purpose.  Many of the refuges are in old buildings that are not necessarily built for this purpose.</p>  <p>  We have to look at how we can improve and expand on the existing refuge accommodation but also how we also start from scratch.  A great deal of work has been done in many counties and areas by councils, community groups, local representatives and many others.  We will link in with those people and groups through this interdepartmental group to see how we get this process moving again.  I appreciate people want to know immediately what it is going to look like in each area, especially where there is no accommodation at the moment, and that will be made clear in a matter of weeks. </p>  <p>  What is also important is that we will have funding allocated, not just for this year but beyond that.  We need to ensure that funding because it is going to take a number of years to build this accommodation.  The Tusla report set out three years for the initial 56 spaces, which we are now expanding to 82, with additional counties being covered.  A great deal of work is in train and I reassure the Deputy that this is a priority.</p></speech>

What steps are being taken by the Department to address the deepening crisis, and will the Minister make a statement on the matter?  I am shocked to see the extent of the use of drugs in Ireland in all sectors of communities, young, old, male and female.  There are no boundaries.</p></reply>

The Government is acutely aware of the sustained and significant damage drug dealing has on communities.  Organised criminal activity, including drug dealing, represents a serious threat to community safety and to individuals.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Health leads on Government policy in the area of drugs, and this policy is guided by the national drugs and alcohol strategy: Reducing Harm,Supporting Recovery: A health-led response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland 2017-2025.</p> <p>This strategy represents a whole-of-government response to drug and alcohol use in Ireland.  Implementation is led by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Feighan, and encompasses actions for all stakeholders, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and my Department.</p> <p> The Government&rsquo;s strategic approach is health-led, to try to reduce demand while balancing this with reducing access to illegal drugs.  It also aims to reduce the numbers criminalised for the possession of drugs for personal use, diverting these people to health and diversion treatments to address their habits and behaviours.  While the strategy aims to support the most vulnerable people who use drugs, it is also matched with strong enforcement measures across government to tackle the supply of illegal drugs.  I share the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s and the Deputy's concern about the prevalence of illegal drug use, and I am glad sustained action by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to tackle this continued apace throughout the pandemic, resulting in increased convictions and ongoing seizures of drugs as well as volumes of firearms, ammunition and cash that inevitably accompany this very serious organised criminal activity.</p> <p> The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau is having significant success in disrupting drug trafficking and the supply of illicit drugs by organised crime groups.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that, in 2021, the bureau seized almost &euro;64 million worth of illicit drugs and more than &euro;5.6 million in cash, a significant increase from 2019 when more than &euro;21 million, still a significant amount, worth of illicit drugs and in excess of &euro;2.5 million in cash was seized.  The bureau&rsquo;s work is supported by divisional drugs units nationwide and by all garda&iacute; working in local communities.  The bureau also works closely and productively with international law enforcement partners, which is important.  Garda&iacute; continue to work closely with local authorities, the HSE, NGOs, community groups and other State agencies to tackle the problems of drug addiction and abuse.  It is an ongoing issue and it requires sustained ongoing support from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

More garda&iacute; on the beat would make a real difference in rural communities.  Does the Minister realise the Garda station in Newcastle West closed down three years ago to move to a temporary station?  The divisional headquarters takes in the greater proportion of County Limerick, but the new Garda station has not even been commenced.  Askeaton Garda station is only open for administrative use.  How can we be serious about a Garda division in our area and for Newcastle West, given its population and that of the surrounding district?  We do not even have a Garda headquarters.  It was closed down three years ago to build a state-of-the-art new Garda station that has not yet commenced.  How can I take it seriously that the Minister and the Department want to help me tackle drug crime in County Limerick, if they have not even given me the divisional Garda station?  It has not even been commenced three years after closing down the old Garda station.</p></speech>

The number of members of all ranks assigned to the Limerick division is 596, which is a 7.6% increase since 2015.  As well as that, the number of Garda staff has increased from 51 to 78, which is an increase of 52%.  That obviously allows more garda&iacute; to be out on the beat.  Yes, it is important to have that physical building.  We have a capital plan that I am working on at present with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Garda Commissioner.  However, it is not just about buildings but making sure we have garda&iacute; out on the ground.  It is also about making sure we have the right policies and legislation in place.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned the justice plan.  In view of organised crime, its connection with drugs and the people who are now being dragged into this, there are a number of actions in that plan.  There is a plan to criminalise those who groom younger people.  This is legislation I brought forward last year and we are working on it at present.  We have a plan to make sure there are life sentences for those who attempt murder but are not successful.  There are a number of other legislative measures and policy reforms to try to deal with the substance of this, separate to the police numbers, the equipment, the supports and the resources the Garda has as well.</p></speech>

Of those, 92 were superintendents, detectives and sergeants.  There are 7,596 uniformed garda&iacute; in the country out of 8,539, if one removes the detectives from that.  Will the Minister explain why Dublin, with a population of 1.4 million, takes 44% of the new recruits?  When there is a population of more than 5 million in Ireland, that is not proportionate for the area.  How does the Minister expect us to police our counties when 44% of garda&iacute; are deployed in Dublin?  Going by population, outside that 1.4 million, that leaves 3.6 million people with 56% of the garda&iacute; deployed.  Even though some of the Garda stations might cover districts of more than 40 square miles, most of the garda&iacute; are deployed to Dublin.</p></speech>

As Minister for Justice, I must make sure the resources are available and that garda&iacute; are coming out of Templemore.  As I mentioned earlier, more than 10,000 people have applied to the recent Garda recruitment campaign.  That is very welcome.  The more of them who come out on the beat as quickly as possible, the more they can be spread throughout the country and not just into areas of high density and high population, given the Deputy's reference to Dublin.</p>  <p>  We can do a number of things to try to deal with not just the issue of drugs but also so much that is connected to it, such as criminality, gangs, younger people being dragged into that and the impact it has on our communities.  Another way we are trying to deal with that is the community safety partnership, which is being rolled out in three pilot areas.  That will come with a fund, money that is coming specifically from seizures of drugs and other things by the Garda.  This funding will be available to communities to be able to implement schemes in their towns and villages to try to keep them safe.  It is about the Garda working with all the State agencies and working with communities to make sure the supports and resources that suit their needs are there.  What people need in Limerick might be different from what people need in Meath and different again from what people need in other counties.</p></speech>

There is also massive support for the idea that the State must do everything possible to support those people.  The question is whether the refugee process will be reformed now so all refugees coming to Ireland receive the same sort of welcome and support, regardless of which country and war they are fleeing and of the colour of their skin.</p></reply>

Most people want to return to their homes as soon as it is safe to do so.  That is human nature.  Staying nearby helps them to feel closer to that goal.  It is the same for the people fleeing Ukraine who are clearly strongly patriotic people.  This time, however, we in Europe are their closest neighbours.  We are stepping up to support them in the same way Jordan, Lebanon and other countries have for their neighbours.</p>  <p>  The Ukrainian people want to be as close to their homes as the war will allow.  For this reason, the EU has, for the first time in its history, activated the temporary protection directive.  This does not replace the international protection system.  Any non-EU citizen can still apply for international protection in any EU member state, including Ireland.  The application will be processed under the established international and EU asylum law.  However, it provides an alternative system designed to be immediately responsive to an unprecedented volume of people in need of temporary protection on Europe&rsquo;s borders, in a way that supports their wish to return to their homes as soon as it is safe to do so.</p>  <p>  People in need of international protection are generally seeking protection from the actions of state authorities in their home country.  It may never be safe for them to return home.  The situation in Ukraine is different.  The displacement of millions of people is driven by the actions of a foreign aggressor.  However, people who have fled Ukraine, or any other country, in genuine search of safety and support will find them in Ireland.  Assistance will also be provided to people who were legally residing in Ukraine without a permanent residence permit to return to their home country, if it is safe for them to do so.</p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that my Department continues to work to improve the international protection process and to reduce processing times, in line with the recommendations made by the expert advisory group, led by Dr. Catherine Day, and the commitments in the Government's White Paper, insofar as possible and bearing in mind that the number of people claiming international protection has increased significantly in recent months.</p></speech>

The processes and hubs that have been put in place are precisely what are necessary for people who are fleeing a war situation to help them find security and safety while they deal with the trauma of their experiences and their flight to safety.</p> <p> The point is that all refugees need this type of support.  Discrimination on the basis of neighbourhood, which is the same language the T&aacute;naiste used, is completely immoral.  The Minister of State is saying people fleeing from Ukraine should be treated differently from people fleeing from Libya, Syria and Afghanistan on the basis of neighbourhood.  That is horrendous.  These people have all sorts of difficulties.  There are delays in issuing temporary residence cards for international protection.  Applicants are unable to get PPS numbers.  They are unable to access schools and medical cards.  This is without even speaking about direct provision.  How is this moral?  How can the Government stand over it?  Surely this needs to be the end of the old system whereby we now treat all refugees in a decent and humane way.</p></speech>

This applies to everybody leaving Ukraine.  They can now come to the European Union for this protection.  People can come to Ireland for protection when they need it.  They can apply under the international protection system in this country.  Those supports are being put in place.</p>  <p>  An end-to-end review of the relevant international protection processes by a multidisciplinary team from the Department has been completed and published.  By October at the latest, the Department will carry out a review of the progress made on reducing and improving processing times.  We have also introduced a regularisation scheme, as the Deputy is very much aware.  With regard to the international protection system in Ireland, significant progress has been made on implementing the report by Catherine Day and other supports.  In particular with regard to Ukraine, the temporary protection directive has been instigated by the European Union.</p></speech>

They will be given hubs, PPS numbers and education assistance.  These are all the things a refugee needs.  It is great.  It is brilliant.  It is what we need for Ukrainian refugees.  At the same time, the Government will continue to say people who come from Syria, Libya or wherever else will go into direct provision.  There are more than 6,000 people in direct provision now, including almost 2,000 children.  It is a system that takes away people's dignity.  It makes people feel worthless.  Mr. Bulelani Mfaco of MASI has said it is a system with an increasing number of complaints.  That people go into direct provision because they are not from our neighbourhood is a racist policy.  It is racism to say this country is near us.  Ukraine is 3,000 km away.  Syria is 4,000 km away.  Is this really the basis on which the decision is being made?  No, it is a racist decision to continue with direct provision for some while for others the Government does the right thing in terms of treating people in a humane way.</p></speech>

We were the only country to introduce a bespoke protection system to be able to bring Afghans to Ireland.  We now have a regularisation scheme which is the most generous regularisation scheme of any country in Europe.  The Government and the Department have not been found wanting in putting the supports in place and in implementing the report of Catherine Day as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  With regard to Ukrainians, the European Union implemented its temporary protection directive.  This is why Ukrainians coming to Ireland or anywhere in the European Union have been given automatic rights on a temporary basis.  When the time comes, and the war of aggression and murder by Putin comes to an end, those Ukrainians will want to, and will be able to, go home to rebuild their country.</p></speech>

I am very much aware that Deputy Murnane O'Connor is very passionate about making sure her county and the community she works with has a refuge and accommodation for women and their families who are fleeing violence and instances of domestic abuse.  A number of streams of work are under way at present.  As I have outlined previously, we are working to publish in the coming weeks the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  While there is a whole-of-government approach, a key element will be the provision of domestic violence refuge accommodation.</p>  <p>  Specifically on this issue, we are building on the recently published Tusla report the Deputy mentioned.  An agreement was reached between the Department and the Department with responsibility for children that the delivery and development of services and refuge accommodation would move under the aegis of the Department of Justice.  We will have responsibility for the overall strategy and the delivery of policy and refuge accommodation.  In recent weeks, since that report was published, there has been engagement with the community and voluntary sector.</p>  <p>  We have established an interdepartmental high-level group, as the Deputy has mentioned.  It is bringing together the Department of Justice, the Department with responsibility for children, Tusla, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department with responsibility for housing.  We are looking at the existing structure, how refuge accommodation is delivered, the type of funding available, where the challenges are and how we can improve the structure and system.  As part of this I anticipate that in the coming weeks the interdepartmental group will engage not only on the 56 spaces and areas identified in the Tusla review but also on an increase to 82 spaces with two additional counties.</p>  <p>  Our long-term vision as well as this specific focus in the short term will be set out clearly in the coming weeks when we publish the action plan and the third national strategy.  All of this needs to be taken together.  While it is about refuge accommodation and providing initial support, it is also about all of the other elements, including education and making sure there is a whole-of-society response.  Every Department has a role to play.  The response from every Department in this regard has been very good to date.  I anticipate we will have a significant number of actions in the strategy that will relate not only to the justice sector but also to many other areas.</p></speech>

Many issues need to be addressed.  Some of them are easier than others.  Domestic violence support services and places of refuge must be easily accessible.  At present there is no phone line or office for help during weekends and after hours.  As the Minister knows, domestic violence does not only happen between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.  Often it happens at other times of the day and night.  In many cases it happens at weekends and at night.  Is there a plan to establish an on-call service and wrap-around services such as those of the local authority when emergency accommodation is full?  In Carlow there are two family emergency units.  Due to Covid, only one is operational.  It is nearly always full.  There is nowhere for women fleeing violence.  They often have to return to the same situation.  What immediate action will be taken in Carlow to deal with these massive gaps in the services?</p></speech>

I said a decision had been taken to bring services to the Department.  A decision was subsequently taken to establish an agency that will be responsible for the delivery of services.  This agency will work very closely with the community and voluntary sector, many bodies in which are already delivering services on the ground.  The work being done by the interdepartmental and inter-agency group will transfer to the agency.  It will take time to establish it as we will have to put it on a statutory footing.</p></speech>
