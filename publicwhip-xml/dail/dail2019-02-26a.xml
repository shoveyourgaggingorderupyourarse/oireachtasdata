    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-26a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022600003#A00200"><p>Last night's special edition of "Claire Byrne Live" entitled, "Her Name is Clodagh", was a heart-rending, difficult and very upsetting programme and an important one from a public service perspective.  The courage shown by Mary Coll and Jacqueline Connolly, Clodagh Hawe's mother and sister, respectively, in telling their story was incredible.  There are many disturbing elements to this story and many of their questions have remained unanswered for far too long.  Their loss was devastating.  The manner of their loss was horrifying and savage, and stretches our human capacity to understand.</p>  <p>  When a mother and her three sons are murdered by their father, it demands a comprehensive response from the State's agencies and that needs to be reflected upon.  The family wants basic answers.  They believe a full book of evidence should be published.  There is no compelling reason basic information could not have been given to Clodagh's family much earlier.  It took until 16 months after the murders for the family to see Alan Hawe's suicide letter, for instance.  No murder trial would have been compromised.  </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, familicide is not new to Ireland.  There is a sense that it is occurring much more frequently in modern times than in the past.  There are serious child protection issues at stake.  How robust are these protections?  There are profound issues relating to mental health and psychiatry.  How much serious indigenous research on this issue has been commissioned by the Departments of Justice and Equality and Health?  How adequate is the State's response across the range of services when such an horrific murder occurs?  Is there a co-ordinated and multidisciplinary response?  Watching the programme last night, one got the sense that there is not.  I do not want to be judgmental and I am not attempting to apportion blame but serious questions remain to be asked and responded to.  Clearly, there are lessons to be learned.  </p>  <p>  Ten years ago, the report into the Monageer familicide was published, albeit that was in different circumstances given that family's interactions with social services on a frequent basis.  Nonetheless, it might provide a template for the kind of inquiry and analysis that Clodagh's mother, sister and family are looking for.  The Departments of Health and Justice and Equality need to co-ordinate strongly on this issue.  The Department of Health states that familicide, murder and suicide are criminal issues for the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Department of Health looks at it from a suicide prevention perspective.</p><p>On foot of the Coll family's request, is the Government considering an inquiry or some investigation into the circumstances surrounding those murders so as to develop a greater understanding of those circumstances and to learn lessons?  Will the Taoiseach ensure that genuine indigenous research is commissioned on this very difficult issue of familicide in Ireland?  Will he agree to develop a multidisciplinary action plan to guide State agencies in responding to such events in the future?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-26a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022600004#B00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue, which I know a lot of people across the country are talking about today.  I am afraid I did not have a chance to watch the programme myself as I was travelling back from a meeting last night and did not get into the country until quite late.  However, a lot of people have spoken to me about it through the course of the morning, and they were deeply impacted by the story they heard and by the bravery of Clodagh's mother and sister, who shared their story with the nation last night.</p>  <p>  I do, of course, know a little about the case and the murders of Clodagh, Liam, Niall and Ryan.  It was a heartbreaking and horrific tragedy for the family and for the wider community in Virginia, County Cavan.  What happened must be beyond anyone's worst nightmares and it was truly a terrible crime.  I am sure the condolences of the entire House go to the family and to the wider community.  We cannot imagine their pain and I know there is very little we can say or do here to ease or erase their grief and suffering.  Understandably, in such circumstances, where a suicide or a murder-suicide occurs, people want to know why it happened and it is often not possible to answer that question.  They often want to know if there is anything they could have done to prevent it or if there were any signs that they could have identified.  Often, the truth is that there is not.  That makes the pain even harder.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy acknowledged, family annihilation and familicide is rare, thankfully, but it does happen and perhaps more frequently that it did in the past.  We can, therefore, learn lessons.  In terms of what we can do, we think it is a combination of changing laws - in fact, we have already changed laws - reform of the Garda and how garda&iacute; deal with such cases, reform of the law and maybe some specific actions around this case.  The Domestic Violence Act, which was passed in 2018, made coercive control an offence in this State for the first time.  That was an important step forward, which was led by Government, with the support of the Oireachtas.  Garda&iacute; are trying to improve the way they deal with such serious cases through the Garda National Protective Services Bureau, GNPSB, which is responsible for ensuring that front-line garda&iacute; have a solid understanding of coercive control and this new legislation.  That has been going live in all Garda divisions since the first week in January.  Ten have been established across nine divisions and it will go to the other 19 in 2019.  In addition, the family have asked us to review the Succession Act 1965 in regard to inheritance, on which Deputy Jim O'Callaghan has done some work, and the Coroners Act 1962 in regard to burials.</p>  <p>  In terms of taking this forward and seeing what we can do to answer some of the questions, and perhaps to learn from what has happened, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, will be happy to receive a submission from the family with their suggestions, and perhaps we will take it from there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-26a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022600004#B00300"><p>I welcome the approach of a submission to be received by the Minister, which would be some response to the family's request as articulated last evening on the programme.  The family made very many valid points on the programme.  Their central point was that it is far too easy in cases of familicide to throw a blanket over the cases and say, "It is depressive psychosis", and that is the end of it.  That leaves the family asking a lot of questions and feeling that the issue has not been dealt with in the comprehensive, multidisciplinary way that it should be.  I ask that this be given consideration.</p>  <p>  The family raised the issue of the Coroners Act and the Succession Act during the programme and I welcome the fact amendments to those Acts will be assessed in the context of familicide.</p><p>The National Office for Suicide Prevention has been carrying out a literature review in respect of familicide with organisations from other European states.  It is time to commission research on familicide in Ireland over the past two to three decades.  The Taoiseach might ask the Departments of Justice and Equality and Health to commission such research.  It could provide insights and valuable lessons for future policy to guide State agencies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-26a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022600005#C00200"><p>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin asked a specific question about the book of evidence.  I understand from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that when someone gives evidence as part of an investigation, that evidence is privileged.  There is concern that if this was removed, it would be harder to convince people to give evidence to the Garda in other cases if they knew that evidence given under privilege could be released later.  The Deputy is correct in stating that there was information which could have been given to the family at an earlier stage and that, on occasion, they learned things from the media.  That is a recurring theme regarding other issues as well.  It is something that should not happen.</p>  <p>  Regarding the suggestion on research being done by the National Office for Suicide Prevention, its budget has been doubled in recent years and it has a budget for research.  We will raise with it the suggestion as to whether it would make sense to do some domestic research on familicide.  As I said earlier, regarding the best way to move forward on this issue, rather than making decisions or commitments in this Chamber on the hoof on foot of a TV programme that aired last night, we would welcome a submission from the family of Ms Hawe to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  We can then consider that, bring things forward and perhaps do something to help the family deal with this tragedy.  Lessons might also be learned that could allow the prevention of similar tragedies in future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-26a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022600005#C00300"><p>Last night, we witnessed the mother and sister of Clodagh Hawe, Mary and Jacqueline, speak about her brutal murder and those of her three sons, Liam, aged 13, Niall, aged 11, and Ryan, aged six, at the hands of her husband and the children's father in August 2016.  Anyone who saw last night's programme has been deeply affected by the utterly terrifying and heartbreaking story, as well as by the issues raised by the family concerning the subsequent investigation and the unanswered questions that remain almost three years later.  I extend deepest and sincerest sympathies to the family and friends of Ms Hawe, Liam, Niall and Ryan.  It is clear from the testimony of Clodagh's family last night that they need answers to the questions they have concerning the murders of Ms Hawe and her three children.  The State also needs answers.  As legislators, there is an onus on us to ensure the necessary statutory provisions are in place to understand in full how and why these violent crimes occur.</p>  <p>  I wrote to the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, earlier this month asking that consideration be given to the introduction of domestic homicide reviews and that these be underpinned by legislation.  Such reviews have been in place in Britain since 2011 and are due to be introduced in Northern Ireland following a public consultation process.  Domestic homicide reviews take a multi-agency approach to determine the circumstances in which such deaths occur.  Organisations such as Women&rsquo;s Aid have long advocated for the introduction of such reviews in this country.  The family and friends of victims should also be included in the review process.  That should happen because the reality is that Garda management does not have adequate data on or understanding of these homicides.  If there were such understanding, then Mary and Jacqueline would not have had to go on television to advance what are modest requests.  They want to understand how or why Clodagh and her children were murdered.   Does the Taoiseach support the introduction of domestic homicide reviews?  Will he consider introducing them in the future?</p><p>Families deserve answers to their questions and reviews of this kind can play a very important part in providing those answers.  Last night, the family called for reviews of the Coroners Act and laws surrounding exhumations as well as changes to the Succession Act.  In a sense they have very publicly made their submission.  I am glad that the Minister for Justice and Equality is open to such a submission, but the family also wants an inquiry.  They want answers.  Will the Minister for Justice and Equality meet the family to agree the scope and form of such an inquiry? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-26a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022600006#D00200"><p>As I indicated earlier in my response to Deputy Martin, the Minister would be very happy to receive a submission from the family with their suggestions on how to better deal with family annihilation and family homicide.  We can take it from there and make decisions on foot of full consideration of that submission.</p>  <p>  I answered the question on the Coroners Act and the Succession Act earlier.  It is acknowledged that the Garda can learn from awful cases such as this, and from other family homicides that have occurred in recent years.  I am informed that the Garda is carrying out a review of cases of domestic homicide to better inform its approach to domestic violence generally.  That review is ongoing.</p>  <p>  In addition, as I mentioned earlier, the GNPSB is now responsible for ensuring that front-line garda&iacute; have a solid understanding of our new laws on domestic violence.  Major changes to policing are taking place within six new divisional protective services units, DPSUs.  They went live across six Garda divisions in the first week of January.  Ten divisional units have been established across nine Garda divisions and DPSUs will go live in the remaining 19 divisions throughout 2019.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-26a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022600006#D00300"><p>I thank the Taoiseach.  I am aware of all of that work and, undoubtedly, it marks progress.  I discussed these matters when I met the Garda Commissioner, Drew Harris, some months ago.  However, I am now making a different proposition and a different point to the Taoiseach.  Rather than proceeding in an <i>ad hoc</i>or discretionary way, we should establish multi-agency review processes of these types of homicides in law.  This would allow an avenue for families, friends and each of the statutory organisations not just to share and reveal information but to learn.  To return to my initial point, Clodagh and her three boys are gone.  Others have also died in this horrific way.  It is our job as legislators and it is the duty of statutory agencies not simply to be horrified, although we are all horrified by this turn of events, but to try to grasp why it happened so that we can take preventative action.  The family have asked for an inquiry.  They have not specified a particular type of inquiry.  Can I suggest that rather than simply indicating a willingness to receive a submission, the Minister should meet the family in these circumstances and hear their questions directly?  He should hear from them what a short, sharp informative inquiry should look like to give these families the comfort that I know we all wish for them to have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-26a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022600006#D00400"><p>I thank the Deputy.  We would not be doing justice to the family or right by the country to make decisions or commitments on the hoof in this Chamber.  As the Minister for Justice and Equality has indicated, he would be very happy to receive a submission from the family based on what they said on television last night.  There may be other things they also want to say, which they were not able to get across on a television programme.  The Minister would be happy to meet them on foot of that and we can follow it up from there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-26a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1353" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022600006#D00500"><p>We have returned to the usual heavy traffic congestion following last week's mid-term break.  Dublin has been ranked the third worst city in the world, in of a survey of 200 cities, when it comes to the time normal people spend in traffic.  Dublin commuters lose an average of nearly five hours every week sitting in traffic jams.  There is a pressing need for a grand plan for public transport, not least to address the issue of lowering our carbon emissions.  The public accepts this.</p><p>In my judgment it demands a better public transport system, but what I am hearing is a great deal of public anxiety about the Government's two major transport projects, MetroLink and Bus Connects, on which it is spending &euro;5 billion.  Can we have confidence in the Government's ability to deliver on these projects following the 100% overrun to date on the national children's hospital?  Is the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform closely monitoring these projects?</p> <p> One hundred and twenty-three years ago, Glasgow opened its first subway.  We are still talking about building Dublin's first metro line.  Originally, we had the Dublin north plan from Fingal to the city centre, but then we had the economic crash.  We then had MetroLink to link the metro with the existing green Luas line.  What has happened now, because that last project seems to have been scrapped?  Will the Taoiseach give the House, the people of Dublin and the nation clarity on that matter?  The proposed metro line will not solve congestion problems for many Dubliners, which is where Bus Connects comes in to rethink the entire bus system.  However, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, seems to have distanced himself from Bus Connects and handed over power to unelected officials.  From many reports I am getting, those leading the public consultations seem to be involved in box ticking without real concern for the anxieties of the people.  I am told that at a public meeting yesterday, the Fine Gael Deputy, Colm Brophy, said that he had a lack of confidence in Bus Connects.  I understand the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Catherine Byrne, called the National Transport Authority dictators.  There seems to be more focus on the electoral prospects of Fine Gael Deputies than on providing the vision of a high-quality public transport system.  Will the Government provide for a full and complete debate in this House to test fully its vision for Dublin's future transport system?  Will the Taoiseach give the House a guarantee that the Government's plan has been future-proofed to meet the transport needs of a city that we expect to expand greatly in the coming decade, which is to be accommodated with a world-class transport system?</p></speech>

As he knows, I represent the commuter constituency of Dublin West and, more so than most in this House, I am very aware of the daily impact congestion has on our constituents.  Huge numbers of people from my constituency are spending perhaps two hours on the bus every day, which is ten hours a week and is time that could be spent with their families, engaged in recreation or sporting activities, or even taking up an evening class and further study.  One thing we want to do over the next couple of years as the city continues to expand and grow and as our population and employment continues to increase is to improve and reduce commuting times for people who commute to work in the Dublin area.  We have detailed plans already such as the National Transport Authority's greater Dublin transport plan running to 2030 and Project Ireland 2040.  We need to get on with those plans and implement them.  That is why I am so concerned at suggestions from some Members of the Opposition that we should suspend Project Ireland 2040-----</p></speech>

Part of the solution to congestion in Dublin is Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway and other urban centres like Athlone, Sligo, Dundalk and Drogheda growing twice as fast as Dublin.  We can turn around a millennium of development in Ireland and move it into a different direction, but it has to be part of the solution.  We can invest in cycling and pedestrian facilities, a lot of which is under way already.  The Deputy will have seen many of the improvements around the city but much more needs to be done in that regard.  We can also invest in public transport projects like Bus Connects, to which I am very committed.  Notwithstanding the disruption it will cause for some, it will benefit the many in terms of reducing journey times, perhaps by half, in suburban Dublin.  We can also invest in rail, much of which is done already.  Luas and Luas cross city are now up and running.  They were criticised and opposed by many.  It did overrun, not cross city but the early elements, but I doubt anyone regrets now that the Luas was built, and there are demands every day for new lines.  The Phoenix Park tunnel is open, allowing for better connections between the Kildare commuter routes and the city centre, and the metro is now out for design.</p><p>The truth is that we have to engage with the public and it is right to engage with the public on design to get it right.  That is happening with BusConnects and it is happening with MetroLink.  People have genuine concerns because it disrupts their sports clubs, it can disrupt their schools, it can involve taking away their parking and it can involve taking away parts of their gardens.  We should not dismiss genuine concerns from communities, whether it is Na Fianna GAA club, whether it is people in Ranelagh or whether it is people out in Terenure.

Let us not forget that BusConnects is not just for Dublin, it is for other cities as well.  It is a &euro;2 billion investment in buses and cycling facilities and people often forget that aspect of it.  It is greatly beneficial for cyclists as well.  It is impossible to cost MetroLink for certain at this stage but it is also a multi-billion euro investment in public transport from the north of County Dublin through to the city centre.  These projects involve public consultation, however, and that is the stage that we are at now with BusConnects and MetroLink.  Public consultation is under way, the NTA is listening and it will come back with revised plans.  When it comes back with revised plans, we will be able to apply for railway orders and planning permission, then put them out to tender and then get a realistic final cost.  It is only when we goes to tender that we will know the real cost and then make a final decision on whether we proceed.</p></speech>

As I understand it, we will not get the revised solution and the revised options on the southside of the city until the end of March.  We are flying slightly blind without that.  The engineers will rightly say that the greater Dublin transport strategy set out their preferred approach but nobody understood at that time that the Government would go with the driverless, segregated system that would effect the southside in the way it might, or that it would change the entire route because it would not build the DART Interconnector, which was another critical piece of infrastructure that it effectively abandoned.</p>  <p>  There are three options, one of which would be to connect with the green line in whatever way.  We will have to wait until March for the detail to see what the preferred solution on that is.  The engineers may well rightly say that is still their preferred solution as it always was.  We have to hear what they have to say.  Second, good engineers say to me that when a tunnel machine is running it is so much cheaper and easier to keep going and the route south west to Terenure, Rathfarnham and Tallaght would be of great benefit to that section of the city, which is very poorly served by public transport.  Third, and I have raised this with the Taoiseach here in the D&aacute;il as an option, the Government could keep the tunnel machine running south east and connect to University College Dublin, UCD and Sandyford.</p><p>It would be capable of providing for the increasing volume of traffic on the long run from Sandyford and Cherrywood on the southside and we would not have to upgrade the Luas green line.  These are the three options available.</p> <p> Does the Taoiseach agree that whatever solution we pick we will not abandon the southside?  I am worried because the Taoiseach mentioned the metro to the city centre.  If the press reports are accurate, this is what the Government is thinking and it has abandoned the southside.  We cannot afford to abandon the southside, the west or the northside.  Our entire transport system requires radical change.  Whatever happens on the southside should not cause any delay on the northside.  We should proceed with the railway order to ensure the northside section is built.  Deputy Rock is shaking his head.  I do not know what his view is but no doubt we will hear it.  Whatever route we pick it should not undermine the case for BusConnects.  We fundamentally stand with BusConnects because the projections from the NTA indicate that even with all of these projects, the transport emissions in Dublin will increase by 30% when we need them to decrease by 30% by 2030.  The scale of the change we need to make is huge.</p> <p> The Taoiseach mentioned consultation on this project.  How do we consult when we do not have the final plans?  Does the Taoiseach agree that we should not abandon the southside, that we should not delay the northside element and that we need BusConnects and the metro in order to start making the city work?</p></speech>

Perhaps the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport, chaired by Deputy O'Dowd, would be the best place for the issue to be fleshed out and debated as experts and various agencies could be brought in and Deputies with a particular interest in or knowledge of transport could engage in what might be a more meaningful way.</p></speech>

The case represents a damning indictment of the Department of Health.  The lack of even basic hygiene as described was appalling.  There is no excuse for it.  The Mental Health Commission took the HSE to court.  Reference was made to the condition of rooms where electro-convulsive therapy took place.  It is very difficult to comprehend what the judge in the case referred to as the "physical manifestation of the lack of care" afforded to mental health patients.  Is a review of the legislation governing the Mental Health Commission in the offing in order to strengthen its powers to allow it challenge in a more robust way the continuing neglect of mental health facilities and services?  Is the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, aware of these issues?  When did he become aware of them?

The Mental Health Commission is an independent body with a new chief executive, Mr. John Farrelly.  It is very committed to dealing with these issues and very much up for the challenge.  There is an ongoing healthy tension between the Department, the HSE, those delivering services and the Mental Health Commission as a regulator of the services provided.  St. Luke's will be treated like any other hospital.  The challenge is for us to up our game and we intend to do that as best we can.  The Minister, the Department and I are aware of the issues that have arisen at the hospital.</p></speech>

The chair of the Mental Health Commission, Mr. John Saunders, stated, "As a regulatory body, it is entirely unacceptable to find conditions that you would have expected to find in a Victorian workhouse in a mental health service in Ireland in 2019."  I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that this is a damning verdict on the shocking conditions in the hospital in Kilkenny and highlights the necessity to ensure capital programmes are delivered in respect of mental health.  In light of the overspend on the national children's hospital, what HSE capital projects will be delayed?</p><p>Could the Taoiseach tell us if that includes proposed upgrades to mental health facilities?  Could he also tell us when the HSE's revised capital plan will now be published?</p></speech>

I have answered it every Tuesday for the past two weeks, if not three.  I do not know whether the Deputy cares what the answer is.  I have no doubt that the Deputy and other Deputies will continue to allege that every project that is delayed, for any reason, is delayed because of the national children's hospital.  That, of course, is not true.  There has been no reduction in the mental health budget as a consequence.</p></speech>

People around the country are frustrated and worried because of the Government's refusal to alter the Revenue Commissioners' decision to change the VAT rate on food supplements from 0% to 23% next Friday.  There are 3,600 jobs directly and indirectly affected by this decision.  I am told absolutely clearly that some businesses will close.  It is important that matters of tax policy be determined in this House.  Even at this late stage, will the Taoiseach ask for a deferment of this decision from next Friday so the review the Minister for Finance has promised will be concluded before the draconian impact on businesses right across the country, particularly as we approach Brexit?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, she is dying.  She has a terminal diagnosis.  Will the Taoiseach intervene with the HSE and Minister for Health to ensure a settlement is quickly made with Philomena?  She has been battling with the HSE ever since she was suspended from her position in 2014.  That case has been drawn out.  Now Philomena's life is nearing a close and she is asking that the HSE settle and that she be allowed access to Pembrolizumab and other life-enhancing drugs.</p>  <p>  I do not need to tell the Taoiseach that the name Brigid McCole has haunted Fine Gael for decades.  Please do not let the case of Philomena Canning become another shameful episode, involving very ill women, in the history of this Government and the establishment.  We saw in respect of cervical cancer screening how people had to go to court.  The Taoiseach said this would not happen.  Will he intervene to ensure a speedy settlement and to allow Philomena to live out her days with quality of life?</p></speech>

Philomena Canning was suspended by the HSE on grounds of malpractice.  Several investigations proved this was wrong and she was vindicated.  Now, facing death from cancer, she finds herself facing a vindictive HSE, which is refusing to settle with and deal with her.  We are asking the Taoiseach to have compassion for a woman whose life was characterised by compassion.  Being a midwife is about being compassionate to both the mother and expected baby.  Philomena was a midwife all her life and she fought for women to have the right to control how their children's births are conducted.  She is an extraordinary, compassionate woman facing and uncompassionate HSE.  We ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, to show compassion for this most compassionate woman and force the HSE to settle with her so she can live what life she has left with dignity and free of pain.</p></speech>

We know, therefore, that point is not lost on him.  Philomena Canning is dying.  It is not unreasonable to ask the Taoiseach not to force or direct the HSE but to intervene personally on grounds of compassion and because this woman has delivered hundreds of babies in the State.  She is now nearing the end of her days.  She wants access to drugs that have the potential to lengthen her life.  She is a medical professional and knows what her situation is but she does not want to spend the remainder of her life battling the HSE.</p><p>The Taoiseach has previously acknowledged that it can be brutal when women have to battle with the HSE.

Deputy Howlin raised the number of signatures that have been gathered.  The Taoiseach pointed out that the Minister for Finance has been in touch with the Revenue but it is adamant it is its decision.  The Government's area is policy and if it is the policy of the Government to look at this, and I understand a review is under way, it makes no sense for the Revenue to persist with the decision.  It could be deferred pending the policy review.</p>  <p>  We are going through an omnibus Bill for Brexit and putting in aids for various businesses and, at the same time, the other hand of the Government is ensuring that people's jobs will be in trouble because of this VAT decision.  </p>  <p>  Most important are those who use health supplements.  We have all received a large number of representations from people with disabilities, who are struggling to live on the ground and are paying for supplements, the price of which will jump by 23%.  For God's sake, I appeal to the Taoiseach to do the right thing and make a practical decision about this.  Of course the Revenue is independent but the decision can be deferred.</p></speech>

A recent UN report entitled, Towards a Common Food Policy for the European Union, published earlier this month, stated that 80% of healthcare costs are caused by chronic diseases, many of which are the result of poor diets.  The report suggested that EU reform of public procurement and VAT could shift incentives in favour of healthy and sustainable diets.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and Ms Mairead McGuinness, MEP, recently opened a new facility for Revive Active in Mullingar at a cost of &euro;500,000 and employing up to 35 people.  I met representatives of that company who advised me that, if this VAT rate is introduced, they could end up laying people off.</p>  <p>  Along with my colleagues, I ask that the decision on the VAT rate be deferred until proper engagement takes place with all the stakeholders.</p></speech>

This is a matter for the Revenue to determine.  The Revenue Commissioners are independent and any decision on a deferral is also be a decision for Revenue and not for Government.  The VAT rate in Ireland for recognised oral medicines, such as folic acid, is 0% but, for processed foods, VAT applies.</p></speech>

Prices for cattle have collapsed and many are working at a loss that they cannot allow to continue.</p>  <p>  Hundreds of these farmers are angered and frustrated.  As they see it, at the very mention of Brexit two years ago, factories took full advantage, prices have been dropping since and no one has said, "Stop".</p>  <p>  We have to urgently look at other markets.  If we do not, the beef farmers will face the worst crisis they have ever seen.  The Iranian market is a significant option, with encouraging signs that it wants Irish beef, lamb, chicken and turkey.  We face one stumbling block to a strong export market to Iran.  Other strong exporting European countries have embassies in Tehran; Ireland has not.  The Iranian ambassador has said that is a major stumbling block for Iran.  Will the Government open an embassy in Tehran even if it initially operates with a skeleton staff?

This is despite the fact that they are part of the blue-light services which respond to emergencies and their vehicles are fitted with them.  Last year, they conducted over 1,100 missions and saved over 400 lives.  This directive could have a serious impact on Coast Guard staff.  As they are not allowed go at high-speed, the only mechanism they have to alert other motorists of an emergency to clear the road is their blue light.  There is no record of any Coast Guard emergency vehicle being involved in or causing a road traffic accident of any description.</p>  <p>  To have this ludicrous decision reversed, will the Taoiseach agree to meet with the relevant parties to give them a forum to raise their concerns about this directive?

A Libyan cattle buyer who wanted to buy 400 bulls had applied for a visa in mid-November to come to this country to see what he was buying.  To date, he has been given no account of the status of his visa.  He has now gone to Spain to purchase these animals.</p><p>Previous taoisigh and Ministers for justice and agriculture would have gone to great lengths to get the likes of this man.  They would have got the document that he was looking for from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, they would have flown to Libya for him and brought him here, and some Minister would have stayed with him for the three or four days that he was here.

This is something the Government promised as far back as the budget last year.  The delays we have seen over recent months are unacceptable.  The Government needs to get its act together on this and publish this scheme immediately so that we can see houses being remedied and families taken out of the distress and misery they have been experiencing as a result of this unfortunate situation.</p></speech>

I appreciate the Deputy's patience in this matter.  He has raised it on a number of occasions, as have colleagues of mine from Donegal and Mayo.  I thank all those who are affected by this for their patience as well.  I met campaigners when I visited Donegal in January.</p>  <p>  We have agreement in principle.  We made that agreement at Cabinet level at the budget.  My Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform have been in intense discussions since then and in recent weeks over what that scheme would look like, something that is almost complete, and the amount of funding that could be put to it in the initial years.  That work is almost there.  When it is there, it will be brought to Cabinet as a priority.</p></speech>

I understand we will have two major trauma hospitals - one in Dublin and one in Cork.  I accept we cannot have 26 hospitals giving the service throughout the country as we have now, but it is a major mistake - I do not know what the Taoiseach thinks - that we will not have a major trauma hospital in the west and north west of the country, which has a population of 750,000.  We should have a major trauma centre in Galway at least.  What is the Taoiseach's opinion of that?  Does he agree that we should have three major trauma hospitals and just not the two?</p></speech>

We have our resources spread across 26 different hospitals and the victims of major trauma do not get the service that they should.  For example, cardiothoracic surgery is done in the Mater and head surgery - neurosurgery - is done in Beaumont.  If a person has both injuries, clearly he or she cannot separate his body into two parts and be in the two hospitals at the same time.  Cork University Hospital is the only one that can cover most of these specialties.  In a country with a population of less than 5 million, we can probably only sustain two.  What is in the major trauma strategy is to have one in Dublin, one in Cork and a satellite one in Galway as well, which is what the experts in this field believe is the best outcome and the best option for Ireland.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach will be aware that in October of last year the Minister for Health signed off on that proposal.  It was also in the health Estimates, so that the funding, we understand, is there.  It is caught up with all the other capital projects that need to be announced.  The Minister for Health has not told us yet when the announcement will be made on the capital projects.</p><p>Yesterday we had a meeting of Oireachtas Members in Waterford and representatives of the South/South West hospital group, including consultants in the hospital and hospital management.  They have told us they cannot plan for the development of a second cath lab until that capital plan is announced.  However, a design team can be appointed.  Will the Taoiseach put pressure on the Minister for Health to ensure the design team is appointed as quickly as possible?  We have been waiting and waiting, with announcement after announcement on the matter but there is still no delivery.  Appoint the design team and let those charged with rolling it out start the work as soon as possible.</p></speech>

A senior member of the HSE's estates project management team also attended the meeting and informed us that a design team cannot be put in place until the budget has been signed off in the capital plan.  The project is ready to progress.  Will the Taoiseach ensure the budget can be signed off this week to put in place the design team, which is the smallest part of the budget?  Progress has finally been made and we are at the final push.  If the Taoiseach could intervene to make this a priority, this vital second cath lab could commence operations as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

Since becoming Taoiseach I have made eight appointments to the NESC, five of these since February 2018.  Four appointments were made on the basis of nominations from sectoral organisations, as provided for in the legislation.  In addition, four independent members were appointed following advertisement of the vacancies on <i>stateboards.ie</i>and a selection process conducted by the Public Appointments Service.  The National Economic and Social Development Office, NESDO, is the body corporate for the NESC.  Section 13 of the NESDO Act 2006 provides that the chairperson and deputy chairperson of the NESC are members of NESDO.</p><p>The National Statistics Board, NSB, was established under the Statistics Act 1993 to guide the broad strategic direction of the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and in particular to establish priorities for the development of official statistics in Ireland.  The legislation provides that the NSB shall consist of eight members, including an assistant secretary or equivalent or higher grade from my Department and the Department of Finance, and the director general of the CSO.  I made one appointment to the National Statistics Board last month following a selection process conducted by the Public Appointments Service.</p><p>All appointments to the NESC and to the NSB have been made in line with the relevant legislative provisions and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines on appointments to State boards.  One principal officer in my Department has been nominated to the council of Gaisce, whose appointments are made by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</p></reply>

Have all departmental officials on State boards been apprised of Circular 12/2010, in particular that a Minister must be notified without delay where there is a significant strategic or reputational risk to the State body that is not being addressed?  Is there a clear and uniform understanding of the role of departmental civil servants on State boards?  What does the Taoiseach understand by civil servants on State boards serving in a personal capacity?  I may be wrong and the Taoiseach can correct me but I am sure individual civil servants do not apply through the State boards system themselves as individuals.  It is presumed they are appointed by Ministers because they have a role within the Department structure.  Does the Taoiseach agree with the conclusions of the Comptroller and Auditor General when he said that concerns about the national children's hospital should have been passed on to Ministers if those concerns were not being addressed by the board?  Does the Taoiseach think this is the correct working methodology for civil servants on State boards, that where there are concerns they believe are not being addressed by the board, in accordance with Circular 12/2010, the Minister should be directly advised of that matter?</p></speech>

In its latest study published in December, it found that the proportion of women on the boards of non-commercial State agencies varies greatly by parent Department.  The highest proportion of women are represented on traditional feminised boards with responsibility for areas of social policy such as education, children and youth affairs, although all of those fall shy of gender parity.  One of the most disappointing findings was that the Taoiseach's Department had the lowest proportion of women on non-commercial State boards.  I would be interested to find out whether this position has changed since the research was published.</p>  <p>  The report also finds that boards that fall under the remit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, whose responsibility it is to deliver Civil Service renewal, have the fourth lowest proportion of women despite the fact that there is now a higher share of women in professional posts, for example, working as senior economists or policy analysts.  This demonstrates that there is no shortage of women with the necessary education and skills to populate these types of boards.  A total of 40% of those on State boards are women but just 27% of them hold chairperson roles.  Eleven boards have no female representation at all.  Less than half of State boards have reached the minimum 40% target of female representation.  I take no pleasure in noting that the Department of the Taoiseach has the worst report card when it comes to women's participation on State boards.  This sends out a very bad signal to women of all ages inside and outside the public sector.  I am sure the Taoiseach has read the IPA research and I would be interested to hear what action he has taken or intends to take to increase the number of women on boards under the aegis of his Department.</p></speech>

More generally, the issue has arisen with public interest directors in the banks and semi-State bodies.  In D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, and I presume it is replicated everywhere else, bizarre situations arose where, when issues relating to the body to which they were appointed were being discussed, public representatives would walk out of the room claiming that they had a conflict of interest.  I do not understand that.  What is the point of us putting civil servants or indeed public representatives on boards of State agencies if they are not responsible to this House or democratic bodies and have responsibilities relating to reporting?  What is point of putting them in there and if, in this case, they are somehow subject to the confidentiality of a project group?  It seems to defeat the purpose of putting them on the board in the first place.  Surely the only point of putting a civil servant on a project board like that or on the board of any agency or semi-State agency is that they are there to mind the public interest and to report back if the public interest is adversely affected.</p></speech>

I understand that the Taoiseach has committed to increasing gradually the numbers of women on boards, particularly in areas like finance.  That is all to the good.  How long will we have to wait in those areas, including with reference to the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach?</p>  <p>  Ireland is now a very different country in terms of the most recent census compared with what it was 20 or 30 years ago.  We now have people from diverse backgrounds all over the world who have made their homes in Ireland and whose children have grown up in Ireland, many of whom, especially in our constituency, are now past the teenage stage, have qualified from college and have achieved very significantly.  Notwithstanding the contribution of immigrants to Ireland, when we look at the composition of the boards, we see that not only are there relatively few women and even fewer female chairpersons of boards, ethnic diversity is almost entirely missing.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance told me the other day about the new holistic approach taken by his Department to policy issues, which I welcome.  What I want to know is whether the Taoiseach would be conscious of the issue given that he represents Dublin West where about 30% of the population is either not born in Ireland or has parents who were not born in Ireland.  The Taoiseach knows that there are significant numbers of young people from a variety of ethnic backgrounds in our secondary schools, yet when it comes to public positions like boards, they see very few people like them.  What is the Taoiseach going to do to address this?</p></speech>

The public servant on that board had an obligation to report to his line Minister and the Minister for Health.  I do not think that has been adequately responded to by Government.  The circular is clear, as is the opinion of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>  <p>  When the previous Taoiseach announced various procedures for making appointments to State boards and changed them a number of years ago, he said they would be reviewed over time to check whether they were delivering better boards.  The early evidence was that the new procedures were confirming that people appointed previously were overwhelmingly being viewed as suitable for reappointment, that the range of people applying for appointments was broad, but that it was uncertain whether there was any improvement in the functioning of boards.  Has the Taoiseach commissioned any independent research on the operation of State boards and whether they are actively performing the role of supervising the strategic direction of State agencies and protecting the public interest?  This is of particular concern in the context of the national children's hospital because, last August, the Government reappointed in full the board of the national children's hospital, and little more than six months ago, the Government expressed full confidence in the board's work.  This was at a point when the Government was fully aware of the outcome of the tendering procedure overseen by the board.  Then suddenly the Taoiseach and Minister for Health began calling for heads to roll.</p><p>Indeed, the chairperson was offered up as a sacrifice to stop more politically sensitive accountability.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied with the procedure by which he and the Government reappointed the children's hospital board last year?  What review did it conduct of their work before nodding through the reappointment of the chairperson and the board?</p></speech>

It has been clarified that the responsibility is to report to the line Minister of the Department under which the board is established, not the Department in which the relevant public servant works.  For example, if it is a health board, the responsibility is to the Minister for Health, and if it is an education board, it is to the Minister for Education and Skills, not the Department in which the public servant works, which could be the Department of Finance or the Department of the Taoiseach, or otherwise.  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board has its own code of governance, which is available on its website and which covers the whole issue of confidentiality and the need for board members to maintain collective confidentiality.</p>  <p>  In regard to Mr. Paul Quinn, again, as I explained to the House last week, he met the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and discussed the situation.  I understand that he judged that he had no responsibility or obligation to report to the Minister for Health on the matter of the overrun, as the chairman of the board had done so.</p>  <p>  In regard to women on State boards, we set a target of making sure that at least 40% of people on State boards were women.  That has been exceeded and it is now 41% or 42%.  Last year was the first year during which more than 50% of appointments were female, and we are now aiming for a higher target to go well above 40%.  The focus is particularly on boards where there is gender imbalance, which can happen both ways.  One will see that on many of the education, health and social care boards there is a predominance of women and very few men, whereas on finance and enterprise boards one will see a preponderance of men rather than women.  Gender balance should work both ways.  The focus is on evening that out across those different types of boards and going up from 40% towards 50%.</p>  <p>  I am also leading an initiative to increase the participation of women on boards of listed private companies, where fewer than 20% of the membership are female, which is half the proportion on State boards.  Now that we have exceeded our 40% target, we are in a strong position to put pressure on the private sector to do much better.  I am leading that initiative.</p>  <p>  With regard to my own Department, I am happy to correct the Deputies.  I do not appoint most of the members to NESC; they are generally appointed by what we used to call social partners.  Of the appointments that have occurred since I became Taoiseach, three were made by me but on the nomination of farming bodies, and all three were male, and one was made by me but on the nomination of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and he was male.  However, of the appointments I have made myself and which I had discretion over, three of the five were female, or 60%.</p></speech>

A Government decision was taken in December 2017 to migrate all primary Department websites to one single portal, <i>gov.ie</i>.  This aligns with international best practice.  <i>Gov.ie</i>has been developed with the citizen at its centre, with an emphasis on policy and service areas, as opposed to how a Department is structured internally.  <i>Gov.ie</i>will be the one trusted source which makes interactions with the Irish Government more citizen-focused and data-driven.  Information is presented in a clear, understandable and accessible manner.  <i>Gov.ie</i>has been used to host many cross-Government communications campaigns, including Healthy Ireland, Be Safe Online, Sl&aacute;intecare, Project Ireland 2040 and information around budget 2019.</p><p>My Department was the first to migrate to <i>gov.ie</i>, with more to follow on a quarterly basis over the next 18 months.  Our new web address is <i>www.gov.ie/taoiseach</i>.  The next to migrate across will be the Departments Public Expenditure and Reform, Finance and Rural and Community Development, and they are now in the process of transitioning.  All remaining Departments will transition between now and the end of next year.</p><p>Users of the<i>taoiseach.ie</i>website were notified in mid-November 2018 that the information on the <i>taoiseach.ie</i>website would move to the new central <i>gov.ie</i>website.  The old <i>taoiseach.ie</i>website was available until 22 February and has since been archived in co-operation with the National Library of Ireland.</p></reply>

In fact, the head of the marketing unit, who has now been transferred to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, produced a report which looked at only three countries and produced no evidence to say the public found it easier to access official information.  The United Nations ranking for eGovernment, which was cited repeatedly as a reason for the promotion of a single site, gave a high ranking to certain states due to completely different factors, access to broadband being the most important.</p>  <p>  In all of the controversy last year, one thing that did come out of the meagre research competed by the unit was the advice of other countries not to implement anything before first checking with the public what they want and in what form they want it.  This was, of course, a piece of advice which was completely ignored.  Before the Taoiseach proceeds further with the single Government portal idea, will he tell us what research has been undertaken to gauge what people want and whether they currently find it difficult to access information?  What is the status of the public opinion research which was contracted back in late 2017-----</p></speech>

He might share with us the analysis that led him to that assertion in order that we can examine best practice internationally and see the models he is aiming to replicate here.  I am aware there are difficulties in regard to finding specific data since the Department of the Taoiseach website has been stood down and migrated into this new common Government website.  People who are looking for information want specific departmental information and Government structural information, and they need to be clear where they are looking.</p>  <p>  I want to ask some specific questions.  What individual person has overall responsibility for this project; in other words, who is leading this migration?  Has there been an assigned budget line for this project and, if so, how much has been allocated to it?  When does the Taoiseach expect it to be fully completed?</p></speech>

He might cite for us the evidence that this is what the public want.  Having discrete access points that are Department-specific, whether that is in regard to social welfare or enterprise, for example, strikes me as having the best prospect of being user-friendly and easier to navigate than migrating all of the State's Departments onto one site.  That, of course, is just my hunch and I could be entirely wrong.  I am sure the Taoiseach is not operating on the basis of a hunch so he might cite for us the source of evidence for this approach.  In addition, how much is this costing?</p></speech>

That information is really important to people.  The current changes being made by the Revenue Commissioners concerning smallscale employers, such as a person employing a child minder in his or her house or at the child minder's house, are generating great numbers of requests for parents, very often the mum, to comply with a huge number of new regulations.  All of this detail is currently and quite properly located with the Revenue Commissioners, and it is hard enough to get an answer from them as it is very confusing currently.  It is the same with social welfare queries, as both the Taoiseach and I know.</p> <p> I do not get why everything should be under one roof, when the nature of some queries, like to Revenue and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, are so specific to the individual, that citizens need a trusted source to which they can go, instead of some kind of public relations outfit.  Under the current changes, people will have to keep going down from the upper and opening elements of the site into the parts of the information system they really need.</p></speech>

It also provides political oversight on Project Ireland 2040.  Significant work is underway across each of these areas through Departments and agencies and a range of interdepartmental groups such as the climate action high level steering group and the Project Ireland 2040 delivery board.</p><p>Cabinet committee B covers social policy and public services including education, children, social inclusion; Irish language, arts and culture; and continued improvements and reform of public services. </p><p>In addition, these matters are regularly considered at meetings of the Government itself.</p></reply>

A pattern has since emerged of Cabinet committees being, at best, marginal to the issues they are supposed to be handling.  The facts demonstrate that in areas such as health, housing, Brexit, Northern Ireland and other areas of public concern, the Cabinet sub-committees have made irregularly.  The Taoiseach recently justified this by stating he preferred to have the discussions at a full Cabinet meeting.  The implication of that stance is that he prefers to have the discussion without the detail of advanced work circulated to Departments, without key officials present and as part of much fuller agendas and limited time.</p>  <p>  These discussions are also sometimes held without putting them on the agenda.  That at least is what is implied by the failure of his staff to note these discussions when explaining the Cabinet agenda in different contexts.  That includes the press briefings on Tuesday afternoons.  Turning to the infrastructure committee, which I think met in January, it is clear it is not on top of the national plan at all or has very little relationship with it.  That is evident from the massive overspend on the national children&rsquo;s hospital, for example.  That overspend will have an impact on the wider national development plan and the capacity to deliver other projects is undermined.</p>  <p>  This recurs repeatedly with different committees which seem very much out of touch with various crises in different Departments.  Will the Taoiseach explain why he thinks it is better, overall, not to have detailed advanced staff work done or key officials present when discussing these important issues?  What used to happen at Cabinet sub-committees was a more intensive and specific look at issues.  It was not just a case of a glance during a plenary session of the Cabinet.</p></speech>

I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that the Euro Health Consumer Index, EHCI, 2018 was published yesterday.  It again found that we have the worst hospital waiting lists in Europe.  This is consistent with the latest figures published by National Treatment Purchase Fund earlier this month.  Those figures show that hospital waiting lists have reached record levels.  More than 523,000 patients were waiting for an outpatient consultation and more than 72,000 waiting for an inpatient procedure.</p>  <p>  The situation regarding hospital waiting lists is out of control.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s Government and his Minister for Health continue with flawed and failed plans.  We need sustained intelligent investment in the public health system to tackle these waiting lists.  That needs to be done through the full implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare to ensure there are significant financial and health benefits for the State and patients in the long term.  Is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department still involved in the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare?  What precise role does his Department have?</p></speech>

That plan led people to protest outside the D&aacute;il again this morning.  Deputy Gino Kenny and I challenged the Minister on this issue a couple of weeks ago.  The response was that it was nothing to do with the Government.  It was an issue for the Revenue Commissioners.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that is nonsense.  An EU directive states that food supplements are food.  The Revenue has, however, now made a distinction between food and food supplements.  After years of applying a 0% VAT rate, it has decided to lash a rate of 23% on those supplements.  That will put many people out of business.  It will also ensure that those supplements, which the EU considers as food and which are very important for the health of ordinary people, will now be out of the reach of many people.</p><p>It is important to state that less well-off people will be hit hardest by this.  Rich people will be able to absorb a 23% increase and still buy their supplements.  Less well-off people will not be able to access these supplements.  The Government is standing back as if to say that this has nothing to do with it.  Actually, it does have something to do with it.  This is about people's health and about fairness.  This is a frankly fairly bizarre interpretation on the part of Revenue.  There is a clear directive from Europe stating that food supplements are food.  As a result, they should not be the subject of this 23% increase.</p></speech>

I have raised it at least three times and, notwithstanding what he stated earlier, I ask the Taoiseach to reflect on this matter further.  Fundamental tax policy should not be made by Revenue as if it was not the purview of the Government or this House.  I ask the Taoiseach to reflect on that again.</p><p>I wish to ask a specific question about the operation of Cabinet sub-committees.  The Taoiseach has redesigned the latter from those with which I was familiar during my time in government.  Is he satisfied that they are working?  The Taoiseach likes a catch-all phrase and, obviously, a catch-all Government website.  However, I question the notion that the Government can deal with health or housing or can drive the Garda reform agenda via a general committee.  The former practice took a lot of time virtually every Monday, with a long time spent on issues by specific committees.  I happen to be an <i>ex officio </i>member of all the Cabinet sub-committees.  All the key officials were there and the Government was able to deal with issues.  Obviously, experimentation is a good thing, but is the Taoiseach satisfied that the new general committee, in which a number of different topics are amalgamated, are working?</p></speech>

This means that, allowing for a month off in August, there are a maximum of 11 Cabinet sub-committee meetings each year.  The Taoiseach has told us about his dislike of the system of Cabinet sub-committees.  That may be an explanation for some of the matters in respect of which there are real holes in this Government's performance.  I put it to the Taoiseach that perhaps he is not getting the kind of detailed information he, as leader of the Government, requires and which the other members of his Cabinet also need.  For example, how many Cabinet sub-committees on average does the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, attend?  How many are he, the leader of the other party in government, and the two Independents entitled to attend?  The Taoiseach presumably meets his Fine Gael colleagues quite a lot.  How does he arrange to meet the other Government partners, namely, Deputy Ross's party and the two Independent Ministers?  Perhaps the Taoiseach arranges to meet them privately, but he is very busy and I doubt he has that much time to do all of that.  This could be the explanation for the problem in housing.  Perhaps this is why there is such a blind spot regarding matters such as social and affordable housing, notwithstanding the increases in other forms of housing.  We are all genuinely perplexed.  This Government has a lot of resources and came into a very good situation.  Its failure to deliver on housing, health and an number of other issues is pretty disappointing.</p></speech>

Everyone is actually involved in making the decision.  People get papers before the meeting happens rather than big decisions being made at the last minute, often following a diktat from the EMC and its members.</p><p>Cabinet meets once a week, sometimes more frequently.  We will have two meetings next week and possibly a third.  That is the way I like to run things.  There are also lots of Cabinet sub-committees.  We have one nearly every week.  It depends on the issues arising.  The Brexit committee now almost never meets because we discuss Brexit at every single Cabinet meeting.  There is also a separate officials' group.  Brexit affects everyone and I want everyone around the table.  We spent the best part of an hour on it today and will do so again next week.</p><p>There are often areas that do not involve everyone but do involve several Departments, and that is where the Cabinet sub-committees come in very useful.  Deputy Howlin mentioned the Garda reform programme.  Our response to the O'Toole commission's recommendations went to the Cabinet sub-committee before it went to the full Cabinet, because that did not involve everyone but it did involve a critical mass of Ministers.  Last week, the Cabinet sub-committee on infrastructure focused on the inter-agency report on homelessness.  That did not impact on everyone but it did impact on four or five Departments which were represented, including the Departments of Health, Justice and Equality and Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  We also discussed the advances that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, is making on realising the affordable childcare scheme at a Cabinet sub-committee meeting last week.</p><p>Different mechanisms are available.  Everyone is present at Cabinet; all the politicians who hold ministerial office are around the table with the Secretary General of the Government.  Cabinet sub-committees can also come in useful but there is a downside to them.  With so many Ministers on each committee plus their officials and advisers, these are meetings of 30 or 40 people.  Anyone who attends meetings knows the difference between getting things done at a meeting of ten people and a meeting of 40 people.  I also meet Ministers bilaterally.  I am in the process of meeting Ministers individually, along with their Secretaries General and their main advisers, in order to review progress and work in the various Departments.</p><p>Deputy McDonald mentioned the Euro Health Consumer Index, which was released in the last few days.  She neglected to mention that the ranking of the quality of our health services went up by two points.  It is major news when we go down but when we go up it barely makes the news at all.  It is important to take these things with a pinch of salt.  It is a private company based in Sweden.  It is not the World Health Organization or <i>The Lancet</i>, but it is still an interesting index.</p><p>In regard to waiting lists, the Deputy is quite right.  That is an area where we have not made sufficient progress.  However there are different waiting lists.  The waiting lists for operations and procedures is very much going in the right direction.  As of the end of last year, the number of patients waiting for an operation or a procedure-----</p></speech>

It went up in January as a consequence of the time lost around the nurses' strike and it will go up in February too for the same reason.  In March, it will once again be on a downward trajectory.  That means that most public patients waiting for an operation or procedure in Ireland now wait between three and six months, which is a significant improvement on where we were not too long ago.  We are not making much progress on outpatients and we need a new approach there.  Approximately, 300,000 people have been waiting for more than 12 weeks.  I refer to the period of 12 weeks because that is the Sl&aacute;intecare target.  The headline figures on waiting lists often include people who have been waiting for one, two or six weeks.  There will always be people waiting one, two or six weeks, but the Sl&aacute;intecare figure refers to those waiting for more than 12 weeks and that is the figure I always look out for.  There are now roughly 300,000 people who have been waiting for more than 12 weeks to see a specialist, but 500,000 appointments are no-shows.</p><p>There is a real problem there in terms of planning and efficiency that we have not got on top of.  There are potential solutions but many of them are IT-based and other things need to be done too.</p> <p> The implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare is run out of the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation office, which is in the Department of Health, but I will put some officials on that.  In the same way as I have officials designated to monitor the implementation of the Garda reform package and the justice reform package, I will assign officials to do the same with Sl&aacute;intecare.</p> <p> On the question of VAT on supplements, I answered questions on that earlier during Questions on Promised Legislation so I will not repeat myself-----</p></speech>

As Minister of State with responsibility for defence, part of his job is to ensure that those under his watch are not bullied, singled out for special attention or skipped over for promotion or continuance of service.  It is more his duty to protect those who are serving members and, in this case, the Air Corps, which made protected disclosures of wrongdoing, incompetence and breaches of health and safety regulations.  These vindictive actions included false statements, counter-allegations and denials of appeals, and no responses have been issued.</p></reply>

It is, therefore, not possible for me to go into detail regarding any actions being taken on foot of any individual disclosure to ensure that such individual's confidentiality is not breached.</p>  <p>  However, as I have previously stated in the House, the health and welfare of the men and women of the Defence Forces are a priority for me and the general staff and I am fully committed to compliance with the requirements of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 and to the protections contained in that Act.  To this end, I want to ensure that those making protected disclosures are reassured that where such disclosures are made in accordance with the legislation they will continue to be dealt with in a thorough and fair manner.  I have made it very clear to my Department and the Defence Forces that the protections of the Act must be afforded to those who make qualifying disclosures under the Act.</p>  <p>  To assist in ensuring a uniform approach to protected disclosures across the Defence organisation, I established a single civil-military protected disclosures office in the Department in which all protected disclosures are initially assessed.</p>  <p>  I take very seriously any complaint of penalisation or threatened penalisation of a member of the Defence Forces for having made a protected disclosure and I note that a statutory mechanism for investigation is available to the complainant.  The mechanism is the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces as provided for in section 20 of the Act.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, any member of the Defence Forces who brings any concern to myself or the civil/military protected disclosures office regarding a feeling that they were penalised or were threatened with penalisation for having made a protected disclosure is advised, as a matter of course, that they should bring the matter to the attention of the independent ombudsman.  I assure the Deputy that each and every case of alleged penalisation is being dealt with in a thorough way.</p></reply>

He mentioned bringing the matter to the attention of the independent Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.  No action was taken on foot of a letter dated 28 November 2018 appealing for the Minister of State's intervention and asking what protection he was giving to this serving member at the time.  What actions were taken on foot of the original protected disclosure?  What actions did the Minister of State take on receiving the letter dated 28 November 2018?  It appears he has failed to protect the ordinary serving member of the Defence Forces in this matter.  We need clarity on that and I would be grateful if he could come back on that.  Will he clarify his position and state that no whistleblower will be prejudiced or penalised for making a protected disclosure?  Will he clearly outline this position to the Defence Forces because from what I have seen that is not happening?  What action will be taken if it is found that any whistleblower was penalised or prejudiced in respect of that section of the Act?</p></speech>

That is stated clearly in the Act.  As I stated in my original reply, if any person believes he or she is being penalised because he or she has made a protected disclosure, there are avenues he or she can take.  If this person has not gone to the ombudsman, I would encourage the person to do that.  As he always does, the ombudsman will rule clearly on it in an independent fashion and he will make a recommendation to me, as Minister of State with responsibility for defence.  It is up to the individual to go to the ombudsman.  I reiterate that I would encourage anyone to go to the ombudsman if they have not done so.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, this person has left the service because of the way he has been treated.  He believes he has been let down.  He has served his country with distinction.  He thought he was doing the right thing by disclosing what was going on but he is now in a position where he cannot keep his job, which will affect him in many other ways.  I appreciate the Minister of State mentioning that there are certain avenues he can take.  However, the proof of the pudding is in the eating in terms of the letter dated 28 November 2018, which explained everything that happened regarding the misinformation and where the bullying was being perpetrated, yet he relied on the last line of defence, if the Minister of State will pardon the pun, which is that he is the Minister with responsibility for defence.  The buck stops with the him yet this person has been left out on a limb and we are now being told that he has to go to another department.  That is disingenuous in terms of this individual because if this problem is systemic in the Air Corps, I can see is arising in the Army and the Naval Service and it will continue.</p></speech>

I will not stand over anybody being wronged.  I encourage the person to whom the Deputy is referring to go to the Defence Forces ombudsman.  He or she may have done so but I assure the Deputy that that case will be dealt with in an independent and fair way.  The ombudsman provides that facility in an independent way.</p><p>The ombudsman will view the case in a very objective way.  Therefore, I will leave this in the hands of the Ombudsman.

This includes the defence sector in module 2.</p>  <p>  In order to assist the commission in its analysis, the Department of Defence was requested to provide specific data.

The Department of Defence is continuing to engage with the Public Service Pay Commission and is responding to queries and requests for further information from the commission.  In this regard, the material is continuing to be collated by the civil and military personnel who worked closely in preparing the submission to the commission.</p>  <p>  The Public Service Pay Commission has engaged an independent firm to conduct a survey of Defence Forces personnel to assist in the analysis.  This follows on from a study conducted in the second half of 2018 of specialist personnel in the Defence Forces.  The main data gathering for the survey will be conducted in February and March 2019.  The survey is being facilitated through the Defence Forces.  The Public Service Pay Commission has written to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, inviting the management parties to attend a meeting.  This will include representatives from the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The commission's work is ongoing.

In January 2019, the Minister of State contradicted himself by mentioning the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and what we have learned since is that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform had the report that was jointly signed off by the Department and military management for up to three months.</p>  <p>  It does not augur well that a report that has been jointly prepared is diluted, amended or changed when it runs through the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and it is worrying for any cohort of public sector workers to see the intervention of that Department.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, admitted to me in recent weeks that he had interfered and involved himself in that process, which undermines the independence and integrity of the Public Service Pay Commission if we have the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform involving itself in and amending the recommendations or the submission that is made from the Department of Defence and from military management.</p>  <p>  I want the Minister of State to clarify why he said in the D&aacute;il that it had gone to the Public Service Pay Commission in October when it had not and when in fact it went in December.  Why did the Minister of State not inform the D&aacute;il in October that it would go to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?  Why did the Minister of State withhold that information at the time?  Why is the deadline now being pushed out into the middle of this year or whenever when the Minister of State had given a previous commitment about quarter four of last year for the Public Service Pay Commission report?</p></speech>

I know the Deputy is perfect and that is the way it is but I am not perfect and I corrected the record in parliamentary questions earlier this year when I said it went to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  As the Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform advised the Deputy in a reply to a parliamentary question on 24 January 2019: "The submission to the Public Service Pay Commission in respect of the Defence Forces was compiled on a collaborative basis between the management side parties in order to provide the Commission with accurate and complete material so as to assist it in its examination of recruitment and retention issues in the Defence Forces."  When the submission was originally made to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform then went back and forward and had dialogue with civil and military management on the submission.  They drilled down into it and looked for more evidence based statistics.  Both my Department and military management worked on that over a number of months before concluding the final submission in December 2018.  I know that the Public Service Pay Commission is still in contact with Defence Forces' members.</p></speech>

The Minister of State knew damn well last year that it was with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and he never informed the House or me.  What the Minister of State wanted to do was to say that it is jointly signed off, it has gone to the Public Service Pay Commission and let us wait for the report.</p>  <p>  On a parallel basis, it is interesting that during that period the Chief of Staff was making a public plea at the various representative association's meetings and publicly talking about the pay issue.  We know now why that was the case because he probably knew at that time that the process was with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but the Minister of State wanted to take it off his desk by saying that it had gone to the Public Service Pay Commission and by not informing us where it had really gone, namely the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  My difficulty is that the Minister of State has delayed the issue around the recruitment and retention crisis by having the report delayed for a quarter of the year with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It also undermines the integrity of the process whereby the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has chipped away at and diluted some of the issues and genuine difficulties that members of the Defence Forces have.  That is the issue.  It is not about having a perfect story or not.  The Minister of State did not tell the House the truth in October 2018 and he did not correct the record until January when he knew damn well where that report was going.  Why did the Minister of State not tell us where it was going at that stage?</p></speech>

I did not in any way undermine the integrity of anybody.  What I want from my side is to make sure that both military management and the Department make the best submission possible to the independent Public Service Pay Commission.  As I have stated in my original reply, the Public Service Pay Commission has written to my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and military management, inviting them in to make a verbal presentation.  This is something that I have looked for and that I am happy to say has now been granted.  I look forward to the outcome and the Government can take whatever recommendations are made by the Public Service Pay Commission into account and make appropriate decisions.</p></speech>

As the Minister of State knows, there is grave concern about the ongoing refusal to award military medals around Jadotville and many families have been in touch with Members across this House about same.  I want to know why the Minister of State cannot progress what has been recommended by many people in the Defence Forces and if he can clarify the matter.</p></reply>

Defence Forces Regulation, DFR, A9 sets out the qualifying criteria required to be awarded such Defence Forces medals.  This regulation also delineates the procedures for the awarding of those medals to members of the Defence Forces.  DFR A9 sets out the various types of medal awards.  "Medal award" serves as an overarching category and then various subcategories are further set out under each "medal award".</p><p>These subcategories are classes of award, bar to medal, investigation by military board, time limit for award, and administrative instructions.  The details provided underneath each of these headings essentially lay out the protocols for the awarding of these medals.</p> <p> Apart from those medals set out in DFR A9, other medals have been awarded.  A recent medal awarded was the 1916 Centenary Commemorative Medal.  This was awarded to all those personnel serving in 2016 in the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force.  Another medal awarded was the Jadotville Medal, which was awarded to the men of A Company 35th Infantry Battalion in recognition of the courageous actions of the men during the siege at Jadotville.  I was very happy to be associated with both of these medals and it gave me great pleasure to attend the various medal award ceremonies and meet the recipients.  To provide for the aforementioned 1916 Centenary Commemorative Medal and the Jadotville Medal, additional stand-alone Defence Force regulations in the yearly series were made for both.  These regulations were made pursuant to section 26 of the Defence Act 1954, as was DFR A9.</p></speech>

I understand recommendations were made for personnel to receive a medal following service in Kosovo.  I also understand that in that case a board never met but one individual decided it was appropriate not to proceed.  Will the Minister of State clarify this?  Will the Minister of State guarantee that when recommendations are made by an appropriate officer, they will always be discussed and the board will always sit?  There is a lot of confusion about this process and the Minister of State needs to clarify it.  Why were medals awarded for Elizabethville during Ireland's participation in the Congo but not for other places that saw action?  I do not dispute these medals but I would like to know the rationale behind the decision.  It is a bone of contention for many people.  I acknowledge this is now historical but it remains of significant ongoing interest to many families.  Was Elizabethville the biggest action the Defence Forces were involved in during the Congo mission?  It is fair to say that it was not.  There is a view that the Jadotville men, who were in action months later, warranted a medal.  Will the Minister of State provide clarity on this specific issue?  The regulations or the process need to be rectified so they can be awarded the superior medal.</p></speech>

A Government decision was made that we would award the Jadotville Medal to the men who participated there.  This went on for a long number of years.  I am very well aware of the campaign under way for medals for a select group of men who served in Jadotville.  These issues were considered in the 1960s by the medal board when people were recommended for a Distinguished Service Medal.  On that occasion, a decision was made not to award a Distinguished Service Medal.  I understand the medal board sat on two separate occasions to consider the matter.  I have stated, and will state again today, that if there is new information, of course it will be reconsidered.  People have put information into the domain recently, but my understanding is that information was already on the military records.  If there is substantive new information, of course this will be reconsidered.</p></speech>

In addition, other medals were awarded to soldiers from other companies in the same battalion in the Congo for other actions elsewhere but no medals were awarded for Jadotville action, which is still the biggest battle with a foreign enemy in which the Irish Army has been involved since the formation of the State.  The defence of Jadotville is recognised worldwide as the most perfect example of a perimeter defence and is now being taught as case history by the British Army, the Australian Army and the German Army and probably by other armies.  There is a feeling in the community, which is lobbying all of us on this matter, that when he was Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny made a direct commitment to offer the superior medal for extraordinary courage and the Military Medal for Gallantry, and that what has been awarded thus far is simply an acknowledgement and does not merit the action in which they were involved.  This is the significant bone of contention.  They feel that a commitment was made at the top of government but it has not been matched with follow-through.</p></speech>

The awarding of a Distinguished Service Medal is provided for in DFR A9, which also sets out the criteria for the award of such medals.  It is important that to maintain the prestige of such medals, the criteria outlined are strictly adhered to.  The Deputy will agree that we should stick with the routine that if a Distinguished Service Medal is awarded, it is up to the military to recommend it to me as Minister of State.  It should not be up to civilians to state someone deserves a Distinguished Service Medal.  It is the military that makes the recommendation.</p></speech>

This emphasises the importance attached by the Government to ensuring that the Defence Forces have the resources necessary to deliver on all roles assigned by Government, at home and overseas.  The 2019 provision comprises &euro;758 million for Vote 36 - Defence, an increase of more than &euro;50 million, and &euro;249 million for Vote 35 - Army Pensions, an increase of &euro;10 million.</p>  <p>  Overall, approximately 77% of the defence sector provision relates to pay and pensions.  The 2019 provision for pay in Vote 36 is &euro;529 million, and this provides for the pay and allowances of more than 10,400 public service employees, including 9,500 Permanent Defence Force personnel, 550 civilian employees and 355 civil servants.  The Government has ensured that full funding has been provided for 2019 for the target strength for the Permanent Defence Force of 9,500.</p>  <p>  Pay is being restored to members of the Defence Forces and other public servants in accordance with public sector pay agreements.  The focus of these increases is weighted in favour of those on lower pay.  Following the increases paid under the Lansdowne Road agreement, further increases were paid in 2018 under the Public Sector Stability Agreement 2018-2020, with additional increases due in 2019.  The allocation includes &euro;6.3 million to meet the additional commitments for 2019.  Further increases in pay are scheduled for 2020.</p>  <p>  In accordance with the provisions of Public Services Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the Government has tasked the Public Service Pay Commission with conducting a more comprehensive examination of recruitment and retention challenges in the defence sector.  The work of the commission is ongoing.  The Government will give due consideration to the findings and recommendations that arise from the work of the commission.</p>  <p>  The non-pay allocation, including capital, for Vote 36 in 2019 is &euro;229 million and this provides for essential and ongoing Defence Forces standing and operational costs as well as the provision of essential procurement and upgrading of defensive equipment and infrastructure.</p></speech>

I have previously raised the issue of the wages of Defence Forces personnel being far below what they ought to be, with some members paid close to minimum wage for work that deserves far more.  That work requires great discipline and sacrifice by the personnel and their loved ones.  I have raised this issue on multiple occasions and will continue to so do until the members of the Defence Forces are given the respect they deserve, which is most reflected by how much they are paid and their conditions of employment.  The increased funding allocated over the past two years went towards ICT, military hardware and equipment upgrades in many ways.  Those upgrades are very important, but the real need for funding is in the area of pay and wages.  Not enough is being done.  There is no light at the end of the tunnel for members of our Defence Forces, as highlighted by the recent campaigns.</p></speech>

The Government is addressing the issue of pay.  I have stated on the public record - in barracks and in the House -  and in private that pay is a challenge for the Defence Forces and that is why the Government is addressing this issue.  The Deputy has been a Member of this House for many years.  He was a member of Government from 2011 to 2016.  He is aware of the challenges in regard to public service pay.  I do not want the message to go out that members of the Defence Forces are paid very little.  Among enlisted personnel, the average gross earnings in 2018 of a three-star private was &euro;37,529; a corporal, &euro;41,076; a sergeant, &euro;44,622; a company quartermaster, &euro;49,605; a company sergeant, &euro;50,224; a battalion quartermaster, &euro;53,616; and a sergeant major, &euro;54,878.  In the officer corps, the average gross earnings of a second lieutenant was &euro;37,108; a lieutenant, &euro;42,291; a captain, &euro;53,138; a commandant, &euro;66,496; a lieutenant colonel, &euro;79,162; and a colonel, &euro;88,480.  The starting salary for a three-star private in the Defence Forces is &euro;27,759.76, while a school-leaver newly commissioned officer would receive &euro;35,614 and a graduate lieutenant a starting salary of &euro;40,566.  I acknowledge that those are starting salaries and that members may experience challenges later in their career in the Defence Forces.  That is why there is an independent Public Service Pay Commission, as I earlier outlined to Deputy Jack Chambers.  We are addressing this issue.  It is taking time to so do and I acknowledge that is frustrating, but there is a significant amount of work to get through.</p></speech>

The ONE campaign highlighted what can happen when retired members of the Defence Forces fall off the edge of society.  We have let them down.  Defence Forces veterans are to hold a national march in Cork on May Day to highlight the poor pay and conditions endured by serving members of the military.  It will be the second national march organised by veterans, with a march having been held last September outside Leinster House.  Members of our Defence Forces do not take such action lightly.  They are very loyal to our State and are protectors of our sovereignty.  For them to demonstrate in such a manner is a significant reaction.  The level of pay of members of the Defence Forces and the way in which they are treated serves to push more and more of our veterans into abject and total poverty.  The legacy of this Government should not be to leave the members of the Defence Forces demoralised, poor and at risk of falling off the edge.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State hopes to address this issue, but money is now available which may not have been available in the past.  We must address the cause of the workers, particularly low pay.  Some are in receipt of the working family payment and finding it difficult to pay for accommodation.  We must take seriously and address these issues for our Defence Forces.  The Minister of State is making efforts but they must be accelerated.</p></speech>

I increased funding for ONE by 108% this year.  Its campaign aimed to highlight the services it provides for ex-members of the Defence Forces who have fallen on hard times.  It does a fantastic job in that regard.  It is out there helping people.  My Department and the Defence Forces are willing to assist the ONE campaign.  Not all of the veterans' organisations have participated in protests such as the march for veterans to which the Deputy referred.</p></speech>

There is considerable concern within the Defence Forces regarding this scheme which the Government seems to have designed and created without much collaboration with or agreement from the representative organisations.  Those organisations are considerably concerned that it has exacerbated the retention crisis within the Air Corps, where there is a growing element of contagion.  On what basis was the scheme designed?  I ask the Minister of State to provide a report on the matter.</p></reply>

As one of a range of measures to address this issue, the general staff and General Officer Commanding of the Air Corps recommended the initiation of a scheme to recommission former Air Corps officers.  There is also scope to recommission officers in other specialist streams across the Defence Forces, if shortages exist.  There have been previously been instances of former officers returning to the Defence Forces.  In the absence of a standard policy for dealing with such requests, each case was dealt with on an individual basis and governed by the rules, regulations and circumstances that applied at the time.  In the absence of a defined policy framework, the processing of such applications posed several difficulties, including defining procedures, identifying the requirements and needs of the organisation and agreeing terms and conditions with the individual.  In order to allow for a transparent scheme to facilitate the re-entry of former officers of the Defence Forces, a policy framework setting out terms and conditions was necessary.</p>  <p>  The terms and conditions for the recommissioning scheme include the provision that the recommissioning of former officers of the Defence Forces, including the Air Corps, shall only be considered in specific circumstances where the Chief of Staff has identified a deficiency in personnel, military capability or expertise in the Defence Forces that cannot be resolved in a sustainable or timely manner from within existing personnel resources.  These terms and conditions apply to all former officers of the Defence Forces and not just to the Air Corps.  Recommissioned officers will be offered a short service commission for a period of three years.  Within that period, they cannot compete for promotion or block a promotion opportunity for existing officers.  The recommissioned officers may only be offered a substantive appointment after three years on the advice of the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General.  This provides a fair and balanced approach for the former officer and existing members.  It is not realistic to suggest that vacancies should be maintained indefinitely for the purpose of ensuring promotions for existing members.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to state that two former officers have applied to rejoin the Air Corps.  Their applications are currently being progressed by the military authorities.</p></speech>

The scheme is viewed as a blind call on behalf of the Government, whereby it ploughed ahead without the agreement of or consultation with the representative organisations.  The Air Corps is currently 30% under strength.  The Minister of State referred to two former officers rejoining, but I understand that more than ten personnel may leave the Air Corps this year.  We do not know how many more personnel will be recruited.</p><p>It has caused considerable concern among those Air Corps officers who have displayed loyalty and commitment to the Defence Forces and who now face the prospect of this initiative having a detrimental impact on their career advancement prospects in what is already a narrow stream.  There is a view that the Minister of State has exacerbated this.  There are also concerns that there are no advertisements for the recommissioning, no process and no protocol.  Can the Minister of State confirm whether applicants are applying directly to him?  Through what section must they apply?  Is it through the human resources section in the Defence Forces or the Minister of State directly?  It would be very unusual if applications for recommissioning were made through the him directly.  He needs to clarify many of the concerns over recommissioning and the detrimental effect it is having on the very problem he is trying to solve.</p></speech>

The initiative was recommended by military management.  There is considerable support.  Wherever the Deputy is getting his information, he is not getting the full picture.  I can give him the full picture now.  The recommissioned officers will be offered a short-service commission for a period of three years.  In that period, they cannot compete for promotion, nor will they block a promotion opportunity for existing officers.  Wherever the Deputy is getting his information, it is totally incorrect.  I reiterate that the commissioned officers will not block promotional opportunities for other members of the Air Corps.  They will be given a short-term commission of three years.  After this period, the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General of the Department will examine the circumstances in the Air Corps.</p>  <p>  I want to address the shortage of pilots.  As the Deputy is well aware, there is a shortage of pilots across the world.  Aer Lingus is looking for more, as are all other airlines.  Anybody who wants to re-enter the organisation may do so through the Defence Forces or Department.  An individual did come to me and I passed on his information to the Defence Forces.  I understand that application is being processed.  An applicant will be accepted only if fully licensed and fully trained.  Those who want to recommence duty in the Air Corps are all fully trained by the Air Corps.</p></speech>

The Defence Forces are gaining two pilots and losing more than ten because they have no retention policy.  The Minister of State is not making it attractive enough to stay in the Defence Forces, including the Air Corps.  That is the core issue.  The Government is exacerbating underlying difficulties with morale and retention.  Does the Minister of State not believe it is unusual that there is a bizarre application process - a kind of South American or Venezuelan recommissioning process - whereby applicants go to the Minister, who then passes on the application?  No one applies to re-enter the health service through the Minister for Health.  No one applies to re-enter the Garda through the Minister for Justice and Equality, nor does one apply to enter the Civil Service through the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Clarity is needed on the protocol and procedure.</p>  <p>  The representative associations have serious concerns about this, and the Minister of State knows that because they wrote to him about it recently.  He has failed to respond properly to their letter of March 2018 in which they outlined multiple issues and concerns.  Their difficulties were not dealt with at that stage.  It is on this basis that I raise my query.  We do not know the advertisement process, protocols or procedures.  It is unusual that potential applicants would talk to the Minister of State about a re-entry process.  He needs to publish and clarify what this recommissioning is about, how it is designed and what agreement exists with the representative associations.</p></speech>

A copy of Mr. Barry's report is available on the website of the Department of Defence for all to see.</p>  <p>  Following publication of the report, an initial meeting to advance the recommendations in Mr. Barry's report took place between the representative and official sides.  Arising from that meeting, the Department of Defence contacted the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, to seek its assistance in progressing the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report through a revised conciliation and arbitration scheme.  Officials in the Department of Defence recently wrote to the representative associations advising them of the name of a person suggested by the WRC who can facilitate the process.  I am anxious that the parties conclude their discussions as soon as possible and arrive at an agreed revised conciliation and arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.</p></speech>

I very much welcome the report by Mr. Barry.  Both representative associations have been seeking changes to the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the past 15 years.  In 2016, when this matter was brought to my attention at the PDFORRA conference, representatives stated they had considerable concerns and reservations about the current scheme.</p><p>I then set about considering what was the best way to address the concerns of both PDFORRA and RACO.  I decided to appoint an independent person to look at the current scheme.  Mr. Gerald Barry examined it and I want both organisations to implement his report because it contains really good recommendations.  It addresses the concerns and was welcomed by both PDFORRA and RACO.  It is now up to the associations, in conjunction with my Department and the military, to accept this and move on.  I was asked to appoint an independent chairperson.  When the facilitator concludes all the work, I want to, and will, appoint an independent chairperson of the conciliation and arbitration scheme.</p></speech>

One of the recommendations in the Barry report states that there should be a significant allocation of resources in order to facilitate the report's implementation.  Has the Department provided for a separate allocation to facilitate the implementation of the recommendations this year?  That is a concern of the representative associations.  The Minister of State will not be able to deliver on the recommendations if money has not been set aside.  Can the Minister of State provide information on the cost of that allocation?  Does he agree that the provision of an effective parallel process form for engagement with the associations to any pay or collective bargaining issues of the public service should be a key policy objective?</p></speech>

Much work has gone on in the background and I understand the cost will be met by means of the existing resources of the Department.  However, I can come back to the Deputy on that.  I do not think there will be a large cost involved.  I am not aware of that.  I can come back to the Deputy.</p>  <p>  It is fundamental that we implement the changes to the conciliation and arbitration scheme recommended in the Barry report.

People knew what I meant.  It is in part an expression of the overall sense of sadness Ireland feels at the UK's decision to leave the European Union.  It is also an expression of disbelief that the British Government and Parliament would allow the UK to leave the EU in a disorderly fashion.  Members should make no mistake.  Such a result would be a lose, lose, lose for the people of the United Kingdom, Ireland and the European Union.</p>  <p>  The Westminster Parliament is the only place which can prevent this from happening.  Westminster needs to make up its mind, collectively, about what it wants.  Today's debate in the House of Commons illustrates the fluidity of the situation and, accordingly, the need for us to be prepared for all eventualities.  Our history with Britain is deep and complicated but it has arrived at a position of parity, trust and close friendship where we are co-guarantors of peace on our islands.  The Irish and British live, study and work together, as well as marry each other and have families together.  We understand each other's sense of self and sense of humour.</p><p>In politics we agree on a lot more than we disagree on.  Brexit must not be allowed to take any of this away from the British-Irish relationship today.<br/><br/>Somewhere along the road, the Irish and the British outlook and politics related to the European Union diverted dramatically.  We joined the EU together in 1973 when critics here claimed a small nation like Ireland would be assimilated.  Instead we flourished.  As a Deputy representing the people of Cork, I am proud to be Irish but I am also proud to be a European.  I am proud of the European Union and what it has given our country but also what we in turn have given the EU.  I want my three daughters to have the freedom to travel in Europe, perhaps to study or work in another EU country and speak other European languages.  They will be no less Irish for doing so.  Being Irish today is about being outward looking, generous and European.<br/><br/>As an Irish politician I will face no backlash from the people who elect me for saying any of this.  However, too few politicians in the UK were able or willing to say such things when discussing whether to leave the EU.  That is something every Member of this House must be wide awake to as the same inward looking political reversal is possible in all European Union countries.  It would be complacent and naive to think otherwise.  Brexit has reinforced once again that the loudest agitators in politics, the ones who get the most media attention, often have the least understanding of the consequences of that for which they advocate.  It is important for all of us who believe in the EU, as I do - the Government, Opposition and those standing for public office, especially those standing in this year&rsquo;s European elections - to communicate honestly to the Irish people the ongoing privileges and advantages of our EU membership.<br/><br/>However much we wish, we are not going to wake up to find the last two and a half years have been a bad dream.  The UK is leaving the European Union and today we still do not know how or under what conditions.  This poses unique and unprecedented challenges for Ireland.  The Government continues to work towards the ratification of the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, as a priority.  We remain closely engaged with our EU partners, as well as maintaining ongoing contacts with the UK.  Discussions are ongoing in Brussels between the EU and the UK.  The EU has made it absolutely clear that it stands by the withdrawal agreement, and it is not open for renegotiation.  However, the EU has made it clear throughout this process that it will listen to British concerns.  It will continue to do so and try to accommodate them.  Ratification of the withdrawal agreement would allow us to move on to start work on the agreement that will frame our future relationship.  The withdrawal agreement gets us to that next phase in the best way possible.<br/><br/>I would like again to take the opportunity to state that the unity and common purpose of all of the parties here in the D&aacute;il to deal with this common challenge has been invaluable.  I thank all Members for this facilitation and support that they have given in the context of the negotiations to date.  Brexit will bring real changes for all of us.  The Government has been working hard to ensure that Ireland is ready for the changes and challenges that Brexit brings.  We continue to seek to mitigate, as far as possible, the negative impacts of what is to come.  With the impending approach of the Brexit deadline, we have had no choice but to ramp up our no-deal plans.  The Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill, which the Government now lays before the D&aacute;il, is a key part of that work.  It covers, in primary legislation, the issues that need to be addressed immediately in the event of a no-deal Brexit, ensuring that key measures and protections are in place.  It focuses on protecting our citizens and supporting the economy, enterprise and jobs, particularly in key economic and vulnerable sectors.<br/><br/>The Bill forms part of the extensive preparations that are under way across Government and across the EU.  Our preparations include a range of measures such as the recruitment of customs and sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, officials, preparations at our ports and airports, and a range of financial and advisory supports for businesses to help them to prepare for Brexit.  Comprehensive, cross-Government preparations were set out in the Government&rsquo;s contingency action plan, published in December, and updated on 30 January.  This work continues at both a national and EU level.  All Departments have sector-specific plans in place.  These address key challenges arising from a no-deal Brexit, and associated mitigation efforts.<br/><br/>Our work at national level goes in tandem with the significant work under way across the EU to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s possible departure without a deal on the 29 March.  At EU level, 12 separate legislative proposals have been made as part of Brexit contingency preparations.  They range from aviation connectivity to road freight connectivity, from dual use goods to fishing authorisations.  Ireland has engaged on the detail of what is proposed at EU level on contingency to ensure that our concerns are reflected in proposals being taken forward at EU level.<br/><br/>Given the emergency nature of this legislation, the Government took the decision that progressing this through the Houses as an omnibus Bill was the most practical and sensible way to ensure that we have the necessary legislation enacted on time.  The Bill contains 15 Parts, addressing primary legislative issues which require immediate attention in a no-deal scenario.  These will be complemented by range of issues which will be addressed by statutory instrument, also before 29 March.  Primary legislative measures have been identified following a detailed screening by all Departments of legislation currently in force.  The relevant Ministers will introduce their sections of the Bill and set out those measures under their remit in more detail.  However, I would like to give Deputies a brief overview of the proposals.<br/><br/>First, should the withdrawal agreement be ratified, this Bill will make provision in domestic law for a transition period during which EU rules and regulations will continue to apply to the UK, even though it will be formally a third country.  This transition period effectively maintains the <i>status quo</i>up to December 2020.  It will allow for the negotiation of an agreement on the future relationship between the EU and the UK, and provide certainty to citizens and business as we continue our preparations for the new relationship with UK outside the EU.  That provision will apply should a withdrawal agreement be agreed and we move into a transition phase.  It will ensure that we treat the UK as a third country outside of the EU but in transition, effectively, as an EU member state.  That section is different from the rest of the proposed legislation which applies in a no-deal emergency situation.<br/><br/>Protecting and maintaining the common travel area and the associated rights and privileges is a key part of our planning and preparations.  This is vital in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland peace process, as well as for broader Ireland-UK relations.  The Bill, therefore, includes measures to underpin the common travel area, CTA, to ensure that the associated rights and entitlements of Irish and British citizens under this long-standing arrangement will continue in all circumstances, deal or no deal.<br/><br/>In the area of health services, the Bill provides continuity for a range of existing healthcare arrangements between Ireland and the UK, once the UK leaves the EU.  The Minister for Health will be provided with the power to make regulations in a number of matters, including to enable persons from Ireland to access healthcare in the UK.  This seeks to ensure that insofar as possible there is minimum disruption to health services and that essential services are maintained on a cross-Border, all-island, and Ireland-UK basis, which anyone living in the Border counties will understand only too well, as will those living elsewhere.<br/><br/>In the area of social protection, the Bill provides for the continued payment of a range of benefits, including old age pensions, illness benefits and child benefit.  It ensures the recognition of contributions made when working in the UK, and access to social insurance payments.</p><p>It is important that we ensure a seamless transition and that existing payments are protected and maintained.  The Bill also provides protection for workers whose UK-based employer becomes insolvent.<br/><br/>In the area of higher education, the Bill protects the continued mobility of students under the common travel area.  It will allow SUSI grants to be paid to eligible Irish students studying in the UK, as well as to UK students in Irish higher education institutions.  This will provide certainty for Irish students studying, or considering studying, in the UK and for UK students in Ireland.  These measures protect and enhance the long-standing excellent co-operation and collaboration between higher education systems in Ireland and the UK.<br/><br/>The Government is determined to maintain the strong co-operation with the UK in the area of law enforcement, particularly in the context of Northern Ireland.  The Bill includes provisions to ensure that justice and security co-operation with the UK, as a third country, can continue.  It puts in place measures to apply the 1957 European Convention on Extradition to the UK.  This will ensure workable extradition arrangements are in place between ourselves and the UK.  It also makes amendments to the Immigration Acts, which might otherwise expose the State to the risk that removals would be unsuccessful and undermine existing arrangements.<br/><br/>From the outset, the Government has made it a priority to minimise the impact of Brexit on North-South co-operation and the all-island economy.  The Bill addresses sectors where major challenges associated with a no-deal Brexit have been identified, including all-island transport and energy.  Provisions in transport will protect cross-Border bus services, ensuring continued service provision for passengers and commuters on the island of Ireland.  This covers compatibility with EU rules that govern services between a member state and a third country in respect of areas such as the recognition of driver qualifications.<br/><br/>The Bill will enable the Commission for Energy Regulation to address possible issues arising from a no-deal Brexit and maintain the operation of the single electricity market, which is so important to Northern Ireland in particular.<br/><br/>The Bill also covers tax measures that seek to minimise the disruption to business operating cross-Border in the immediate aftermath of a no-deal Brexit.  In the context of capital acquisition tax, the amendment provides continuity in existing treatment so that landowners who operate cross-Border will not be disadvantaged.  On corporation tax, the amendment maintains the <i>status quo</i>for tax treatment of certain transaction or corporate group structures.<br/><br/>The Government and the Commission have paid particular attention to the impact of Brexit on Irish business in their contingency planning.  Businesses and other affected areas need to respond and prepare themselves, and the Government is providing an array of supports and information to assist them.<br/><br/>The Bill will give Enterprise Ireland additional enabling power to further support businesses through widened investment, loans, and research and development and investment grants.  This is to further assist Irish businesses in remaining competitive and resilient in a no-deal Brexit context.  This will maximise our capacity to support businesses in the face of what could be a difficult transition.<br/><br/>The Bill also provides continuity for financial services, while the Irish market transitions to a new central securities depository provider.  Other measures provide for a temporary run-off regime to protect Irish policyholders from continuity issues with their insurance contracts in the event of a no-deal Brexit.<br/><br/>Finally, the Bill includes provisions to introduce postponed accounting for VAT purposes in a no-deal scenario.  This will alleviate the impact of potential cashflow burden issues faced by businesses post-Brexit.  This is a practical measure which will support businesses and was an issue highlighted by multiple industry representatives.<br/><br/>I would like to flag that, in the area of taxation, the Minister for Finance will introduce two technical changes on taxation on Committee Stage next week.  I will happily brief any of my colleagues on the content of that should they want it.<br/><br/>It is the Government&rsquo;s intention that, following the Second Stage reading this week, to take Committee and Report Stages next week.  The Bill will go to the Seanad for Second Stage, Committee Stage and Report Stage in the week of 11 to 14 March.  This timeline allows for commencement orders and other secondary legislation arising, numbering some 30 items, to be enacted in time for 29 March.  Ministers have briefed Oireachtas committees over the past two weeks, since the publication of the heads of the Bill, to discuss the proposed measures in their sectoral areas.  As the timelines are tight for the necessary enactment, the Government will work closely with all Opposition parties in the Oireachtas and all Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad to ensure that the necessary no-deal Brexit related legislation will be in place before the end of March.  This legislation is an essential part of our whole-of-Government preparations for Brexit.  I appreciate the co-operation and assistance from all Members in both Houses to ensure that we can get this Bill through the relevant stages and enacted in time.<br/><br/>The potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on Ireland would be severe.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, recently outlined the potential macroeconomic impacts and negative impacts that would be faced across a number of exposed sectors.  Our preparations, including through our legislative proposals, are focussed on minimising these impacts.  I reiterate, however, that managing a no-deal Brexit is an exercise in damage limitation.  It would be impossible in a no-deal scenario to maintain the current seamless arrangements between the EU and UK across the range of sectors which are, at present, facilitated by our common EU membership.  The Government is committed to working at a national level, as well as at a European level, to minimise impacts for our citizens and businesses as much as possible.  The Bill before the House forms an important part of this work.  It puts in place necessary measures for the application of a transition period under the withdrawal agreement.  It also provides continuity in key arrangements with the UK, notably in the context of the CTA.  In doing so, it seeks to protect our citizens and support the economy, enterprise and jobs, in key economic sectors.<br/><br/>There will come a time, I hope, when the word &quot;Brexit&quot; will no longer dominate the lens through which the British-Irish relationship is viewed.  The Government is determined to ensure that Britain and Ireland build new structures to build and maintain our strong and special relationship.  I say again, however, that our future is European.  It is incumbent on all of us here to ensure Ireland remains an active and committed member of the EU and its Single Market and customs union.  There is no greater demonstration of the benefits of EU membership to a country like Ireland than the unity and solidarity shown by our EU partners in the face of the potential exposure of this country to the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.<br/><br/>I look forward to colleagues' comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-26a.311" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1336" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="17:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022600029#DD00200"><p>With 31 days to Brexit, it is extremely disappointing and worrying that we find ourselves in this situation of having to pass emergency legislation to try to minimise the damage to our country and our citizens because of the UK Government's failure to ratify the withdrawal treaty which it negotiated and helped to craft.  We are but onlookers to this entire mess, something which we did not ask for or create but which nevertheless impacts on us heavily.</p>  <p>  The Oireachtas has shown incredible political maturity in uniting to navigate Brexit together and ensuring that we do all we can to protect Ireland's interests.  We have at times disagreed with the Government's approach to the Brexit process - particularly in the context of the disintegration in Anglo-Irish relations - and we remain dissatisfied with the level of preparedness for a potential no-deal Brexit.  Notwithstanding this, Fianna F&aacute;il has, despite the posturing of others in this House, given Government the latitude to deal with Brexit in the national interest.  When one compares and contrasts the political situation here to that in the UK, one is comparing stability with chaos.  The stable political situation here in Ireland has allowed us as an Oireachtas to have to a mature and responsible approach to Brexit and work to protect our economy, our people, our farmers and our business community.</p><p>I am proud of the role my party and its leader have played in ensuring that much-needed stability our country needs right now, particularly in light of the cheap political stunt Sinn F&eacute;in tried to pull last week when it attempted to plunge the country into a general election.  What Sinn F&eacute;in wants is to develop the same chaos here that it has created in the North, playing right into the hands of the hard-line Brexiteers and attempting to mirror the chaos in London.  I am thankful that it was unsuccessful in what it attempted to do.<br/><br/>There are only 11 D&aacute;il sitting days until 29 March.  The time is tight to get this mammoth legislation through the House but I and my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il will do all we can to facilitate its timely passage.  We are, however, disappointed that the Bill was only published on Friday last and that the Opposition has been given insufficient time to scrutinise it properly.  Given the goodwill that exists on the part of my party in assisting the Government in getting the legislation through and despite numerous requests from me to see it sooner, this request was not facilitated and the reasons given are not acceptable.  It is in all our interests to ensure that this crucial Bill is as robust as possible and it is our opinion that much more time should have been allocated in respect of it.<br/><br/>The Bill was published on Friday and, four days later, is now before the House.  By the Government&rsquo;s own admission, it is a substantial item of legislation, so the time provided to the Opposition to scrutinise it - effectively a weekend - is wholly inadequate.  It was simply unnecessary to create this situation.  It is no secret that other countries, including France and the Netherlands, published their Brexit legislation a number of months ago.  We seem to be on the back foot in terms of contingency planning for a no-deal Brexit.  Given that Ireland is the country most exposed to the impact of Brexit, we should really be out front in terms of our preparations for a no-deal Brexit, not at the back of the queue and lagging behind, trying to catch up.<br/><br/>All of us in this House, like the T&aacute;naiste, are hoping that this emergency legislation will not be required and that either a deal can be reached or there will be an extension of the Article 50 process.  It appears likely an extension will be sought and granted, given how little time is left, but it is not a guarantee that it will be requested by the United Kingdom.  We do not know what length of extension will be sought in the event that there is a request from the UK, but an extension, while preferable to a crash out, will not be without impact.  The continued uncertainty is having a negative impact on sterling prices, business and farming.  As a result, this is not an ideal situation by any means.  The business community is crying out for some degree of certainty in order that it can plan and make investments but a picture is being painted that so much is on hold as we wait to see what happens.<br/><br/>The situation is extremely fluid.  Yesterday, the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, stated that she would delay the next meaningful vote on Brexit until 12 March, only 17 days out from Brexit day, and President Donald Tusk called on the UK to ask for an extension.  The leader of the British Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, has stated he would support a second Brexit referendum if the UK Parliament rejects Labour's Brexit proposals.  In today's edition of the <i>Daily Mail</i>, three Conservative Ministers wrote an article stating that they will support an amendment tomorrow to take no deal off the table and extend the Article 50 process if there is no agreement by March 13.  The situation in the UK is changing by the day, if not the hour at times, and it is uncertain for everybody.  We know the clock continues to tick down to 29 March and we are no further towards concluding a Brexit deal.<br/><br/>To say something positive about the UK political position, I can see that a number of MPs across all parties genuinely want to find a solution and understand and sympathise with the Irish position.  I put on record that I am grateful for those moderate voices in the British Parliament who appreciate their responsibilities under the Good Friday Agreement and also understand that there is an onus on the UK when pursuing its Brexit policy that it should not hurt or damage other member states in the process.<br/><br/>Whereas we all hope that those in charge of the Brexit process in the UK see sense and realise that leaving without a deal would be an act of great self-harm, nothing can or should be assumed at this point.  We only need to look back to December 2017, when we were told that commitments given on the Border were bulletproof and cast-iron to see how wrong assumptions and premature celebrations can be.  It is my strong belief that the actions and comments of our Taoiseach in December 2017 following the joint statement that gave birth to the infamous backstop at paragraph 49 was touted as a big political win by the Irish Government over the UK.  The language used by the Taoiseach at the time made the backstop toxic to some MPs and went some way to souring relations between the UK and Ireland.  We have been dealing with the consequences of that mistake ever since.<br/><br/>I am glad that this legislation has finally being published and that the Government is at last not assuming an orderly Brexit and that everything will be all right on the night.  We just do not know if that will be the case.  Whereas Brexit is not of Ireland&rsquo;s making, we are, unfortunately, central to it.  The UK is our nearest neighbour and traditionally our largest trading partner, and our countries are bound together by our often difficult past and tied to each other's future because of the common travel area and as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.  Ireland and the UK joined the European Union together in 1973 and the relationship between our two islands has been shaped and governed by European Union membership ever since.  We took for granted the structures that were put in place by the EU that provided for regular interaction between the Taoiseach and British Prime Minister of the day and various Ministers from both jurisdictions.  We have become accustomed to the EU way of doing business and the UK leaving the EU will fundamentally change how our islands interact and work together.  We now have to find another mechanism by which our two Governments and countries can maintain our relationship and continue to work together.  Fianna F&aacute;il has proposed a Nordic-style council of ministers and believes no time should be wasted post Brexit to put this new structure in place.  Given how strained relations have become as a result of the Brexit process, we will have work to do to mend those relations and strengthen them for the future.<br/><br/>In the event of a no-deal Brexit, this Bill will address some of the most fundamental issues and will, as much as is feasible, maintain the <i>status quo</i>.  The Bill spans a number of different Departments and over the course of the debate my party's various spokespersons will address each of their areas of competence covered by the Bill.  We welcome that reciprocal health arrangements will be maintained as this was of particular concern to patients living around the Border who may have been precluded from accessing their geographically closest hospital for treatment.  We welcome that an agreement has been reached that formalises the pre-existing common travel area social protection arrangements in a legally-binding agreement signed on 1 February.  We welcome that this Bill ensures that cross-Border bus services will be maintained to ensure connectivity across communities.  We also welcome the provisions relating to electricity supply licences to facilitate the continuing operation of the single electricity market and we welcome the measures that strengthen Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s capacity to support through the Brexit process client companies that may have become exposed and vulnerable.  This flexibility is much needed and will remove some of the barriers and red tape companies can face in obtaining credit.  We welcome also the provisions relating to third level institutions and the maintenance of the current arrangements with the UK to facilitate students from both islands continuing to study across both islands.<br/><br/>While these measures are welcome, we must be very clear in this House and, more importantly, with the public that this is emergency legislation and it will not fully protect Ireland or its economy in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  There will be an immediate disruption to financial markets.  A fall in sterling would harm our competitiveness.  Several sectors will be particularly exposed and will immediately need significantly more support and assistance than the Government has offered to date.  Over the longer term we would see a reduction in economic growth and a reduction in the level of output.  According to Department of Finance projections, a disorderly Brexit would result in a substantial slowdown in gross domestic product growth to 2.7% in 2019 from an estimated 4.2% in the 2019 budget, and the modest surplus projected for 2020 would instead become a deficit.  Over a ten-year period, the level of Irish output could be reduced by approximately 6%, employment would increase more slowly and the unemployment rate could rise by 2%, which translates to between 40,000 and 50,000 job losses.  That, in turn, would impact on the public finances.  To put it mildly, there is no good news in Brexit.<br/><br/>Certain sectors are particularly exposed to Brexit.  Our agrifood industry, for example, could be decimated in a no-deal Brexit because it is particularly reliant on the UK market.  In 2017, agrifood exports to the UK were valued at approximately &euro;5.2 billion, with 48% of our beef exports going to the United Kingdom and 21% of our dairy exports, including 46% of cheddar cheese exports.  Almost 100% of mushrooms go there.  There are up to 300,000 people employed both directly and indirectly in this sector in the country and the grim reality is that a no-deal Brexit would result in job losses in this sector.  There is very little in this Bill to prevent this.<br/><br/>Last week, there were reports that in a no-deal scenario the UK would open its market to South American beef.  This would be nothing short of a catastrophe for our beef industry and it would have a devastating effect on all our farmers.</p><p>If this comes to pass and Irish beef is forced to compete in the UK market against cheaper imports from other countries, jobs, many of which are in rural Ireland, will be lost.  It was really concerning to read reports last week from the UK that some British politicians were seeking to exploit this concern from Ireland around our beef market in the hope we would compromise on the backstop.  It was disappointing to see tactics of this nature emerge and I hope they have been put to bed.  It is wise to remember that there will come a time when Brexit is behind us and we have to be able to trust and work with each other.  In response to this, the T&aacute;naiste said last week that the European Commission will support and protect a sector to ensure that it survives.  While warm words are welcome, this industry needs to know the facts and figures.  It needs assistance now and needs to know that a concrete guarantee will be in place afterwards relating to resources, financial and otherwise.  I have consistently asked the Government to provide the farming sector with details regarding the financial aid package that will be available on 30 March should the worst happen.  We need to ensure that regardless of whatever aid is made available, it goes directly to the producer and that the farmer is not at the back of the queue.<br/><br/>Moreover, we cannot lose sight of the fact that whatever the outcome of Brexit, orderly or disorderly, it will ultimately result in change, and while the magnitude of this change is not yet identified, industries, businesses and SMEs will need additional supports in the short, medium and long term to help them adapt to a new trading environment that sees the UK outside of the EU and considered a third country.  While the measures in this Bill relating to Enterprise Ireland are welcome, we need more detail on how the Government plans to support businesses and industries in the weeks, months and years ahead.  There has been far too much of a wait and see approach from Government.  Now is the time for specifics.<br/><br/>From the date of the referendum result, Fianna F&aacute;il has called on the Government to prepare for all Brexit scenarios.  Time and again, we asked the Government to publish its contingency plans and to be prepared for what is one of the gravest threats we have ever faced.  At times, when the Government did not like our line of questioning, it accused us of playing politics with Brexit, but that was neither true nor fair.  We were, and are, simply trying to protect our country and our interests and do our job in opposition.  It is no secret that while we have broadly supported the Government's negotiating stance, we have been critical of its domestic preparedness, and I make no apology for that.  As the main Opposition party spokesperson, it is my job to ask the difficult questions and to hold Government to account.  The Government has been far too quick to accuse the Opposition of acting against the country's interests when we simply ask legitimate questions of Government policy and strategy.  Only yesterday, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, together with the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, launched the first in a series of customs training workshops which are being delivered for the Government by the local enterprise offices, LEOs.  This exemplifies the tardiness with which the Government has approached its domestic preparations for Brexit.  Why are these workshops only being launched now with just over 30 days to go until 29 March?  Why did the Government not act sooner in terms of providing these workshops?  These are legitimate questions and the Government should not shy away from answering them.<br/><br/>Throughout this entire Brexit process, the issue of the Border has loomed large over the debate.  The possible reintroduction of a border on this island is causing serious anxiety across Border communities and the issue remains unresolved.  There is a withdrawal agreement between the EU and the UK negotiation teams, and within that agreement there is a solution to the Border, namely, the backstop.  However, this remains one of the key barriers to getting the deal ratified in the UK Parliament and the UK is seeking to change the backstop or drop it from the agreement.  If the deal is not ratified, then we do not have a backstop and we remain without a solution to the Irish Border issue.  I listen and take heed when the head of the PSNI warns that the reinstatement of any Border infrastructure on this island would run a serious risk of a return to violence.  I sincerely hope that British politicians listen to this warning too.  A Border is not just a barrier to trade.  It represents partition and harks back to a dark past on this island that we want to leave in the past.<br/><br/>Like everyone in this House, Fianna F&aacute;il will not accept a reintroduction of a Border on this island but we are concerned about what happens in a no-deal scenario.  This Bill does not address this issue and we have no clarity on how the Government intends to protect the Single Market and the Union's customs code in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  We have been told that difficult conversations must be had, but what does that mean in practice?  When pushed on the issue, the T&aacute;naiste went as far as to say there might be checks in the sea somewhere, but that does not exactly provide any clarity to anybody in this House.  More than once, I have asked whether any contingency planning for a hard border has been done by the Government and I have been told &quot;No&quot;.  I have to take this answer in good faith and accept this to be the case.  However, I do not think it is credible to suggest that no conversations have taken place whatsoever around what might happen in the event of a no-deal Brexit.<br/><br/>It is accepted that if the UK crashes out and becomes a third country, there must be checks somewhere on goods coming in from the UK, but we have yet to see anything from Government on how it plans to deal with this.  While the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is clearly in the dark on this issue, I have to assume that at the very least, the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste have had this conversation.  I would be concerned by any suggestion that we might have checks imposed on Irish goods entering the EU mainland through France or elsewhere because we might be seen a as back door to a third country and will not permit checks here.  This would effectively remove the benefits of the Single Market from Irish exporters and we do not want to see this happening.  I sincerely hope, therefore, that the Government and the huge team of experienced civil servants working on this have a plan in place in the event that the worst happens.<br/><br/>This omnibus Bill is only one element of our preparations for Brexit but it is an important piece of the puzzle and will go some way towards ensuring we maintain the <i>status quo</i>in key areas in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  The fact we have set aside essentially all parliamentary time by agreement of the House to get this legislation passed shows the commitment of all Deputies to doing what we can to protect our country and get the legislation through.  There is no doubt that Ireland is in a vulnerable and precarious position and we need to up our game in terms of preparations.  It is clear we can no longer afford to have all our eggs in the basket of getting a deal over the line.<br/><br/>As painful as this process has been to date, arguably the most difficult part is yet to come.  We are still only at the state of negotiating the UK's exit from the EU.  We have yet to begin negotiating the future trading arrangement between the EU and the UK.  This will be by far the most important part for Ireland, and arguably it could deal with the Border issue as well.  The future arrangement we will negotiate beyond the UK's withdrawal agreement is the agreement that will govern our relationship with the UK in a post-Brexit world for decades to come.  To think that we are only at the stage of negotiating the UK's exit and have yet to start negotiating the future trading arrangements should provide for some sobering thinking.  We have a long way to go in the Brexit process.<br/><br/>I assure our citizens and those listening to the debate that Fianna F&aacute;il will do whatever needs to be done in the national interest to help our country navigate Brexit.  As an Oireachtas, all of us working together have shown incredible maturity in ensuring that our country has the stability it needs to navigate Brexit in the difficult weeks and months ahead.  It is clear to me that Brexit will be with us for many years to come, but our hope is that in the weeks and months ahead, we can find a stable place and ensure that we get a deal over the line so that the UK exits the EU in an orderly fashion and we can then proceed to the real task, which is negotiating a future trading relationship with the UK and the EU that serves Ireland's interests and ensures we protect our citizens, economy, farmers and business community.  I look forward to listening to the debate.  My party and I will do everything we can to ensure that the legislation is passed in a timely manner.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-26a.314" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="18:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022600031#FF00200"><p>This omnibus Bill is the bare minimum needed in terms of Brexit planning.  It is a steady state solution that does not plan adequately for the economic consequences of a hard crash-out of the EU by the UK.  This is despite the fact that the Bill is being portrayed as a comprehensive response to the disruption Brexit will bring.  However, it does not engage with the realities that many businesses and citizens will face.  A no-deal Brexit would lead to 50,000 job losses in the first year.  That is according to data from the State and all of the think tanks that have looked at the economic consequences of Brexit.  Where are the provisions for this potential disaster?  The majority of these job losses will be in the agrifood sector, yet the Bill is silent on this.</p>  <p>  Brexit does not just affect businesses.  It will affect communities and people, and any Brexit strategy worth its salt needs to reflect and address this reality.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes in a dual strategy for dealing with a no-deal Brexit.  The first is to mitigate its effects in the short term through State measures.  The second is to overcome any disruption through medium to long-term investment in capital and social infrastructure.</p>  <p>  In terms of the North, the Taoiseach has consistently stated that there will be no hardening of the Border and that our agreements must be protected.</p><p>We accept and acknowledge those statements from the Taoiseach.  Instead of a hard border, people North and South should be given the opportunity to remove the Border once and for all.  That is the democratic thing to do and it is also the right thing to do.  Partition has failed; it has failed for our country.  Brexit has shown that the British Parliament has not acted and will not act in the interests of Ireland.  The people of the North voted to stay in the European Union and we want to ensure that the entire island does so.  Therefore, it is not only prudent but imperative that the Government begins to plan to give effect to the promise of the Good Friday Agreement, to plan for a referendum and to plan to win that referendum.</p> <p> Why does the Government close its mind to any planning on Irish unity?  We call for a forum to be established to have a discussion on how we plan the transition to Irish unity and the Government says "No".  We call for the Government to bring forward a White Paper to set out the stepping stones necessary to create a united Ireland and the Government says "No".  It is part of the Good Friday Agreement.  If the Government wants to deliver on all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, it has to recognise the holding of a Border poll to unite this country is one part of that.</p> <p> This omnibus Bill is being presented as what the State needs to do to protect itself in the event of a hard crash-out.  However, the biggest issue facing the State and the island of Ireland if there is a hard crash-out is what happens at the Border.  We do not accept all of those problems can be solved in an omnibus Bill but we do say the Government is closing its mind to the most obvious solution which is available to the Irish people, North and South, in the event of a hard crash-out, the application of World Trade Organization rules and the chaos for businesses, farmers and citizens either side of the Border.  Why are the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il afraid of Irish unity, afraid of having a debate on Irish unity and afraid even to plan for Irish unity without taking any practical steps?  The T&aacute;naiste can account for that for his party and Fianna F&aacute;il can account for itself.  Again, this is why we call on the Government to convene a forum to begin planning for Irish unity.</p> <p> We met the T&aacute;naiste and his colleagues to discuss the Bill.  We will engage constructively to work with them to progress the Bill but also to strengthen it.  We will be seeking clarification on some matters to ensure that the Bill is fit for purpose and adequately addresses the full range of issues thrown up by a no-deal Brexit.  While we will not be seeking to delay any necessary legislation, we will not be giving the Government a blank cheque.  We support most of the provisions of this Bill.  Those Deputies who represent Border counties know that those provisions are necessary.  They are the bare minimum but they are necessary to ensure continued access to services in health and education, and to ensure the all-island economy, all-island public transport and all-island energy are protected.  All of that is absolutely necessary, which we accept.</p> <p> While we do not have a quarrel with the T&aacute;naiste or the Government in regard to many provisions of the Bill, we will certainly seek to expand on them.  However, we do not believe the Bill does enough to invest in the Irish economy, to support small to medium size businesses or to make sure we protect ordinary citizens from the worst effects of Brexit.  I have to point out that, in whatever form it takes, Brexit is going to bring about economic shocks and turbulence for Ireland.  Obviously, that turbulence will be greater if there is a no-deal scenario.  One of the quarrels we have with the Government is that, whatever form Brexit takes, businesses need to be supported, and it is not just in the case of a hard crash-out.  There are many exporting businesses, many in the agrifood sector and many in other sectors of the economy who are struggling as we speak because of currency fluctuations.  Yet, there are no hard, tangible, practical solutions, measures, investments or supports, financial or otherwise, in this Bill that would give any comfort to those businesses.</p> <p> The Bill covers the Departments of Health, Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Education and Skills, Finance, Transport, Tourism and Sport, Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Taoiseach and Justice and Equality.  While the range of issues covered gives the impression that this is a comprehensive Bill, in reality, there is a simple and necessary theme and objective that runs through it.  Overall, the purpose of the Bill is to allow certain Departments to treat Britain as if it is a treaty country in the event of a no-deal Brexit, and this applies to the North as well.  It is to avoid Britain becoming, in certain aspects of Irish law and policy, a third country.  We are going to spend five or six days discussing this Bill but, in essence, that is the purpose and objective of the Bill, and we support that.  The one major exception is in regard to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, to which I will return later.</p> <p> In the area of health, for example, the Government proposes to amend the Health Act 1970 and the Health Act 2004 to enable healthcare arrangements to be maintained between Ireland and Britain, including reimbursement arrangements, in the case of a no-deal Brexit.  The common travel area facilitates access to health services in both states, including access to emergency, routine and planned care, and the Bill seeks to put in place an appropriate legal framework in the Irish state to ensure the continuation of the common travel area arrangements in respect of healthcare.  In terms of student supports, the Bill proposes to ensure continuity of the current commitments to maintaining the rights and privileges bestowed by the common travel area and eligibility for SUSI grants, even in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  Again, in terms of continuity, we have a section on cross-Border bus services, an amendment to the Harbours Act and amendments to the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984 in order to protect workers where an insolvency happens.</p> <p> In all of this, there is nothing new being proposed, which, when we think about it, is quite strange as Brexit will be very new and is going to be durable and lasting for the people of this State, for businesses in this State and for citizens, not just in this State, but across the island.  While it is important to ensure continuity, it is also important to ensure preparedness for the discontinuity Brexit brings with it.  That is just common sense.</p> <p> The one area where the omnibus Bill delves into this is in the section on business supports.  The Government proposes a series of amendments to the Industrial Development Acts 1986 to 2014.  These will give Enterprise Ireland the power to offer enhanced support to companies involved in research and development.  It will also allow Enterprise Ireland to lend, participate in certain types of follow-on investments and ensure the organisation can apply for Government approval for individual investment amounts on loans in excess of &euro;7.5 million.  These measures differ from those originally proposed in the heads of Bill, especially around the need to extend state aid rules to normal EU levels.</p> <p> When Deputy Quinlivan and I discussed this, we were taken aback, to say the least, that the Government does not already avail of the flexibility in regard to state aid rules in these areas.  We find it truly shocking that the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation currently operates under state aid caps that are self-imposed by the State.  These were in place during the economic crash, when businesses needed to be supported.  They were still in place as many of those businesses, over the course of the last couple of years, were deeply affected by the uncertainty that Brexit presented due to the currency fluctuations to which those sectors were exposed.  Why was that the case?  What the Bill is missing and what the Government has not yet spelled out is where is the flexibility in regard to state aid rules.  The EU needs to understand that the Irish economy is the most exposed as a consequence of Brexit.  If there is a hard crash-out, it is going to be a disaster for the Irish economy.  We all accept that and we all, as much as we can, want to do whatever we can to avoid a hard crash-out.  While I still believe that is the most unlikely outcome, we could find ourselves in that position more by accident than by design.  We need Europe to step up to the plate, not just in regard to giving us protections in regard to the backstop, which is necessary and for which we are thankful, but also in giving greater flexibility to the Government in the application of the fiscal rules and state aid rules in order for it to properly support, in very practical and tangible ways, the sectors of the economy that will be most exposed.</p> <p> Last month, Sinn F&eacute;in launched a comprehensive Brexit contingency plan.  Again, I was taken aback by the spokesperson for Fianna F&aacute;il, who seems to think it is its job to hold Sinn F&eacute;in to account for the failures.  Every single time we hear Fianna F&aacute;il make a speech, it is to attack Sinn F&eacute;in.  One would think we were responsible for Brexit failures and the problems in health and housing.</p><p>Fianna F&aacute;il has produced no plan of its own.  It has no Brexit contingency plan and was relying almost solely on the Government's plan.  Yet, Fianna F&aacute;il comes in to critique it.  We have launched a Brexit contingency plan because we know we need to invest.  There needs to be investment in capital spending, in supporting business and in ensuring commercial exporters are properly protected.  We also need to invest in supporting all of the regions, some of which, such as the south east, will be deeply exposed as a consequence of Brexit. </p> <p> Brexit will mean a structural change in the Irish economy.  It going to be one of the biggest market distortions to impact on Irish businesses.  The Government also needs to understand that Brexit will not be solved by market solutions alone.  State intervention is needed.  There needs to be State support and investment.  Where is the investment?  Where is the additional capital spending on ports, for example?  Where is the additional capital spending on public transport?  Where are the additional, hard, practical and tangible supports for businesses that need them?  The Government is tinkering around the edges in this Bill with grants for research and development for companies.  That is reverting to what current state aid rules allow anyway.  There are, however, no real practical proposals to give businesses the supports necessary.  We have engaged and worked with a number of different stakeholders.  We met with IBEC, ISME and the British Irish Chamber of Commerce.  All of those organisations are stating that what is needed is a loosening of state aid rules.  They also state that what is missing from this Bill are practical proposals for businesses.</p> <p> Those organisations also recognise the need to invest in the Irish economy.  The only way to protect this economy from the worst effects of Brexit is to invest.  There is no investment of additional capital spending in public transport.  We also have ports that need to be supported.  I gave the example previously of the ports in Rosslare and Waterford.  There is also a need to invest in the ports in Cork, the T&aacute;naiste's constituency, in Shannon Foynes and other parts of the country.  That is necessary to ensure every region in this State, and on the island of Ireland, is in a position to have connectivity with Europe if there is a hard Brexit.  There is nothing of substance in this Bill, however, that deals with any of those measures.  Much more needs to be done to protect the Irish economy.</p> <p> I return to the topic of the North and the Border.  I fully accept we cannot deal with the real and mammoth challenge a no-deal Brexit will create for people who use services on either side of the Border and businesses that use and depend on the all-island economy.  We represent the vast majority of nationalists in the North, despite what might be thought from listening to some of the voices from the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il.  They vote for us because we understand where they are at and we understand their needs.</p> <p> We understand they are concerned about what will happen if there is a hard Brexit and what will then happen with the Border.  We have no inkling from the Government about what will happen.  We know the obvious.  World Trade Organization rules will kick in and there will be disruption.  In that scenario, everybody accepts there will be a hardening of the Border.  The Government, however, is putting its fingers in its ears and pretending there is no problem.  It is a real problem.  The Government needs to spell out to people who live on both sides of the Border what will happen in that scenario.  It is not good enough to state we can sort this out afterwards.  People need to be given some sense as to what will happen.</p> <p> It is reasonable and responsible for politicians on the island of Ireland to plan for the most obvious outcome in the event of a hard Brexit.  That is a Border poll on Irish unity.  Why is the T&aacute;naiste so afraid to have that discussion?  The Government is surely aware of the opinion polls which show that in the event of a hard Brexit a majority of people North and South would opt for the entire island remaining in the European Union as a unified country with no Border.  That would be instead of the chaos of continued partition, where one part of the island would be inside the customs union and Single Market and the other part of the island would be outside.  That is where the disruption and chaos will come from.  There is an obvious way to end that disruption and chaos.</p> <p> I will finish by stating we welcome the publication of this Bill.  We also welcome the provisions which are necessary and will be helpful to citizens who use services.  We accept we have to plan for the worst case scenario.  We are hopeful.  I acknowledge the T&aacute;naiste recognised the efforts of the Opposition in helping get to the point where we had a withdrawal agreement, a protocol and an insurance policy for Ireland.  That is what we want.  We want to avoid any hardening of the Border.  We wanted the withdrawal agreement to be passed.  We want a solution that protects the interests of the people on this island.  It does not suit anybody if we have a hard Brexit.</p> <p> It does not suit people in the North, the South, in Britain or in Europe.  We do, however, have to plan for every eventuality.  We do not believe the Government has done that in respect of certain sectors of the Irish economy which need to be supported.  The Government, therefore, needs to come up with more practical proposals for businesses and farmers.  There have been repeated promises that such protections will be coming from Europe and that Europe will give a package of supports to the farming community and the agrifood sector.  We have not seen them.  They have not arrived.  We have the Government&rsquo;s Bill and none of it deals with those issues.</p></speech>

This State, and every member state, is planning for a no-deal Brexit.  We are being told these are the contingencies.  On the other hand, we are also being told that there might be some solutions down the road for the agrifood business and farmers.  They have not seen them, however.  We have also not seen any bespoke solutions for this State to be able to ease the rules on state aid.  Europe needs to do much more to protect the Irish economy.  I am not just referring to the backstop but the Irish economy as a whole.</p>  <p>  We welcome the publication of this Bill.  We will work with the Government and the T&aacute;naiste to get this Bill passed as quickly as possible.  The nine spokespeople for Sinn F&eacute;in, in respect of the relevant Departments, are working on amendments and supporting the sections of the Bill that we can.  We will not delay the passage of this Bill.  We will support it as best we can to make sure it goes through as quickly as possible.  We are sincere, however, when we say that it does not go far enough in many areas.  It is underwhelming regarding practical supports for the vulnerable sectors of the Irish economy.  Much more needs to be done to ensure more supports are provided, no matter what form Brexit takes, whether hard or soft.  Those supports are not in this Bill, unfortunately.</p></speech>

I am not sure I can ever recall debating a Bill, introduced by the Government, that everybody in the House wants to ensure never actually comes into effect.  We are all hoping for an alternative outcome.  This underscores the unique and bizarre situation that has come to pass since the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union.</p>  <p>  We need to address many issues that are non-legislative.  Some of those have been touched upon by other speakers.  We will have to address those matters outside of the scope of this legislation.  The Bill, however, does cover many areas.  I want to focus on the economic side of the legislation.  The major concern of this Bill is to allow the continuation of trade with the United Kingdom as smoothly as possible.  Clearly, however, as we all recognise, it will never be as smooth as with countries that are actually full members of the European Union.  That underlines a central truth missing in recent years from the debate on the European Union in the United Kingdom.</p><p>Modern trade is managed, regulated and organised through international agreements and legislation.  It is a point that is worth stressing.  Diehard supporters of Brexit in the UK seem to entertain a fantasy of unregulated trade.  Whether it relates to the type of free trade deal they wish to have with the EU or to trading under WTO rules, they apparently assume that trade agreements are simply about opening up markets, as opposed to regulating the flow of goods and services entering markets and regulating ongoing economic activity.<br/><br/>Trade policy with respect to the UK has been a settled matter since the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement of 1965, followed eight years later by our entry into the European Economic Community.  The 1965 agreement expanded on the 1938 Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement.  This historical perspective is important to remind us that if and when the UK leaves the EU without a trade deal it will bring about a situation we have not had to deal with in decades.  Hopefully, it will not happen now and the EU and UK will conclude a comprehensive trade agreement whereby something close to free trade with the UK will continue.  In fact, we can be clear that our preference would be for the British people to be allowed to reconsider if this is what they want in light of all the new information that is now available.  We hope the UK could yet remain in the Union.<br/><br/>However, the legislation we are examining is designed, in part, to prepare for a no-deal outcome.  If that happens, we have to be ready for a period of time &ndash; hopefully, a short one &ndash; in which we do not have a trade agreement with the UK for the first time in decades and have to rely on WTO rules.  The WTO's multilateral trading system is founded on five basic principles, namely, trade without discrimination, gradually freer trade through negotiation, predictability, promoting fair competition, and encouraging development and economic reform.  Built on those foundations, WTO trade agreements are complex documents, covering a wide range of detail relevant to each and every sector of the economy.  Crucially for our purposes today, the Bill must be consistent with WTO rules.  We cannot legislate for post-Brexit trade with the UK in a way that contradicts our own commitments, as well as British commitments, under the WTO agreements.<br/><br/>Trade without discrimination is one of those WTO principles.  That means that Ireland and the UK - indeed the entire EU and the UK - cannot alter the basic rules of trade that we offer any other country trading under WTO rules.  These are important principles.  In the absence of a formal trade deal with the UK, Ireland cannot have more favourable trading arrangements with the UK than with any other WTO member state.  In future, the EU can, and hopefully will, have a comprehensive trade agreement with the UK.  If the withdrawal agreement currently before the UK Parliament is passed, we will continue to have free trade as part of the agreed transition period.  However if there is a hard Brexit on 29 March, or if the UK enters a transition period but fails to conclude a trade deal with the EU, we will find ourselves trading under WTO rules.<br/><br/>The Government&rsquo;s legislation seems to prepare for this for the most part but I question Part 6.  I hope the T&aacute;naiste will deal with this in his response.  Under Article 2 of the WTO's General Agreement on Trade in Services, GATS, each member must immediately and unconditionally give other members treatment that is &quot;no less favourable than that it accords to like services and service suppliers of any other country&quot;.  Part 6 treats the UK as a member of the EU, the European Economic Area, EEA or the European Free Trade Association, EFTA, for most, if not all, tax purposes.  British companies, shares, trusts, insurers, residents, ships, colleges and so on will all benefit from this status.  This is presumably done to preserve the <i>status quo </i>in trade insofar as it gives rise to taxable consequences here.  However, other third countries and their companies, insurers, residents, ships and so on do not get these benefits.  The Bill proposes to give them exclusively to the UK. <br/><br/>This appears to be preferential tax treatment extended to just one so-called &quot;third country&quot; and not available to others.  I am sure the answer to my question to the T&aacute;naiste has been comprehensively teased out.  Is this compatible with our obligations under the GATS treaty?  If not, what is the alternative?  It would be much easier for Irish businesses if we could proceed as outlined in Part 6, as this would mean less disruption, but it is our job as legislators to stress-test this legislation.  As others have said, we only got sight of it last Friday, despite the fact that it is a comprehensive Bill with such important ramifications.  There will be some teasing out to be done as we read, re-read and get advice on the various component parts.  It would cause even more disruption to business if Part 6 was ruled to be in breach of our obligations under the GATS treaty and subsequently needed to be changed.  I look forward to hearing the T&aacute;naiste's explanation of how he and the Attorney General believe Part 6 is compatible with the WTO rules I have outlined to the House. <br/><br/>On a different issue, I wish to raise a matter of constitutional concern in the Bill.  Brexit legislation in Westminster has relied heavily on what are euphemistically called &quot;Henry VIII clauses&quot;.  These clauses confer a delegated power under which a Minister may amend primary legislation by secondary legislation.  A ministerial order, therefore, can amend a British Act of Parliament.  The British Government can do that under the UK's constitutional arrangements.  This reverses the usual rule that legislative power is vested in the legislature.  These clauses have been controversial in the UK, but in our own context such clauses would be unconstitutional.  They are constitutionally prohibited except where necessitated by EU membership.  In such cases they already been permitted by referendum.<br/><br/>The Department of Health is seeking to create a Henry VIII clause in the Bill.  Whether or not it has drawn inspiration from the UK's legislation, the Government will need to rethink this section of the Bill.  Under Part 2, the Government has proposed to give the Minister for Health power to make &quot;such adaptations and modifications to the Health Acts 1947 to 2019 or any regulations made under those Acts as the Minister considers necessary for the purpose of bringing those Acts or regulations into conformity with this Part&quot;.</p><p>This would clearly involve the Minister for Health amending primary legislation without bringing it back for determination in the D&aacute;il.<br/><br/>The specific section where the power is described is section 4, which proposes to insert section 75B(2)(c) into the Health Act 1970.  I believe this to be unconstitutional.  Under Article 15 of the Constitution, the &quot;sole and exclusive&quot; law-making power of the State is vested in the Oireachtas.  As a result, regulations that modify primary legislation are necessarily beyond the authority of Ministers.<br/><br/>In a 1999 legal case, Laurentiu <i>v.</i>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, counsel for the State conceded that power to amend primary legislation could not be delegated by the Oireachtas to any other body.  Specifically, the Oireachtas &quot;is constitutionally prohibited from abdicating its own power&quot; and &quot;in accordance with the democratic basis of the Constitution, it is the people&rsquo;s representatives who make the law, who determine the principles and policies&quot;.<br/><br/>Chief Justice Murray gave a relevant judgment in 2004, in the case of Mulcreevy <i>v.</i>Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  In that judgment he stated: </p><blockquote>It is well established that the exclusive role assigned to the Oireachtas in the making of laws by [Article 15] does not preclude the Oireachtas from empowering Ministers or other bodies to make regulations for the purpose of carrying into effect the principles and policies of the parent legislation. [&hellip;] But it is also clear [this is the important point] that such delegated legislation cannot make, repeal or amend any law and that, to the extent that the parent Act purports to confer such a power, it will be invalid having regard to the provisions of the Constitution.</blockquote><p>The sole exception to this rule is in the European Communities Act 1972, which enables a Minister by regulations to amend an EU directive.  The power to make regulations under that Act has been held to be necessitated by the obligations of membership of the European Union and therefore immune from constitutional challenge.<br/><br/>I have raised what might be regarded as two technical matters.  This is largely technical legislation but they are both issues of major consequence to the robustness of the Bill and the importance of the transposition and carrying on of health matters in one case and of other matters in the second case I have mentioned.  They pose serious questions about whether the Government&rsquo;s legislation has been sufficiently considered before it was presented to the D&aacute;il.<br/><br/>I agree with the points made by other speakers that it is very late in the day for us to have sight of such monumental legislation with such far-reaching import.  For all of us to have a mere weekend to read it, and get our legal advisers to read it, is very short notice.  To have then literally a week to debate it on Second Stage in principle and to have questions and queries responded to before we go into committee week is a tight deadline.<br/><br/>I want to come back to the substantive issue of the overall Bill.  This Bill is designed to prepare our Statute Book for a disorderly exit of the UK from the EU.  It is equally designed to prepare us for the possibility that the UK and the EU will be unable to conclude a comprehensive free trade agreement in the time available even if the existing withdrawal agreement is passed.<br/><br/>I will quote the then Taoiseach in the debate on the trade agreement that ended the six-year Anglo-Irish trade war in 1938.  &Eacute;amon de Valera stated: &quot;One of the things, then, that makes this Agreement possible is that you have at this moment in England a Conservative Government that can, in Parliament, make its will effective.&quot;  Our problem today is that the withdrawal agreement, including the Ireland-Northern Ireland protocol known as the backstop, has been paralysed by a British Parliament that is deeply and hopelessly divided on the issue of the European Union.  Prime Minister May's Conservative Party Government is internally divided.  Even if it was not, it is incapable of making its will effective in Westminster in the way referenced by the then Taoiseach, &Eacute;amon de Valera, in 1938.<br/><br/>The net result is that we have to be careful not to assume that we can make sensible or purely technical administrative agreements with the UK once it has left the Union.  I know that is at the back of much of what the T&aacute;naiste has aimed to do.  It is likely to be the case that if the UK leaves the Union without a deal, there will be serious economic consequences for it, which will quickly will lead to a sour political atmosphere there, even sourer than the one that currently prevails, and, whatever we feel about it, it is likely that Ireland will be blamed, especially by those Brexiteers who have lied to the British people about the EU for years and who have lied about the fantasy of unregulated open trade with everybody and anybody after Brexit.<br/><br/>If we need to use this legislation, due to the UK leaving the EU without a deal, we are also likely to be in a situation that is unfriendly, if not actively hostile, to the development of bilateral agreements on administrative matters.  I applaud the efforts of Deputies who said they would all hold hands and have a Nordic council but I fear that in a disorderly Brexit there will be great animosity.  These administrative matters will be hugely important.  They are important to Irish patients in British hospitals who need to access health care without incurring significant personal costs.  They are equally important to British patients who avail of the Irish healthcare system.  These administrative matters will affect Irish students in British universities.  They will affect commuters crossing the Border on buses and trains.  People do not expect to have to think about all of the background law and regulations that allow them to get on with normal living.  It is important that we get our legislation in order so that the level of disruption to people's lives can be minimised.<br/><br/>I want to conclude by inviting the Government to explain how it intends to deal with the issues and problems I have set out but also with other issues that have yet to emerge and that have not been anticipated.  Even the complexity of this Bill is nothing compared to the complexity of Brexit itself.  What processes will be put in place to allow for a rapid response when gaps in laws and regulations are identified that have not been thought of by any of us when this law is enacted?  Presumably, a permanent Brexit unit will need to be established to keep all of these issues under constant review as we move into the unknown waters of Brexit.</p></speech>

I want to start on the issue of jobs.  Estimates that a no-deal Brexit could result in 40,000 job losses could prove to be conservative, according to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe.  It is an absolute priority that jobs are protected.  How can this best be done?  What is the best model for protecting jobs?</p>  <p>  Let us start by looking at what the Bill provides for.  Among other things, this Bill provides for, first, Enterprise Ireland to lend up to &euro;7.5 million to a company without having to consult the Government and more than that if it has the Government's permission; second, Enterprise Ireland to invest up to &euro;7.5 million in a company without having to consult the Government and more than that with its permission; third, an array of increased grants to companies for research; and, fourth, grant aid to the horticulture industry over and above its eligibility for Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine grants.  It is a kind of bailout model which would see the State providing aid to the private sector.</p>  <p>  A number of questions arise.  Will the companies have to open their books for inspection before receiving aid?  Will conditions of state aid be that a company guarantees that there will not be any job losses, it will not cut wages, it will comply with environmental standards and it will recognise trade unions?</p><p>In other words, will a company be allowed to receive state aid and then cut jobs or cut wages?<br/><br/>I am totally in favour of saving jobs.  I am in favour of state aid to save jobs but I am also in favour of doing it on a different basis.  Medium or large size enterprises that need state aid in this crisis should be taken into State ownership.  In other words, they should be nationalised.  Of course, when the banks were nationalised ten year's ago, they did not serve the people.  They shut branches, axed jobs and hammered mortgage holders.  Their boards were stuffed with establishment figures.  There should be no establishment figures this time.  Nationalisation in this crisis should be done on the basis of workers' control and workers' management.  These nationalisations should guarantee job protection, protection of wage rates, the highest environmental standards and trade union rights.<br/><br/>Retailers from the Republic, Northern Ireland and Britain joined forces last week to warn that the price of everyday food items could jump by up to 45% in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  The director of Retail Ireland, Mr. Thomas Burke said:</p><blockquote>Regardless of the type of Brexit agreed over the coming weeks, retailers will see an increase in their operating costs arising from checks at ports and other supply chain disruption.  In the current operating environment, these additional costs simply cannot be absorbed and will have to be passed on to the consumers in the form of higher prices.</blockquote><p>Retail Ireland represents the interests of the big chains.  I do not believe that the big chains simply cannot absorb increased costs.  To take just one example, pre-tax profits soared by almost 800% to just under &pound;1.3 billion at Tesco in the period from February 2017 to February 2018.  I can state with a degree of certainty that Tesco can absorb increased costs better than a household on the average industrial wage or a household on not much more than the minimum wage for that matter.  I would say to the Tescos of this world that if they try to increase prices by anything remotely resembling the kind of figures mentioned last week, they will need to prepare for protest outside of the shops.  I will be there myself, along with many others I suspect.  If they want to take that as a warning that is fine because that is exactly what it is.  Furthermore, the trade union movement should take action to ensure that wages are not undermined by price increases.  Wages should either be linked to prices or the State should act to freeze prices.  The unions need to put this Government under real pressure on this issue.<br/><br/>We know the red lines laid down by the Tory government.  We know the red lines laid down by nationalism and unionism.  It is time for the labour movement to lay down its red lines.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions needs to convene a conference as a matter of urgency to bring together every working class activist on the island of Ireland to discuss these matters alongside workers' representatives from England, Scotland and Wales.  Delegates from trade unions, representatives from workplaces and genuine cross-community groups should all be invited.  No to job losses and price increases, no to wage cuts and no to sectarian division.  Yes to nationalisation to save jobs, yes to action against price increases and yes to the unity of working class people in fighting to defend our jobs, conditions and futures.  These are the red lines the working class movement needs to discuss and to act on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-26a.324" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="18:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022600036#LL00200"><p>The most important issue facing this country in the event of a no-deal Brexit is the threat of a hard border.  That is an issue that is not dealt with in this legislation and we still do not know from the Government what it will do in the event of a no-deal Brexit where pressure comes from either the UK or the European Union to impose a hard border.  While other considerations that are looked at in this Bill such as health, education, insurance, tax, electricity, harbours legislation, share trading and the other issues which we can go through in a minute, are very important and need to be looked at and addressed and some of them have been, to my mind all of those issues are secondary to the threat of a hard border being imposed.  If a hard border was re-erected between the North and South of this island, it would be a total disaster and it would drag us back to the very dark days of conflict and division.  It is important to say that this threat is not one that should be uniquely highlighted by those who consider themselves nationalists or republicans.  It would be a disaster for everybody from every background, every creed and every political point on the spectrum if a Border was imposed.  It would cause divisions and conflict that would be disastrous from every point of view.</p>  <p>  It is not clear to me what the Government will do in that context and it is clear to me that the other parties to this Brexit dilemma are not fully to be relied upon.  It should be a statement of the absolute obvious, given the shambles in Westminster and the rotten politics of the Tory Brexiteers, that these people cannot be trusted not to crash into a situation where they may seek to reimpose a Border.  They are obviously willing to sacrifice the best interests of this country or of peace for whatever bizarre political agenda the Tory right wing and the Tory Brexiteers are pursuing.  The danger from that quarter is obvious but there is equally a danger which has been revealed in various comments and statements made by European leaders and by some comments and statements made by our Government.  They say that we are doing everything we can to avoid a hard border, we are not making any preparations to do anything at the Border but then they say that it could be very difficult to avoid a hard border if there is a no-deal Brexit or that somehow a Border would become "inevitable" if there was a no-deal Brexit.  By that, they mean that pressure would then come on to protect the integrity of the European Single Market and that the commitment to do that would then potentially lead to the Irish Government, on behalf of the European Union, erecting a Border to protect the integrity of the European Single Market.</p>  <p>  We need to state categorically that this will not happen and it should be stated in this Bill.  We should state that under no circumstances will it happen and that this particular dilemma can be sorted out by the European Union and Britain but for our part we are not participating in any shape or form under any circumstances with the erection of a border between the North and the South and that we will actively oppose any attempt to put a border between the North and the South.  As I have said, we have heard comments from the Government itself at various times on this and we have also had a number of comments from people such as Merkel, Macron and leading figures in the European institutions saying that in order to protect the Single Market, a border might be necessary if we cannot do a deal and we can just blame Britain for that.</p><p>There is no doubt we could blame Britain and point at Britain for its recklessness, shambolic politics and the particularly rotten politics of the Tories, but the blame game is not good enough.  We need absolutely to say we will not allow a border to happen under any circumstances as a result of pressure from anybody and that we will oppose it because peace on this island is more important than the Single Market or WTO rules or anything else.  This is the most important point I want to make.<br/><br/>It does not surprise me that in recent opinion polls a majority of people in the country have expressed that they do not want to return to a hard border.  If there is any suggestion from any quarter that this might happen there should be massive protests, not, as I have said, waving tricolours, although people can wave what they like as far as I am concerned, but on the basis that it would cause divisions and create the basis for conflict.  Anybody who is progressive, who opposes sectarianism and who does not want to see a return to violence should mobilise to oppose any move towards a hard border.  To say that anything such as this being suggested or any move in this direction should mean a Border poll is a basic democratic statement.  The Government has suggested it would be dangerous or inflammatory to speak about this but to me it is a matter of basic democracy that if any suggestion of this sort was made, the people North and South should have the right to make a decision as to whether they want it to happen.  There is no doubt that if they were asked that question, they would say they do not want it to happen.  It is a basic democratic point to make and it is the view of the majority of people.<br/><br/>On the other substantial areas of the Bill, there are many provisions that are essentially trying to maintain the <i>status quo</i>in areas such as health services, which is to be welcomed, education, maintaining bus services, maintaining electricity provision and, with regard to harbours, basic practical provisions that will allow ships from Britain and Ireland to continue to land in each other's ports and other such measures.<br/><br/>I do have concerns about some of the tax measures the Government is taking to protect us on an economic basis.  As has been said by others, of course we need to move to protect jobs.  This is absolutely the case.  I worry, however, that our notion of protecting these jobs seems to focus significantly on the maintenance of tax loopholes which, frankly, are problematic in the first place.  These include research and development tax credits, which are one of the major means through which multinational corporations in this country avoid taxes.  I am concerned about this and there is potential for abuse in it.  I do not want to go from this to stating we should have a protectionist tax code, but I am concerned about potential abuses.<br/><br/>I am concerned about loans been given out to businesses where there are no guarantees about the jobs that would be retained and the standards and objectives being pursued by those private companies.  There is a complete lack of emphasis on direct public investment in infrastructure and public enterprise in the areas on the Border likely to be affected and the need for particular investment in these areas to protect industry there against the possible impact of a no-deal Brexit.  I am quite worried about these issues and I want assurances.<br/><br/>Their needs to be considerable scrutiny of tax loopholes.  I take seriously Naomi Klein's concept of disaster capitalism, in other words, never letting a good crisis go to waste.  There are certain sectors we know did this in the most recent economic crash.  Vulture funds and big international investors took advantage of the crash.  The Government facilitated them in this under the guise of stating it must act in an emergency.  It actually introduced measures that allowed vulture funds and international investors to gobble up massive amounts of Irish property assets in particular, with, in my opinion, disastrous consequences.  I am concerned there might be elements of disaster capitalism buried in the detail, especially in some of the tax loopholes and the lending facilities being proposed for IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  I am not saying this is absolutely the case but the provisions need to be seriously scrutinised.  I would like to see far more emphasis on tangible investment in infrastructure and public enterprise and the State directly protecting jobs.<br/><br/>I would like to hear precisely what is the issue with driver licences.  The licences of UK licence holders living here at present will stand as driver licences here.  There have been contradictory signals and warnings about UK driver licences not being recognised here.  This would be a problem for people from the North and Britain who have UK driver licences.  The AA has spoken about a legal patch being required but then slightly rolled back from it.  We need answers on this.  If necessary, there should be amendments to the Bill or legislation to ensure mutual recognition of driver licences is maintained.<br/><br/>In the area of health services, as well as maintaining existing cross-Border health services, it would be a very good measure on our part, and it could be included in the Bill, to offer free abortion services in the South to the women of the North.  We need to show in a positive way the need to maintain the progressive trajectory we have seen in repealing the eighth amendment and the introduction of abortion services in this country.  People will remember that at the time the talk was that the North would be next and women in the North are fighting for abortion services.  Irish women in the North would have to pay to come down here for abortion services.  We could include something in the legislation to state women in the North would be entitled to avail of abortion services in the South without charge.</p></speech>

What appeared certain until today was that Britain would leave the EU and the uncertainty was all about the when and the how and whether it would be a no-deal Brexit, a last-minute deal or an application for an extension.  New vistas are appearing daily.  Yesterday we had the British Labour Party's decision to back a second referendum to prevent a crash out.  This throws up the possibility of no Brexit if that is a proposition on the paper if the referendum goes ahead.  The T&aacute;naiste has been very strong in confirming that a disorderly Brexit would be a lose, lose, lose situation for Ireland, the UK and Europe.</p><p>Prime Minister May recently postponed the vote until 12 March.  That has been interpreted as an attempt to wind down the clock such that the withdrawal agreement is far more appealing than crashing out with no deal and the Prime Minister will be able to win a vote in the House of Commons on the matter.  The Taoiseach is of the belief that Britain will not crash out.  Yesterday, &quot;extension&quot; appeared to be the word of the day at EU and Irish level.  Today, it appeared in the vocabulary used by Prime Minister May, who promised to give members of the UK Parliament a vote on extending the Brexit negotiations or withdrawing without a deal if her plan is rejected next month.  The latest proposal is for a meaningful vote on 12 March and will include whatever additional assurances she gets from the EU.  If that proposal falls, two separate votes will take place the following day, one on a no-deal Brexit and another requesting an extension.  She now appears to be taking seriously the challenges and problems that a crash-out Brexit would bring.  I find it rather bizarre that she is acknowledging it at this stage.  Yesterday, she stated, &quot;I believe that if we have to, we will ultimately make a success of a no-deal&quot;.  However, she will also present an honest assessment of the very serious challenges presented by a no-deal Brexit.  The debate in the House of Commons has descended into a major row between the British Labour Party and the Tories over which of them has made more U-turns.<br/><br/>The leader of the DUP, Arlene Foster, believes a deal on Brexit will be reached by 29 March.  Another member of the DUP, Jeffrey Donaldson, commented today that the EU will shift and make the necessary changes to the withdrawal agreement.  He made those comments in spite of the fact that the EU has been firm that the withdrawal agreement is all that is on offer.<br/><br/>Three days of late sittings have been allocated in the House to prepare for something that might not happen and which we hope will not happen.  Prime Minister May is insisting on going to Europe to seek concessions.  What is very certain is that the political system in Westminster is in disarray.  I have been at meetings today since 3.30 p.m. and have not had a chance to hear the latest news.  I wonder what new avenue has been opened at this stage.<br/><br/>I wish to acknowledge the briefing last Friday morning organised by the T&aacute;naiste.  It provided a whistle-stop tour of what Brexit means for the Departments mainly affected by it.  Although short, it provided a good overview of the Bill and the issues that will be discussed this week.  A significant body of work has been carried out for something that might never happen and which no rational person would want, namely, a no-deal Brexit.  Officials went through the 15 Parts of the Bill which involve nine Ministers.  The hours of work that went into the preparation of the Bill took away from the work that the Departments should have been undertaking.  What came across from the briefing was that the motive behind the Bill is to ensure a seamlessness after 29 March and if there is no deal.<br/><br/>Of course, the new favourite word seems to be &quot;extension&quot; but it is difficult to see what that will achieve beyond what is happening now.  What is the point of an extension if the EU is maintaining that what is on the table is all that will ever be on offer?  After two years of negotiations, one would have thought that every &quot;i&quot; had been dotted and every &quot;t&quot; crossed.  In the case of a no-deal Brexit, the UK will become a third country.  As other Members have stressed, what is paramount is protecting the Good Friday Agreement, supporting North-South co-operation, and protecting and maintaining the common travel area.<br/><br/>On the section of the Bill dealing with health and the confirmation of existing healthcare arrangements, the explanatory memorandum confirms the situation regarding access to health services in the UK for citizens of this State and <i>vice versa</i>, but the question of access to healthcare for a UK citizen living in Ireland when that person is in another EU country is not addressed.  An issue regarding drugs which has not, to the best of my knowledge, been raised is that people travel to facilities such as Merchants Quay Ireland and the National Drug Treatment Centre at Trinity Court in Dublin to access addiction treatment and interventions.  How can the opiate substitution treatment methadone maintenance programme between Belfast and Dublin or Ireland and the UK be maintained if there are differing regulations in each jurisdiction relating to the prescription of methadone?  Will people be prohibited from having prescriptions filled in other jurisdictions?<br/><br/>On industry, although the EU has been firm to date on respecting the Good Friday Agreement and the need for the backstop, it is very clear that the UK will remain in some form of customs union in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  There will be pressure for such a customs union from countries such as Germany, for example, the car industry of which has a significant dependency on the British market.  A crash-out Brexit now appears less likely, given the upsurge in discussion of an extension.  I acknowledge that Enterprise Ireland and other agencies will facilitate additional lending and investment instruments and it is likely there will be significant demand for that.  However, a question remains about the criteria that will be applied in that regard and the basis on which certain people will be supported but others will not.  The Student Support Act 2011 is dealt with in the Bill and those current arrangements will continue, as will the arrangements under the Harbours Act.However, even if a deal is agreed and there is no crash out, there will be a need for border checks of some sort.  Even Norway, which has access to the Single Market, and Turkey, which has a close customs union deal, are subject to border checks.  There needs to be clarification of what kinds of checks are proposed and envisaged between Ireland and the UK and the UK and continental Europe.<br/><br/>It is crucial that there be no hard border on the island.  The Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, of which I am a member, heard many presentations by organisations, community groups and businesses, some of which were from the North or involved in North-South Border co-operation.  Their fears and concerns were very apparent to the committee.  There is a need for more clarity on this issue because a hard Brexit is still a possibility.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the immense work done on the Bill by officials, it is a rush job which was prepared in a vacuum and without knowing what is coming.  I hope that does not come back to haunt us.  The hope is that the legislation will not be needed.  There are bigger questions for the EU generally in regard to its commitment to the principles on which the EU was founded and by which it is supposed to abide, such as respect for human dignity, law, human rights, democracy and equality.  The situation is very challenging.  There are difficulties and frustrations but, as an eternal optimist, I do not think it will all be doom and gloom.  I hope I am right.</p></speech>

I commend the officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and nine other Departments on the work they have done in ensuring that we have some degree of readiness for a disorderly Brexit, which, of course, must be avoided at all costs.  Like my colleague, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, I welcome the decision by Keir Starmer, Jeremy Corbyn and the UK Labour Party to move towards a second referendum to prevent a no-deal Brexit.  I commend the work of the T&aacute;naiste in involving our Irish-American colleagues, particularly at national congressional level, and bringing in the important lever of the 30 or 40 million Americans of recent Irish descent to try to even up the disparity in power between us and the UK.</p>  <p>  The Bill and the draft heads of the Bill bring home the dawning realisation of the profound damage a disorderly Brexit could cause to Ireland in areas like health, education, social welfare, justice, migration and our economy, especially agriculture.  In particular, it could put at risk the incredible work done by so many people to progress North-South developments under the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  I thank the Oireachtas Library and Research Service which provided a very helpful digest of the general scheme of the Bill and an updated version on the Bill as laid before the House.  I note some differences between the heads of Bill and the Bill as presented to the House.  Where is the section of the Bill dealing with data governance?  On railways, the draft Bill contained a section regarding the Dublin-Belfast line.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste stated that 12 separate legislative proposals have been made as part of Brexit contingency planning, addressing areas such as aviation, road freight connectivity, fishing authorisation and so on.  Does the Bill provide the whole story or are there significant areas which are yet to be addressed?  I previously raised the issue of fisheries with the T&aacute;naiste and was told that it could not be negotiated until the future relationship trade agreement was being implemented post Brexit.</p><p>As the Minister knows, east-coast fishermen are absolutely terrified at the prospect of not being able to fish in waters that have been EU waters but will become British waters.  There are major problems.  The Minister is very familiar with this area from his previous work.  It has been mentioned that the Commission has published 87 notices on areas that require negotiation.  Are all these included in the Bill?  The Minister stated that there will be some amendments.  Do we have all the information we need to protect the common travel area and the reciprocal rights and entitlements to public services across the two jurisdictions?  It was stated during previous discussions that the common travel area long predates the European Union.  The Minister indicated previously that bilateral negotiations were critical to the maintenance of an agreement, much of which is simply based on tradition and precedent considering that Ireland was once part of the United Kingdom.</p> <p> On Part 2, as my colleague stressed, we have become used to European health insurance, the treatment abroad scheme, the cross-border healthcare directive and the range of initiatives that involve North-South collaboration.  It is daunting to think all these are endangered by Brexit.  I refer to the additional resources we received.  Section 45 of the Health Act 1970 is to be amended by the Bill, which seeks to cover frontier workers, workers posted to Ireland and so on.  Again, it is remarkable that we have to be doing this at this stage given that we have become so used to an EU health system.</p> <p> The chief concerns in the post-Brexit world will include mutual recognition of qualifications in medicine and the supply of medicines.  The former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, referred to the need for dialogue between professional bodies in the UK and Ireland on qualifications.  There was a recent Bill in this regard.  There is grave concern over access to medicine and treatments after Brexit.  This week we will celebrate Rare Disease Day.  All of us have been making representations on orphan drugs and drugs to look after a small cohort of the population.  We have had very bad news in respect of one of those in the past day or so.  It is critical to ensure that all the measures in the Bill will not have to be implemented since the kind of Brexit they address would be to the detriment of our people, North and South.</p> <p> Part 3 is important.  I welcome the allocation of additional financial resources and also the flexibility afforded to Enterprise Ireland, under its CEO, Ms Julie Sinnamon, in taking shares in companies, etc.  We have had many discussions on getting the business sector ready for any kind of Brexit, particularly a crash-out Brexit.</p> <p> We recall the creation of an all-Ireland energy market.  It is one of the most historic developments of the past few decades.  The threat to the single electricity market is very worrying.  Part 4 is particularly important in this regard.</p> <p> Part 5 is also important.  It relates to SUSI.  I noted media reports that there were approximately 10,000 Irish students in colleges in the UK but the Oireachtas Library digest states the number of students from Ireland in receipt of a SUSI grant in the UK is much lower, namely, 1,418.  It states there were 213 students from the UK studying in Ireland and receiving the SUSI grant.  It is important to make contingency plans for approved institutions, including Queen's University Belfast, the University of Ulster, St. Mary's University College, and Stranmillis University College.  Without the changes in Part 5, students would be left in very dire circumstances.</p> <p> As a previous speaker indicated, Part 6, which covers taxation, is particularly revealing because of the gamut of reliefs that operate across the UK and Ireland.  The Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 is the principal Act referred to in the Bill in this regard.  The Bill is informative for those who did not realise the sheer volume of interactions between investors and savers across both countries.  Mention was made to postponed accounting under the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010, which is also important.</p> <p> Part 7, which relates to financial services, is important.  The Stock Exchange is now known as Euronext Dublin but we are deeply involved with the UK central securities depository.  Back in 2017, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform was encouraging private entities to put in applications to establish an Irish-based central securities depository due to Brexit but we have not gone down that route so far.  The Bank of England, along with the European Securities and Markets Authority, has agreed that we should still be able to use the EUI even in the event of a disorderly Brexit.</p> <p> Part 8 is important in the area of insurance because of intermediaries from the UK or Gibraltar that operate in Ireland.</p> <p> Part 10 provides for the changes needed to allow for third-country bus services and grants additional powers to the chief executive of the National Transport Authority.  When considering this, it is interesting to note there are 300 bus journeys across the Border day in, day out.  I am one of those who believe that a hard border should not return under any circumstances.  In earlier discussions, reference was made to a border moving to northern France, including Calais, Cherbourg and the other ports, in the event of a cliff-edge Brexit.  Clearly, we cannot be involved in implementing a hard border in any way in this context.  It just cannot be on the table.  I hope the recent moves in the UK Parliament by both major parties will be a step on the way to ensuring it does not happen.</p> <p> Part 11 is important.  A significant number of British and Irish citizens benefit from social protection allowances and benefits in the two countries.  One of the issues raised with me, which has occurred to a number of pensioners, particularly those who worked for many years in the UK and who are enjoying a UK pension, is that in the event of a crash-out, with another decline in sterling, those pensions will be worth much less.  The point was put to me that we are rightly stepping in to assist our farm industry and others.  Are there plans, however, to protect the value of social welfare pensions from the UK in dire circumstances?</p> <p> There are matters covered in the general scheme that are not in the Bill itself.  Perhaps the Minister will explain this.  I welcome the Bill and will be supporting it.  It seems bizarre, however, that we are discussing such lengthy, detailed legislation to deal with something that may never happen.  We all hope it will not happen.  It seems the great majority of Members in our sister Parliament at Westminster do not want any kind of cliff-edge or disorderly Brexit.  They will have their say.  They feel an obligation to respond to the will of the British people, who did decide to leave the European Union but hope the whole European Union, of which Ireland is an integral part, will have the closest possible relationship with the UK.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-26a.332" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1320" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="19:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022600039#OO00200"><p>I am glad to get an opportunity to talk about this important Bill.  Among every section of every community in Ireland, nothing gives rise to concern as much as Brexit, which now has been talked about for almost two years.  The various groups affected are so concerned.  These include farmers, the self-employed and small companies exporting to the North and to Britain.</p><p>The one issue that does not seem to be mentioned in the Bill, which has been highlighted by other speakers, is the hard border and how it will be managed.  I agree with others that if Britain wants to leave the EU and maintain a border between the North and the South, that is a matter for Prime Minister May and the European Union to sort out.  We cannot interfere or be a part of anything that would break up the Good Friday Agreement, into which so much effort was put by past leaders, Ministers for Foreign Affairs and everyone who was involved from all sides.  Sinn F&eacute;in, the unionists, including the DUP and, in our country, former taoisigh, Albert Reynolds, Garret FitzGerald and Bertie Ahern, played their parts.  All the leaders along the way put in hard work and we cannot ever again allow the divisiveness that obtained in our country for almost 30 years.  We do not want that back and we cannot wish that upon our people, south or north of the border.  We condemn and abhor much of what happened for that time, the wrongs that were done, and we do not want to go back to that.<br/><br/>There are small things which can be very big things.  I am being asked questions about driving licences and that issue needs to be explained.  Will an Irish licence be recognised in Northern Ireland or Great Britain?  What about lorry drivers?  It will be the same for people coming to this country with an English driving licence.  Will it work <i>vice versa</i>?  Will UK licences be recognised here?  Surely things like that can be sorted out and common sense will apply to ensure that drivers will be able to continue as they have been.  If a driver is good enough to drive in Ireland or the UK, the licence he or she obtained should be sufficient to allow him or her to drive in either country.<br/><br/>I am glad that this week, at last, Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party, has indicated that, with conditions, he would be in favour of having a second referendum.  We spoke about it in this House when news of the referendum result broke and I believe I was the first person to ask the then Taoiseach Enda Kenny to ask the UK Government to have another referendum.  I hope that will happen.  Many people, all along, have been asking and hoping that would happen.  The people of Great Britain and Northern Ireland should be well informed before they cast their votes a second time.  It is clear that they were not advised of all the pros and cons when they went to the polls the first time and of the adverse effects it could have for their country and other countries, especially ours.<br/><br/>The backstop is important.  I hope, if the UK decides to leave on 29 March, that the backstop is part of whatever deal will be agreed by the UK Government and Parliament.  Maybe they will delay the UK's exit further and eventually save the day with another referendum.<br/><br/>It has been mentioned that Irish farmers will get a package from Europe.  Farmers are in a critical state now, especially beef farmers.  Prices are very bad.  Farmers have sheds of cattle and they are afraid of what will become of them.  They are feeding and caring for them like they always have.  The farming community comprises a wonderful set of people, especially the farmers I represent in Kerry.  They are very concerned at the moment.  There have been beef plan meetings in Castleisland, Kenmare, Dingle and Listowel.  There are more planned in Dingle and Cahirciveen and there will be one in Listowel next Monday, 4 March.  The price of cattle is the issue that is exercising their minds and they are concerned.<br/><br/>I was at one of those meetings last night.  We were told about what happened to a Libyan cattle buyer who wanted to buy 4,000 bulls in this country.  I do not know if the T&aacute;naiste is aware that there is a complete slowdown in taking bull beef from the farmers.  To get a call from a factory that will take a few cattle from a farmer is like winning something big in the lotto.  Farmers need contacts and the way the factories are operating at the moment is not fair.  A few years ago, farmers were advised to go into bull beef, to deviate away from bullocks, but now nobody wants to take the bull beef.  There has been a complete slowdown.  A Libyan purchaser wanted to come here to buy 4,000 cattle worth &euro;5 million.  The T&aacute;naiste is the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  This Libyan man applied for a visa in mid-November to be allowed to come to see the cattle.  The boat and buyers were organised but he wanted to come and see what he was getting.  Lo and behold, he still has not been told what is wrong or if he will get a visa.  I am afraid that the cows carrying calves at the time he applied will calve again before he gets an answer to his visa request.  It is ridiculous that this has happened.  We have been asking the Government day after day on the Order of Business to ensure that our country will have other live export options around the world.  This has happened to our farmers under our noses who work so hard, from dark to dark, to try and produce top quality beef and there is then no outlet for them to sell it.  It is ridiculous.  <br/><br/>This Libyan man has now indicated that he is not interested in Ireland and he has gone to Spain.  It is appalling that we have lost that volume of bull beef exports.  It seems that he applied to the Department of Justice and Equality for a visa.  No one has come back to him.</p><p>Neither has anyone said they are looking for anything.  The galling point about it is that the man was in this country several times before.  There could not be much wrong but it is like somebody was not paying attention.  It looked as if other Deputies made representations to the Minister for Justice and Equality on his behalf.  However, sadly, nothing has happened and this is where we currently stand.</p> <p> We know there is a large beef market in Iran but it seems this has not been explored by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Farmers at these beef plan group meetings have asked about these markets.  The group which has set up the beef plan has said it is trying to secure markets abroad.  It is, however, up to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to do so.  While he may have been castigated for different reasons, we remember when the former Taoiseach, Charlie Haughey, went out to meet the then Libyan leader, Gaddafi, and secured markets when agriculture was on its knees before.  The Government should not be beyond that.  Ministers should be able to do that as well.  There are now more ways to travel to new markets, as well as dealing with matters through email.  I cannot understand how we have lost an export market like the one in question.</p> <p> It is a fact the majority of our beef exports go to the UK.  The UK has already put pressure on us by suggesting it will allow in beef imports from South America.  Likewise, Italy and Germany are exploring how to allow South American beef imports into their countries in return for allowing them to sell cars to South American countries.  These matters are concerning for our farmers.</p> <p> We do not have enough lairage in Cherbourg.  It is not France's responsibility to provide lairage for dairy-bred calves but that of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Bord Bia for export on to markets like Holland.  We cannot get them there because we need extra lairage in Cherbourg.  Will the Minister team up with the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Justice and Equality, to ensure these export markets continue to protect our agricultural industry?</p> <p> What travel arrangements are being made if Britain leaves?  Will Britain still be the main landbridge between Ireland and the Continent?  What problems will arise with the transport of animals?  Can we avoid going through the UK as much as possible because there will be tariffs?  People are asking these questions.  I am appealing to the Minister to ensure the proper arrangements are in place to deal with these matters.  Time is getting scarce.</p> <p> Fishermen are also concerned.  They find it hard enough to survive with the elements and bad weather.  Will the Minister explain how much of a package we will get from Europe to assist our farmers and fishermen?</p> <p> The cross-border health directive has been vital for many people in Kerry and west Cork.  Through it, Deputy Michael Collins and I have taken 25 buses of people to the North of Ireland to get operations to remove cataracts, get hip or knee replacements, as well as for children to have their tonsils removed.  Are we sure this will continue if Britain leaves the European Union?  We have great admiration for these people who have taken it upon themselves to travel this long journey for an operation.  It takes seven hours to travel from Kerry to Belfast.  One 96 year old man saw it as either going to Belfast or going blind.  One has to admire them for going in the dark of the morning and not coming back until late the following night.</p> <p> We need to assure people that medicines will be available.  There is much concern that there may be shortages of different kinds of food such as flour.  I was told often by my grandmother that there was a scarcity of flour after the Second World War.  She would tell how glad she used to be to get a ten stone bag of flour that she would carry home over 350 yards on her back from where it was dropped off on the road with just one stop.  When I hear talk about scarcities of flour, I think of her and what she went through at the time.</p> <p> The free travel scheme facilitates people to travel North to visit relations and friends and likewise for people coming down from the North.  It is hoped this will continue.  We depend on tourists from the UK.  Many of them come year after year.  They have always been appreciated and recognised as good spenders.  We hope that, if there is a hard Brexit, they will still be facilitated.  Any drop in visitors from Great Britain would hit hard many of the small bed and breakfasts, as well as family run and large hotels, which provide such great facilities.  These businesses provide many jobs in the Ring of Kerry, the great town of Killarney, Tralee, north Kerry and even in the heart of south Kerry in places like Valentia.  These places appreciate the visitors from the UK, as well as those who come through the UK to visit our county.</p></speech>

It is particularly unusual to welcome legislation we hope never to see enacted.</p><p>Looking through this mammoth Bill, it is extremely jarring to confront the fact that in a few short weeks, unless Article 50 is extended, we will have an external EU frontier cutting across this island.</p> <p> While I commend the Government on this complex legislation, it is a matter of huge regret that we should have to discuss this issue at all.  As I and others have stated previously, there is no such thing as a good Brexit.  As it stands, the relationship between Ireland and the UK, as partners in the Single Market and the customs union and with almost frictionless movement of people, is as close to the optimum that can be achieved in terms of social and economic co-operation between two economic states.  However, the United Kingdom has chosen to walk away from that arrangement.  It has also chosen to walk away from similar relationships with 26 other member states.  From the perspective of a neighbouring country, this is a really baffling decision and the Conservative Party will bear a heavy responsibility for it in the future.  It also shows the dangers of nationalist populism when driven to its irrational extreme.</p> <p> While we respect the outcome of the 2016 referendum, the lack of foresight and planning, the obfuscation that has followed and the incomprehensible continuing lack of clarity from the British Government regarding what kind of Brexit it wants has undoubtedly served to sour relations between our two states.  This is most regrettable as the warming of the east-west relationship between our two states was one of the hard-won triumphs of the peace process.  We can only hope that this relationship can be repaired over time.</p> <p> Events at Westminster today indicate that an extension of the Article 50 process seems a more likely outcome than no deal.  The Labour Party seems to have thrown its weight behind the possibility of a second referendum.  We need to have more clarity in terms of what it now proposes.  If Article 50 is extended, I urge the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste to work to ensure that it is for as tight and defined a period as possible.</p> <p> Aside from the possibility of hard Brexit, the most frustrating outcome for individuals and businesses that desperately need clarity on what form Brexit will take is a further open-ended period of uncertainty.  Businesses that rely on access to the UK market literally have no idea what their trading arrangements will be in a few short weeks.  To further prolong this uncertainty is untenable.  The British Prime Minister&rsquo;s strategy of running down the clock to effectively bounce her party into supporting the deal on the table, at the risk of a no-deal Brexit, underscores the UK's total unpreparedness for the enormity of a hard Brexit.</p> <p> Playing fast and loose with not only the peace in Northern Ireland, the businesses that rely on trading relationships and the UK market but also with the lives of the most disadvantaged who would be disproportionately damaged by a no-deal Brexit displays a callousness and a disconnectedness from the reality of existence for so many people in the UK.  Theresa May will be remembered as the Prime Minister who tore up her own deal when faced with the same malcontents from the extremes of the British political spectrum who, in the first instance, fought for Brexit in the absence of a plan on how to deliver it.  Regardless of the form it takes, it is a Brexit will come at the expense of the British public, their jobs and businesses.</p> <p> I now turn to the Bill.  I commend the work that has gone into producing this legislation.  It contains complex provisions - spanning several Departments - that would attempt to minimise the massive disruption that a disorderly Brexit would cause.  I especially welcome the proposed changes to the VAT regime for importers that would continue to treat the UK on the same terms as a member state for the purposes of making VAT returns every two months on imports, rather than on their arrival in Ireland.  This will be of benefit to small and medium-sized enterprises which do not have sufficient capacity or a sustainable cashflow that would allow for continuous VAT payments.  This is a particularly welcome measure because it goes some way to addressing an aspect of Brexit preparedness on which the Government has been weak, namely, support for small and medium enterprises.</p> <p> Part 3 relates to the role which Enterprise Ireland will play in enhancing support to companies involved in research and development in order to allow them to continue to operate and expand.  There is also provision for additional lending and investment instruments in certain circumstances.  While these measures are welcome, I do not think that it is credible that this measure should be offered after the fact if the Bill is ever needed.  I urge the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation to speak to small and medium-sized enterprises so as to fully ascertain their needs.  Small businesses cannot afford to prepare for no-deal Brexit while big business cannot afford not to.  The Brexit loan support scheme was a welcome plank in the Government&rsquo;s preparedness strategy.  However, we have heard serious and repeated claims that the scheme did not take into full consideration the specific needs of small and medium-sized businesses when it came to capacity to make applications.  If the Article 50 process is extended, I ask the Minister to work to further develop the strategy to assist this sector to prepare for Brexit and to ensure that those in it are fully cognisant of existing supports.  I also ask her to work to develop additional sector-specific solutions as needed.</p> <p> While the Government and the other 26 EU member staters have thus far stood fast on the need for a legally-binding backstop to be a core part of the withdrawal agreement, as the deadline looms, I hope no member state will be tempted to blink.  In recent months, certain elements in Eurosceptic Governments who may be more susceptible to bilateral lobbying by the UK have made some worrying comments about Ireland&rsquo;s role in the current impasse.  This cannot be allowed to become a narrative as the prospect of a no-deal Brexit approaches.  The Government enjoys the unprecedented support of all in this House to continue to hold the line.  I urge the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste to ensure that this support is echoed in the capitals of the other 26 member states as 29 March looms nearer.</p></speech>

It is legislation that none of us want to see enacted or used but it is a necessary precaution that we must make as a result of the possibility of a no-deal, crash-out Brexit.</p><p>This morning I read something that gave me a sense of the lack of connection to reality of the British political system at this time.  I regret that I must say this but they are the only words I can use to describe the situation as I see it.  It was an article in <i>The Telegraph </i>by the very eminent and experienced former Tory leader and Foreign Secretary, William Hague.  He advises his colleagues that if the EU is going to make any meaningful concession, it will only do so at the last minute because of the consequences of a no-deal Brexit.  He said that the UK Government has to hold its nerve and extract change to the legal durability of the Irish backstop.  That seems to be the current negotiating tactic employed by the UK Government.  I scratched my head and thought how surely they must understand, as I think most people here do, that the European Union is not going to allow the extraction of such as concession.</p><p>To explain why, our party leader in the European Parliament, Mr. Philippe Lamberts, MEP, was over here recently and put it well when I questioned him on this.  He said that what they do not seem to realise is that the concession they are looking for is, in effect, a concession with regard to the Single Market, or a complete weakening of it, and whatever the difficulties that would no doubt be caused by a no-deal Brexit exit, which no one wants, the European Union will not undermine the Single Market.  It will not throw a concession on that because that is fundamental.  The Single Market is a cornerstone of the Union and that is what is at play.  I regret that such a lack of knowledge, or lack of shared understanding of what is at play, exists on the other side of the Irish Sea and I hope that in some way in the coming weeks they can turn it around to realise that this issue will not move, that having it as their great salvation out of the division they have in their Parliament will not work and that they will have to seek some other means, and fairly quickly, to manage this situation.  I heard an adviser on the Irish side say today, and I have heard it said recently, that the chance of a no-deal crash out is only 10% and in all likelihood there will be an extension and then some form of agreement.  I am nervous because the way I see it in the House of Commons is that there is such lack of cohesion and co-operation, even within each party, or certainly across that House, the risk is they will not even manage that process of avoiding the no-deal crash out, and we have to prepare for it.</p> <p> It will be difficult for parties on this side to manage the whole process, not only because we are not in opposition to the Government on this but because of the sheer breadth of the technicalities.  Given that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is able to bring in one Minister after another and has the Departments rowing in, it will be difficult for us to suggest amendments or to have the same resources, particularly given the timelines we have for debating this legislation.  This is not an ordinary legislative process.</p> <p> There are a number of areas where I would hope we could suggest further measures that will need to be taken.  They might not necessarily have to be legislative but we will certainly look to see if they are, or will try to input as best we can into what is a contracted and, by its nature, a crisis legislative process.  We need to strengthen - if it is not in the legislation, it needs to be put in somewhere else or there needs to be an opportunity to do so somewhere else - the preparation for the environmental consequences of a no-deal crash out Brexit.</p> <p> One of the strengths of the Good Friday Agreement is it recognised the environmental reality that we share one island and pollution does not recognise borders.  Councillor Mark Dearey, a colleague of mine in Dundalk, always makes the point that the water that eventually arrives at his tap has crossed the Border four or five times as the rivers wind their way through south Armagh and County Louth.  Similarly, he makes the point that there is real uncertainty as to where the Border is in the likes of Carlingford Lough, and he lives on the shores of Carlingford Lough.  A series of environmental campaign groups came to the D&aacute;il late last year, largely because they had no one in the Assembly to speak to.  There is no representation in Northern Ireland at present, which is shocking because the Good Friday Agreement envisaged that environmental powers would be devolved to the Assembly.  In the absence of any political representation in the North, which could hear their pleas, groups such those protesting against gold mining in the Sperrin Mountains and those who were rightly concerned about the massive and seemingly fraudulent expansion of the pig sector in the North where there is a range of new environmental concerns came down here.  For instance, there is the equivalent of 12 million persons' worth of sewage coming from these new anaerobic digestion plants that have been approved in the same way that the home renovation incentive, HRI, plants were approved in the North.  That pollution, the ammonia and the concerns regarding water pollution from such plants are cross-Border issues.  This Bill is not strong on the environmental legislation and that is something we will need to strengthen in the event that there is a crash-out Brexit.  The advantage is it is not ideological.  It is merely the physical reality that, as is said, pollution does not recognise borders.  Good environmental management must cross borders.  That is an area where we could perhaps get some co-operation with unionist parties in the North in recognising it is in their interests.  It is in no one's interest to ignore transboundary pollution issues.</p> <p> There is another reason it is an important area for real detailed work and consideration.  One of the problems with this Brexit process and one of the fears we have is that the UK Government intends to use the Brexit process to weaken environmental standards and gain competitive advantage by diverting from the high standards the European Union has set in the Habitats Directive, the Water Framework Directive and the climate directives.  All that environmental legislation is European and, as we see it, looking at the draft legislation before the House of Commons, the environmental regulations they are seeking to put in place do not include proper monitoring of what will happen, especially in Northern Ireland.  It is English-centric.  They are looking at weakening environmental standards and diverting away from European standards which would have particularly severe negative consequences for this island.  That is one of the main reasons we must maintain a no-border approach.  For farming and for environmental reasons, that has particular consequences on this side of the island.</p> <p> I hate to say it but we simply do not trust the European Research Group, ERG, and its fairy tale notion that there will be fair trade deals everywhere.  It wraps it up in a green ribbon that Mr. Michael Gove, MP, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, presents in terms of being the greenest of them all.  Given everything we know about its philosophy, I am sorry but it seems in the legislation it is already considering deregulated lower standards in both employment and environment.  That is why I would like to see a much strong emphasis in our response to protect environmental standards in whatever we do.</p> <p> A second and more detailed area is in the education sector.  I have been approached by a number of people involved in Irish universities who said that they are concerned about the lack of a detailed approach to the management of students, who thrive on both sides, both our students going to the UK and UK students coming here.  I was told as recently as last week that they had no real certainty as to what they would do with students later this year and next year.  I do not have immediate proposals or suggestions in this regard.  We must look into the details of the legislation, and through the legislative process, try to ensure that it is as tight and as effective as possible.  As I said at the Brexit dialogue in Dublin Castle recently, one of the areas where we might see co-operation with our unionist friends is on the rights of those holding British passports in Northern Ireland to have access to the likes of the Erasmus scheme and also to work, which applies not only to students.  We must avoid, in what we are managing, the division between those carrying an Irish passport in the North and a British passport in terms of the rights they gain.  We should look for concessions from the European Union post Brexit, whether it is a no-deal or a withdrawal agreement, to protect those rights because it would be deeply divisive to make what passport a person in the North holds determine his or her future.  It would be deeply unfair and would undermine everything we have been working for within the Good Friday Agreement and within the peace process that we are all committed to.</p> <p> There is so much more here because it is such broad legislation.  Suffice it to say that we enter into the process of writing this legislation with regret.  We will maintain the co-operative approach with the Government that has been evident throughout this Brexit process but we will try to maintain a critical eye and provide useful suggestions to address any flaws and to propose improvements as best we can.  Time is short.</p><p>The position is tight and we will do our best to help in whatever way we can.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-26a.341" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="20:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022600044#TT00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to address D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2019 and, in particular, the elements of it which I have proposed as Minister for Finance.  The Government remains firmly of the view that the only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union is to ratify the withdrawal agreement as endorsed by the European Council and agreed with the British Government.  The Government remains focused on the ratification of the withdrawal agreement and the negotiation of an ambitious and comprehensive future EU-UK partnership.  However, we must also be prepared for the possibility that the United Kingdom will leave the European Union without an agreement.  We are doing all we can to avoid this happening, but we need to be ready in case it does.</p><p>The Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2019 follows on from the Government's contingency action plan published in December 2018 and the measures being undertaken at EU level via the European Commission's contingency action plan.  The purpose of the Government's Bill is to protect citizens and the economy by putting in place the necessary measures to mitigate some of the worst disruptions and discontinuities that would arise as a result of a no-deal Brexit.  As Minister for Finance, my objective is to protect the economic and financial interests of the state and support the work of the Revenue Commissioners so as to minimise the disruption to trade to the greatest extent possible.  My Department is working within the whole-of-government approach and co-ordinating closely with the agencies, including the Central Bank of Ireland and the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, which is also heavily involved in developing and implementing plans and measures to protect the economy to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>As I have outlined previously, Brexit, in whatever form, is an historic challenge and, as we approach it, we must continue to be clear that membership of the Single Market and the customs union is a core element of our economic strategy and will not change.  Ireland will remain an active and enthusiastic member of the European Union and the Government is committed to working with the European Commission to ensure the closest possible relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom and to protect the interests of businesses and citizens as much as possible.  The legislative amendments I have proposed in the areas of taxation and financial services will form an important part of this contingency planning.</p><p>Part 6 of the Bill provides for the modification of income tax, corporation tax, capital tax and stamp duty legislation in order to ensure continuity for business and citizens in their current access to certain taxation measures, including reliefs and allowances.  Part 6 also makes provision for the introduction of postponed accounting for VAT on imports from third countries, an important measure to mitigate the cash flow burden on businesses should the United Kingdom leave the European Union without a withdrawal agreement.  It also provides for the retention of certain capital taxes and VAT anti-avoidance provisions.  There are seven chapters in this Part of the Bill.</p><p>The proposed amendments to income tax are covered in chapter 2, sections 16 to 41, inclusive, where various sections of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 will be amended to ensure income tax measures will continue to apply to existing beneficiaries should the United Kingdom leave the European Union without an agreement.  The relevant legislative provisions will, as far as practicable, be extended to include the United Kingdom in order to maintain the <i>status quo</i>in the immediate future.  The measures covered are diverse and include the artists' exemption; the exemptions from income tax of hepatitis and HIV compensation payments and foster care arising in the United Kingdom; the application of the seafarer allowance and the fisher tax credit to Irish taxpayers serving on UK-registered vessels; ensuring continuity of relief for small and medium enterprises benefiting from the employment and investment incentive, start-up refunds for entrepreneurs, the key employee engagement programme and preservation of existing pension reliefs for Irish taxpayers; the retirement arran<i>g</i>ements for professional sportspersons to ensure Irish taxpaying sportsmen and sportswomen who retire to the United Kingdom can avail of the relief; and the continuation of various reliefs in respect of charitable donations and charities' incomes.</p><p>The proposed amendments to corporation tax are covered in chapter 3, sections 42 to 47, inclusive.  In broad terms, they seek to maintain the <i>status quo</i>in the tax treatment of certain transactions or corporate group structures in the immediate aftermath of a UK exit from the European Union without an agreement.  The purpose of the amendments is to minimise disruption to businesses to the greatest extent possible.  For example, the amendments proposed in section 42 relating to charges on income for corporation tax purposes will ensure certain interest payments made by companies to recognised banks, Stock Exchange members and discount houses carrying on business in the United Kingdom will continue to qualify for the relief.  Similarly, the amendments proposed in sections 45 to 47, inclusive, aim to retain reliefs for certain start-up companies, companies engaged in research and development activities and gains realised on certain transfers of chargeable assets owned by UK companies.</p><p>The proposed amendments to capital taxes are covered as part of chapter 2, section 41; chapter 4, sections 48 and 49; and chapter 7, section 60.  The amendments are proposed in order to allow for continuity of existing provisions, in the main capital gains tax and capital acquisition taxes covering investment and farming reliefs, as well as amendments to cover specific capital gains tax anti-avoidance measures.</p><p>VAT is covered in chapter 5, sections 50 to 53, inclusive.  The main change being proposed is in section 51 which provides for the introduction of postponed accounting for VAT.  This is a significant measure that will alleviate VAT burdens on businesses as a result of Brexit.  The change allows businesses to account for VAT on imports in their bi-monthly VAT return, instead of having to pay VAT at the point of importation, which normally applies to imports from third countries.  This mirrors the existing VAT system for trade from the United Kingdom and will avoid the cash flow burden for businesses trading with the United Kingdom of having to pay VAT up-front and also the administrative burden of operating new systems.  The amendments proposed in section 52 are an anti-avoidance measure.</p><p>With stamp duties, chapter 6 sets out the proposed amendments to the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 which are covered in sections 54 to 59, inclusive.  The aim of the amendments is to maintain the <i>status quo</i>.  The amendments proposed in sections 54 to 57, inclusive, provide for a continuation of stamp duty reliefs on the acquisition of stocks and marketable securities, the reconstructions or amalgamations of companies and the demutualisation of assurance companies.  The amendments proposed in sections 58 and 59 provide for a continuation of stamp duty levies on certain life insurance and non-life insurance premiums.  Today the Government approved two amendments to be included in the Bill on Committee Stage related to duty free sales and the operation of the VAT retail export scheme between Ireland and the United Kingdom post Brexit.</p><p>Turning to Part 7 of the Bill, legislative amendments are proposed to extend the protections contained in the settlement finality directive to Irish users of UK-based settlement systems for trading in financial instruments once the United Kingdom becomes a third country.  This legislation is related to the Irish market's reliance on CREST, a central securities depository, CSD, based in the United Kingdom to settle trades in Irish listed financial instruments.  A central securities depository is a specialist settlement system that holds financial instruments such as shares on behalf of investors and facilitates transfers in ownership through electronic book entry, rather than the actual physical transfer of paper certificates.</p><p>It is a key component in financial market infrastructure that enables the safe and efficient trading of financial instruments. <br/><br/>In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the European Commission has already adopted a temporary and conditional equivalence decision for UK-based CSDs under the central securities depository regulation, CSDR, for a period of two years.  This will allow the Irish market to continue settling trades in CREST while the transition to Euroclear Bank, a CSD based in Be<i>l</i>gium, is completed.  The proposed amendments to the settlement finality regulations are required to support implementation of the Commission equivalence decision and allow Irish participants to continue accessing CREST.  The settlement finality directive ensures that transfer orders of financial instruments entered into designated settlement systems by market participants are legally binding.  It provides legal certainty to market participants that trades will fully settle even if one of the parties attempts to revoke the trade or becomes insolvent prior to settlement.  Recital 7 of the directive grants member states the discretion to extend the protections of the directive to third country systems.  At the time of the directive's transposition into Irish law through SI 624 of 2010, Ireland did not exercise this discretion as CREST was based in another member state - the UK.  Following the UK's decision to leave the EU, it will become a third country for the purposes of EU legislation and, therefore, it becomes necessary to implement recital 7 in Irish law, as I am proposing in this Bill, in order to ensure that the protections under the directive continue to apply to Irish market participants. <br/><br/>Regarding the designation of settlement systems, I, in my role as Minister for Finance, will decide on the designation of a system following a recommendation by the Central Bank of Ireland.  The Central Bank is required to conduct an equivalence assessment of the United Kingdom's legal system as it relates to settlement finality to ensure it is equivalent to the relevant Irish laws and that the rules of the individual system comply with the requirements set out in Regulation No. 7.  The proposed legislation allows for the withdrawal of a designation if the Central Bank of Ireland deems that either UK law or the rules of the system no longer comply with the requirements set out in the legislation.  The legislation also allows for the temporary designation of settlement systems that are already designated by the Bank of England under settlement finality.  The introduction of this legislation will ensure that there is no disruption to existing market activity in the event that the UK withdraws from the EU without ratification of the withdrawal agreement. <br/><br/>Finally, Part 8 of the Bill provides for contract continuity in respect of contracts of insurance.  If the UK withdraws from the EU without ratification of the withdrawal agreement, it will become a third country from 30 March 2019 with regard to the EU's regulatory framework for insurance and financial services.  UK and Gibraltar insurance undertakings or insurance intermediaries will, therefore, no longer be able to write new business in Ireland and will not have the authority to continue to service contracts that were concluded before Brexit.  The servicing of contracts would include activities such as paying out on claims or accepting premium payments.  Therefore, certain measures are necessary to protect Irish customers to ensure the continuity of these services post Brexit. <br/><br/>The Central Bank has indicated that a significant majority of insurance undertakings have proposed appropriate contingency plans that have already been implemented or will be implemented.  In addition, most of the larger insurance intermediaries are taking the necessary action to resolve this issue.  However, there is a legitimate concern, that some smaller UK-Gibraltar insurance undertakings and insurance intermediaries, which, admittedly, represent a very small portion of the overall market, will not have implemented contingency plans in place on time or because they do not propose continuing to operate in the Irish market post Brexit. <br/><br/>This Part, therefore, caters for these situations and ensures that Irish policyholders who hold existing life and non-life insurance policies with insurance undertakings or through insurance intermediaries operating in Ireland from the UK or Gibraltar will not be affected due to those undertakings or intermediaries losing their right to conduct business in EU members states post Brexit.  To do so, the Part provides for a temporary run-off regime, which, subject to a number of conditions, will enable such firms to continue to fulfil contractual obligations to their Irish customers for a period of three years after the date of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU.  The measure is exclusively in place for existing policies and does not allow these firms to issue new policies.  This temporary run-off regime is established by amendment to the two sets of regulations that provide for the regulation of insurance undertakings and insurance intermediaries, namely, the European Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulations 2015 and the European Union (Insurance Distribution) Regulations 2018.  <br/><br/>Finally, Deputies should note that this regime is in line with the principles set out by the European Commission and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, EIOPA, in that it does not allow for new business to be written, it is temporary in nature and is in line with the principles set out in the Solvency II directive.  These factors have been key considerations for my Department and the Central Bank in developing this regime.  Indeed, EIOPA, in its recommendations for the insurance sector in light of the United Kingdom withdrawing from the European Union, which were published on 19 February, has effectively endorsed this approach.  I am confident, therefore, that these measures should ensure that Irish policyholders are protected in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  <br/><br/>I hope this gives Members a good outline of the issues in this Bill that are covered by the Department of Finance.  The breadth of the issues ranges from sportspeople to settlement systems, which indicates the complexity of this Bill and the complexity of the undertaking that lies ahead.  The passage of the Bill is vital to ensure that in the event of a disorderly Brexit, we have done all we can to protect the interests of our State and citizens.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-26a.343" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="20:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022600045#UU00200"><p>It is timely, if unfortunate, that we find ourselves debating this Bill this evening.  The Minister outlined some of the key aspects of the Bill and the complexity involved in so many of the areas covered by it.  I will focus on agriculture, which is not directly affected by the Bill but is equally complex in terms of the issues thrown up by the threat of a hard Brexit and requires as much clarity in our preparations as do those areas covered by the Bill.  As the Minister is aware, of all the sectors of the Irish economy to which the threat of a hard Brexit poses a massive risk, agriculture is head and shoulders above the rest in terms of its level of exposure.  While 17% of our total national exports are destined for the UK, the figure for the agriculture sector last year was 38%.  There are some areas within agriculture that are massively exposed.  It has been well rehearsed at this stage in terms of how the beef sector in particular is exposed.  Half of our beef exports go to the UK.  Certain areas in the dairy sector, particularly cheddar, are exposed.  Other affected areas include the pigmeat and horticulture sectors.  The impact on horticulture has been felt for a year and a half.  The initial fluctuations in the value of sterling whacked that sector and put some operators out of business.</p>  <p>  It is crucial that as much clarity as possible is brought to bear on preparedness and the mitigation measures that will be in place in the event of a hard Brexit.  </p><p>We all look with great attention at the day-to-day developments in Westminster and my own assessment, and that of most people, is that it is still unlikely there will be a hard Brexit.  However, we have to ensure we have every possible measure in place in the event it does happen.  In regard to agriculture, unfortunately, the clarity has not been there to the extent that should be possible.  The Government has not ensured the sector is as prepared or as clear as it could be in terms of the supports that will be in place if a hard Brexit happens on 29 March.</p> <p> With my colleagues on our agriculture team, Deputies Cahill and Aylward and Senator Paul Daly, and on our Brexit team, Deputies Haughey and Chambers, since it became clear the UK was on a certain course, I have consistently asked the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine what exactly the Government is doing to try to help the agriculture sector.  Since budget 2018 was announced in October 2017, the Minister's standard response, which he has used to reassure us in regard to how the Government was taking this seriously, is that significant funding has been put aside to bring in a Brexit loan scheme specifically tailored and designed to equip the agriculture sector, and farmers in particular, to deal with and prepare for Brexit.  Where are we today in regard to that scheme?  It still has not been launched and we still have not seen the detail of it.  Going back over 18 months, that was the stock answer from the Minister to reassure us in terms of how seriously the Department was taking its responsibility to work with the sector and prepare it as best it could.  However, it is still nowhere to be seen.</p> <p> Unfortunately, that is reflective of the overall approach we have seen from the Government in regard to agriculture.  Instead of hoping for the best and preparing for the worst, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Government have majored in hoping for the best but they have not paid the attention they should to preparing for the worst.  We saw this displayed at the Cabinet meeting in July last at the Daniel O'Connell homestead in Derrynane, after which the Government made the big bang announcement that there was no need to worry, that it was totally in control and that it would hire 1,000 officers in order to be prepared for the eventuality of a hard Brexit.  Some 700 of that 1,000 round figure were to be customs officers and 300 were to be sanitary and phytosanitary, or SPS, veterinary officials.  Fast forward to October, three months after the initial big announcement, and the figure of 300 SPS veterinary officials was downgraded, with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine outlining that all we would need was 116.  As of today, and having queried the Minister in recent weeks in regard to how many of those officials would be hired and in place for the end of March, when they might be needed, there has been no answer.  He could not tell us because they have not been hired.</p> <p> In the last couple of days, what we have seen in the media from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is that it is now putting out a tender call to the private veterinary sector, calling for people within that sector to make an application or an expression of interest to the Department as to their preparedness and willingness to take up the role of inspector officers at entry points into the State at the end of March, should they be needed.  While the Government was telling us it had it all under control, this week we see it is outsourcing it to the private sector and to the veterinary community, and expecting them to come forward with an expression of interest, with just 31 days to go to Brexit.  Of course, the veterinary profession is already under massive pressure in regard to resources and is exceptionally stretched, and the end of March is the busiest time of year for veterinary practices and professionals across the country.  I severely doubt the Government will get the required level of response to fill those roles in the event of a hard Brexit.  No doubt, the Government will tell us it has this covered because it has the tender out, and it will hope for the best again and hope it will not be needed - the default position.  However, if it is, I doubt this will be in place, given that the level of consultation with the veterinary profession has been very limited.</p> <p> The other key thing we need to see, and which we have not seen, is certainty with regard to the level of support that will be in place in the event of a hard Brexit for the beef sector, the dairy sector and the agrifood sector.  When the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is cornered and put under pressure as to what exactly will be done, he tells us not to worry and says hundreds of millions of euro will be available, but that is as far as it goes.  There is no certainty.  We saw the UK environment Secretary, Michael Gove, last week outline what might happen there, particularly in regard to beef, where a tariff-free quota would be allowed up to the level of tonnage that would be required to make up for the UK's lack of self-sufficiency.  Again, there is no clarity as to the response from the Irish Government in terms of what will be in place in the event that our sector needs to be supported, given it is already under massive pressure.</p> <p> My clear message is that the Government needs to step up to the mark in terms of communicating what it is going to do in regard to agriculture and the supports that will be in place should they be required, although we all hope they will not be.  The Government and Members on all sides of the House are resolute in terms of working together to try to achieve that objective but we need to ensure the supports are in place, and that they will be communicated in advance to try to protect what is our largest indigenous sector, which is essential to the economy of the nation, in particular rural Ireland.</p></speech>

After the referendum on 23 June 2016, I said in the D&aacute;il, as many others said at the time, that it would be an awful shame that so much time and effort has to be given by Government and Opposition, and by public administration generally, to dealing with the fallout from Brexit, and so it has come to pass.  With 31 days to go to 29 March, we have 11 D&aacute;il sitting days left.  I suggest this legislation has come to us a little late but we will scrutinise it as best we can.  It was only published last Friday and is very complex legislation, so all credit to the civil servants who prepared it across many Departments.  We now have to do it justice.</p>  <p>  In regard to the withdrawal agreement, we are hoping Westminster will pass it in time.  I am not sure what the other options are or if there is a possibility of a new deal between the EU and the UK involving a legally binding codicil in respect of the Irish backstop.  Obviously, a new deal would need the agreement of the European Commission.  There is also the possibility of an extension of Article 50 and now, into the mix, the British Labour Party has thrown the possibility of another public vote.</p>  <p>  It is worth stating again that the political stability in the Republic of Ireland at this time should not be taken for granted arising from the confidence and supply agreement by Fianna F&aacute;il to facilitate this Government.  I am not sure everybody gets the immediate threat to jobs, to living standards and to the public finances arising from Brexit.  I think the effects will be seen immediately.  People's standards of living are under threat and people need to realise this.  At least the D&aacute;il is sitting this week to pass this emergency legislation.  The D&aacute;il has not been dissolved, which I believe most people will appreciate.</p><p> The Brexit omnibus Bill has 15 Parts and involves nine Departments.  It aims to secure the provisions in respect of the common travel area, maintain existing arrangements and deal with immediate issues to ensure continuity generally.  I hope no new measures are being slipped into it.  We need assurances in that regard.  I note that the Minister has stated two amendments were approved by the Cabinet today.  We need full openness on the Bill and no suggestions measures are being slipped into it about which we know nothing.  </p> <p> The Bill deals with health issues, in particular the cross-Border directive and the treatment abroad scheme, which is to be welcomed.  It also deals with the Industrial Development Acts and the remit of Enterprise Ireland, which is also welcome.  </p> <p> There are provisions covering the single electricity market.  They are only precautionary and it is hoped they will not be needed.  </p> <p> Provisions are included for the continuance of Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants under the heading of education.  That is a practical measure which students will appreciate.  </p> <p> The Minister has outlined all of the financial provisions included in the Bill.  The VAT deferral item is of particular concern and will be welcomed as part of the Bill.</p> <p> There are provisions covering transport, the Harbours Act 2015 and ports.  I am that glad buses and trains will also continue to travel across the Border.  </p> <p> Citizens will appreciate the social welfare provisions and the assurance that benefits will continue to be paid.  </p> <p> There are many complex provisions covering justice issues, including extradition, warrants, immigration, the common travel area, visas and fingerprints, etc.  Those with an interest in justice issues will appreciate all of these provisions.</p> <p> This legislation is not the be all and end all in dealing with Brexit,  Therefore, we need to be kept informed on all of the other measures the Government is taking, as well as the issues that come within the competency of the European Union.  There has been mention of 20 statutory instruments being implemented.  As other speakers stated, we need more information on the additional measures being taken, particularly in the SME and agriculture sectors.  I am glad that the Minister is here, as I want to raise the issue of contingency planning at Dublin Port which is in his constituency in the event that there is a no-deal Brexit.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is examining the possibility of allowing lorries to park in one of the long-stay car parks at Dublin Airport to avoid traffic jams at Dublin Port.  In the event that there is a no-deal Brexit, it is envisaged congestion on the M1 and the M50 and in the Dublin Port tunnel is a real possibility arising from delays at customs.  The suggestion is the Dublin Port Tunnel may have to be closed and that alternative routes will have to be used by trucks to avoid congestion.  That would be of real concern for Dubliners, including my constituents.  If the Dublin Port tunnel was to be closed for any length of time, the whole city would snarl up.  To the best of my knowledge, it happened last Monday.  The Minister, the Department and Transport Infrastructure Ireland which manages the Dublin Port tunnel will have to give this issue serious consideration.  The one thing that will immediately annoy people in the event that there is a no-deal Brexit is traffic chaos in the city and leading into the port.  I hope all of the interested parties are dealing with that matter and preparing for it.  </p> <p> With reference to Northern Ireland, it is good to see that business and farming interests are making their voices heard on how they will be affected by Brexit.  It is unfortunate, however, that politics in Northern Ireland has become polarised, as we have seen in recent elections.  I was interested in the comments of the leader of the SDLP, Colum Eastwood, at the Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis.  He said there was a special place in hell for those calling for a Border poll at this volatile time.  It would be counterproductive to throw it into the mix now.  Moderate voices need to express that view in a very forceful way.  I have also spoken in the House before about the deterioration in Anglo-Irish relations arising from Brexit.  Other speakers have also mentioned the issue.  The peace process brought to an end 800 years of hostile relations and imperial oppression, as some like to refer to it.  We have come a long way from the Good Friday Agreement.  A lot of work will have to be done by the Government, all of us in the House, all other Members of the Oireachtas and our colleagues across the water to restore good harmonious relations which are in the interests of all citizens.  There are many connections between our two peoples, about which we need to be concerned.</p> <p> I have some concerns about our level of preparedness for Brexit at this stage.  My colleague Deputy McConalogue mentioned recruiting Customs officers and veterinary inspectors, about which there is confusion as to whether we are doing what we need to do to fulfil previous commitments on the timely recruitment of these personnel.  We also need more details on the provision of State aid for particular sectors of the economy, including SMEs and the agriculture sector.  </p> <p> I refer to the forthcoming elections to the European Parliament in May.  Deputy Shortall spoke about the need for voices of reason at this time, as we have witnessed a rise of populism and the hard right, in particular.  Citizens need to give serious consideration to the people whom they elect to the European Parliament.  We need to ensure the European Union will function effectively for all those of us who subscribe to its liberal democratic values.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-26a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="20:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022600047#WW00200"><p>T&aacute;im bu&iacute;och as an deis labhairt ar an mBiIle seo anocht.  Since the Brexit referendum result became clear in June 2016, we, in Sinn F&eacute;in, have been steadfast in stating Brexit presents the most serious social, economic and political challenges to the island in a generation.  That is the reality of the current situation.  Brexit presents a massive challenge, one that demands a thoughtful, purposeful and robust response.  The withdrawal agreement between the European Union and Britain that is on the table and the backstop contained within it are that response which by no means is perfect.  In fact, it is the bare minimum required to in the short term protect the Good Friday Agreement and ensure some safeguarding of our economic interests.  It is a legally binding guarantee that ensures there will be no return to a hard border on the island and that the interests of citizens in the North, the majority of whom voted against Brexit, will be protected.  However, it falls short on the promise that the rights of citizens in the North would be protected.  I refer to the rights and protections afforded to other Irish citizens living in the European Union being extended to citizens in the North.  We already see the assumption of the British system that all those who live in the North are British citizens.  In their eyes, Irish citizens living in the North are foreigners in their own land.</p><p>The Irish Government and the EU have much to do to ensure that the rights and entitlements of people in the North, including the right to political representation, are protected.  To date the Government and the EU have failed to secure these rights.  The legislation before us, the so-called omnibus Bill, does not deal with the long-term issues.  No British Government should have the ability to set aside the wishes of the people in the North and impose Brexit.  The Border is the problem, and as Brexit so amply demonstrates this is not just an Irish problem.  It is a European problem also.  Unfortunately, a mere five weeks from Brexit the British Prime Minister continues to renege on the deal that she made.  She has sought to play blink with the EU and demand changes that she cannot secure and which must not be conceded.  Today the Brexit shambles continues at Westminster.  The reality is that the backstop is required to protect our agreements and our economy.  It is required to ensure there is no hard border.  This is not simply the position of Sinn F&eacute;in, the Irish Government, the Irish State or, indeed, the EU.  This was the position of Theresa May when she spoke to us before Christmas, yet she now says that it is not required or that it can be time-limited.  Today she said it was her deal, no deal or further negotiation.  All the while, uncertainty and instability grows. </p> <p> The time for stalling is over.  There is a deal on the table, and the British Government and Parliament must now honour that agreement.  There is a cohort of Brexiteers who do not deal in reality.  They believe in Brexit at any cost, and if that cost is chaos in Ireland, a hard border and the ripping up of our agreements, so be it.  That is their view.  They do not want to be in the European Union.  We know that much.  They do not want a withdrawal agreement and they do not want a backstop.  For them, Ireland is inconsequential.  Our economy, our citizens and our agreements are collateral damage in their fight to recapture their imperial past.  It is our job to ensure that does not happen.</p> <p> I share the view of the T&aacute;naiste when he says we do not want to see this Bill enacted.  What we want is a solution.  We never wanted Brexit in the first place and we certainly do not want the chaos it will cause.  That is why the people of the North rejected Brexit; because they recognised the folly of one part of our island being inside the European Union and the other being outside.  The consequences of that are now upon us.  The British Prime Minster tells us she wants a deal but she already has a deal.  Today she told us that Parliament will decide if there is to be no deal.  She is the Prime Minister who has refused to rule out no deal.  She is now telling us she may seek an extension to Article 50 while also saying that an extension will not resolve anything.  That is why we must prepare for the worst-case scenario.  That is why we must face up to the prospect that in a couple of weeks we could be in a no-deal situation, despite the wishes of the people of this island, North and South.</p> <p> It is an outrageous proposition that nobody here wants, but it is being foisted on us by those who do not care one iota for Ireland, our interests or our people.  Shamefully that cohort includes the DUP.  That party knows that a hard Brexit will damage this island, but its members are content with that situation because in their view the return of a hard border is the acceptable cost of the union with Britain.  They are wrong.  The DUP does not represent the view of a majority of citizens in the North.  They got it wrong during the referendum debate, they were wrong in its aftermath and they are now very wrong about the withdrawal agreement and the backstop.  It is disappointing and in fact disturbing that the DUP has sought to take the side of Tory Brexiteers and the likes of UKIP over the needs and aspirations of citizens in the North and across the island.  However, that is their decision.  Their decision is to be reckless and irresponsible.  The truth is that ordinary citizens in the North, whether they are republicans, nationalists, unionists or otherwise, recognise that Brexit is not good and they want a deal that protects their livelihoods and their futures.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in speaks for all communities on this, not for narrow interests.  We have brought our view to Europe, to the Irish Government and to the British Government consistently over the last year and a half and more.  When we first articulated a policy of special status for Ireland and for the North, some of the parties in this D&aacute;il accused us of grandstanding.  They told us it was unrealistic.  Yet it has since become the agreed EU position in negotiations.  I believe we had a huge impact in that regard.</p> <p> I have made the point here before that Brexit is not a temporary thing.  It has consequences that are very real, lasting and enduring.  They are for keeps.  To combat those, we need a solution to match.  Sinn F&eacute;in will be supporting the Bill before us tonight.  We believe it can and should be strengthened and we will bring forward amendments to that effect.  However, I must state this clearly that the Bill before us is not the catch-all solution to a no-deal scenario that the Government has sought to portray it as.  It is in fact just one of the multifaceted responses that are required and which must be adopted as a matter of urgency by all of us here in this D&aacute;il.</p> <p> The Bill deals with some of the things that will impact immediately on people&rsquo;s daily lives in the event of a no-deal Brexit, things like access to healthcare, cross-Border travel, access to education and pension entitlements.  Dealing with these matters is absolutely necessary and nobody here could argue against ensuring that the contingency measures in this Bill are put in place and are ready, if required, though hopefully never needed.  That is a reasonable proposition and one which we wholeheartedly support.  Where we may differ with the Government, although I hope this is not the case, is with regard to what else is required in the event of a no-deal scenario.  Much more is required.  In addition to dealing with what the Bill before us does, we need to look at the bigger picture.  While this Bill deals with important day-to-day matters it does not address the very real economic consequences of a crash-out Brexit or the prospect of the imposition of a hard border on our island.</p> <p> Our country in its entirety will be the country most affected by Brexit apart from Britain itself.  That will be felt in ways that are out of proportion to anything that might be experienced by other countries in the European Union.  That is why we need, and why we in Sinn F&eacute;in have compiled and called for, a comprehensive medium-term plan for dealing with the economic impact of a no-deal Brexit.  The first part of that must be to mitigate the effects of Brexit in the very short term through legislative measures, some of which are dealt with in the Bill before us.  The next part of the strategy must be to ensure that we overcome the disruption of Brexit through medium-term investment in capital and social infrastructure.  That is why we have proposed the development of a &euro;2 billion Brexit stabilisation fund.  This should be put in place to complement, not to substitute for, any EU supports that are forthcoming in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  We need supports for small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, in vulnerable sectors as well as targeted capital investment in our ports, roads and airports and in housing, health, and education.  Enterprise Ireland has said that up to 25,000 jobs could be lost in a no-deal scenario.  This would be catastrophic and we need a plan on the shelf for that prospect.</p> <p> There is a need for direct Government support for those importers and exporters that trade exclusively with Britain.</p><p>The majority of these businesses are small to medium-sized enterprises and lack the scale of resources to easily change practices that have been so many years in the making.  That means taking on board the concerns of stakeholders, mitigating, where possible, the effects of Brexit and investing in the future to overcome the structural changes in supply and trade that Brexit will bring.</p> <p> We must also accept that Brexit does not just affect businesses.  It affects communities and people as well, and any Brexit strategy worth its salt needs to reflect and address that reality.  That must be put in place without delay.</p> <p> As I said, there is a gap in this legislation.  It fails to address the fundamental issue at the heart of the current crisis - partition.  The third and most crucial aspect of our contingency planning must be to look to the future and to the constitutional arrangements on this island.  I have made the case on numerous occasions, and I will do so again, that in the event of a no-deal scenario it is absolutely incumbent on the British Government to put the constitutional future of the North to the people in a referendum on Irish unity because if the people of the North are to be disregarded, then the people of the North must have their say in respect of their future.  In a series of polls, a majority in the North have indicated that in a no-deal scenario, they would vote for a united Ireland.  Similar polls indicate likewise here in the South.</p> <p> It is now time for the Government to heed those views from across the island and to indicate clearly that it, too, wants to see a referendum being held in the event of a no-deal situation.  It is a more than reasonable position and one which all parties here should support.  It makes perfect sense because the European Council agreed in April 2017 that the whole of our island would be afforded membership of the EU in the event of national reunification.  That is what all of us here should be working towards.</p> <p> It seems some parties here have a problem with that view.  I have to say I do not understand that position because these are the same parties which are quite content to talk up their united Irelander credentials when it suits them but talk down the prospect of unity when they think it is politically expedient to do so.  I believe their position is the wrong position.</p> <p> I am talking chiefly, although not exclusively, about the shameful position of Fianna F&aacute;il on this matter.  It is now almost two years since Fianna F&aacute;il promised it would "within months" publish a roadmap to a united Ireland.  We are two years on.  There is no plan.  There is no roadmap, only the word "No".  Its hypocrisy is laid bare for all to see.  We are told that now is not the time to be talking about a unity referendum due to Brexit but now is absolutely the right time to be talking about unity as the undemocratic nature of partition is clear for all to see.  Never again can a British Government seek to impose its will on the people of Ireland.  Those days are over.</p> <p> The leader of the SDLP, or should I call him the Fianna F&aacute;il leader in the North, Colum Eastwood, said at the weekend that there is "a place in hell" for those advocating for a Border poll without a plan.  Someone should have told Colum how Fianna F&aacute;il has rejected proposals for a cross-party group to create such a plan for unity.  It will have another chance because we in Sinn F&eacute;in will bring forward amendments to this Bill calling on the Government to convene an all-Ireland forum on unity and for the Government to develop a White Paper on Irish unity.  Now is the time to talk about unity, to plan for unity and to secure and win unity polls, North and South.  I trust the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Taoiseach will support these measures and essential amendments to ensure there can be no Border on our island.</p> <p> The leader of Fianna F&aacute;il also raised the issue of the institutions in the North.  It is absolutely regrettable that the North's political institutions are down during the Brexit process, but that is the reality we face.  It is a disgrace that the Executive is not meeting but while the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il hurled from the ditch, Sinn F&eacute;in sought and secured a deal with the DUP, a deal that the DUP subsequently walked away from and, a year later, it has not walked back into the talks.</p> <p> I would remind the Fianna F&aacute;il leader that it was his northern sub-contractors that first walked out of the Executive.</p></speech>

The Fianna F&aacute;il leader&rsquo;s position is not surprising given the diatribe he greets us with here on a regular basis.  Throwing shapes and offering a running commentary on issues of the day are no substitute for political positions and principles, so I suppose the current leadership of the SDLP and Fianna F&aacute;il are very well matched.</p>  <p>  The prospect of a hard border would still be on us, as it is now, even if the institutions were in place.  That is a fact.  That is why we must not deal in the hypothetical but with the reality before us that we face the prospect of the introduction of a hard border on this island in a matter of weeks if there is no deal.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach have dodged this issue time and again.  I appreciate fully that they do not want to be seen as the Government that reintroduced a hard border on this island but that is what will happen if nothing is done because that is what the European Union rule book dictates, and we cannot allow that to happen.  That is why, in the event that a no-deal situation, the Government must immediately begin preparing for a referendum on Irish unity, preparations it should be undertaking in any event.</p>  <p>  The only way to ensure there is never again a hard border on our island is to remove the Border for once and for all.  It is the common sense, durable answer to a no-deal scenario and an absolutely essential component of the Government&rsquo;s contingency planning.</p>  <p>  Should we have this evening&rsquo;s Bill?  Yes.  Should we have an investment programme and emergency EU funding for vulnerable sectors?  Absolutely.  Should we have a unity referendum in the event of a no-deal scenario?  Most definitely, because the ultimate backstop for citizens in the absence of a withdrawal agreement is the Good Friday Agreement and if a no-deal situation transpires come 29 March, then we need, as per the Good Friday Agreement, a referendum on Irish unity.  That must happen and we must now prepare to prepare to plan to end partition and to remove the Border, the dilemma of the Border and the jeopardy of the Border from our island for once and for all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-26a.354" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="21:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022600049#YY00700"><p>I have not heard all the contributions but most of the ones I heard were supportive of the Bill and its provisions and indicated that the provisions were necessary to keep business, traffic and trade flowing in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  The Bill has all the hallmarks of emergency legislation.  What we are doing all this week and next week, in terms of passing this Bill, is striking in its rapidity and in the multitude of areas it covers.  In a way, it is emergency legislation.  I have no problem with that.  We have no problem with the fact we have to sit late to get the Bill through the House but it is because Brexit will threaten businesses and trade and that there is a clear need for some provisions.  However, we are moving heaven and earth yet again to respond to a crisis.  Some people will find parallels to the legislation that was rushed through this House in 2008 to bail out the banks, albeit over two weeks rather than two nights.  I am not arguing that this is not an emergency or that this Bill is not necessary but we should look carefully at what it does.  It raises the grants available to businesses affected from &euro;0.5 million to more than &euro;7 million under Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.</p><p>It covers up tax loopholes and tax credit facilities for businesses that might be affected by Brexit so that they can continue to avail of our flawed tax codes for corporation tax and capital gains tax.  It clearly flies in the face of much of the dogma that we have had forced down our throats in recent decades on what the State can and cannot do to interfere with the market because we are constantly told that the State cannot interfere with enterprise and the markets but here we are interfering in a very forthright manner.</p> <p> In the words of the Minister, the Bill seeks to safeguard our State and its institutions so the question I want to put is: if this is how we respond to an emergency, could we see single-minded determination - I would dearly love to see it - from this State, the Minister and everyone in the Government to rush through emergency legislation to deal with the other emergencies we face, such as the housing emergency and the climate emergency?  Why can the State not move heaven and earth to invest in State-owned institutions to deal with those emergencies?</p> <p> We must look at where this crisis originates from because it really is a crisis of the British State.  It is particularly a crisis of a section of the Tory Party, who whipped up anti-immigration sentiment and the worst kind of nationalism, namely, British nationalism, in order to stem the growth of the support that was rising for Corbyn and for his section of the Labour Party and to safeguard their own positions.  This is a battle within the British ruling class of two competing blocs in Britain and it is all about a decaying British empire on which the sun does not even rise anymore.  It is a decaying empire that is trying to reposition itself inside global capitalism to be able to compete with Brussels, Paris and Berlin and make the City of London great again.  I come from a political tradition that used to raise the slogan during the Cold War of "Neither Washington nor Moscow but international socialism."  The slogan today would rightly fit with "Neither London nor Brussels but with workers across Britain and across Europe."  I say this because both in Britain and in the European Union, the movers and the shakers of this crisis have no real interest in or how their machinations affect the lives of ordinary people.</p> <p> The main issue for us is that this Bill says nothing about the implementation of a hard border.  It says nothing about taking measures that could stop a Border being imposed on us by the European Union.  Despite what was said here in Parliament over a year ago, Jean-Claude Juncker and Michel Barnier have given no guarantee that they will not try to implement a hard border in this country.  There is no declaration by the Irish State as to what the Government will do in the event of a hard border being imposed on us.  For example, it does not offer abortion services to women in Northern Ireland, something that we are proud of having achieved down here.  After the referendum was passed, the first slogan to be chanted across the yard at Dublin Castle was "The North is next" but we have nothing to say to those tens of thousands of women in the North who are trapped without abortion services.  It does not say anything about building the kind of infrastructure that is needed to link the North and the South, such as decent railway lines between Dublin and Derry and Donegal and Derry.  It says nothing about the environment and the types of changes that we need to make to ensure that we battle climate change in a meaningful and effective manner.  Indeed, it says nothing about the proposal by the Tory Government to dump nuclear waste in County Down and that is a serious threat by the Tory Government.</p> <p> The bottom line is that if there is a hard border imposed on this country, either by the Tories through a hard Brexit on foot of their refusal to do a deal or by the European Union insisting that there be one, it behoves the Government to declare that we will have no truck with it and we will not implement a border by using civil servants, garda&iacute;, customs posts or any software or online equivalent that might try to track whatever happens on the Border.  Therefore, it behoves us to say that the best solution to a hard border is to have no border and that means giving the people, North and South, a vote on the outcome of whatever deal or no-deal happens.  The people of this island did not vote for a hard Brexit.  They did not ask for it and in that case they need to have a democratic vote on the outcome of whatever happens.</p> <p> It is absolutely legitimate to be sceptical of the European Union and at the same time to be against a hard Brexit because what it would do in this country is unthinkable.  Were a border to appear again in this country, 20 years after the Good Friday Agreement and the progress that has been made since then, it would be unthinkable.  It behoves the Government to have a response to that.  The best response is to look to the people for people power to oppose a hard border, to give them the vote in the first instance and if there is any attempt to physically impose it, to mount a mass movement in opposition to it, such as the movement that was mounted in opposition to the water charges, to defeat an attempt to implement such a hard border.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-02-26a.356" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1263" speakername="Michael Collins" time="21:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019022600050#ZZ00200"><p>With Brexit approaching, it will no doubt have important consequences for the Irish economy.  It is vital that this Government navigates its way through these uncertain waters with its head well screwed on.  We are all in the same boat, and it is so important that we work together and listen to the concerns of the people.</p><p>Brexit poses a number of major challenges for healthcare, especially our collaboration between Ireland and the UK and how patients from the Republic can access health services in the UK, including in Northern Ireland, and <i>vice versa</i>.  My main concern is for the cross-Border directive.  So far, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and myself have carried 26 busses to Belfast for cataract procedures.  Statistics released recently showed that 150 people travelled to the North in 2015, 1,025 in 2016, 2,011 in 2017 and up to the first four months of 2018, 1,422 had travelled at a cost of &euro;2.79 million.  That shows that there has been an explosion of people going to the North for procedures and patients receiving care in Northern Ireland as part of the cross-Border directive.  People from the Republic received high-tech treatment in the UK under the treatment abroad scheme.  While we have been give some reassurances, which are very welcome, that the cross-Border directive will remain accessible for people travelling from the Republic to Northern Ireland and the UK, I still seek more clarity on this issue.  A new basis will have to be agreed to support ongoing and future collaboration in health services and in ensuring timely and seamless access to treatments for patients.</p><p>We also need more clarity on other cross-Border service level agreements that exist as a result of collaboration and capital investment from both the Republic and Northern Ireland.  These include the provision of all-island paediatric cardiac surgery services for children with congenital heart disease at Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin in Dublin.  It is vitally important that during the Brexit negotiations, we remain vigilant that these agreements are not threatened.  There are also patients going from Donegal to Derry for cancer treatment, and it is very important that this continues.  It is not just the cross-Border directive; other agreements between the UK and the Irish Government need to be protected going forward.</p><p>On medical professionals such as doctors, we will need a bilateral agreement between Ireland and the UK to facilitate Irish graduates who complete their postgraduate training or spend a period of time in the UK before returning to Ireland.  It is vital that there will be continued mutual recognition of qualifications between Ireland and the UK as there are currently almost 3,200 doctors registered with the General Medical Council in the UK who received their primary medical degree in Ireland, and 742 doctors registered with the Medical Council in Ireland who received their primary medical degree in the UK.</p><p>We need to pay particular attention to the agricultural sector.  Brexit is already causing chaos to the Irish agricultural industry.  As I mentioned today in a question, at the very mention of Brexit, factories lowered the price of cattle about two years ago.  It has not recovered since and many beef farmers' livelihoods are being threatened seriously.  The uncertainty around Brexit is being felt hard by farmers on the ground as I have said.  Beef prices have taken a serious hit and prices for finished cattle are down by &euro;100 to &euro;150 per head.  The UK is Ireland&rsquo;s largest market for food and drink, with 40% of our food exports destined for the UK.  A reduction in access to the UK market would have a very negative impact on the Irish beef sector and potentially on the overall EU beef market.</p><p>The 270,000 tonnes of Irish beef exports to the UK represent almost 10% of the intra-EU beef trade.  The displacement of these exports would, therefore, have a serious effect on the overall EU market.  I was disappointed with the Taoiseach's reply to my question earlier today on looking at other markets.  The beef sector is on its knees.  Last weekend, I attended a beef forum meeting in Bantry along with more than 300 other people.  They are not making up stories.  This is the reality as it hits.  They are worried about the potential loss of the UK market and the price they will get for their cattle.  Earlier today, I asked the Taoiseach to consider opening the embassy in Tehran because the Iranians have indicated they would consider buying Irish beef if something like this happens.  He more or less dismissed it.  That does not look as though he is fighting to deal with our worries about losing the British market.  Last Thursday, we read in the <i>Irish Independent</i>about the potential loss of much of the UK market.  How will this be offset?  What are the thoughts of the Minister and the Government on this?<br/><br/>The Irish farming and food sectors have a higher dependence on the UK market compared to other sectors in Ireland, therefore making them the most exposed sectors to any negative economic impact of the UK's Brexit decision.  We really need to look at our diary industry.  Ireland is the only significant exporter of cheddar cheese to the UK market and the UK market is the only market of significance for Irish cheddar.  We export 78,000 tonnes of cheddar cheese, most of which comes from Carbery in Ballineen in my constituency.  The people there have done excellent work over the years.  At present, they are doing much work to try to counteract what could be a very negative Brexit.  It is also very worrying for the many dairy farmers who supply them.  Irish exports account for 82% of all cheddar cheese imported by the UK.  It is vital that we have tariff-free access to the UK market.<br/><br/>We need to pay serious heed to the effects of Brexit on EU funding for farmers.The UK is an important contributor to the overall EU budget, providing 10.5% of funding.  In turn, some 37% of the overall EU budget is directed towards the Common Agricultural Policy.  Brexit is likely to have a significant negative effect on future spending on the CAP, particularly from 2021 onwards.  The EU will need to provide substantial financial support for Irish agriculture or many of our rural family farms will not survive.<br/><br/>I also have a big concern about employment levels.  The report by Copenhagen Economics for the Government estimates that the UK&rsquo;s departure from the European Union will cause the value of output from key parts of the agrifood sector to fall between 10% and 20% by 2030.  The agrifood sector employs 175,000 people and this could mean 17,000 fewer jobs, or more than 30,000 fewer jobs were there to be a hard Brexit.<br/><br/>We cannot forget about our ports and fishermen and the effect Brexit will have on them.  In my constituency we have ports such as Bantry Bay, Castletownbere, Union Hall and Kinsale.  Their futures need to be secured.  I plead with the Government to support these ports through the uncertain times that lie ahead with Brexit on the horizon.  Recent days and weeks have shown us that we are in very uncertain times regarding Brexit, which is especially the case for many of our industries, including fisheries.  When Ireland first joined the EU, fishermen got a shockingly bad deal in the negotiations for membership.  We got small and unfair access to European waters.  People can now install an app on their phones that will allow them to see the number of foreign vessels in Irish waters.  It is astonishing.  With the introduction of fish quotas, Irish fishermen were at a disadvantage from the start.  Big European factory ships have blown our Irish fishing fleet out of the water.  When I see on the app so many foreign vessels on our shoreline it is quite scary, to be quite honest.  Our fishermen have been left high and dry.  They play a major part in our country but there are very few debates on their livelihoods.  They have suffered for years under successive Irish Governments, which have failed to properly represent them in various quota negotiations in Europe.  Now, with Brexit, the fishing industry is at another crossroads and we need the Government to fight a strong case in Europe on behalf of fishermen.  Our fishermen and fisherwomen need to be protected in their own waters.  We cannot allow other European fleets to flood our waters post Brexit.  The quotas of Irish fishermen must be protected.<br/><br/>I had a fight with the Minister about applying for a bluefin tuna quota.  That request was continually refused.  Now I am grateful to see he has applied for a bluefin tuna quota and I hope it will be a great help to the fishing industry.  It should not be a fight.  We have to look at other markets if things go badly and this is one way to help.  It has now been agreed but it took a hell of an argument.<br/><br/>We need to protect all our export markets.  It is vital to maintain strong and competitive transport links with the rest of the EU in order to secure Ireland&rsquo;s economic future.  Two thirds of Irish exporters use the UK landbridge to access Europe.  Brexit will have a huge effect on Ireland&rsquo;s ability to use this route for exports.  We need to look at negotiating transport routes.<br/><br/>I have a big concern about driver licences.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the driver licence of a UK licence holder living in Ireland will not be recognised.  What will happen to Irish drivers in the UK?  Will they be in the same situation with regard to an Irish driver licence?  This area needs clarity.  I have been contacted by quite a number of people about it.<br/><br/>I have also been contacted by people worried about their citizenship and the cost of all this.  It is a very difficult time for people.  Thousands of people living here receive pensions and other payments from Britain, while Ireland also pays people who live in the UK.  I welcome the announcement that the Irish and British Governments have guaranteed the continued payment of State pensions, child benefit and other social welfare payments in the event of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal.  We need to ensure the future of Irish citizens living in the UK and <i>vice versa.</i>This is needs to be addressed urgently.  No Irish citizen living in the UK should have to live in fear.  We also need to ensure there will be freedom of movement between here and the  UK.  We need to look what will happen to Irish students studying in UK colleges.<br/><br/>My fear regarding Brexit lies with the people of rural Ireland and the negative effect it will have on rural Ireland.  In recent years, I have seen rural Ireland wither before my very eyes.  In my constituency, and I presume it is the same for other Deputies, I have seen the closure of schools, pubs, shops, butchers, cafes, restaurants, hairdressers, petrol stations and insurance offices.  We have also seen the closure of post offices.  My fear is what will happen to rural Ireland when the effects of Brexit kick in.<br/><br/>The Irish Hotels Federation has reported that nine out of ten hoteliers in Ireland are concerned about the impact of Brexit on their businesses.  I come from a beautiful part of west Cork where we are lucky to have such a high standard of hotels, from the Barleycove Beach Hotel in Goleen to Actons in Kinsale and every hotel in between.  The list of hotels is endless but one thing they all have in common is that they are highly dependent on tourism, in many cases from the UK.  There is no doubt that a disruptive Brexit could have serious economic repercussions that would be felt directly by the tourism sector given its heavy reliance on the UK market.  The tourism sector is already suffering as a direct result of the Government&rsquo;s increase in VAT from 9% to 13.5%.  Our tourism businesses have much to deal with, including the Brexit storm that is on the way, the increasing cost of business, such as insurance hikes, a slowdown in European growth and the increase in the VAT rate.  Having spoken to hotel owners I know they are very concerned about the Government's negative change in approach to tourism and the lack of recognition of the important role tourism plays in our economic growth.</p></speech>
