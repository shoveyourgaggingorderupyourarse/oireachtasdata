This should come as a surprise to nobody as Galway elected representatives have been highlighting this year after year.  In 2020 we had the second-lowest spend <i>per capita</i>of all counties, with only &euro;714 being spent per person in our county, compared with more than &euro;1,000 in Clare, more than &euro;1,200 in Leitrim and almost &euro;1,200 in Longford.  In a ten-year period from 2008 to 2018, the funding fell from &euro;160 million to &euro;112 million.  This has since been increased, although not in the past year, and it is still &euro;25 million less than it had been.</p><p>Galway County Council has consistently had a budget <i>per capita</i>that was not only millions of euro less than the closest comparator but also millions of euro below the average of comparators.  We need urgent action from the Government on this and it must immediately engage with Galway County Council and councillors in this regard.</p><p>T&aacute;imid i ng&eacute;arch&eacute;im i gContae na Gaillimhe, faoi l&aacute;thair, ins&iacute;m don Aire St&aacute;it.

Looking at Ireland's top five counties in terms of size, the funding appropriated to Galway is astonishing.  I have raised this question with the Minister a number of times but it still has not been explained to me why when we consider the top five counties in Ireland in terms of size, there are such major funding discrepancies.</p><p>Last year Oireachtas Members from Galway were given a presentation on funding at Galway County Council and it is important to put some of the comparisons laid out to us on the record.  In 2018, Kerry, Donegal and Tipperary - all smaller than County Galway - received funding of more than &euro;900 <i>per capita</i>, with Mayo receiving more than &euro;1,000 <i>per capita</i>.  Galway received &euro;670 <i>per capita</i>.  Increases were seen at that time across the board of between &euro;82 and &euro;121 but Galway's increase was &euro;22.</p><p>There are also a number of serious discrepancies when it comes to staffing numbers.  In 2018, Galway County Council had 757.61 whole-time equivalent staff.  Kerry, Mayo and Tipperary - again all smaller than Galway - had well over 1,000 whole-time equivalent staff.  This is not news to the Minister, who advised me in reply to a recent parliamentary question that he met a delegation from Galway County Council in April, and at that time he agreed that his Department would work with the delegation to explore the options available in order to put those finances on a more sustainable footing.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to tell us what has happened since.</p><p>The Minister of State knows the impact of these funding discrepancies affects every person living in County Galway.  It means roads cannot be maintained and less money for amenities.  It also means local authority housing cannot be maintained, and this affects every town, village and community.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-10a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="09:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000003#A01100"><p>I thank the Deputies for raising the matter and I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be very interested in the response as well.</p>  <p>  The system of municipal districts as a sub-county level of governance and decision making was introduced as part of the reforms brought about by the Local Government Reform Act 2014.  These reforms provided for the dissolution of 80 town councils and the establishment of 95 municipal districts in their place.  Within the local authority budget process, municipal districts consider draft budgetary plans before the plenary budget for the wider council, although different arrangements apply in city councils, where there are local area committees rather than municipal districts.</p>  <p>  Following consideration, municipal district members may adopt the draft budget with or without amendment.  The input from the municipal district members is important to the overall budgetary process and the chief executive of the local authority must have regard to any plan adopted.  However, if a municipal district does not adopt a budgetary plan, it does not prevent the continuation of the plenary budget process at county level.</p>  <p>  The plenary budget process for local authorities across the country is now under way and I understand Galway County Council will hold its initial meeting on 29 November.  The council has 14 days available after that date to adopt a budget for the year ahead and this is among the most important decisions the elected members of local authorities are required to make.  The adoption of a sufficient budget that balances local resources with local needs is a key statutory obligation of elected members.</p>  <p>  Critical to an effective and self-reliant system of local government is the management of local government finances to support the functions provided.  Local authorities have been notified of allocations from various funding Departments and agencies and it now falls to members to consider their overall resources, including how their income from commercial rates, goods and services and the local property tax can be allocated within the authority.</p> <p>While it is unfortunate that the municipal district members have seemingly not adopted budgetary plans, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has not been advised of that.  I advise all members to focus constructively on the forthcoming plenary budget to ensure that a budget is put in place for next year.  The elected members have legal responsibility for adopting the annual budget and are democratically accountable for all expenditure by the local authority.  They must make informed and necessary choices as part of this process.  Failure to adopt a plenary budget and determine an annual rate and valuation would be a clear contravention of a council's statutory functions.  The Minister notes that Galway County Council has not applied an increase in local property tax for a number of years, nor has it increased commercial rates since 2009.  Had Galway County Council availed of the opportunity to raise local property tax by 15% for 2022, it would have benefited from an additional &euro;2.2 million.  While such decisions are the democratic rights of the elected members, they must be prepared to take the necessary decisions on the other side of the equation.  Comparable counties along the western seaboard have raised the local property tax rate for next year.  Clare, Limerick, Donegal and Sligo have raised the rate by 15%, Mayo by 10% and Kerry by 7.5%.  Leitrim and Roscommon also raised the local property tax by 15% for next year.  Galway County Council is among the exceptions, yet seeks extra funding from the centre.</p> <p> As stated, it would not be appropriate to increase the funding for Galway County Council only, particularly if the members are reluctant to use local revenue-raising powers.  Such an approach could undermine the very principle of local decision-making and would effectively seek to transfer the responsibility for difficult decisions elsewhere.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-10a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1579" speakername="Mairead Farrell" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000004#B00200"><p>The Minister of State's answer is outrageous.  She said it would not be appropriate to increase the funding for Galway County Council only, but we have just outlined the fact that spending <i>per capita</i>for Galway County Council is significantly lower than in other counties.  It is not something that only Sinn F&eacute;in is arguing, but it is something that councillors from all parties are saying very clearly.  That is why they have rejected the budgets in the municipal districts.  They have been clear that there has been underfunding year after year.</p><p>The Minister of State also said that had Galway County Council availed of the opportunity to raise local property tax by 15%, it would have an additional &euro;2.2 million.  The point is that if the same revenue budget <i>per capita</i>was available to the council as is available to its closest comparator, there would be an additional budget of &euro;43 million.  If the same revenue budget <i>per capita </i>was available to the council as is available to its average comparators, there would be an additional budget of &euro;52 million.  That is an enormous amount of money that Galway County Council and the people of Galway county are losing out on.</p></speech>

It is clear when one looks at counties by size and population that Galway is not getting its fair share.  As I said, it is the second largest county in Ireland.  We have reached crisis point in Galway and we need the Government to act.  It is not good enough to say the council could have increased local property tax or raised revenue through increased commercial rates.  We are looking at the amount of money given across all local authorities and there is a clear discrepancy in the funding available to Galway County Council.  It is not good enough to say it can raise money elsewhere.  We are looking at the exact figure the council is getting from central Government and there is a problem.</p>  <p>  There is a problem in the area of staff, particularly outdoor staff.  That has a considerable impact across County Galway.  I see it in Ballinasloe when it comes to the maintenance of roads or houses.  There is a big issue in that regard.  The Minister of State did not mention staff.  The council also has an acting chief executive.  It is interesting that chief executives are replaced almost immediately in neighbouring counties while Galway is left with an acting chief executive.  It is not good enough and we need action.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-10a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="09:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000004#B00400"><p>I will conclude by examining the supports that have been provided to Galway County Council in recent years.  Across all schemes and funding sources, the Department provided &euro;51.1 million in 2019 and &euro;82.9 million in 2020 to Galway County Council.  The increase in 2020 was due to an increase in capital funding for housing as well as funding in respect of the unprecedented Covid-19 commercial rates waiver, additional expenses and lost income linked to the pandemic.  Galway County Council also uniquely received a once-off allocation of &euro;1 million for 2021.  This funding was linked to the operation of municipal districts and was subject to a small number of requirements, including that the funding be divided equally among the municipal districts.  The Department is currently reviewing correspondence from the council in respect of this funding to determine if each of the conditions have been complied with.</p>  <p>  The Department has recently confirmed an allocation towards the additional costs that will arise for local authorities in 2022 as a consequence of the national pay agreements and the unwinding of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation.  The allocation for Galway County Council will be &euro;4.44 million, the objective of which is to reduce the cost of pay and pensions next year.  In addition, local property tax allocations to local authorities for 2022 have been recently confirmed in the amount of &euro;524 million, a figure which includes the impact of local variation decisions.  The allocation to Galway County Council for local property tax is &euro;14.5 million.  This includes &euro;2.7 million of equalisation funding as the 80% of the local property tax retained locally in Galway's case is lower than the baseline or minimum funding level.  All local authorities have the opportunity to vary their local property tax rates by plus or minus 15%.  Galway County Council has opted not to avail of this opportunity since 2017.  Had it availed of the opportunity to raise the tax, the council would have benefited from an additional &euro;2.2 million.</p>  <p>  The adoption of a budget is probably the single most important duty that elected members are called on to carry out each year and I will take this opportunity to remind them of their responsibilities.</p></speech>

According to Irish Water, in the four-year period from 2017 to 2020, a total of 8.875 million cubic metres of untreated sewage and storm waters have been discharged into Dublin Bay from overflow tanks located at the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant.  That figure does not include other significant discharges from the 410 storm water overflows in the Dublin region, which are not measured but are thought to exceed the discharges in the Ringsend plant.  This equates to 3,550 full-size Olympic 50-metre pools over the four-year period and averages out at 74 Olympic pools full of untreated wastewater each month.  These discharges of untreated sewer wastewater usually occur during storm periods when the current Dublin wastewater treatment facility reaches maximum capacity and cannot cope with loads being received.</p>  <p>  As a representative for D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, I am aware, as are all representatives along the Dublin Bay coast, of the beauty of Dublin Bay.  We want to protect it.  Every time it rains, there is a seawater quality issue.  People swim in the sea all year round but it has become a part of the lifestyle of many more people since the pandemic.  It is a serious health issue that they do not know whether the water they are going into is clean.  They have an indication that if it has been raining, they should not go in for a couple of days, but the lack of transparency is a problem.  My constituents want to be able to pick up their phone and check an application to see whether the water is good right now, not whether the water was good two days ago or whether the water will be good two days from now.  There should be ongoing testing and live updates.</p>  <p>  Councils have made some improvements and one can see the water quality on Killiney beach and so on, but people want to be able to check so they do not pick up serious illnesses, as we know has happened.  People are interested in this.  Approximately 21,500 people have signed a Dublin Bay petition organised by an excellent expert and advocacy group, SOS Dublin Bay.  It is a live issue and features all of the constituencies along Dublin Bay.</p>  <p>  There is also a serious concern that Ireland, by failing to deal with this in the appropriate way, is in breach of the 2006 bathing water directive.  I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's points on that issue. </p>  <p>  I and other Deputies have raised this matter consistently.  Some 35 Deputies from the Dublin Bay area have signed a letter calling for year-round sea testing so our constituents have knowledge about whether or not the water is clean.  That would provide additional data as to where the difficulties are, and that can be quite nuanced.  There was a situation recently where the water on one beach was fine while the water on a neighbouring beach was seriously bad.  It was later discovered that was to do with migratory birds or something random like that and was not to do with the water system.  The key is having data for people to allow them to decide whether or not to get into the sea in the first instance.  We need year-round water testing.  We also need the ultraviolet technology in Ringsend to be used on a year-round basis so bathers can be protected.</p> <p>Its usage has been extended somewhat, but I do not know to what extent.  Perhaps the Minister has provided clarity on that in his script for the Minister of State to respond to me.</p></speech>

I thank her for raising the ongoing issues with water quality in Dublin Bay.  I point out that primary responsibility for the monitoring, management, protection and improvement of water quality is assigned to local authorities under the Local Government Acts and related legislation.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has had statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels, including investment in wastewater treatment plants and returning wastewater safely to the environment in an efficient and sustainable manner.  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, is the key statutory body for investigating complaints of pollution and for the enforcement, both directly and through oversight of Irish Water and local authorities, of environmental legislation in Ireland, including compliance relating to licensed urban wastewater discharges.</p>  <p>  As part of budget 2022, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage secured funding of more than &euro;1.57 billion to support water services.  This includes &euro;1.459 billion, comprising current expenditure of &euro;629 million and capital expenditure of &euro;830 million, in respect of domestic water services provided by Irish Water.  The overall investment will deliver significant improvements in public water and wastewater services, support improved water supplies across Ireland, including rural Ireland, and support a range of programmes delivering improved water quality in rivers, lakes and marine areas.  It is key to addressing Ireland's shortcomings in water and wastewater infrastructure, including compliance with the urban wastewater treatment directive.</p>  <p>  As regards Dublin Bay, the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant was originally designed and built to treat wastewater for a population of 1.64 million people and is now overloaded.  In response, Irish Water is currently undertaking a major upgrade of the plant.  This upgrade will increase the capacity of the plant to cater for the growing population of the greater Dublin area and will address compliance with EU law.  Planning permission was granted for the project in April 2019 and the project is current under way.  In addition, officials are currently examining the most suitable options to provide for safe bathing water during the winter months and improve the dissemination of information in respect of bathing water quality, particularly in the Dublin Bay area.</p>  <p>  Both the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, have met several local interest groups regarding the Dublin Bay area, including the SOS Dublin Bay group, and are committed to developing a solution that will allow flexibility in respect of the bathing season and the protection of those who swim throughout the year.  Ongoing work by the Dublin Bay task group chaired by Dublin City Council is aimed at improving bathing water quality all year round.  The work of this group and the welcome commitment from Irish Water to operate its ultraviolet filter at Ringsend for a period outside of the bathing season are already providing improved protections for bathers while also improving our knowledge of the quality of bathing waters outside the defined season.</p></speech>

Obviously, my question is in respect of the fact that Irish Water is going to operate the ultraviolet filter at Ringsend for a period outside the bathing season.  As the Minister of State is aware, the bathing season lasts for three months in summer.  My question to the Department is about how long Irish Water will operate the filter.  Will that be publicised and constituents informed of it?</p>  <p>  As regards the Irish Water upgrade, the Minister of State is absolutely right.  I met representatives of the body a very long time ago in respect of this problem and they told me the ongoing works in the Shanganagh catchment drainage area plan programme and the west pier and Ringsend catchment drainage area plan will not be completed until 2023 and 2024, respectively.  I believe that completion just relates to analysis and planning, never mind actually getting down to doing the work.  Dr. Eimear Cotter, the director of the EPA, has said that it is calling for additional water quality monitoring at beaches where there are a large number of year-round swimmers and for that information to be made available to the public.  That statement by Dr. Cotter validates and endorses the position I am taking and that of the 35 other Deputies who have signed up to this body of work.</p>  <p>  On 2 November, I received a response from the Department to a parliamentary question I tabled on this issue and the response of the Minister of State mirrors it very closely.  However, a section of that response has been left out of her script today, and I query it.  It states that departmental officials will examine options with the bathing water expert group at the next meeting of the group, which is in December.  The part of the response that I do not understand states that the group will undertake a robust analysis of the positive and negative consequences of each of the options and, in particular, the Minister is aware that the group will wish to ensure existing summer time bathing water designations are not jeopardised in the short term as a consequence of weather-affected winter sampling results, while also providing protection to those bathing in Dublin Bay all the way through the year.  I do not even understand that in English, never mind in policy or political terms.  I assume it is not some class of threat or a case of being one or the other.  I encourage the departmental officials, who I hope are watching these proceedings, to embrace a philosophy of being able to do both.</p></speech>

It is interesting that all 35 Deputies across the Dublin area have signed the letter in question and are very concerned.  She is right in what she said.  Many people now swim all year around.  They do not swim only during the summer season, as we call it.  Today is a mild day and I am sure there are plenty of people in swimming today in their bathing suits.</p>  <p>  As regards the Deputy's remarks, officials are currently examining the most suitable options to provide for safe bathing water during the winter months and improve the dissemination of information in respect of bathing water quality, particularly in the Dublin Bay area.  Officials will examine options with the bathing water expert group at its next meeting.  The group will undertake a robust analysis of the positive and negative consequences of each of the options.  I am not particularly sure what that means.  The next meeting of the group is expected to take place in early December, after which the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage will give consideration to the most appropriate option for amending the regulations.   I have no doubt this issue will come to the floor of the D&aacute;il again.</p></speech>

Having listened to the previous speaker, the Minister of State is probably going to become an expert in water and water quality.  Deputy Burke and I wish to speak about the issues relating to Carrignavar wastewater treatment plant, which is just 10 km north of Cork city.  We could probably name a dozen villages in the greater Cork area affected by this issue, but the specific issue at Carrignavar deserves scrutiny, given that its potential for development in the coming years is limited as a result of the difficulties with its wastewater treatment plant.  Knockraha, Cloheen and Kerry Pike are just a few villages that are experiencing wastewater treatment issues, not to mention bigger towns such as Midleton, or Ballyvolane on the north side of Cork city, where the issue has been resolved recently.</p>  <p>  As I stated, Carrignavar is 10 km from Cork city centre.  It is a village of approximately 600 or 700 people, with probably another 1,000 people in its wider hinterland, and it has significant potential for growth in the coming years as it is so close to the city and is on the new BusConnects route.  It is well set up for development into the future.  The difficulty in respect of Carrignavar, as Deputy Burke will also summarise, is that the wastewater treatment plant has been at capacity and overloaded since I became a councillor in 2014.  I refer to various reports by Irish Water through the years.  An environmental report published in 2019 states the plant is non-compliant, which is no surprise to us.  It has failed every aspect of its effluent monitoring report each year because it is overloaded.  The current organic loading is more than double the organic capacity of the plant.</p>  <p>  An Bord Plean&aacute;la recently decided on the application for a replacement school for Scoil an Athar Tadhg in the village.  Unfortunately, one of the conditions on the planning permission for the school is that it cannot increase its student population.  The school is indefinitely restricted to a student population of 338 pupils, along with 62 staff.  The student intake is restricted.  Not only that, the difficulty for the school is that it has a significant population of students with special needs.  There are difficulties there.  We are trying to encourage the school to grow and take on more students with special educational needs but it is restricted from doing so because of the indefinite plans relating to the wastewater treatment plant.  Does Irish Water have plans to upgrade the plant in the short term?</p></speech>

It is so serious that the Inland Fisheries Board objected to planning permission for the school and took the matter all the way to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  As a result, there is now a condition that means the school cannot increase its numbers.  I understand that the new county development plan will allow for only ten additional houses to be built in the area over the next five years.  A large number of people want to live and rear a family in the area but now we have the problem with the school.  There are more than 350 students in the school.  As my colleague outlined, the school is dealing with students with special needs.  It was so important to build a new school because 70% of the buildings in the existing school are prefabs.  Despite this, the matter went all the way to An Bord Plean&aacute;la because the Inland Fisheries Board was so concerned about the treatment plant not having the capacity to deal with any increase in numbers in the school, let alone an increase in housing.</p></speech>

Irish Water takes a strategic, nationwide approach to asset planning, investment and meeting customer requirements.  The prioritisation and progression of individual projects and programmes is a matter for determination by Irish Water.</p>  <p>  Irish Water delivers its services in accordance with its statutory water services strategic plan for the period 2015 to 2040, which sets out a high-level strategy over 25 years to ensure the provision of clean, safe drinking water, the effective management of wastewater, environmental protection and support for economic and social development.</p>  <p>  The Minister's primary responsibility and focus are to ensure Irish Water has a policy direction, through the water services policy statement, that is properly structured to deliver effective and efficient public water services and to ensure it is funded sufficiently in respect of domestic water services.  The programme for Government commits to funding Irish Water's capital investment plan for water infrastructure on a multi-annual basis.  The national development plan for the period 2021 to 2030 commits to a capital investment of almost &euro;6 billion in Irish Water, which everyone welcomes.  Of the investment, more than &euro;4.5 billion will be voted Exchequer funding in respect of domestic water services.</p>  <p>  As part of budget 2022, the Minister secured more than &euro;1.57 billion to support water services.  This includes &euro;1.459  billion for domestic services provision by Irish Water.  This investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and wastewater services, support improved water supplies right across urban and rural Ireland and support a range of programmes delivering improved water quality in our rivers, lakes and marine areas.</p>  <p>  To get to the nub of the question that both Deputies asked on the facility at Carrignavar, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, understands from Irish Water that the Carrignavar wastewater treatment facility has not been listed as a high priority by Cork County Council in the small towns and villages growth programme.  Irish Water will consider the position in the context of future investment planning, having regard, in turn, to Cork County Council's priorities for its land-use planning responsibilities.</p>  <p>  Both Deputies mentioned that 70% of the school is prefabricated.  They stated there was an objection to the planning permission by the Inland Fisheries Board.  Considering what both of them said, Cork County Council will have to revisit the fact that this has not been listed as a high priority.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-10a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1521" speakername="P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan" time="09:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000006#D00300"><p>I should have acknowledged initially that there was a great investment in water infrastructure right across the country as part of the last budget.  However, the Minister of State said Cork County Council and Irish Water have not prioritised the matter.  I have seen the council's wastewater treatment plant priority list.  Carrignavar comes somewhere in the middle.  Ultimately, however, it is the call of Irish Water, which said there is no funding for the project.  This is unfortunate.  The Minister of State is saying a strategic, nationwide approach is taken to these matters but the problem in Carrignavar is symptomatic of a wider problem.  It is one village but we could name 20 or 30 across Cork county.  There are probably hundreds of villages across the country whose development is on permanent pause.  It is unfair on people in Carrignavar, the school-going community and the principal, who will try to get more staff and attract more pupils to the benefit of his school.  I hope that on foot of this morning's question, Irish Water will revisit the issue and carry out whatever assessment is appropriate to improve the chances of Carrignavar getting what it needs.  As Deputy Burke and I both said, to restrict a village ten minutes from the city centre to ten units over the next six years is somewhat incredible.</p></speech>

That is a very small number for the county overall.  Maybe it is time that the Department started considering public&ndash;private partnerships in respect of the development of necessary infrastructure because we cannot afford to wait.  The populations of Cork county and city are growing dramatically.  Nine of the world's top ten pharmaceutical companies are based in Cork.  The employment number is increasing the whole time.  Therefore, the number of people who reside in the area is increasing.</p></speech>

Irish Water, the public water utility, has developed a long-term investment perspective to address strategically the many deficiencies in the public wastewater system.  It is optimising investment decisions to ensure it utilises scarce capital by making investments that deliver the best possible service improvements for communities.  Irish Water will have to consider its investment plans in line with the significant funding being made available to it now and in the years ahead over multiple investment cycles.  Maybe it would be a good idea to raise again with Irish Water the fact that sufficient ring-fenced funding has been provided under the national development plan for the next five years.  There was a matter in my constituency that I have since raised because of the extra funding that has been provided.</p>  <p>  The Minister is ensuring that Irish Water is on a sustainable funding path and has the significant sustained investment required to ensure the continued operation, upgrade and repair of the county's water and wastewater infrastructure to support housing delivery and economic growth in the years to come, including in areas such as Carrignavar.  I have no doubt but that this matter will be raised on the floor of the House again and that we will hear more about Carrignavar and the expansion of the school.</p></speech>

I appreciate that his colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, is abroad at COP26 but I wanted to take the opportunity to raise this matter.  My colleagues, Deputy Harkin, Deputy Kenny, and the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, and I all agree that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, seems to be on the verge of granting prospecting licences for gold-mining in north County Leitrim.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, will be aware, in 2019 we declared a climate and biodiversity emergency in Ireland.  In recent weeks we issued our carbon budgets.  The Minister of State's party leader is at COP26 this week to advance Ireland's co-operation on the global climate action strategy that will be required to stop prohibitive temperature rises here in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Significantly, County Leitrim, in the north west of the country, is the only county where planning permission cannot be got at the moment because of soil quality.</p> <p>Many efforts are under way to try to devise a sustainable solution that would allow rural farming families and their children to secure planning permission in the area.</p> <p> The Minister of State will appreciate that it beggars belief that any party in Leinster House, much less the Green Party and its leader, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, would give prospecting licences to gold-mining companies.  The company concerned, Flintridge Resources Limited, is connected to another company called Omagh Minerals Limited, which had a licence in this area previously.  That company breached the guidelines it was to follow regarding informing landowners of prospecting and liaising with them in that regard.  That was not done.</p> <p> In addition, as I am sure the Minister of State is well aware, gold mining is the most disruptive form of mining.  It can lead to contamination of the water table and it has led to cyanide, zinc and other chemicals entering the water table.  In a parallel to what is proposed in north county Leitrim, our neighbours in county Tyrone have experienced a terrible situation with a company called Dalradian Resources.  It was the subject of a BBC "Spotlight" programme that showed how the community there has been destroyed by the proposal to carry out mining.  The key point is that Flintridge Resources Limited has the same executives as Omagh Minerals Limited.  That company did not contact any landowners in the area in the past.</p> <p> The people of north Leitrim have a vision for their county in line with the global vision for a circular economy.  It is a vision of sustainability, one that nurtures and supports the rural economy with sustainable farming methods and secures a future for their families in the local area.  It is not consistent with our actions, in advance of total agreement, debate and implementation of a directive on the circular economy from Europe, for us to proceed in this way with what is the most disruptive form of mining, namely, gold mining.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-10a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="09:52:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000007#E00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  This issue was the subject of discussion last week during a Topical Issue debate and I welcome the opportunity to debate it again.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications published a notice of intention to grant two mineral prospecting licences in north Leitrim in local newspapers on 7 October 2021.  Submissions on these applications were invited until 7 November, which was last Sunday, and no final decision has yet been taken on whether to grant the two prospecting licences.  All valid submissions will be considered before a final decision is made.</p>  <p>  Mineral exploration, prospecting and mining are often confused with each other.  Mineral exploration is not mining.  They are two very different activities, given their potential environmental impacts and scale.  Different regulatory rules apply to each undertaking.  A prospecting licence relates to the activity of exploring for minerals only and it does not give the licence holder permission to mine.  Most prospecting activities are temporary and involve minimal disturbance.  All proposed exploration activities are the subject of environmental screening by the Department.  This ensures that they will not give rise to any significant adverse effects on the environment.  Furthermore, no intrusive prospecting activities, such as drilling or trenching, can be undertaken without the express consent of the landowner or tenant.  It is also worth noting that few prospecting licences ever lead to mining.</p>  <p>  I stress again that a prospecting licence does confer the licensee with any rights which would allow it to undertake mining.  Mining requires three additional and separate consents.  Planning permission must first be obtained from the local authority.  This involves a full environmental impact assessment, EIA, and public consultation.  The activity of mining then also requires an integrated pollution control, IPC, licence from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and that process also involves a full environmental impact assessment and public consultation.  In addition, a mining lease or licence is also required, and this is sought from the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications.  A mining lease or licence, if granted, is not granted until after planning permission and an IPC licence are in place.</p>  <p>  The Department is finalising a draft policy statement on mineral exploration and mining and submissions received as part of a public consultation that concluded on 15 October are being considered.  The Government will consider the draft policy statement early next year.  It highlights the role of minerals in our everyday lives and the critical role they will play in our transition to net-zero emissions and carbon neutrality by 2050.  The draft policy recognises that we need to reuse and recycle more minerals and metals, but the document also accepts that this alone will not supply the quantity of minerals required to decarbonise our energy system through solar power, renewable wind energy and batteries.  Relying on imported minerals risks these activities being developed in parts of the world where less stringent environmental and human rights standards apply.  It also risks our ability to secure the supply of minerals needed to make the green and digital transitions.</p>  <p>  A key priority in the draft policy statement is to build public understanding of, and trust in, the mineral exploration and mining sector.  During the public consultation on the draft policy statement, the acceptance by communities of exploration and mining operations and the provision of information that is easily understood emerged as key issues.  These issues will be taken forward by the Department with the help of an advisory group on mineral exploration and mining which will be established shortly and will draw on as broad a range of views as possible.</p>  <p>  Regarding the specific prospecting licence applications advertised recently in north Leitrim, a final decision will be made following consideration of the submissions received.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the decision has not yet been made.  That is why we are here.  The people of north Leitrim are not in any way stupid and they fully understand the difference between prospecting and mining.  However, we are getting in early this time.  We want to ensure that this process does not proceed and that companies will not be misled into feeling they will be able to undertake mining in the area.</p>  <p>  Gold has nothing to do with the just transition.  There is no shortage of gold in the world.  I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, casually in the corridors last week about this.  I am sure he will not mind me sharing the information here.  During our conversation, he asked me if I had a phone.  I said I did, and the Minister pointed out that there was gold in my phone.  I am aware of that too.  There is no shortage of gold in the world, although there is a shortage of energy and that does not stop us, collectively, trying to move to use renewable energy.  We are importing peat, yet we have closed our bogs.  If we have a debate on gold being needed because there is gold in our phones, I will win.  Someone may say that gold is a necessary part of a just transition to a more sustainable economy but it is not.</p>  <p>  The key point here is that another manifestation of Flintridge Resources Limited, that is Omagh Minerals Limited, had licences previously.  It did not follow the guidelines and did not consult people in the area.  The main submission among the 4,000 submissions I have been told were made is one from the community group, Treasure Leitrim.  Its submission contains statements from 12 of the main landowners in the area stating they were never consulted.  Omagh Minerals Limited, the sister company of Flintridge Resources Limited, has stated it prospected in the area and did all the necessary things but there was no liaison with the landowners.</p>  <p>  We do not need this activity.  We must listen to the will of the people of the area.  Dare I say it, if this was happening in Ranelagh or Irishtown, I am sure the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, would not be interested in it going ahead.  Equally, if this was occurring in Galway, I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would not be supporting it, nor indeed would any of us support it.  It is not a case of NIMBYism.  If this was something we genuinely needed, I could understand it to an extent.  As I said, the people of north Leitrim have a vision for their area and it is far removed from the cold profitability of a Canadian company.</p></speech>

It means that 432 teams are actively prospecting, in many cases for gold, in different places all over the country.  Some of those sites are within the Deputy's constituency in Sligo.  It is this particular instance in Leitrim that has drawn considerable attention, not just from the Deputy but also from his constituency colleagues, Deputies Harkin and Martin Kenny.</p>  <p>  That may perhaps be because Leitrim, especially north Leitrim, is a place that is particularly environmentally sensitive.  Local activist groups there have successfully managed to block fracking in the past and helped to change the national policy on that activity.</p> <p>There are also concerns about forestry, with evergreen trees putting people's homes in the shade, wind farm development and so on.  There has therefore been a lot of interest in what will happen.  That may be the reason Leitrim is the place where there has been a sudden interest in and a large movement concerned with gold prospecting.</p> <p> The process of getting a gold prospecting consent is similar to the planning permission process, to which Deputy MacSharry referred.  Anybody can apply for planning permission to build anything anywhere.  It is just an application.  Someone fills in the form and submits it with the fee.  That is what has happened in this case.  Any company can apply to prospect anywhere if it wants to do so.  It pays, I think, a &euro;190 fee and applies.  That does not mean it will get a consent.  We should bear in mind as well that there are two mines in the whole of Ireland that are active, namely, the Tara lead and zinc mines and the gypsum mines in Monaghan.  Of the 242 active teams and many thousands of groups that have obtained consents and drilled hundreds of thousands of boreholes, only two mines ever came out of any of that activity.  The chances of anything being mined are therefore extremely remote.</p> <p> I do, however, take the Deputy's concerns on board and I will relay them to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan.  A decision has not yet been made.</p></speech>

that as the second winter of the pandemic approaches, we are now contending with a cost-of-living crisis on multiple fronts;<br /><br />&mdash; that the Government&rsquo;s climate action policies are having a profound socio-economic impact on everyone;<br /><br />&mdash; the key EirGrid report (operator of the national grid) warning that Ireland could face electricity deficits for the next five winters;<br /><br />&mdash; the EirGrid prediction that low availability of power plants in Ireland was likely to contribute to the energy issues faced by the country this winter;<br /><br />&mdash; that there have been at least 31 energy price hikes by suppliers this year, meaning bills skyrocketing by as much as &euro;805 for some customers, leaving the country in the grips of an energy crisis;<br /><br />&mdash; that electricity prices in Ireland are the highest in the European Union (EU), according to Eurostat;<br /><br />&mdash; the warning from the Irish Road Haulage Association that the all-time high record increases in petrol and diesel are &lsquo;crippling the sector&rsquo; and increasing all consumer goods, as a consequence of increased transport costs;<br /><br />&mdash; that soaring petrol and diesel prices will continue to rise unless the Government stops heaping taxes on consumers;<br /><br />&mdash; that soaring petrol and diesel prices are disproportionately affecting people in rural Ireland, who have very limited access to public transport and alternative fuel sources;<br /><br />&mdash; that currently the motorist is paying approximately &euro;1.70 for a litre of petrol, of which &euro;1 (around 60 per cent) goes directly to the Government, mainly via excise duty, carbon taxes and VAT;<br /><br />&mdash; that the Government will increase the price of petrol and diesel even further from 1st January next, when the increases from Minister Eamon Ryan&rsquo;s &lsquo;Energy Efficiency Obligation Scheme&rsquo; and &lsquo;Biofuels Obligation Scheme&rsquo; kick in, with consumers facing a hike of a further three cents per litre;<br /><br />&mdash; that the Government-imposed carbon tax (now at &euro;41 per tonne of carbon) is having a bruising impact on the cost of home heating oil, electricity, petrol and diesel;<br /><br />&mdash; that the Government&rsquo;s skimpy fuel allowance increase announced in Budget 2022 is grossly insufficient;<br /><br />&mdash; that research by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul (SVP), earlier this year (and before recent price hikes), reported that many people had already been cutting back on heating or electricity due to cost, including 42 per cent of people unable to work due to illness or disability; that&rsquo;s almost one in three renters and 36 per cent of one-parent families;<br /><br />&mdash; that Government-imposed taxes on fuel and energy are having a profound impact on all rural residents, who have no alternative but to use oil to heat their homes and to use their cars to commute to work and bring their children to school;<br /><br />&mdash; that the European Commission developed a &lsquo;toolbox&rsquo; of measures to mitigate the short-term surge, encourages member states to cut taxes and levies that typically account for around a third of energy bills;<br /><br />&mdash; that the Irish Government blatantly objected to a fundamental change to the EU&rsquo;s energy market, proposed by Spain and France, which would have brought about reduced energy costs and greater security of supply, through a new joint energy procurement initiative;<br /><br />&mdash; that Irish produced gas has four to thirteen times less carbon intensity than the natural gas we import from the United Kingdom (UK);<br /><br />&mdash; that despite the benefits of Irish produced gas for the planet over imported gas, the Government made the illogical decision to ban future gas exploration in Ireland, through the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, which completely undermines our uncontested need for more gas-fired power generation to ensure continued security of electricity supply;<br /><br />&mdash; that Ireland&rsquo;s energy security is now at risk, due to frenzied Government bans on new gas explorations, by relying solely on the UK (who can control supply and price) for this country&rsquo;s gas supply to heat homes and provide electricity;<br /><br />&mdash; that in Spain, where energy prices increased by 35 per cent in the twelve months to August (less than in Ireland&rsquo;s case), the Prime Minister, Pedro S&aacute;nchez, has dialled back prices to what Spaniards paid in 2018, by cutting taxes and capping costs; and<br /><br />calls on the Government to:<br /><br />&mdash; immediately act on the European Commission DIY toolbox aimed at mitigating the impact of higher energy prices, by slashing taxes and offering help to impacted households, motorists and sectors such as agriculture and road transport;<br /><br />&mdash; immediately reverse the decision to increase the carbon tax in Budget 2022 and beyond, until the full impact of the energy crisis is fully understood and a cost-benefit analysis undertaken, by whatever parliamentary means necessary, including new legislation, if required;<br /><br />&mdash; reduce the excise duty on all motor fuel by 50 per cent until the energy crisis abates and a proper and common-sense plan for rural public transport alternatives is put in place in every rural community, and the purchase price of electric cars is affordable to the ordinary motorist;<br /><br />&mdash; reduce the excise duty on petrol (currently 62.77 cent per litre) and diesel (currently 51.9 cent per litre) by 50 per cent from now until at least the end of 2022, which alone would save up to &euro;18 on a &euro;100 fill up of petrol/diesel, for the regular motorist;<br /><br />&mdash; reduce VAT on all motor fuels, electricity, and home heating oil to below 5 per cent until the end of 2022;<br /><br />&mdash; establish a multi-million-euro discretionary fund to support energy costs for all low-income households and introduce a voucher (to be paid before Christmas) of at least &euro;250 for every low-income household in the State;<br /><br />&mdash; implement measures to ensure suppliers must commit to keeping the lights on for vulnerable and financially insecure customers and make sure that there are flexible options available for people to address energy debts;<br /><br />&mdash; fully recognise that for people in energy poverty assistance is needed in the present; while retrofitting offers a long-term answer to the high bills caused by inefficient and substandard housing; it is this winter that those people need the urgent support, not in some Governmental plan in six or seven-years&rsquo; time, as well as contributing to climate action targets;<br /><br />&mdash; allocate funding and implement an action plan to clear the piling backlog for applications under the home retrofitting schemes with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland; and<br /><br />&mdash; direct the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities into meaningful discussions with industry actors over how gas and coal-fuelled electricity plants, set to close their doors in the coming years, should instead be kept open to stave off a potential longer-term energy crisis.&quot;  </blockquote>  <p>Before I discuss this very important motion, I thank M&aacute;ir&iacute;n McGrath and Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill, who have helped us to put it together.  I also wish Deputy Mattie McGrath, our group leader, the very best.  He continues to recuperate from a recent illness.  Please God he will be back with us soon.</p><p>Some 94% of voters are concerned about the rising cost of living.  Consumers are facing higher charges at the fuel pumps and for their electricity and gas bills due to the surge in energy prices.  Data from <i>pumps.ie</i>indicate that in March 2021 petrol was &euro;1.33 per litre and diesel was &euro;1.24 per litre.  On 7 November, just three days ago, petrol was &euro;1.728 per litre and diesel was &euro;1.62 per litre, more in some places.  That is an average price increase of 30%.  The Government in VAT alone takes 12% from that increase in the price of petrol and about 9% from the increase in the price of diesel.  As the price of fuel increases, the Government gets more income.</p><p>There are a number of causes of the natural gas and oil demand surge.  Europe's unilateral reduction of its nuclear power capabilities and coal power production is one cause.  Chinese and other Asian coal output coming in below what is needed as the global economy recovered from Covid-19 is another.  As many power plants can switch between coal and gas, global competition for natural gas supplies has kicked in.</p><p>The energy price surge in Ireland is an extraordinary and urgent situation that requires urgent action.  The energy transition, ecological transition and decarbonisation the Government talks about are possible only if consumers and industries perceive the benefits of transition.  In Ireland, consumers are not experiencing any such benefits.  In fact, the opposite is the case, and many leading international economists are now warning that matters will get much worse.  In Ireland, EirGrid is now warning that heavy industry, business and householders face real-time risks of electricity outages during morning and evening peaks.  The Government has failed utterly to guarantee the security of electricity supply.</p><p>As for the financial impacts, I have no doubt that if there is a blackout in this country, the Government will be run out of the D&aacute;il, so it should be very careful if that is the outcome the people will have to suffer.  They are suffering enough in the pocket, but if they have to suffer mentally and physically because of the Government's inadequacies, I assure the Minister of State that its days are numbered.  Many Government Deputies' days are numbered in any case, judging by what the people out there tell me.  The financial impacts of the pandemic remain with the households and many families, having used up savings, are carrying the burden of debt from the extra costs and lower incomes of the past 18 months.  Worrying numbers of people identified by research commissioned by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul at the beginning of the year reported cutting back on heating or electricity due to costs.  They included 42% of people unable to work due to illness or disability, almost one in three renters and 36% of one-parent families.</p><p>Throughout this winter, those in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment will also see their incomes reduced as the payment is gradually withdrawn.  The main welfare rate onto which people will transfer has been shown to be inadequate and will remain so after it was increased by &euro;5 in January.  Data from the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice show that in 2021 the gap between social welfare for a single adult and the cost of a basic but decent standard of living is &euro;49 every week.  For a lone parent with two children, the weekly gap is &euro;82.</p><p>We are deeply concerned that this crisis will come to a head during the coming months as households are unable to find extra room in their budgets for escalating energy costs.  For those at risk of disconnection or those on prepayment meters who cannot afford to top up, this could mean being unable to afford to stay warm and keep the lights on.  That has serious health implications and is a situation that should be avoided at all costs.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, to imagine not being able to afford to turn on the lights or the heating.  There is no solution.  Deputy Leddin was in the House the other day saying the Government has no solution.  It has no solution, only continuing to hit people in the pocket harder and harder.  We already have the highest electricity prices in the whole of Europe so we cannot just say this is a global issue.  It is an Irish issue.</p><p>Household energy costs are rising at a rapid rate.  The Government must now step in and protect households facing significant arrears and acute risk of disconnection by establishing an emergency response fund.  The budget saw the fuel allowance extended to more people but, crucially, it still misses out on the low-earning families on working family payments.  For those households a discretionary fund to alleviate energy costs and debt will be vital.  Suppliers must commit to keeping the lights on for vulnerable and financially insecure customers and make sure that flexible options are available to people to address energy debts.</p><p>Weakening Ireland's economy will do nothing for the environment because our emissions are incredibly low, globally speaking, and because countries such as China can easily counteract whatever Ireland does with the flick of a switch.  It is bad enough that the Taoiseach went to the COP26 conference and made a large number of economically devastating promises in an effort to blow up his image for a global crowd.  He was treating Irish money like confetti thrown around at a wedding.  I do not know what game he was up to.  What he did not realise was the absence of any honest commitment on the part of countries such as China, Russia, India, Australia and America.  We cannot blame Greta Thunberg for saying it was a whole load of &quot;blah, blah, blah&quot; out there.  That is exactly what it was from start to finish.  When the big powers are only laughing at the small boys coming into town trying to show off their muscle, we are nothing, and the way our Taoiseach carried on was a disgrace.  It demonstrated how self-destructive the Government's approach is.</p><p>The increase in energy prices is also having a significant and immediate impact on the agriculture, fishing, transport and mobility sectors, resulting in higher costs for farmers, drivers, passengers, bus owners, lorry owners and freight transport users.  In the long term, this will mean the destruction of Ireland, especially rural Ireland, thanks to the Green Party, Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  There is a mindset change here.  There is no mindset change on the part of the Green Party - we know where it stands - but there is on the part of Fine Gael.  I saw a former Minister stand up here about a month ago to say agriculture must now take its cuts so we can save other sectors in our country.  That was an astonishing statement from a former Fine Gael Minister.  It is no wonder agriculture is worried and terrified by the way the Government is continuing.</p><p>Pensioners are finding it very difficult to keep their homes warm.  The Minister of State might say they got &euro;5, but &euro;5 is nothing.  Considering what they are trying to pay extra for a bag of coal, home heating oil and electricity, that &euro;5 is soon gone out of their pockets.  It is like giving them money with one hand and taking it away with another.  I was talking to a bus owner in west Cork who runs a bus company for public transport, West Cork Connect.  He told me it was costing him &euro;110 to do a return trip.</p> <p>This man is doing several return trips from Skibbereen and Bantry every day and is saving the State millions of euro every year.  Taking cars off the road is great for the environment and he also has a very good time schedule.  Last year, it cost him &euro;110 to do one trip.  It is now costing him &euro;160.  What is the Government doing?  It will destroy the economy and country.  We can forget about green policies because a continuous rise in fuel costs will stop this man operating, which will put cars back on the road.  These policies are having the most unbelievable negative effect on our environment.</p> <p> Carbon tax is nothing but an attack on the people of rural Ireland.  I have said this often enough.  It affects only one sector, which is people, including those I represent in my constituency.  People are incensed.  I was at a funeral on Monday and people were pulling me aside and telling me this had to stop and somebody should pull the plug because these guys are out of control.  I was astonished by the number of people saying this and the anger out there.  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act was blindly supported in this House by Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il, the Social Democrats and Sinn F&eacute;in.  Nobody saw it but the devil was in the detail.  These parties have turned their backs on the people.  They should have looked at the detail before they signed up.</p> <p> There must be an immediate cut of 5% in the VAT rate for petrol, gas, home heating oil and electricity.  A once-off energy voucher worth &euro;250 must be given to people because they are facing an immediate crisis on their doorsteps.  There must also be a freeze or reversal of the carbon tax because people cannot afford it.  Any Deputy who tells the House that people can well afford it should be damn well mindful of his or her seat.  We also call for a 50% cut in excise duty.  This is the least my colleagues and I ask for in this debate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-10a.43" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1499" speakername="Richard O'Donoghue" time="10:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000009#G00200"><p>There is not one Member of this House who does not have a green agenda or does not want the environmental agenda to work.  There must, however, be a common-sense approach here.  If the Government wants people to get electric cars, it must incentivise them to do so.  If it wants people not to use their cars, it must provide public transport services.  I have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is no public transport in rural villages and towns.  There may be public transport in the larger cities but beyond the areas where the 50 km speed limit applies in the cities, there is very little rural public transport.  It cannot work.</p>  <p>  I want to save my planet but I also want to use a common-sense approach.  My car does almost 1,000 km per tank of diesel.  I do my best coming up and down to Dublin.  There is no infrastructure to bring me to Dublin by train because trains are not available if I go home late.  There is no place for me to park my car if I want to use bus transport.  The cheapest way for me to come to Dublin is by car, which burns a tank of diesel for each 1,000 km I drive.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks, I have listened to Deputies debate fuel increases and propose that this or that be done.  I remind the public that on 16 June, Deputies passed the deeply damaging climate action Bill, which means extra costs for goods, higher electricity bills and fuel costs, the culling of the cow herd and the ending of turf cutting.  Thirty-four Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies, 27 Fine Gael Deputies, 12 Green Party Deputies, all six Labour Party Deputies and all the Social Democrats Deputies, five Deputies from Solidarity-People Before Profit and five from the Regional Group, 30 Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies and four Deputies from the Independent Group voted for the Bill.  Two Deputies from the Independent Group voted against it, as did the members of the Rural Independent Group.  The same people who, day in and day out, hammer the Government and call it a disgrace voted for this Bill.  All of the Opposition parties, bar ten Independent Members, voted for all of these cuts.</p>  <p>  I was missing on the day the House voted on the climate action Bill because I was in hospital.  Otherwise, the vote would have been 128 in favour with 11 against.  I have my morals and I will say it as it is.  Everyone, bar ten independent Deputies, voted for the Bill.  RT&Eacute; gives full coverage to Opposition Deputies who voted for increases in fuel and electricity costs when they now say they are against the Government.  Independent Deputies are not against legislation but we want infrastructure put in place so we can all work together.  However, there is no infrastructure.</p>  <p>  I highlight our call on the Government in this motion "to immediately act on the European Commission DIY toolbox aimed at mitigating the impact of higher energy prices" by slashing taxes and offering help to impacted households, motorists and industry.  Last week, I spoke on haulage costs and the impact this has on every household in Ireland.  Bringing food to the tables of these households is a primary objective.  I appeal to the Minister of State to take the lead, as other European countries have done, by increasing the cap on fuel allowances for truckers.  Every other country has increased the rebate scheme for truckers.  In Ireland, the rebate is set at 7.5 cent per litre.  Other European countries have increased it to 26 cent per litre to counteract the knock-on effects of higher fuel costs.  If fuel prices are higher, haulage costs will be higher and the food in our shops will get dearer.  Everything, including materials costs, will be higher.  Why has the Government not done the same as every other European country by increasing fuel rebates for haulage companies?  The Government could easily increase the cap to 16 cent per litre.  This would halt the rise in transport costs in this country.</p>  <p>  The Government is spending &euro;8 billion on retrofitting houses that would use the equivalent of one tank of oil per year.  A truck would burn that amount in one week.  The only form of transport we have to get our food into shops and to transport our children to school is the diesel engine.  We have asked the Government to spend &euro;108 million on transport to upgrade trucks to Euro 6 engines.  Those engines can be modified down the line for further emissions savings.  The Government has decided, however, to spend &euro;8 billion on retrofitting house when &euro;108 million would reduce the carbon emissions from trucks.  That makes no sense.</p>  <p>  Probably the only way the Government will listen is to do what truckers have done in France and other areas.  On 24 November, a convoy of trucks will travel to Dublin and block the whole place.  The only way the Government will listen to people outside Dublin and other urban areas is if we turn off the lights for a week.  Let us see how long people will last then.  That is what happens to us.</p>  <p>  The Rural Independent Group is fighting for equality.  We are not fighting against climate action but for equality so that everyone can be incentivised to bring down carbon emissions.  We must have the same infrastructure the cities have.  This morning as I drove to Leinster House I was watching the buses.  None of the open-topped buses had a passenger.  We passed 38 buses in the final 5 km of our journey into the city.  I estimate those buses did not have 100 passengers between them.  We in the countryside are trying to get our kids to school and buses are at capacity.  Private bus operators are trying to get our children to school at a minimum cost, while the Government subsidises Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The Government has never incentivised anything outside the city areas.  It must invest in infrastructure and incentivise people to come along with it.</p> <p>If the Government provides incentives, people will work with it but it does not intend to do anything in that regard.</p> <p> The local area plans and national development plans show that the Government wants between 65% and 75% of people to move into the cities.  That is what the Land Development Agency, LDA, was all about.  Everything is to be built in towns and cities and not one house is to be built in county areas.  Why is that?  The reason is that the additional population in the cities will give the Government more Deputies and it will maintain control of the D&aacute;il.</p> <p> Some 37% of the population live in rural areas.  As I said, I want the people who live in rural areas to remember who voted for the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill in this House without any infrastructure being put in place.  That is the main message we want to put across to the people.  Truckers drive 1.9 million miles per day to keep food on our tables.  The Government is putting all the money into retrofitting rather than trying to bring down emissions.  Solar panels and heat pumps have been incentivised but when people install solar panels they are told they are not allowed to send their electricity back to the grid because there is some technicality preventing it.  </p> <p> In farming, the Government was told about ash dieback back in 2009.  In 2012, an instrument was introduced to stop trees coming in from the Netherlands.  This happened under a previous Government and this Government is now offering farmers &euro;1,000 to fix the problem, with no income for the next 20 years.</p></speech>

and substitute the following:<br /><br />&ldquo;notes:<br /><br />&mdash; the increase in energy costs and their impact on households and businesses;<br /><br />&mdash; that the increases in wholesale and retail energy prices in Ireland and across Europe are predominantly related to international wholesale gas prices;<br /><br />&mdash; that Ireland faces particular challenges in this regard as we are a price taker on international markets and that Irish electricity and gas prices have historically been higher than other European Union (EU) countries due to long standing drivers such as geographical isolation, dispersed population, fossil fuel dependency and small market scale;<br /><br />&mdash; that the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), which has statutory responsibility for security of electricity supply, published an information note on 29th September setting out the programme of actions being progressed to deliver secure supplies of electricity;<br /><br />&mdash; that the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is carrying out a review of the security of energy supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems which is focussing on the period to 2030 in the context of ensuring a sustainable pathway to net zero emissions by 2050;<br /><br />&mdash; that, while national average diesel prices have increased significantly since the start of the year, there are schemes in place, such as the Diesel Rebate Scheme, to partially insulate licenced haulage and bus sectors from such increases;<br /><br />&mdash; that businesses that are registered for VAT may deduct the VAT charged to them on the purchase of business inputs such as road diesel and other motoring costs; and<br /><br />&mdash; that carbon pricing is an essential element of any credible plan to decarbonise the economy; <br /><br />and affirms:<br /><br />&mdash; that the best long-term approach for Ireland to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets is to invest in energy efficiency, renewable energy and expand interconnection with European and neighbouring markets to deepen the internal market and competition;<br /><br />&mdash; that the Government is committed to supporting households with their energy costs through energy efficiency measures, with a total budget of approximately &euro;300 million in 2022;<br /><br />&mdash; that of this amount, &euro;194 million is targeted at either local authority housing or low income private households through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland&rsquo;s energy poverty retrofit schemes;<br /><br />&mdash; that the recently published National Retrofit Plan provides for an unprecedented level of State investment in retrofit of &euro;8 billion between now and 2030;<br /><br />&mdash; that Ireland has already put in place several of the measures proposed by the European Commission toolbox, including investment in energy efficiency measures and renewable energy measures;<br /><br />&mdash; the targeted welfare supports in Budget 2022, including increases in the Fuel Allowance, Qualified Child payment, Living Alone Allowance and Working Family Payment, amounting to &euro;146 million on a full year basis with a substantial proportion of this funded through the carbon tax; these measures are in addition to adjustments to basic welfare and pension rates; adjustments to income tax bands have also been introduced primarily to cater for the cost of living increases driven, in part, by energy prices;<br /><br />&mdash; a suite of customer protection measures overseen by the regulator, the CRU;<br /><br />&mdash; that further analyses and assessments of the current energy prices spike are underway by the European Commission, in particular studies on the functioning of the gas and electricity markets and the EU Emissions Trading System market;<br /><br />&mdash; that Ireland will engage further on these matters with our European partners at the Energy Council and the European Council in December on the basis of the assessments currently being carried out under the auspices of the European Commission;<br /><br />&mdash; that Ireland continues to support the current electricity market design and views the European Green Deal and the Fit for 55 package as the long-term solution to energy price rises;<br /><br />&mdash; that additionally the Government is committed to ringfencing all additional carbon tax revenue, estimated at &euro;9.5 billion, as follows:  	&mdash; approximately one third will be spent on targeted social welfare and other initiatives to prevent fuel poverty and to ensure a just transition;<br /><br />&mdash; just over half will be spent on a socially progressive residential retrofitting programme; and<br /><br />&mdash; the remainder will be spent on incentives for farmers to farm in a greener and more sustainable way; &mdash; the Government&rsquo;s commitment to review the implementation of the Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty (2016) by early next year;<br /><br />&mdash; that the Energy Efficiency Obligation Scheme proved to be hugely successful between 2014 and 2020 and supported energy efficiency actions in more than 300,000 homes and 3,000 businesses; the new scheme to operate from January 2022 will more closely align with policy objectives, particularly in the residential sector including energy poverty; and<br /><br />&mdash; that continuing gas exploration would be inconsistent with the Government&rsquo;s ambition to decarbonise the economy by 2050.&rdquo; </blockquote>  <p>I thank Deputies for raising this important matters and for allowing time to discuss them today.  Clearly, the current situation, where we are witnessing significant increases in international gas prices with their knock-on effects in the Irish market, is a matter of serious concern for the Government and our EU colleagues.  The Government fully accepts that recent energy price rises, including electricity, gas and other fuels, will not be welcomed in light of the current economic environment.  In speaking on our amending motion, I will deal with substantive elements of Government policy and household supports for energy costs.</p><p>I will first set out the global market developments that have affected Irish energy prices, after which I will set out for Deputies the functions of the independent regulator, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, in these matters, including its highly relevant activities in consumer protection monitoring competition and ensuring security of supply.  Finally, I will set out for the House the amendment I have tabled.  </p><p>As part of describing our amendment, I will outline what the Government is doing in providing significant supports for household energy costs both in terms of energy efficiency and welfare supports.  It is important to recognise that these price increases are not Government or even regulatory decisions.  Price regulation ended many years ago and suppliers compete with each other on prices and set their own prices accordingly, as one would expect in a competitive, commercial, liberalised market.</p><p>I will first outline then for the House what has happened to prices in the market.  Increases to wholesale energy prices following rises in international gas prices have been the principal driver of these increases.  These have been impacting across Europe and are not just an Irish phenomenon.  These prices reflect the cost that suppliers face, including in particular wholesale gas prices.  The most immediate factor affecting electricity prices in Ireland is the upward trend in international gas prices.  In Europe, wholesale and natural gas prices have been on an upward curve since the second half of 2020.  This feeds directly through to retail electricity prices as the wholesale price of electricity correlates strongly with the price of gas.  </p><p>Various commentators, including the International Energy Agency, have stated that the various demand and supply factors have contributed to a tightening of the European gas market.  Such factors include a lingering 2022-21 winter, post-Covid recovery, supply constraints in Europe and increased demand in Asia.  European gas reserves during 2021 started out low and what was used during winter 2020 was not replenished in the summer months.  The ongoing need to replenish these reserves means higher gas imports.  This has fostered competition between Europe and Asia for supplies, thus further increasing gas prices.</p><p>Geopolitical tensions over gas infrastructure have resulted in significantly lower gas supplies from Russia to Europe than last year.  As this is a Europe-wide phenomenon, an extraordinary meeting of the EU energy Council was held on 26 October 2021, having being tasked by the European Council meeting of 21 and 22 October to take forward discussions on the increase in energy prices and discuss possible mitigation measures at both national and EU level.  Energy ministers agreed to take stock of energy prices and progress made on the implementation of the measures contained in the European Commission&rsquo;s toolbox, Tackling Rising Energy Prices: A Toolbox for Action and Support.  This was for early December.  The next energy Council meeting on 3 December will prepare the ground for the December European Council meeting at which EU leaders will return to the issue of energy prices.</p><p>I reaffirm that the Government welcomes the European Commission&rsquo;s toolbox and the Commission&rsquo;s ongoing work.  The Government is carefully monitoring the situation and already has many of the measures in place that were proposed by the Commission, including, for example, energy efficiency measures, targeted welfare supports, which were set out in budget 2022, and a suite of customer protection measures, which are overseen by the regulator, the CRU.  Ireland continues to support the current electricity market design and views the European Green Deal and Fit for 55 package as the solution to sudden energy price rises rather than the problem.  This view is shared by other member states, including Austria, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Finland, Luxembourg, Latvia and the Netherlands.  Together with Ireland, these member states signed a joint statement affirming their commitment to the Fit for 55 and the current market design as part of the energy Council's deliberations on the matter.  </p><p>I turn to the regulatory role of the CRU in these matters.  Deputies should be aware that the Commission for Regulation of Utilities is the independent energy regulator and has a wide range of economic and customer protection responsibilities in this area and also in respect of security of supply.  As part of its statutory role, the CRU has consumer protection functions and it monitors energy retail markets to ensure that competition continues to develop for the benefit of the consumer.  The CRU also oversees non-price aspects of competition and continues to take steps to increase transparency and consumer engagement in retail markets.  This includes, for example, developing various codes of practice and setting out customers rights which are to be found in a suppliers' handbook.  Additionally, the CRU certifies price comparison websites, leads the smart metering roll-out and participates in initiatives such as the supplier-led voluntary energy engage code under which suppliers will not disconnect a customer who is engaging with them.  I note the CRU recently appeared before the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action to which it is accountable.</p><p>The Government amendment to the motion acknowledges that international energy prices have been increasing and that these increases are having a knock-on impact on households.  The amendment also asks that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann notes that Ireland faces particular challenges in this regard as we are a price-taker on international markets and that Irish electricity and gas prices have been historically higher than those of other EU countries due to long-standing drivers such as geographical isolation, dispersed population, fossil fuel dependency and small market scale.</p><p>The amendment upholds the Government&rsquo;s conviction that the best long-term approach for Ireland is to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets, invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy, expand interconnection with Europe and the neighbouring markets and deepen the internal market in energy.  The amendment reaffirms that the Government is committed to supporting households with their energy costs through energy efficiency measures and the solar photovoltaic scheme with a total budget of approximately &euro;300 million in 2022.  Of this amount, &euro;194 million is targeted at either local authority housing or low-income private households through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, energy poverty retrofit schemes.  Furthermore, the recently published national retrofit plan provides for an unprecedented level of State investment in the retrofit, comprising &euro;8 billion between now and 2030.</p><p>The amendment reaffirms that Ireland welcomes the European Commission&rsquo;s toolbox and is carefully monitoring the situation.  Ireland already has in place many of the measures proposed by the Commission, including energy efficiency measures, targeted welfare supports, which were set out in the budget, and a suite of customer protection measures overseen by the CRU.  </p><p>The amendment notes that further analysis and assessments of the current energy prices spike are under way by the European Commission and, in particular, studies on the functioning of the gas and electricity markets and the EU emissions trading system, ETS, market.  A preliminary report by the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators, known as ACER, will shed light on the situation in the electricity market.  The first preliminary assessment by the European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA, in mid-November will give member states greater clarity on the integrity of the European carbon market.</p> <p>This market analysis will provide input for further deliberation and possible further action when the matter is addressed further by the Energy Council and the European Council in December.  </p> <p> The amendment affirms that Ireland continues to support the current electricity market design and views the European Green Deal and the Fit for 55 package as the solution to sudden energy price rises, rather than the problem.  The view is shared by other member states.  Together with Ireland, these member states signed a joint statement affirming their commitment to the Fit for 55 package.  The amendment also notes that Ireland will engage further on these matters with our European partners at the Energy Council and the Council of Ministers in December on the basis of the assessments currently being carried out under the auspices of the European Commission.</p> <p> I now wish to highlight the parts of the amendment that deal with the extensive Government supports in place.  Deputies will be aware that the amendment to the motions affirms that the Government provided additional social welfare supports in the budget to protect the most vulnerable against fuel price increases and that the following social welfare measures can help to alleviate fuel poverty.  The fuel allowance, which is a payment of &euro;33 per week for 28 weeks from October to April, is made to over 370,000 low-income households.  It was increased by &euro;5 a week in budget 2022 and the increase applied from midnight on 12 October 2021.  Increases to the qualified child payment, the living alone allowance, the income threshold for the working family payment and the pension were also announced.  The total cost of these interventions is projected to be &euro;146 million in 2022.  They will be funded by additional carbon tax funds, through the &euro;105 million that has been allocated to the Department of Social Protection, with the remaining &euro;41 million cost to be met by the Exchequer.</p> <p> These measures are in addition to adjustments to basic welfare and pension rates.  Adjustments to income tax bands have also been introduced, primarily to cater for the cost of living increases driven in part by energy prices.  The household benefits package, which consists of a set of allowances which help with the cost of running a household, include allowances towards covering electricity or gas costs.  Recipients are paid &euro;35 a month.</p> <p> Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances.  Exceptional needs payments can be made to help meet essential one-off costs where an applicant is unable to meet them from his or her own resources.  The living alone allowance, which is targeted at recipients of certain social welfare payments who live alone and often have significantly higher heating costs, is paid at a rate of &euro;19 per week, in addition to primary social welfare payments, such as the State pension.</p> <p> The Government is committed to ring-fencing all additional carbon tax revenue as follows.  Around one third will be spent on social welfare, around a half will be spent on retrofitting and the remainder will go to helping farmers with greener schemes.  The Government also reaffirms its commitment to review the implementation of the 2016 strategy to combat energy poverty by early next year.</p></speech>

I also wish the leader of our group, Deputy Mattie McGrath, good luck and health.  I hope he gets back on the road to good health very quickly.</p>  <p>  Through this motion, as a group, we are saying that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann should recognise that as the second winter of the pandemic approaches, we are continuing with a cost of living crisis on a number of fronts.  The Government's climate action policies are having a profound negative socioeconomic impact on everybody's lives.  The report of the key operator of the national grid, EirGrid, warned that Ireland could face electricity deficits - in other words, blackouts - for the next five winters  EirGrid has predicted that low availability of power plants in Ireland will likely contribute to the energy issues faced by the country this winter.</p>  <p>  The Government has continuously said that we should use more and more electricity.  At the same time, it has shut down the plants that generate this electricity.  It just does not make sense.  The Government shut down Bord na M&oacute;na at a time when we need it more than ever.  Its answer was to shut it down.  There have been at least 31 energy price hikes by suppliers this year, meaning bills are skyrocketing by as much as &euro;805 for some customers, leaving the country in the grip of an energy crisis.  This is not just affecting householders; there are small shops and businesses that use a lot more energy.  They are seeing their costs going through the roof and their income, if anything, is reducing .  Electricity prices in Ireland are the highest in the EU, according to EUROSTAT.  The Government must recognise the warning from the Irish Road Haulage Association, representatives of which I met with two weeks ago, that record increases in the prices of petrol and diesel are crippling the sector and increasing the price of all consumer goods as a consequence of the increased transportation costs.  Everything in this country rolls on wheels; nothing falls out of the sky.  When I met representatives of the Irish Road Haulage Association in Killarney two weeks ago, their message to me was very clear.  They told me that I should stand up in the D&aacute;il and ask the Government to recognise that the haulage industry is going through a massive crisis.  People who have lorries on the road and are delivering goods, the goods that we need every day, are in crisis.  </p>  <p>  The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act completely undermines our uncontested need for more gas-fired power and energy generation to ensure continued security of the electricity supply.  Now, more than ever, the Shannon liquefied natural gas, LNG, project should be going ahead.  What was the Government's answer when it came into office?  It was to capitulate and give in to the Green Party.  What did the Government do?  It said it would not go ahead with Shannon LNG.  Everybody knows we need it and it is the right thing to do.  The Government chose to satisfy the needs of the Green Party, which is really running this country into the ground.  Nobody will ever point his or her finger at us and say that we are climate change deniers, we do not agree with anything and we think it is all a load of nonsense.  We are not saying that; what we are saying is that there are sensible, prudent things that the Government should be doing but instead, it is taking actions which are adversely impacting on farmers and householders, the people who have to live, pay their ESB bills, send their children to school and pay their food bills today.  At the same time, what are they getting from the Government?  They are facing the massive shock wave of implications resulting from the implementation of the carbon budget and what that is going to mean for them.  It is actually frightening.  </p>  <p>  Unless you are living in the Cabinet bubble that seems to be so far removed from reality that you can be oblivious to what is happening in the countryside, you will feel the wrath of what is happening in the countryside.  The amazing thing about it is that I do not know what the people are going to do.  It is not just the Green Party.  Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party are blind and asleep.  Many Opposition Members are telling the Government that it is not going far enough, fast enough.  What does it want to do?  Does it want to make it impossible for people to live today?  We are all interested in the climate and the future but you have to protect the people in the present and the Government is choosing to ignore that completely.  We see what other countries are doing.  They are recognising the energy crisis.  In Spain, for instance, the Prime Minister there has reduced the VAT and tax take to try to ensure that the people can survive and pay their bills today.  I ask the Government to wake up to the needs of the people now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-10a.48" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1580" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="10:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000011#J00300"><p>I am glad to get the opportunity to speak on this most serious matter.  It is affecting every man, woman and child.  Everyone is suffering because of the high cost of energy and fuel prices.  While costs have increased worldwide, more than half the cost of fuel and energy is going in taxes to the Government.  Indeed, &euro;60 in every &euro;100 spent on fuel, diesel, petrol or home heating oil is paid in carbon taxes.  The sheiks in Iran, Iraq or wherever is getting somewhere in the region of &euro;15 of that, while transport and retail makes up the rest of it.  The retail outlets, that is, the petrol stations, get around &euro;3.50.  We should remember that that is charged on top of all these carbon and other taxes.  The Government is taking the people for a ride all right.  Perhaps we will also run out of petrol.</p>  <p>  The Government gave away &euro;225 million last week in the name of climate change.  This money was collected from carbon taxes that hard-pressed Irish people were forced to pay and will be forced to pay.  The Government appears to be hanging its coat on offshore energy, which may not happen for more than ten years.  The Government closed down Bord na M&oacute;na and one third of Moneypoint, only to have to open it again.  It put in nothing to replace the generating stations that it closed.  It is opposing the Shannon LNG project.  It is telling us to buy electric cars when there is nowhere to plug them in.  It is very likely that there will be no electricity to charge such vehicles when people go to charge them.</p> <p>In the recent past we have had eight amber alerts.  We have the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, saying we will bring in electricity and we will have a connection to France and the UK. We are all under the one sky.  They have to generate electricity there also somehow.  It costs more to bring it from far away.  There is a carbon footprint in that.  We have had 35 electricity price increases in recent months.  The cost has increased by almost 20%.  Imagine it has increased by almost one fifth.  The price of gas has increased by 14%.  Home heating oil has increased by 50% from 38 cent this time last year to 84 cent now.  The Government is closing Bord na M&oacute;na, Shannonbridge and Lanesborough and 10,000 acres of bog are left in Littleton.  We are importing peat from Latvia and briquettes from Germany.  At the same time, a special case is being made for Romania because it relies so much on coal.  It will be allowed to produce coal and sell it and do what it likes with it.  We cannot cut a sod of turf.  The Government does not want us to cut a sod of turf.</p> <p> Householders and people trying to heat their homes cannot cope with the savage energy costs.  Farmers are being put through the mill.  The increased cost of diesel means tractors, jeeps, cars and other work vehicles cost way more to run.  These extra costs are eating into the profit margins of farmers.  We rely on commercial transport for all of our goods, as has been said.  When the cost of transport increases the cost of everything else increases and it has done so.  We are calling on the Government to increase the diesel rebate in commercial industry from 7.5 cent to 15 cent.  It should be doubled to give people a chance to keep going.  It is one thing if we have to pay more for services, food and hardware but if we cannot get them it will be way more serious.  People trying to heat their homes are in a desperate way.  The Government left one serious crowd behind in the budget.  These are people on social welfare benefit payments.  They cannot get a fuel allowance.  At the same time, they must pay exorbitant prices for their fuel and perhaps must leave their homes without heating.  They end up cold and getting pneumonia and other problems people get when their homes are not heated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-10a.50" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="10:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000012#K00200"><p>It has been merely a number of weeks since we previously debated a motion on energy prices.  This shows how important this issue is.  In these few weeks we have witnessed yet more price hikes from suppliers but we have seen absolutely no action from the Government to address the crisis.  There have been more than 35 price hike announcements from Irish suppliers this year.  They are having a crippling effect on families.  A dual customer of Flogas, for example, will pay &euro;1,385 more this year than last.  This is an unprecedented increase in costs.  The Government seems to be blind to this reality.  Where are workers and families supposed to get this extra money?  The sky-high cost of living driven by out-of-control rents, and we will hear more on this today, along with childcare costs and other costs have put people to the pin of their collar and beyond.  Thousands of families will soon have to turn off their heating or put on extra layers of clothing to keep the heating off in the depths of winter as they simply will not have the money to meet these bills.</p><p>Not only is the Government failing to act but it is contributing to the crisis.  According to figures from the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, 16.2% of an electricity bill is made up of Government charges in VAT and the public service obligation, PSO, levy while 17.4% of gas bills are made up of Government charges comprising carbon tax and VAT.  This is before excise and other duties.  In agreeing to exacerbate this issue by increasing the carbon tax, pushing up gas and home heating oil prices even further, the Government is both tone deaf and belligerent.  Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently highlighted the unfairness of the carbon tax on heating people's homes when they have no alternative.  This is certainly the case for many families and it is most certainly the case for haulage companies and others dependent on fuel.  It is a punitive measure.</p><p>One argument the Government makes in defence of the punitive carbon tax is that some of it, a fraction of it, will be recycled to assist those who need it most but this argument simply does not hold up.  The climate action plan states &euro;9.5 billion from carbon tax will be ring-fenced for retrofitting, social welfare payments and agri-environmental projects.  However, in reality there is a serious question mark over this funding and the actions to be funded by it.  If the carbon tax is successful, receipts should be falling by the end of the decade and this is not taken into account.  Second, and this is where the more serious issue arises, the EU Commission's Fit for 55 climate package proposes to take 70% to 80% of all carbon tax receipts into a central EU fund with Ireland as a net contributor.  This leaves a black hole in the Government's finances and completely undermines the retrofitting targets and the promised social protection increases.  As it stands, carbon tax will increase each year, all while Europe is positioning itself to siphon away the vast majority of it to redistribute it across Europe.  This is a charge the Government has never addressed.  Regardless, no level of carbon tax redistribution will address the immediate crisis.  We need urgent and immediate action from the Government.</p><p>In recent weeks, my party leader, Deputy McDonald, asked the Taoiseach whether he would cut VAT on electricity over the winter months to provide households with some breathing space on utility bills.  The Taoiseach had no answers on that day and has taken no action since.  The Minister for Finance was similarly intransigent with my colleague, Deputy Doherty, when he raised the same issue last night.  The figures we have received from the Department of Finance show the State collected &euro;228 million in VAT on domestic electricity bills in 2020.  How on earth can the Government stand over this, given the financial pressure workers and families are facing this year?  The European Commission has said EU countries can reduce VAT and energy taxes, issue fuel vouchers, defer utility bills and ban grid disconnections to help families get through the winter months.  While other EU countries have taken such action, the Irish Government has left Irish households to fend for themselves.  It is a dereliction of duty and something that needs to change.</p><p>To get us out of this energy crisis the Government states we need a massive move away from fossil fuels towards renewables.  For this we need a new grid.  Today, EirGrid launched its Shaping Our Electricity Future plan, another glossy plan that states commitments to deliver essential grid capacity.  It includes an outline of the key developments needed for networks, engagement, operations and market perspective to support a secure transition to at least 70% renewable electricity by 2030, in its words.  I want to speak about engagement, particularly as it relates to the North-South interconnector.  It is easy to write it on a page or say it is important but I do not believe EirGrid knows the meaning of it, unless &quot;engagement&quot; means predetermining outcome and driving through regardless; patronising local communities when they put forward reasonable and fair arguments; picking the information that suits its argument and ignoring other perspectives; or throwing taxpayers' money at sponsorship deals in a hopeless attempt to win over the people.  In the most recent example, my local newspaper is reporting is a charge made by local communities in County Monaghan that EirGrid secretly intruded on the land of private landowners.  There was no request made for access and no notice given.  This is all at a time when a Government review of the project itself is under way.  No one is holding out hope for the review because the terms of reference are so constrained.  <i>Quelle surprise</i>.  This company needs to learn lessons and engage with the community.</p></speech>

Perhaps he is not aware of it.  Every winter, in homes up and down the State, people do not get formally disconnected but many people are on a meter because they have fallen into arrears.</p> <p>The Minister of State will acknowledge we are in the grip of a cost of living crisis.  While he may not want to acknowledge the part he played in the crisis, it certainly exists and outside of the walls of this House, in real life, we know it is affecting people.  Due to the cost of living, people fall behind in the payment of their electricity bills and are put on a meter system.  They must pay back some of the money they owe and heat their home.  The day before payday for low-income workers can often be the day they have to put on both extra jumpers and a coat, while indoors, when it gets very cold.  That is absolutely reprehensible.  This Government needs to reach out to those people.  Every day of the week, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul or other charities give people money to keep their homes warm, which is a basic need.  I do not know how people tell their kids that they cannot turn on the electricity or the heating.  There must be real and meaningful action taken on this.  These people want to play their part, but what they hear from the Government is that they can play their part by being freezing cold for one or two days a week.  That is not good enough.</p></speech>

This is the second month in a row in which we have debated a motion that seeks action to address an energy crisis.  The Government does not care that workers and families are struggling to pay the increase cost of bills.  Last month, the Government and its supporters, including both of my constituency colleagues, voted against a motion that would have made a real difference.  That motion would have set a maximum unit price on electricity, gas and home heating oil under section 62 of the Consumer Protection Act 2007.  The choice is in the Government's hands, but time after time it chooses vested interests over the needs of people.</p>  <p>  This crisis must be recognised and we need real action to relieve the pressure ordinary workers and families are under.  We are facing our second winter of this pandemic and families have been through enough following a tough year.  Many have been laid off work and have been ill or have lost loved ones.  They have experienced difficult financial circumstances and they need help.  Instead of throwing them a lifeline, the Government is offering them a rock.  There is a cost of living crisis and it needs to be addressed.</p>  <p>  While there is also a climate crisis, loading carbon taxes on the working poor who cannot afford to change heating systems or install renewable technology is not the answer.  As other Members have stated, there have been at least 35 energy price increases by suppliers this year.  Household bill costs have skyrocketed by more than &euro;800.  Electricity prices in Ireland are the highest in the EU.  The Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service has warned that households face a potential emergency this winter in trying to heat their homes, which Deputy O'Reilly has just explained to the Minister of State.  As energy prices soar higher, voters will remember who stood up for them when it comes to the next election.  I urge all Deputies to support this motion.</p></speech>

Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures indicate that inflation rose by 3.7% over the past 12 months to the end of September, which is the highest rate since 2008.  The cost of electricity, gas, oil and petrol and diesel has increased by 20%, 14%, 45% and 15%, respectively.  Today, a report was published that stated rents are 6.8% higher than they were this time last year.  The cost of living is out of control.</p>  <p>  I take on board some factors that influence the increase are outside the Government's control.  However, it is a question of how the Government responds to these challenges.  The Government has choices to protect people on lower incomes, ensure the lights stay on, putting workers and families first and in regard to the carbon tax.  The carbon tax is a brutal and punitive measure.  The people who can least afford it are those who have to pay it.  It is in the everyday cost of living.  The petrol to get to work, the gas to cook dinner and oil to heat homes are all needed and this carbon tax affects them.</p>  <p>  We are in a climate crisis but taxing our way out of this crisis is the wrong approach.  We all want to save the planet but sometimes, I wonder what planet the Government is on.  People who are affected by this have different choices to make.  They can choose between heating their home or putting food on the table.  They can choose between leaving the lights on or sitting in the dark.  They can choose between filling the car with fuel or buying presents for Christmas.  These are the choices people have to make.  There is a new phenomenon occurring.  As public representatives, we have all been asked in the past to get sleeping bags for people who are homeless.  We are now getting sleeping bags for people who are in their homes just to keep them warm.</p></speech>

Only yesterday, I read a recent newspaper headline stating:</p> <blockquote> 	Spain cuts soaring energy prices with emergency measures.  Government expects to redirect &euro;2.6bn from firms to consumers in next six months, with average monthly bill falling by 22%. </blockquote>  <p>Some Members today have stated that while we acknowledge green policies, we must also acknowledge the current emergency in energy.  The Minister of State said in his opening remarks that is not all due to Government policy.  However, the Government in power has the power to make changes and we should be assisting those who are in deep trouble.</p><p>I also read during the week that a church in the midlands has threatened that it might have to close the church for the winter if it gets very cold because it will not be capable of heating the building.  Another issue people who fill their tank of petrol or diesel may not be aware of is that the energy efficiency obligation scheme comes out again in January.  This will result in a further 3 cent increase on the cost of a litre of petrol or diesel, which will affect ordinary people.  The Minister of State spoke about rural and urban areas.  However, the speakers are correct: if a person is not in the hub of a city, he or she will have to rely on public transport which is scarce.  Many people are not on the natural gas network and therefore need home heating oil.  They are being hammered left, right and centre and it costs them a fortune to travel to work and school.  As many of the previous speakers have said, we are in a crisis and the Government has an obligation to look after our own people.  I urge the Government to considers measures similar to what Spain or Italy are currently introducing.</p></speech>

Energy prices continue to soar, further carbon tax increases are anticipated and households are struggling like never before in some instances.  A major study by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul earlier this year found that nearly 20% of working people cut back on fuel and electricity due to costs.  As my colleagues said, this year alone there have been more than 35 different price increase announcements from energy suppliers in Ireland.  There have been increases to diesel and petrol prices at levels never before seen by many of us.  The budget was limited in what it did to help people with energy costs.  It was in regard to the fuel allowance which, as we all know, is extremely limited.  There was a slight increase in eligibility but the fact remains that the budget did nothing for the vast majority of workers and families who will struggle this winter.</p>  <p>  I refer to the mad situation whereby we are importing peat at rates never before seen.  Some 40,000 tonnes were imported in the first seven months of this year alone.  Will the Government tell the workers who were let go, almost overnight, from plants in Shannonbridge and Lanesborough, many of whom have not had their jobs replaced, why the situation exists where we are importing peat, from thousands of kilometres away, to this State rather than transporting it down the road, as was the case, from bogs in the midlands?  This is a laughable situation but it is not laughable for the workers whose livelihoods have been taken from them while we import peat.</p></speech>

The annual bill for heating a home can cost between &euro;400 and &euro;500 more than it was this time last year.  Electricity prices have risen by 21%, gas by 14% and home heating oil by 46%.  The Minister of State and his party want those prices increased even further, which will make those households even poorer, in the hope they will find magic money under the mattress in order that they can switch to air-to-water or underground heating.</p> <p>That is not the reality.  It is not what is happening in real life.  We need to respond to this unprecedented increase in the cost of heating homes and the way to do so is to do what other countries have done.  Spain has reduced VAT on electricity bills dramatically, by 11%, until the end of the year.  The British Labour Party is trying to convince the Conservative Party to institute a 0% VAT rate for household energy bills.  The Czech Republic has already passed legislation, and is in discussions with the European Commission, regarding a 0% VAT rate for household energy bills over the winter period.  The Government should do the same.  It should have these households' backs and it should be on the side of these families.  It could reduce the VAT rate to 0% over the winter months, thereby reducing these household bills by 12%.  Other options are also available if the Commission does not approve a change in the VAT rate.  A refund could be provided.  As recently as last month, the Commission said that this is a tool that member states have used.  Instead of pushing additional costs onto families, let us do the right thing.  Let us have their backs and take the pressure off them this winter.</p></speech>

It should be obvious but we need to keep it in our minds that a cold house is a terrible thing.  It is a horrible thing to experience.  What is equally horrible is the fear that many families have that their services will be disconnected over this winter.  They fear that they will be without energy or heat for days, or perhaps weeks, because they do not have the money and will be cut off by their providers.  The first thing I ask the Minister of State and his Government to do is to ensure a moratorium on energy disconnections this winter.  It could be a very hard winter.  It has already been an extremely difficult time financially for many families.  With energy prices as they are and with the way that bills will follow, it is essential that a moratorium be introduced.</p>  <p>  I will raise a point that my colleague, Deputy Kerrane, and others including the Society of St. Vincent de Paul have been raising for some time, namely, the need for a discretionary fund.  The fuel allowance is an important part of our social welfare system but, like any part of that system, it cannot anticipate all of the circumstances in which people will need support.  I believe in a social welfare system that is largely rules-based but there always needs to be a bit of space for discretion.  There are people who will not qualify for the fuel allowance but who will really struggle to pay the bills and keep their houses warm.  As I said at the start, that is what it will come down to.  It will come down to choices between heat and food, clothes and other essential purchases.  Those families who fall just outside the threshold need additional support and I urge the Minister of State and Government to move on the proposal to put in place a discretionary fund to assist those families.</p></speech>

There are three specific crises facing us in this country as regards energy.  The first is the most pressing for many households, namely, the rising cost of energy bills.  The average household in Ireland is facing significantly increased costs.  All 14 of Ireland's energy suppliers have increased prices at least once this year.  In September, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities warned that people will face higher charges due to record demand and reduced supply.  Many people, households and families have real concerns that they will face fuel poverty over the coming winter.  That is a real and pressing concern for all of us.  We need to hear more from the Government as to how that will be tackled.</p>  <p>  Second, there is a potential crisis building with regard to the security and certainty of our energy supply.  My colleague, Deputy Kelly, raised this with the Taoiseach yesterday.  He asked whether it can be guaranteed that the lights will stay on.  He also noted that the response to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Sherlock in recent weeks pointed out that there have been seven amber systems alerts in the past 12 months, the most recent having been on 28 October.  All of us are concerned about guaranteeing the security of our energy supply.  That is very much linked to the rise in prices and the great burden this is placing on households.</p>  <p>  Of course, there is also a third crisis, which is a global crisis.  I refer to the crisis currently being addressed at the Conference of the Parties, COP26, which is discussing how to decarbonise our energy and how to move to reduce our emissions to ensure we do not see a devastating rise in global temperatures over the next decade and beyond.  We also need to focus policies on this area.  All of us in the Opposition accept that these are challenging crises for the Government to address.  There is no doubt about that.  It is very difficult to address the challenge of enormous increases in prices for households and the burden that is placing on hard-pressed families and individuals alongside difficulties with supply and the urgent need to decarbonise.  However, we need to see more from Government.  We need to see more firm and concrete commitments to address these three crises.  </p>  <p>  Half of our electricity is powered by gas and demand for that has increased as most countries have exited lockdown.  That has led to the shortages in supply.  Urgent increased investment in other forms of energy generation, particularly in renewables and microgeneration, along with urgent investment in retrofitting will help us to tackle the crises in cost and supply.  We have discussed before how we have no shortage of potential energy sources, including solar and wind generation.  There is an abundance of wind potential in particular in Ireland.  However, to date, we have not put in place the investment to develop infrastructure for offshore wind generation.  We need to do so urgently in order to meet the ambitious targets we have set for this decade, up to 2030.  </p>  <p>  I heard the radio interview with the chief executive of EirGrid, Mark Foley, this morning.  He spoke about the challenges in meeting these targets.  EirGrid has launched a very ambitious blueprint today, Shaping Our Electricity Future, but there are real questions about how that blueprint can be delivered upon, particularly in light of last week's news of Equinor's withdrawal from Ireland and slowdowns in many areas, not least in transport with the announcement of the greater Dublin area transport plan being delayed.  </p>  <p>  We need to see more firm commitments on green hydrogen and the roll-out of new technologies.  Last week, I asked the Minister of State to outline how the Government intends to make the production of green hydrogen more cost-effective.  We again need greater clarity on that.  We also need an update on when the new planning regulations on solar generation will be submitted.  We all get correspondence from schools, community centres, GAA clubs, football clubs and other sports clubs in our constituencies about how they can contribute to meeting targets by investing in solar generation.  There is tremendous goodwill in the community but these groups have so far been stymied and obstructed in installing solar panels and in feeding back into the grid.  Microgeneration is of great importance in dealing with shortfalls in energy supply.  We also need greater clarity from the Government on the issue of data centres.  We know how much of a burden they place on energy supply and we need to hear more about how that is going to be addressed in the future.  We have had that debate here.  </p>  <p>  We also need more firm commitments from the Government with regard to a just transition and how allowances are to be made for those on whom the measures necessary to tackle climate change will have the most impact.  We need to ensure that households that are struggling to pay rising fuel and energy bills are supported in doing so.  My party believes in the need to sustain a carbon tax.  It is one of a suite of measures that is required to help us meet the challenge of this global climate emergency.  However, we also believe that Government needs to do more to address the cost that imposes on households.  We need better allowances in respect of the fuel allowance and a new carbon tax credit.  In our alternative budget, Labour put forward a proposal for an alternative carbon tax credit worth &euro;200 a week for households with incomes of less than &euro;50,000 and whose homes have a building energy rating, BER, lower than B2.  That sort of initiative would have been a real signal that Government understands that the transition to a low-carbon or decarbonised economy will have an impact on people and that this impact must be addressed.  </p>  <p>  There are ways to address this.  There are ways that a Government that is green but which also recognises real burdens on struggling households can address these crises in energy costs and energy supply, while at the same time moving forward to decarbonise in all of our interests and in the interests of our global society.  As COP26 enters its final days, we all hope and anticipate that we will see a clear pathway given at international level through the memorandum that is being prepared.</p>  <p>We also need clarity on the pathway in this country.  We need to see how the climate action plan that was launched last week will deliver in practice on the ground and how the impact it is likely to have on individuals who are struggling with fuel costs will be addressed through other Government measures, ensuring a just transition.</p></speech>

It is very timely as obviously we are heading into winter and this issue will impact people significantly over the coming months.  I had previously called for the D&aacute;il to set aside time for a debate on the surging energy prices and had requested such a debate from the Business Committee but unfortunately it was not provided for.  It is unfortunate that we need to rely on Opposition motions to raise this because it is an issue that will significantly impact on every individual in the country.</p>  <p>  At the moment we have a perfect storm on energy.  We have a crisis with cost and affordability which is obviously affected by international factors.  However, there are also factors relating to the demand being placed on our energy system and on the antiquated infrastructure we have in place.  The wholesale price of natural gas has nearly tripled this year and that is before peak winter demand sets in.  As a consequence, consumers are experiencing enormous hikes in their energy bills.  The price hikes resulted in Bord G&aacute;is charging almost 28% more for gas than during last winter and nearly 24% more for electricity.  Last week Energia announced that it would increase charges for electricity and gas by 15.5% and 18.5%, respectively, on top of two rounds of price increases earlier in the year.  Others such as Panda Power and Pinergy have already raised prices four times this year.</p>  <p>  Consumers could see increases this year of &euro;500 to &euro;800 in their bills which is an incredible amount of money and many people will not be able to afford to deal with those.  The rising cost will have a negative impact on many vulnerable people on fixed or low incomes, including pensioners and those in receipt of social welfare payments.  Only small increases in social welfare payments were provided for in the budget and these are not sufficient to keep people afloat.  It also did not address the needs of households with one or two people working in the home but still finding it very hard to keep up with the rising cost of living, including increasing rents or mortgage payments, rising childcare costs and other general cost increases.  These people will not be able to get any supports from the budgetary measures the Government has put in place.  The Social Democrats had called for the fuel allowance to be extended to those getting the working family payment, but the Government missed the opportunity to assist those working families who will find it difficult this winter.</p>  <p>  The measures the Minister of State outlined in his statement are all long-term ones.  We want to see retrofitting and we want to see people being able to feed back into the grid through the microgeneration schemes, but none of that will happen in the short term.  At the moment there is a 26-month waiting list for people to get retrofitting grants.  None of the measures the Minister of State listed will help people in the short term.  In the budget the Government failed to take the opportunity to help people in the short term through the expansion of fuel allowance payments to those on the working family payment.</p>  <p>  I have spoken to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, requesting a moratorium on disconnections because we do not want people to be disconnected over the winter.  I understand that some measures are in place but they are not sufficiently widespread.  The CRU advised that people who are struggling to pay their energy bills have a series of options but the problem is that not many people are aware of this.  The CRU needs to communicate widely to tell people what supports are available and what safeguards are in place to ensure that people are not disconnected.  That would be a very sensible and feasible thing for the Government to do.  I ask the Minister of State to put that in place or to discuss it with the CRU.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State spoke about all the measures, tools and policies the Government had put in place as a result of the climate action plan.  He spoke about retrofitting, solar energy and so on, which are all welcome.  However, I have concerns that the value of the climate action plan announced last week was portrayed in the media as &euro;125 billion.  That gave the impression that the Government had invested &euro;125 billion in those measures, which is completely incorrect.  In reality, the Government will be looking for people to carry the financial burden of this.  The majority of that &euro;125 billion is the money that individuals, families and businesses will need to put into their homes, cars and business operations to upgrade to meet the targets under the climate action plan.</p>  <p>  I do not think the Government has invested sufficiently in this to assist people to make those changes.  As was said earlier only ten or 11 people disagreed with the climate Bill and while most of us agree with the targets, how we get there is equally important.  Unfortunately, the concept of just transition does not seem to be making it into the Government's policy-making discourse.  </p>  <p>  Ideally individuals should have warm homes where they do not need to spend a lot of money paying for energy bills, where their homes are insulated and efficient, and where elderly people and people on low incomes do not need worry about that.  That will happen through things like retrofitting.  We also want people to have the opportunity to install solar panels and feed back into the grid.  I know that is Government policy and it is welcome.  It would make a big difference for many families.  </p>  <p>  Even within rural communities we need a transport system so that someone can catch a bus within a few minutes' walk of their door.  I believe that is what the Government is trying to achieve with the Connecting Ireland plan, which is welcome.  However, the level of investment the Government is making will mean that those targets will not be met.  The real-life experiences that we want people to have will not be met through the investment the Government is making.  Last week the NTA gave us a presentation on the Connecting Ireland plan.  It seems like a very ambitious plan with the goal of 75% of Ireland having access to regular public transport.  The entire plan will take five years to roll out.  The investment the Government has given the NTA for that for next year is a paltry &euro;5.6 million which will not meet people's needs in rural communities across Ireland.  If we want people to move away from cars, we need to make public transport available, efficient, fast and affordable.  Allocating &euro;5 million to rural transport next year will just not do it.</p>  <p>  The Government's solar panel policy has not been successful, with only 2,500 or 3,000 applications for the solar grant scheme every year which is very little.  We need to make it more attractive because the payback on solar panels is over many years.  If the Government wants people to invest and make those changes, it needs to assist them to it, but the grant scheme it has in place is not doing that.  Similarly, many people will not be able to retrofit which is estimated to cost approximately &euro;56,000 per home.  Who has that kind of money?  People are worried about keeping a roof over their heads and feeding their children.  They will not have &euro;56,000 to invest in something that not only does the Government want them to do, but we need them to do it.  If the Government needs them to do it for us to meet our targets and to live more sustainably, it will need to invest in them to do it.  We should take the opportunity to ring-fence the entire yield from the carbon tax for this as opposed to just the increase in the carbon tax.</p> <p>It is interesting that even many Green Party Deputies do not understand that the full carbon tax does not go towards these measures, and that is worrying.  The Government should examine that issue.</p> <p> It is positive that we are having this debate.  The Government really needs to focus on it, in regard to not just the long-term measures but also those in the short term.  It needs to see what it can do in the coming months to assist families and individuals who are finding the fuel crisis tough.</p></speech>

In 2019, at a meeting of the all-party Joint Committee on Climate Action, we passed a motion committing the Government to conducting a review of energy poverty throughout the population.  As the Society of St. Vincent de Paul research that is mentioned in the motion before us shows, energy poverty is much greater and deeper than what is accepted by the Department of Social Protection and the Government.  Only last month, People Before Profit tabled a similar motion on the energy crisis, putting a very different emphasis on its cause and proposing remedies to address that cause.  We support, therefore, the call on the Government to take action to deal with the impact of the energy crisis, the low level of Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, grants that are available to the poorest of people, the number of households that do not qualify based on income tests or health tests for those grants and the exclusion of many from fuel allowance.  We support all the calls in the motion to extend that.</p>  <p>  Uniquely, however, the Rural Independent Group has managed to identify the completely wrong cause of the crisis and suggested a remedy for the underlying issues that shows utter contempt for attempts to address the climate crisis and for the concerns many millions of people, in both urban and rural settings, have about it.  The energy crisis and the hikes have nothing to do with the ban on fossil fuel and gas exploration.  It would not matter if every team of Shell and BP were combing the Irish seas looking for that gas and oil.  Nor would it matter if they brought that gas and oil on shore.  It would not have any effect on the stability of prices of fuels for the Irish household because it would be privately owned and sold on the open market, like all other fuels.  Past governments ensured we the people would never benefit from any exploration of gas and oil, and to say at this stage that it is wrong to ban the exploration of gas or oil is utter climate denial.</p>  <p>  In the context of its Deputies' comments on home-made gas, does the Rural Independent Group support using fracked gas?  Does it support fracking gas on shore or the idea that we would return to fracking gas on land?  The Deputies' constituents might like to know whether that is what they are saying.  The energy market here was deregulated, in a neo-liberal policy supported by many of the Deputies pushing this motion, and the inevitable outcome was the Government would not intervene in the energy market.  We have now gone from having one of the lowest prices for electricity to the consumer in Europe to having one of the highest, because of deregulation and neo-liberal competition.  Nevertheless, the most immediate threat to our lights staying on this winter is not the lack of oil and gas exploration.  Regardless of what the Deputies claim, it is the unbridled proliferation of data centres, in a policy cheerled, again, by some of the Deputies supporting the motion because it appeases the multinationals and whatever wish list they have or demands they want to make on the State, even if that means power cuts for ordinary people.</p>  <p>  We support the reversal of carbon tax on ordinary people but we want hefty taxes on the profits of those who pollute the planet.  We cannot support the motion for these reasons that cut to the heart of where the crisis lies, namely, in the market, as we are denying people the right to access fuel when they need it and pushing up prices for ordinary people, a matter at the heart of the climate crisis.  There are good aspects in the motion but there is really reactionary stuff as well, so we will not support it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-10a.65" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="11:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000016#O00300"><p>A very significant crisis faces ordinary people in regard to energy prices and the Government cannot say it has not been warned.  We have warned it and it has been repeatedly raised in the media, yet the Government has done effectively nothing for anybody, except something completely inadequate for those who receive fuel allowance.  For everybody else, the Government is saying, &quot;Well, suck it up&quot; - the additional &euro;500, &euro;600, &euro;700, up to &euro;1,000 for some people this winter - when people simply cannot afford to pay it.  The consequence will be devastating.  The answer, of course, as was outlined eloquently by my colleague, is not the kind of climate denialism that is at the core of this motion, namely, exploring further and digging up more gas, or keeping open fossil fuel power stations.  There is no energy crisis on a dead planet and that is where those sorts of policies will lead us.  Equally, the answer is not in the Government's countermotion, which promotes eco-austerity in the form of carbon taxes.</p><p>I have seen a point referenced in the media in a kind of offhand way.  I think Pat Leahy mentioned it in an article a couple of weeks ago, when he wrote that everyone accepts carbon tax is an important part of addressing the climate crisis.  That is not true.  It is not what the evidence suggests.  The international evidence, such as in a study of 26 jurisdictions that had introduced carbon taxes, shows that in order for carbon tax to have an effect, it would take 110 years.  We do not have 110 years.  There is a reason the main people who are pushing for carbon taxes are the fossil fuel corporations, big oil.  They are doing that because they know it is not going to hit them where it hurts, which would be to say they have to leave fossil fuels in the ground, and they know it turns people off climate action because it presents climate action as something that will make people's lives more difficult as opposed to easier.</p><p>The real answer is what was contained in our previous motions.  We must stop the expansion of data centres, a proposal that is strikingly absent from both the motion before us and its countermotion, which are projected to use 30% of our energy by the end of the decade.  Attempting to shift to renewables while continuing to expand data centres is akin to attempting to walk down an escalator that is going up.  Price controls, too, are absent from the motion.  The Government has the power, and a ministerial order can introduce them and demand providers stop the extortionate prices for ordinary people.  We should also renationalise the sector and use it both to guarantee decent jobs and services for communities and homes and as an instrument in a change in energy policy towards fully renewable energy.</p><p>I might make a point about fuel allowance.  The Government made much of the paltry additional &euro;5 per week announced in the budget, which was one third of what is necessary, but it announced at the same time that it would increase the means test threshold by &euro;20.  I have been working with a man who is just above the current means test threshold.  When we heard the news the means test threshold was increasing, which was great, we contacted the Department, which told me the threshold was not being increased until January.  When I asked the Taoiseach about it, he stated in the D&aacute;il:</p> <blockquote> 	The Government decision was to implement the decisions with immediate effect on budget night.  The two key decisions were the amount of &euro;5 ... and the increase in the threshold [...] It could be an administrative issue. </blockquote>  <p>I have reverted to the Department, which confirmed the man will not be able to access fuel allowance until January.  Either the Taoiseach needs to correct the record of the D&aacute;il if he misled it or, preferably, he can fix the decision.  He should not accept circumstances whereby the man will need fuel allowance in January but somehow is supposed to scrape by in November and December.</p></speech>

It is important we recognise the increased difficulties that are arising for our population as part of our new climate action policies and the fluctuations occurring in international energy prices.  Indeed, further motor fuel, electricity and gas price increases are on the way, and we may yet have also to contend with additional Brexit breakdown matters.  This is putting further economic pressure on vulnerable families in the State and increasing household costs.  Carbon tax levies on fuels are placing a significant hardship on rural families, as the Minister of State will know well, and on those with fewer public transport options.</p>  <p>  Turning to some of the disjointed policies occurring under our transport initiatives, the Government has removed the rebate of &euro;2,500 to support plug-in hybrid cars, which allowed many people to buy an energy-efficient car, plug it in at night and use it, without having to revert to fossil fuels.  By doing that, it has taken away that car from the matrix of purchasing options for people.</p> <p>Indeed, there is increased tax now on new cars, making changeovers more difficult.  It means there will continue to be more heavier polluting cars left in the fleet.  The roll-out of electric charging networks in rural areas is making the electric car almost impossible as a purchase decision.  There is an absence of policy to continue to support the purchase of petrol hybrids to allow a graduated roll-in of electric cars.  This is also feeding into our energy costs.  We have no policy regarding the generation of hydrogen technology for heavy vehicles.  I am sure the Minister of State has heard many times about the haulage and transport components that are adding significant costs to the household consumer budget.  We have to examine these matters.</p> <p> There is also the overall electric energy policy into the future.  We are told that the grid output is to rise by 50%, with a mix of 70% renewables and 30% gas.  There is currently talk about offshore fixed-bottom and floating platforms, but they are years away.  We have yet to designate a wind port in this country.  I have spoken a number of times about the need to designate Rosslare harbour as the most viable harbour for this for the east and south coasts.  What are we waiting for?  We will not meet the offshore wind goals at the rate we are going at present.  That means we will have to increase fossil fuels, which means a further carbon levy will be levied on vulnerable families.</p> <p> Beyond that, there is carbon sequestration and carbon trading.  I heard the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine speak recently about his desire to see this get up and going.  We need this for the agriculture sector and for the rural economy to try to impact energy prices.  Indeed, 20% of the carbon levy is paid to agriculture to reduce emissions.  This must be ring-fenced for research activity.  It must go into the agriculture sector but it must go into research.  A very telling research proposal from Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, on horticulture, agriculture and forestry has been sent to Science Foundation Ireland.  I believe there must be ministerial effort to ensure that it is supported as part of our climate action policy into the future.</p></speech>

The prices of rent, childcare and food are rising significantly.  This increase is happening to the people who probably suffered most during Covid.  Many people have lost their jobs and have had their incomes decrease significantly because of Covid.  On top of this, energy and fuel prices are going sky high.  The facts are startling.  Ireland has the highest electricity prices in Europe and is the 21st most expensive country in the world for petrol.  Diesel prices are up more than 24%.  The wholesale price of natural gas has surged by 251% since the start of this year.</p>  <p>  These increases are hammering rural Ireland, in particular.  I do not believe that this is by accident.  Fine Gael and the Green Party are Dublin-centric parties that are mainly in large urban areas.  They do not have the feedback they should have from people living in rural areas.  Fianna F&aacute;il is rolling over in this regard in a big way.  The Government is not standing idly by, but is actually adding to the problem.  Consider the issue of the carbon tax.  How can the Government design a tax today that can be implemented six, seven and eight years hence without understanding the circumstances of people six, seven and eight years hence?  Surely that is a blind way of implementing a tax.  It is a dangerous and damaging way to do it.  Aont&uacute; has produced an amendment that will hopefully go into the Finance Bill which would put a ceiling on the carbon tax plus market price effect on the end price of fuel.  It would have the objective of pushing people away from fossil fuels without scalding them economically to do that.</p>  <p>  The other issue is that the Government is seeking to push people away from fossil fuel without providing alternatives in much of Ireland.  The electric car is still too dear and charging points do not exist in rural Ireland.  The bus service in many towns and villages in this country is absolutely rubbish.  There are towns and villages in my constituency that have no bus service or where a bus rolls in at 7 a..m. and perhaps again at 8 p.m.  Yesterday in County Meath, the information came through that the rail line between Navan and Dublin which has been promised for years, as long ago as when Mr. Noel Dempsey was the Minister, is being put on the long finger again.  This morning the majority of Meath workers left the county to go to work.  It happens nowhere else in Ireland.  Navan is the largest town in the country without a rail line and plans by this Government to build a rail line are for 2040 to 2050, which is really never-never land where the Government can say that it is in the plan but never has to deliver it.</p>  <p>  The manner in which the Government is engaging with people with regard to building a proper energy system is incredible as well.  We have seen it when it comes to the pylons the Government is seeking to build in my constituency.  It is seeking to build 409 pylons of up to 51 m carrying 400,000 volts through Meath, Cavan, Monaghan, Armagh and Tyrone, with a minimum distance of 13 m from people's homes.  There has been massive opposition since 2008.  People have agreed that they would like it to be underground, but the Government will not do that.  This week, we learned that EirGrid and the ESB have secretly intruded onto landowners' properties without notice to, or permission from, those landowners.  I understand that EirGrid and ESB staff told landowners that the reason for trespassing was that they were studying bats and bees, while at the same time digging holes for pylons.  It is incredible.  In some cases, the management of EirGrid is offering thousands of euro to farmers to let it onto the land.  The Government does not have a policy for the development of a proper infrastructure for energy in this country at a reasonable price.  As a result, the people of Ireland are getting salted by its policies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-10a.69" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="11:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000017#P00300"><p>There is no doubt that we are in the grip of a severe energy crisis.  What is more terrifying is the fact that the Government is knowingly and purposely leading us down a dangerous path.  Energy import dependency is said to be one of the simplest and most widely-used indicators of a country's energy security.  Ireland is very heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels and, given this, our energy security is at very high risk.  This is something that requires action beyond the empty words spoken at COP26.</p>  <p>  It is extremely concerning to read EirGrid's winter outlook and that our electricity system will be operating at double the maximum safety threshold for potential loss of power.  The prediction that this country could face electricity deficits for the next five years is particularly worrying.  The fact that we may be facing winter power blackouts is truly terrifying, yet somehow this Government does not seem too fazed about this prospect.  Instead we are expected to roll out the red carpet for data centres, which are set to double our power demand by the end of the decade.  We are expected to make personal sacrifices, to wrap up and reduce our electricity consumption in order to cut carbon emissions, while at the same time welcoming the development of data centres that guzzle all our energy.  We are expected to accept over 30 different price increase announcements from energy suppliers, with costs expected to rise by a staggering &euro;500 per household.  We are expected to accept that this is the way it has to be because Amazon, Facebook and all the other big tech companies that have this Government lining their pockets say so.  I refuse to accept this.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s climate action plan states that data centres are forecast to take up to 23% of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity demand by 2030.  This is absolutely shocking.  Despite this, we are not imposing any environmental conditions on these centres, which are putting huge pressure on our country&rsquo;s energy infrastructure.  At the very least, we should oblige them to pay an environmental tax, to tax them for the demands they are putting on our electricity infrastructure and our water resources.  Each data centre is the equivalent of a large town in the amount of water it uses.  Where will data centres get the water?  We will supply it.  Who will pay for it?  We will.  It is unacceptable that this Government is willing to look after these big corporations over the needs of its citizens.  It asks citizens to make sacrifices, endure price hikes and to pay ridiculous carbon taxes, as if it would make an iota of difference what individuals do when data centres are not subject to any environmental conditions.  We must have a better-managed system for data centres.  We cannot expect citizens to pay carbon taxes without enforcing a pollution tax on those centres.</p>  <p>  Such a tax would provide more funding for things like increasing the fuel allowance and assisting with the backlog of Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, grant applications.  I have constituents in Donegal who have been waiting over two years to be awarded their SEAI grant.</p> <p>There is no point blaming Covid-19 for this because there were long waiting times prior to 2020.  A pollution tax would give us the means to properly fund policies to support sustainable energy and transport rather than having unfair carbon taxes, which we know disproportionately affect low-income families and especially those in rural communities with extremely limited access to public transport or alternative fuel sources.</p> <p> I have spoken before about the huge potential of wind and hydroelectric power.  Given our position off the north Atlantic, we are sitting on a potential gold mine of renewable energy.  It has been proven that Ireland could be energy independent in the next ten years using only wind and hydroelectric power.  We have seen that a Norwegian company has withdrawn from a partnership with the ESB in the past week or so.  Such events make a mockery of everything the Government states it is doing in becoming climate resilient and building a climate action plan.  Companies are walking away when we might think they are the be-all and end-all.  Perhaps Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael were not too interested in a state-owned company and perhaps if it had been a private sector company, they would have bent over backwards to ensure it could be looked after.</p> <p> Numerous Members have mentioned Bord na M&oacute;na stopping the harvesting of peat but we are importing peat briquettes from Germany hand over fist.  That does not make sense.  How can the Government stop the manufacturing of peat briquettes and not stop the importing of those briquettes into the country?  How can we expect people to buy into a climate action plan or the need to reduce our carbon usage when we see such stupid acts?  It is nonsensical and we must stop such activity to get people to have faith in the idea that the Government is working on their behalf.  That is what it comes down to.</p> <p> It seems the Government is working on behalf of data centres and not the citizens of the country.  We all know consumerism and capitalism are the real causes of environmental decline and in order to truly address the energy crisis we need to stop the development of these data centres, which are to the detriment of our citizens.  I ask the same important question as Mr. Niall Williams; how much of the world do we have to destroy in order to save it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-10a.71" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="11:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000018#Q00200"><p>I welcome this debate and I thank colleagues from all sides for their contributions.</p><p>The Government accepts consumers are currently facing volatility in energy prices due in particular to a spike in international gas and oil prices.  We know over the coming winter they will be faced with higher energy costs as suppliers and energy companies seek to recoup their energy outlays.</p><p>Current market expectations on energy commodities, particularly gas, indicate that wholesale gas prices will remain high during the winter months and fall from later in 2022 onwards.  Beyond the winter season, EU forward contracts anticipate a reduction in the current wholesale gas prices.  This is welcome news.  A reduction cannot come soon enough but we should not be complacent.  Markets are volatile and the optimum policy is to move away from fossil fuel dependency and the unpredictability of international commodity markets.  That is what the Government is doing.</p><p>The programme for Government sets a clear pathway towards less reliance on fossil fuel across every sector of society.  It specifically contains a commitment to end the issuing of new licences for the exploration and extraction of gas.  This is on the same basis as the decision taken in 2019 by the previous Government relating to oil exploration and extraction.  Therefore, continuing gas exploration would be inconsistent with the Government's ambition to decarbonise the economy by 2050.</p><p>I turn to Government policy in this area.  Electricity and gas markets are commercial, liberalised and competitive in line with EU policy.  The position of successive Governments for almost 20 years has been that competitive energy markets result in greater choice for consumers and businesses in terms of suppliers, products and prices and support competition to drive down prices.  Within this overall competitive framework, the best long-term policy is to support households with their energy costs through energy efficiency measures, with the Government providing a total retrofit budget in excess of &euro;280 million this year.  We will also continue the development of renewable electricity and enable Ireland to reach EU renewable energy targets and our own national energy and climate target of delivering at least 80% of renewable electricity by 2030.  We will also continue with measures such as the EU emissions trading scheme and the carbon tax as providing incentives to switch to cheaper renewables and lower carbon energy sources.  These measures provide essential economic signals to support the energy transition away from fossil fuels.</p><p>Carbon pricing is an essential element of any credible plan to decarbonise the economy while supporting those most directly affected.  This includes allocating the revenues received to fund those availing of social welfare, home retrofits and sustainable farming methodologies.  We must also promote further electricity interconnection both to the EU and the UK and further integrate Ireland with the EU internal energy market.</p><p>The Government welcomes the European Commission's toolbox and the Commission's ongoing work and is carefully monitoring the situation.  It already has in place many of the measures proposed by the Commission.  In pursuing our objectives of decarbonisation while supporting those who are vulnerable, our collective efforts have led, for example, to over 143,000 homes receiving free upgrades under the better energy warmer homes scheme.  In the first six months of 2021, the average value of the energy efficiency measures provided per household was approximately &euro;17,100.  Strong growth in wind power has had a major impact on energy production costs and is key to achieving our greenhouse gas emission reductions and further electricity interconnection to both the UK and France is under way.</p><p>I will now outline the regulatory regime in which we operate.  Operating within an overall EU framework, the independent regulator, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, has a wide range of economic and customer protection functions.  In particular I mention the CRU's role in promoting switching and smart metering, both of which offer immediate benefits to consumers.  The CRU has certified three price comparison websites, which are <i>bonkers.ie</i>, <i>switcher.ie</i>and <i>powertoswitch.ie</i>to assist consumers in switching.  Even if they do not switch, customers should engage with their supplier to avail of the best offer available.  This is because switching, whether it is switching supplier or to a lower cost product with an existing supplier, makes the supports go further in meeting costs.</p><p>Switching supplier could save a customer consuming the average amount of energy up to &euro;240 on an annual electricity bill, &euro;408 on combined annual electricity and gas bills and &euro;238 for an average annual gas bill.  This is based on a comparison made on 9 November 2021 using a CRU-accredited comparison website.  Based on CRU data, active customers who switched supplier or renegotiated with their current supplier every year for the past four years could have saved &euro;704 on gas, &euro;1,097 on electricity or &euro;1,696 on their dual fuel costs.  A recent CRU survey indicates over half of electricity and gas consumers have switched supplier at least once.</p><p>The programme for Government commits to ensuring the energy efficiency potential of smart meters is realised and that all mechanical electricity meters are replaced by 2024.  The smart meter upgrade led by the CRU is a meter replacement programme to modern, smart-ready technology.  New generation electricity meters are being rolled out across Europe and internationally and when the programme completes in Ireland in 2024, all domestic and business premises will have a new modern meter installed.</p><p>Of significant importance is the Government's commitment to helping households with their energy costs, particularly Iow-income households and those in danger of energy poverty.  The Government is acutely aware of the impact on households of increasing energy costs and its primary response is to increase funding for the social welfare system to counter rising costs of living, of which energy costs are one of the biggest drivers.  To directly address this, budget 2022 increased the weekly rate of the fuel allowance by &euro;5 to &euro;33.  This increase was applied from the week of 11 October, meaning the recipients of fuel allowance this year will receive &euro;932.  The fuel allowance has a budget of &euro;292 million for the upcoming season to pay an estimated 400,000 households.  As everybody knows, people in receipt of the fuel allowance can get it on a weekly basis or twice yearly.</p><p>Increases to the qualified child payment and the living alone allowance and an increase to the income threshold for the working family payment have also been announced.</p> <p>The total cost of these interventions is projected at &euro;146 million in 2022.  This will be funded by the additional carbon tax funds of &euro;105 million that has been allocated to the Department of Social Protection, with the remaining &euro;41 million cost met by the Exchequer.  This is in addition to adjustments to basic welfare and pension rates.  Adjustments to income tax bands have also been introduced, primarily to cater for the cost-of-living increases driven, in part, by energy prices.</p> <p> The household benefits package includes allowances towards covering electricity or gas costs.  Recipients, the majority of whom are pensioners, are paid &euro;35 per month.  The Department of Social Protection will spend approximately &euro;195 million this year on the household benefits package for over 47,000 customers.  Targeted supports provided under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, exceptional needs payment and urgent needs payments may be made to help to meet essential once-off costs which an applicant is unable to cover from their own resources.  In addition, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances who have special heating needs. </p> <p> I reiterate that supports are in place to assist with household and business energy costs.  Moreover, our regulatory framework underpins a competitive market in which consumers can make considerable savings.  That framework also provides protections to consumers through the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities.  Furthermore, the Government has provided additional social welfare supports in the budget to protect the most vulnerable against fuel price increases.  I welcome this debate and thank Deputies from all sides of the House for their contributions.</p></speech>

I particularly thank the Deputies who have indicated their support for their motion and who are, like us, listening to constituents who are telling us they are enduring great hardship.  These are ordinary families, businesses, farmers and hauliers.  This crisis is affecting everybody in the State.  There have been several power cuts in my county in recent weeks.  There were, in fact, two power cuts in one week.  As power cuts become more common, I wonder will we be dancing in the dark this Christmas.</p>  <p>  The Government is not doing enough.  It is not listening to people and there is a big disconnect.  It does not have the empathy to reach out and listen to what people are saying.  People in this country are enduring great hardship.  We are still in the midst of a pandemic, unfortunately.  Businesses are struggling to keep their doors open.  Families are telling me they are struggling to put diesel or petrol in their cars every week.  Heating bills and electricity bills have risen enormously.  We have the highest electricity bills in the EU.  Our average electricity and heating bills have now increased by between &euro;500 and &euro;800 per year.  That is a colossal amount of money for any family or business struggling to keep its doors open.  Despite the Government's rhetoric about helping people, I do not believe it is doing so.  More needs to be done and proper regulation is required.</p>  <p>  I wish to correct a statement made earlier by a representative of Solidarity-People Before Profit.  That party tries to be true socialists.  Electricity hikes are affecting the most vulnerable in our society.  A representative made some sorry and incorrect statements this morning to the effect that we support data centres.  I want to correct that because it is incorrect.  At no point did Solidarity-People Before Profit engage with us or submit an amendment to the motion.  Its representatives prefer to come in here and jump up and down----</p></speech>

Some socialists they are.  We all must question that.</p>  <p>  People are struggling.  I have had meetings with farmers, hauliers and ordinary working people who are being hit hard.  I can honestly say they are facing real hardship and I am asking the Government to please take action.  I ask it to ensure some action is taken because it does not make sense to me or anybody else that Ireland has the highest electricity costs in the EU.  That does not make sense.  Much more could and should be done.  There needs to be true leadership.  The mistake the Government is making is that it is leaving people behind and that is a problem.</p>  <p>  We all want to do our bit for the environment.  Nobody is denying anything but we are saying that some of the solutions and actions being taken are ludicrous.  A power station in Shannonbridge in my constituency closed down.  Another closed in Lanesborough, County Longford.  Those closures happened at a time when we needed those power stations.  We are seeing inferior quality peat coming in from thousands of miles away, as far away as Latvia, and that is increasing our carbon footprint.  It makes no sense.  The Government is losing people who want to do the best by the environment and want real justice.  All of those people are being left behind and are disillusioned.</p>  <p>  I am asking for the Government to listen to what the people in the country are telling us.  They are saying they cannot sustain the electricity or energy prices.  It is not sustainable.  We are going to lose many businesses.  Some hauliers and farmers are at the brink at this point.  We must do more.  Ordinary families cannot afford these costs.</p>  <p>  I am asking for action.  Energy security and energy price fairness are issues of fundamental importance.  If we are to assess the Government's intent by its actions rather than by its rhetoric, it would appear that energy blackouts and sky-high energy costs are a price it is willing to accept in pursuit of ridiculous policy objectives that bear no relation to reality.  Those ridiculous policies include the importation of peat and briquettes into the country.  It makes no sense because it increases the country's carbon footprint.  The Government is putting people out of jobs and it is not good enough.</p>  <p>  As the lights go out and businesses the length and breadth of the State receive more and more scheduled loss of power notifications from the ESB, this Government and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, continue to act like the knight from the famous Monty Python sketch.  The knight's arms and legs are gone but he insists on calling it a scratch.  "Nothing to worry about", he says, as if there is nothing to see here.  It would be funny if the matter were not so serious and if so many people in our State were not suffering.  Indeed, the Minister is like the parent who, in all sincerity, would tell a child, "This is going to hurt me more than it is going to hurt you."  That is not the case.  Who does this Government think it is kidding?  The people who are going to suffer the most from this energy crisis are the same people who have always suffered, whether from Government incompetence or from situations that require decisive action in favour of citizens.  The Government is not taking decisive action.  It will be the poorest who will suffer, those who cannot pay the estimated &euro;56,000 for retrofitting, despite all the bloated promises around grants and financial support.  We have already heard a number of times from Deputies, and I will say it too, that the waiting lists for grants from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland are too long.  We are not getting to grips with that issue.</p>  <p>  I represent peat harvesters and turf cutters.  We are sacrificing an important part of Irish tradition without showing any regard for them or putting value on them.  Those harvesters will continue to see their traditional lifestyles and livelihoods decimated.  I again call out the importation of briquettes and peat.  I call on the Minister to come into the House and explain why we have such a scenario when it is increasing our carbon footprint.  It is all well and good for him to swan off to Glasgow or wherever he is.  Our carbon footprint increases if we import peat.  The Minister should come into the House and explain himself.  It makes no sense whatsoever.</p>  <p>  The Minister, in a press statement in September, stated that in order to accommodate those with rights to harvest sod peat, no ban on its burning will be introduced.  Yet here we are, a little less than two months later, with a climate action plan that specifically targets the banning of coal and peat for residential use by 2030.  We cannot believe a word this Government says because it is full of contradictions when it comes to protecting people's capacity to heat their homes in the way they see fit and are entitled to do, as the generations before them have done.</p> <p>This is exactly what I have called the creeping criminalisation of people who want to burn turf and the turf cutters.  I have been warning about this for some time.  The plain reality is that the Climate Change Advisory Council and the Government are helicopter-dumping ideological nonsense all across rural Ireland with the full blessing of a complicit and grossly out-of-touch Government that does not have the first clue about how hard life is becoming.</p> <p> When it came to the vote on the climate action Bill only ten Independent Deputies voted against it.  That Bill condoned the carbon tax and the Climate Change Advisory Council, which devised carbon budgets and punished our farmers, as it continues to do.  Let us not fool the people.  Let us make it very clear only ten Independents, including me, opposed that Bill.</p> <p> The members of the Climate Change Advisory Council, who are essentially acting as the Minister's personal cabinet, will not suffer.  The people in this State who are unnecessarily suffering will continue to suffer because of these short-sighted and stupid policies.  That is what they are.  Some of them make no sense whatsoever.  Some of us are increasingly starting to wonder who the real Taoiseach is in this Government.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Mich&eacute;al Martin, spoke last week about how he took it as a great compliment when somebody said he sounded like a member of the Green Party.  That must have gone down very well with those in Fianna F&aacute;il who lament the total collapse of the party's political identity.  It ought to be as plain as the noses on our faces that the energy situation, as it currently stands, risks causing not only significant national damage but significant international damage to this country.  This is a time when we need real statespeople to step up, show leadership and defend our people.  Ordinary families and working people, and our farmers and hauliers, are being punished and it has to stop.</p></speech>

Austin was a long and distinguished Member of this House.  He was one of the founding members of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, SDLP, and served in the Northern Ireland Assembly as Minister for Housing, Local Government and Planning.  He became a Member of the D&aacute;il in 1989, was a presidential candidate in 1990 and served as a Minister of State at the Departments of Education, Justice and Health from 1994 to 1997.</p>  <p>  We will remember him as a pioneer of the civil rights movement and as somebody who selflessly dedicated his life to the peaceful and respectful solution of intractable problems, a man of outstanding courage who serves as a shining example to those who have followed him into a political career, north and south of the Border.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste, as a representative of Fine Gael, may have some remarks to make.</p></speech>

I will attend a meeting of the trade Council in Brussels later and I have to get to the airport.</p>  <p>  I am deeply saddened to learn of the death of Austin Currie.  On behalf of the Government, the Fine Gael Party and the Dublin West constituency, I extend my sympathies to Austin's family and to my colleague and friend, Senator Emer Currie.</p>  <p>  A pioneer of the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland, Austin was one of the outstanding politicians of his generation, exposing and highlighting discrimination against Catholics in Northern Ireland in issues like housing with the famous sit-in protest of Caledon.  He helped organise one of the first civil rights marches in Northern Ireland and went on to cofound the Social Democratic and Labour Party with John Hume and Gerry Fitt.</p>  <p>  Austin moved his political career and his family, who I got to know well, south of the Border in the 1980s when he became a Fine Gael Deputy in Dublin West, the constituency which I am currently honoured to represent.  I knew Austin as my local Deputy, as a party colleague and as father to my good friend and colleague, Senator Emer Currie.  I knew him as Minister of State with responsibility for children in the rainbow Government under then Taoiseach, John Bruton, and he was the first to hold that important office.</p>  <p>  I knew Austin as a man of enormous bravery, real courage and principles.  He was blessed with extensive political insight and boundless humanity.  Austin fought for human rights, peace and unity on this island and he only ever did so through peaceful and democratic means.  Above all, he cared about bringing peace, reconciliation and unity to this island, something he worked towards throughout his political career.  He was vehemently opposed to political violence and while he and his family were subjected to it, they never contemplated resorting to it.  For Austin, like John Hume, two wrongs could never make a right.</p>  <p>  Austin is somebody who encouraged me in my early years in politics.  He was somebody who I knew personally and, at the same time, he was somebody I read about in history.  It was a strange experience, having a living icon as your colleague and local TD.

Ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn machnamh a dh&eacute;anamh ar an dl&uacute;thr&oacute;l a bh&iacute; aige i ngluaisteacht cearta sibhialta an Tuaiscirt.  Fear agus polaiteoir den scoth a bh&iacute; ann.  D'oibrigh s&eacute; go d&iacute;cheallach, Domhnach is d&aacute;lach, ar son mhuintir na t&iacute;re, sa Tuaisceart agus sa Deisceart araon.

He was a former colleague in this House for more than a decade and served the State with honour and integrity as Minister of State with responsibility for children, embracing the Departments of Education, Justice and Health at the time.  On that basis alone, he would be deserving of national recognition and respect.  However, Austin Currie's contribution to Irish politics was much more profound than his service here, for he was one of that extraordinary generation of Northern leaders.  In the face of the appalling injustices and degradations of the Northern state at that time, they recognised the power of peaceful protest and understood that social and economic justice and progress would only be secured through the force of argument.  His protest on housing rights in Caledon is widely seen as the beginning of the civil rights movement.  Then, along with those other great names, Hume, Cooper, Fitt, Devlin, O'Hanlon and others, he founded the SDLP and developed the fundamental political philosophy that ultimately became the basis of peace and power-sharing across the board and underpins the institutions we have today.</p>  <p>  Alongside this intellectual capacity, Austin Currie was also a man of great physical courage.  More than 30 times his family home was attacked by elements within loyalism, so-called, and elements within republicanism, so-called, yet with his colleagues he persisted.  Our country owes him a great debt for this persistence.  Many people are alive today and raising families of their own because of this persistence.  We have peace in our country because of this persistence.</p>  <p>  Away from politics Austin Currie was deeply committed to his family.  I know they will be feeling his loss very deeply at this moment but I also know they will take comfort and some pride from the fact that his was a life well lived and that he was one of those who truly made Ireland a better place.  To his wife Anita, his children, including our colleague in the Oireachtas, Senator Emer Currie, his siblings and wider family circle, his friends in the SDLP and his Fine Gael colleagues in the Oireachtas, I offer my sincerest sympathy and gratitude.  Ar dheis D&eacute; go raibh a anam.</p></speech>

As a leading member of the early civil rights campaign, a co-founder of the SDLP, a Minister in the short-lived 1974 power-sharing executive in the North and a Fine Gael Minister of State, Austin had a long and commendable record of public service.</p>  <p>  My thoughts and condolences are with Anita, our colleague, Senator Emer Currie, and the wider Currie family circle at this sad and very difficult time for them.  I would like also to extend our sympathies and solidarity to colleagues in the SDLP and Fine Gael on what is a very sad and significant loss for them.

He will be remembered, above all, as a politician of conviction and somebody who stood up and was counted and never, in a long career, allowed any form of intimidation to get in his way.  He showed huge courage as he strived to bring peace to our island through his service to the people he represented, uniquely, both North and South on this island.  As one of the founders of the Social and Democratic Labour Party alongside John Hume, Gerry Fitt, Seamus Mallon and others, he was central to the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland, famously commencing with a housing campaign of which we are all well aware.  He showed huge conviction and spirit in how he brought that to the attention of a global audience.  He helped to chart a course of reconciliation on this island through his work.</p>  <p>  A generation of giants has now passed who brought reconciliation and peace to our island.  Their legacy lives on today in the peace we all share.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I extend my condolences to Austin's beloved wife of 53 years, Anita, his children, Estelle, Caitr&iacute;ona, Dualta, Austin and our colleague, Emer, and the rest of his family, friends and former colleagues in the SDLP and, in particular, his colleagues in Fine Gael.

Mr. Currie was a pivotal figure in Irish politics, having played an instrumental role in the civil rights movement, been a founding member of the SDLP, and served as an MP for South Tyrone and, latterly, as a Fine Gael Deputy and distinguished Minister of State.  His outward political affiliation may have changed, which was necessitated by his move to Dublin, but his core decency, integrity, bravery and tireless advocacy for peace, social justice and human rights never did.  The kinds of richly deserved plaudits being paid to him now on both sides of the Border are an indication of the huge influence he had on the political life of this island and the warm esteem in which he was held by everyone.

It was very sad to hear of Austin's passing yesterday.  We express our condolences to Senator Emer Currie, the Currie family and the Fine Gael Party.  As a nationalist, I also want to commend Austin on all he did in the North when it was very difficult to stand up for Catholic and nationalist families.  In terms of housing, he did huge work.  He will always be remembered for that great work, his courage and, mainly, the leadership he showed at a very difficult time.</p></speech>

I did not know Austin Currie personally, only by reputation, and he had a reputation of which any person would be proud.  He was a man who had the strongest courage of his convictions and who took risks, both personal and political.  He was a man of protest, a peacemaker, an activist and a politician.  Many fine words have been written and said in the past day or two by those who knew him and served with him.  If I were to choose only a few words from all that has been said, it would be the two words used by Mark Durkan, when he described Austin Currie as a man of "stubborn honour".  May he rest in peace.</p></speech>

It will bring no comfort to tenants who hand over an extortionate amount of their earnings to landlords every month and it again highlights the abject failure of the Government to get to grips with this crisis.  Rents, already at record levels, increased by a further 7% in the past year.  The average rent has more than doubled in a decade, increasing every year for the past nine years.  It now stands at &euro;1,516 per month.  It is off the wall.</p><p>While rents in Dublin continue to soar to an astonishing average of &euro;2,082, the real punch in the gut in this report is the massive jump in rents people in the regions now face.  Rents in Munster are up by 15.6%.  In Connacht-Uladh, people in Mayo, Leitrim and Roscommon have been hit by a 20% hike.  A bad situation has gotten even worse on the Taoiseach's watch and that of a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  Fianna F&aacute;il has picked up right where its Fine Gael partners left off.  The party's refusal to take urgent action means this crisis has become a generational catastrophe.</p><p>Workers, families and young people cannot afford these rents.  They do not stand a chance of saving a deposit to buy their own home.  Renters are hanging on now by a thread.  Why?  This is happening because the Government recycles policies that favour developers, wealthy investors and big landlords over ordinary people.  We need only look at what it is dong.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has given landlords the green light to increase rents even further in the midst of this crisis.  The Government bends over backwards with sweetheart tax deals and roadshows for cuckoo funds that drive rents through the roof and, by the way, pay no tax on their rental income.  The Government did nothing in its budget to help renters.  These are the choices it has made and renters are now paying a very heavy price.</p><p>There are alternatives that would make a big difference.</p> <p>Sinn F&eacute;in has asked the Taoiseach time and again to cut rents by putting one month's rent back into renters' pockets through a tax credit.  He said no.  We asked him to ban rent increases for three years.  He said no.  Now, here we are, with renters staring into the abyss and their lives on hold and aspirations curtailed, unable to plan for the future because many of them do not know whether they will make it to the end of the month.  That is the reality and it must change.  If the Taoiseach does not show up for renters today, he never will.  T&aacute; an gh&eacute;arch&eacute;im c&iacute;osa ina tubaiste faoi deara.  T&aacute; m&eacute; ag imp&iacute; air an treo a athr&uacute;.

I ask the Taoiseach to act.  I ask him to cut rents and ban rent increases for three years.  I ask him to do both of these things urgently.  No more blah blah blah, kicking for touch or talking down the clock.  I ask him to show up and give renters the break they need or make way for a Government that will.</p></speech>

The bottom line is the most fundamental way we can ease pressures on rent - there is no question of there being pressures on renters - and the most effective way to deal with it is to increase supply.  We had two lockdowns since the commencement of Covid.  That hit supply in 2020.  It has hit supply in 2021, although we are making a significant comeback on commencements.  Commencement notice data showed September commencements increased by 48% on August figures.  In the year to September 2021, 30, 519 residential units were commenced, which is up 40% year on year, when compared to the same period to September 2020.  Significant momentum is building up in the house construction sector, which we need to get to the average of 33,000 completions per annum.  That is a central part of Housing for All.</p>  <p>  That will involve the State intervening, as provided for in budget 2021, for affordable housing and cost rental homes to be delivered, of which up to 1,580 are to be delivered next year by approved local housing bodies, local authorities and the Land Development Agency.  More than 1,100 social housing homes are to be provided.  The emphasis of Government policy is to increase supply across the board, in social, affordable and cost rental housing and to bring back voids, which we have done at an unprecedented rate in the past 18 months.  There is no question of the number of voids which have been brought back and the funding given to local authorities to create additional homes in the social sphere, along with working with the approved housing bodies in terms of homelessness and new social housing builds.</p>  <p>  In the interim, five pieces of legislation have already passed on protecting security of tenure for tenants and restricting rent increases.  Up to quite recently inflation was below 1%.  However, inflation has gone up globally so the Minister will now provide for a maximum limit of 2% increases in rent or inflation, whichever is the lower and for an unlimited duration in terms of tenancies.  Substantial protection of tenants has been realised by the Minister through a variety of legislation he has passed.  Fundamentally, supply is the key and all of us in this House have a responsibility to do everything we possibly can to facilitate supply of housing.</p>  <p>  Too many schemes are being left there and deliberated upon by councils, schemes as large as 750 houses in Dublin City Council.  It seems they are going on forever.  I cannot reconcile all of the angst and anger in here about housing and party colleagues of Deputy McDonald and others, on Dublin City Council, saying no to substantial housing projects because of their mixed nature, be it affordable or some private and some social.  It is just not good enough and cannot be sustained.  We need to push on ahead, get projects delivered and housing provided for people because that is the most effective way to deal with the rent issue, in addition to the restrictive measures the Minister has and will introduce on the 2% maximum limit.</p></speech>

Supply is, of course, the issue and that is why the Taoiseach should have embraced the ESRI recommendation to double capital investment in the delivery of homes, but he did not do that.  His top economist trashed that report.  I ask him not to lecture me or anyone else on the Opposition benches on the issue of supply, while simultaneously allowing a high-ranking Government official to undermine the argument for supplying the resources to underpin it.  I do not know if the Taoiseach heard the figures I gave to him.  There has been a 20% increase in rents in some Connacht counties and an increase of almost 20% in Munster.  I have asked the Taoiseach very simply to take actions that would make the world of difference now to the 300,000 renters in this State.  I am asking him to introduce measures that will cut their rents now - cut their rents - not allow for a further increase and I have asked him to introduce a measure to ban increases for three years.  Here is the truth: that is what needs to needs to happen.  I want him to answer straightforwardly whether he will do those two things.  Yes or no?</p></speech>

It represents a huge blow to the people of the greater Dublin area and what appears to be an abandonment of our emissions targets in the transport area, as set out in the climate action plan.  It was particularly devastating for the north side of Dublin because of the further long fingering of MetroLink.  I represent Dublin north west, which is the only constituency in the greater Dublin area without any rail service at all.  We are entirely dependent on a bus service, which is not capable of meeting the demand from commuters.  Large numbers of people have no choice but to get into their cars and drive.  Dublin north west is sandwiched between the city centre and Fingal, an area which has seen its population grow by 41% in a 20-year period and it is continuing to grow.</p> <p>Many residents in Fingal, too, have no choice but to get into their cars to drive because of the inadequate capacity in the public transport system.  On top of all of that is the airport, where passenger numbers reached 33 million in 2019.  We are the only European capital without a rail link to our airport.  All of that adds up to a situation where there is near gridlock for most of the day on most main roads on the northside of Dublin.  There is seldom a morning when the Swords Road at Whitehall is not referenced in the traffic reports.  </p> <p> In the 1990s, we were promised a northside Luas line.  It never materialised.  The metro was first announced in 2001.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s late colleague, S&eacute;amus Brennan, told us that the metro would be open in 2007.  We are now on our third iteration of the metro.  There have been several rounds of detailed consultation with residents on the northside of Dublin.  Hundreds of meetings have been held.  Thousands of leaflets have been distributed.  Hundreds of millions of euro have been spent on planning and design work.  Yesterday the bombshell was dropped that it will be more than ten years, and possibly up to 20 years, before there is any prospect of the metro opening.  Yet again, and for the third time, people are being marched to the top of the hill.  It is beyond belief that it was a Green Party Minister for Transport who flagged the fact that this project, and indeed DART+, would not go ahead.

I will first deal with the issue of emissions.  The strategy was published yesterday and it is a statutory requirement to review the strategy it had published in 2016.  Under that strategy, greenhouse gases linked to public transport will fall dramatically, contrary to what the Deputy said.  The implementation of the full measures will reduce transport emissions in the greater Dublin area by 69%.  That will come about because of further investment in DART and Luas, which are already fully electric.  This is also as a result of the complete transition away from fossil fuels for buses within 13 years.  I would like to do that faster.  I am maintaining the pressure on that.  Acceleration of investment into walking and cycling infrastructure will also deliver substantial greenhouse gas reductions.  The delivery of existing projects under the current strategy, as well as newly proposed projects, will significantly expand the availability of alternative options to private car journeys.  Newly proposed plans include a provision of a new rail line to Navan and extending the DART+ programme to deliver electrified rail services to Sallins, Naas, Kilcock, and Wicklow.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has made fair points about the northside, the airport and the rail link.  I accept her analysis of gridlock and the unacceptable situation for residents and commuters from the northside.  However, the NDP provides the funding to commence delivery of the major public transport projects under the greater Dublin area transport strategy, which include BusConnects, DART+ and MetroLink.  The Deputy is correct in saying that enormous work has gone into finalising the preliminary design of MetroLink, completing the required environmental impact assessment reports and closing out property referencing issues.  That is all critical work to MetroLink.  The Deputy outlined some of it herself when speaking about the consultations.  The focus right now is getting all three projects, namely, BusConnects, DART+ and MetroLink to the Government for approval under the public spending code.   As well as this, the focus at a project level is on getting planning application documentation ready for submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in early 2022.  </p>  <p>  This idea that is being spun that somehow, MetroLink has been shelved for ten years is just not the truth.  It will be going to planning in early 2022.  It has to go through public spending codes and various approvals.  I do not think anybody here would expect otherwise.  The fact that the national development plan, NDP, is a ten-year envelope and has a ten-year framework is the ultimate guarantor that we will get MetroLink built.  That is our determination as a Government.  Far from shelving anything, therefore, work is proceeding at pace to get MetroLink going, as well as all of the necessary decisions that have to be taken to get it ready for planning.  </p></speech>

It was confirmed to me in a reply to a parliamentary question that in the period from September 2020 to September 2021, there have been 33 resignations of dental surgeon contractors from the dental treatment services scheme in my constituency of Laois-Offaly alone.  This crisis is mirrored in every single region and county right across this State.</p>  <p>  In discussions I had with the Irish Dental Association on Monday, it was confirmed to me that there are only 750 dentists actively treating medical card patients.  This is less than half the number of contracts held by dentists up to two years ago.  This translates to just one dentist per 2,000 medical card patients.  It is extremely worrying.  The scheme is entirely unfit for purpose.  It is under-resourced and restrictive to the point where patients cannot access the care they need in their local communities.  It supports the extraction of teeth, rather than preventative treatments to save teeth.  An entirely new scheme is required.  That is coming from the people themselves, the dentists who are at the coalface.  </p>  <p>  There are now also enormous and serious concerns regarding access to dental care for children.  Over the past decade, there has been a 30% decline in the number of dentists in the public dental service, despite a 23% increase in the number of eligible under-16s due for assessments.  Understaffing of the school screening system means that the number of children being seen for targeted checkups is a fraction of what it should be.  It also is alarming that the Irish Dental Association says that its members have been repeatedly denied meaningful engagement with the Department of Health, whether through representation in the development of policy, or constructive engagement in its preparation.  </p> <p>We have been promised reform of the Dentists Act 1985 for more than a decade.  The Government needs to give this urgent priority.  Will the Department of Health respond positively in the near future to the Irish Dental Association's request, communicated two months ago to the Department, for the appointment of an independent chair and confirmation of a framework for negotiations equivalent to that agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation seven years ago?  Will the Taoiseach accept that the current crisis is widening the divide in oral health status according to income levels, thereby prohibiting general dentists from following through on their wish to provide access to essential and routine dental care for all of the community?</p></speech>

I acknowledge there are significant challenges in fully implementing the dental treatment services scheme, DTSS, which provides dental care, free of charge, to medical card holders aged 16 and over.  These services are provided by independent dental practitioners who have a contract with the Health Service Executive.  I know the Deputy has spoken eloquently and has been in touch with the Irish Dental Association, IDA.  The Irish Dental Association is discussing that contract and the dental treatment services scheme with the Department of Health and the HSE.  The Deputy has suggested, following the lobbying of the Irish Dental Association, that an independent chair should be appointed for those talks.  The reality is that there are industrial relations and contractual dimensions to this which we cannot lose sight of.  That said, additional funding was provided in the budget, of &euro;10 million more than the &euro;56 million base for the existing level of services, so there is now &euro;66 million for the operation of the scheme.  The national oral health policy, Smile agus Sl&aacute;inte, has been developed in consultation with all involved, and was published in 2019.  The Minister at that stage meant with representatives of the Irish Dental Association in late November 2020.  It was followed by discussions with officials.  They have been engaging constantly with the IDA with a view to contractual engagement.</p>  <p>  This is about a contract and we need to go into it with our eyes wide open.  At the same time, there has been a reduction by more than 200 private dentists holding a DTSS contract to provide dental care to medical card holders.  Approximately 1,200 contracted dentists continue to provide oral healthcare to medical card holders under the DTSS.  As the Deputy said, recent figures show that there have been about 85 resignations from the DTSS so far this year.  Some 81 new contracts have been issued.  We are aware that more dentists, particularly recent graduates, have been joining established dental practices.  Since they usually, at the outset, provide services under the contract of the practice owner, they are not included in the figures of dental contractors.  The salaried public dental services will provide emergency and routine care to children under the age of 16.  We want to get these issues resolved.  I will again engage with the Minister for Health and the HSE about the ongoing discussions.  I am mindful that with matters of this kind, we have to give space for those discussions to continue to get a resolution that is fair to everybody.</p></speech>

We have to remember that reform of the Dentists Act 1985 has been promised for the last decade.  There are difficulties at play.  From speaking with the dentists, there is a lot of frustration which would indicate that there has not been meaningful dialogue with the Department.  That concerns me because these issues should have been ironed out long ago and the matter should have been resolved to make sure that people have access to dental treatment.  The core issue is that people do not have enough access and that there have been 33 resignations in Laois-Offaly alone.  I stress that there needs to be some commitment from the Department to the appointment of an independent chair and confirmation of a framework for negotiations equivalent to that agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation seven years ago.  Will the Taoiseach request that the Minister for Health publish the report commissioned by the HSE on orthodontic care and treatment, as an important first step in debating how best to tackle these persistent difficulties that have led to having so few dentists and to 33 resignations in Laois-Offaly?</p></speech>

I will talk to the Minister for Health about the publication of the report on orthodontic care.  These are negotiations and discussions that involve contractors seeking a better contract, which will involve additional resources from the taxpayer to provide care for those who have medical cards.  We want to provide free dental care for those with medical cards.  As always, with contractual negotiations, there are two sides to every story.  I am informed that officials in the Department of Health and HSE are in discussions - I will double-check that with the Minister and officials - with the Irish Dental Association on matters concerning the dental treatment services scheme.  All matters raised by the Irish Dental Association are under discussion.  I will revert to the Minister with the Deputy's views.</p></speech>

We have a long list of projects.  The language around regional balance is there.  We know from bitter experience that that has not worked beforehand and past performance is certainly a poor indicator of future success.  Time and again, I have quoted the facts and figures that show the widening economic gap between the northern and western region and the rest of the country.  Unfortunately, the European Commission confirmed our worst fears by downgrading the region economically, not just compared to other regions in Ireland but to every single region in the EU.  In that context, the NDP has some heavy lifting to do in order to redress the economic imbalance which has worsened over the last 15 years.</p>  <p>  I do not believe that the Taoiseach or any of his predecessors intended for such an imbalance in development between the regions to occur.  I believe that it was a combination of inertia, a frame of mind wherein a rising tide would lift all boats, a failure to measure systematically the impact of policy from a regional perspective across all Departments and, more than anything else, the absence of a disciplined and ongoing commitment to provide the necessary investment and support to the northern and western region.</p>  <p>  There is a five city-led approach to development, not exclusively but significantly.  However, the northern and western region cannot benefit from that approach as it has only one city, which is situated at its southern tip.  The NDP needs to be explicitly nuanced to allow other towns in the region, such as Sligo, to play a special role as a driver for development.  If it is to close that gap, towns such as Sligo and Letterkenny must be afforded opportunities and provided with investment that is comparatively greater than that being provided to similar-sized towns in other regions.  That is not favouritism.  It is an absolute necessity to rebalance the part of the plan that is city-led.  We need timelines and benchmarks to measure progress.  Finally, we need a form of regional proofing when assessing projects.</p></speech>

She mentioned the citywide strategy.  That is a good thing because it will help all regions in terms of that imbalance.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy looks at key sectors such as education, for example, there is investment in the technological university embracing Sligo, Letterkenny and Galway-Mayo institutes of technology, ITs.  They will comprise one technological university for the north west, which will be a significant help in driving the economy of the region.  Each of those institutional campuses has its strengths.  I have been to the IT Sligo campus on a number of occasions.  It has a unique robotic technology centre, for example.  It is also strong in relation to small to medium-sized companies.  Funding is provided for further development for the IT Sligo central campus extension.  The Sligo Cultural Plaza is identified in the NDP as are the Sligo cultural and learning hub, the Sligo hospital regeneration and a range of other proposals.  I was recently at the ceremony for the completion of the Sligo western distributor road as well as the new N4 upgrade.  That will be a significant boost from a road infrastructure perspective.</p>  <p>  The various funding streams through the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, and the rural development fund will add to the NDP in creating infrastructural and human skills investment in the north-west region.  There is no doubt that we have to rebalance economic development in the country.  In this NDP there is a strong focus on that rebalancing.</p>  <p>  Only last week the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, published the rural transport plans, which involve a substantial expansion of what was there before.  That is about trying to create a critical mass in the regions, particularly in the north west, to ensure sustained economic development.  The NDP is a high-level document in terms of the broader range of objectives, aims and so on.  Within that, it gives rise to a range of projects on a smaller scale which will be delivered in a timely and efficient manner.</p></speech>

I do not dispute the city-led approach.  I am saying the northern and western region cannot benefit from it to the same extent as other regions.  We need a more nuanced approach.  The Taoiseach mentioned all the great projects in Sligo.  I could say we have not had a road project in 20 years.  I could quote the Northern and Western Regional Assembly report, which states that we are not getting our fair share in regard to regional projects in the NDP, but that is not the point.  The Taoiseach and I could play ping-pong across the floor of the D&aacute;il all day regarding projects.  However, unless we can measure progress and there is a system in place to do so and unless there is accountability across Departments, a nuanced approach to the northern and western region that recognises its specific circumstances and challenges and regional-proofing like we have with the climate action plan that requires adjustments to achieve planned outcomes, I do not believe we will see change.</p></speech>

There are always different metrics used by different bodies and groups to analyse and reach conclusions.  For me, one of the essential ingredients of the NDP is human capital.  Maybe all of us focus too much on the big, mega-project.  What drives economics and society is investment in human capital.  Education at all levels is the key to the economic development of any region.  That is why the NDP, in underpinning the establishment and investment in key elements of the technological university, will be an important economic driver for the region.  The wider skills provision in Skillnet and the apprenticeship programme that is developing at pace and expanding are also important.  Then there is the industrial part of the project in terms of foreign direct investment, FDI.  Critically, as I said in the D&aacute;il recently, the last 50 years might have been about FDI and we will always maintain our focus on that but the next 50 years has to be about growing indigenous industry to an even higher scale than we have.</p></speech>

This is a national crisis.  The Istanbul Convention obliges this State to have 498 refuge places; currently there are 140.  Nine counties have no refuge place.  Between September and December last year, 808 requests for a refuge went unmet.  In June, the Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il that he was committed to implementing Istanbul and creating more refuge facilities but that has not happened.  It is scandalous that the recent budget contained no specific commitment to provide additional refuge places.  The lack of an exit route sees women and children staying longer in abusive homes.  I and others raise this crisis year after year and nothing changes.  What urgent action will be taken to ensure every women who cries out for help is given the protection of refuge?</p></speech>

The latter has returned as Minister; before that, it was Deputy Humphreys.  Additional resources were provided in the budget.  The working through and the consultations with key stakeholders on the strategy continue.  We want to arrive at a situation where in all parts of the country facilities, refuge and supports are provided to victims of domestic violence.</p></speech>

I support what it delivers for over-60s, under-60s who are compromised and, when we have European Medicines Agency, EMA, approval, hopefully children as well.  Does the Taoiseach believe we will have a booster programme for the remaining population early next year?  Would he support that?  Will he ask the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC,  to bring forward a decision on that before Christmas so the infrastructure in place for the programme can be maintained afterwards?  It would be crazy to let that infrastructure go away.  Does the Taoiseach believe that we will be in a position to do this?  NIAC and the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, will advise on whether it is medically and scientifically good but it is a Government decision whether to proceed with such a booster campaign.  Will the Taoiseach have NIAC make a decision before Christmas?  That committee took so long in relation to healthcare workers.</p></speech>

The evidence is strong now.  Evidence is emerging that administration of the booster vaccine to the over-80s is having an impact on reducing severe illness in that age cohort.  I am aware of the interaction and the proper level of engagement with the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, NPHET and NIAC.  We have to avoid the sense that politicians are declaring on clinical issues.  Doctors want the protection as they administer vaccines of a hierarchy of clinical advisors.  As I said before in the House, the expectation across Europe is that we will arrive at a situation where there is an annual booster vaccine.  I see the programme expanding but NIAC keeps it under constant review following requests from the Minister and the CMO.</p></speech>

The report published by the National Oversight and Audit Commission shows that there are almost 5,000 empty local authority homes throughout the country.  Some local authorities take more than a year to re-let a home.  Cork City Council, for example, takes 85 weeks on average to re-let a home.  With more than 60,000 households on housing waiting lists and even more people living in insecure housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancies, this is completely unacceptable.  We know the most sustainable way to deal with housing is to bring vacant homes back into use.  What is the Government doing to address the number of local authority homes that are left vacant for so long?  When will the Government introduce a vacant homes tax?</p></speech>

Voids should be brought back into use very quickly where houses are vacated.  When I came into office, I asked the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to focus on this with the July stimulus.  The report related to prior to the pandemic.  Since then, and by the end of this year, my understanding is that approximately 6,000 void units will have been brought back into use.  Specific funding was given to local authorities in the July stimulus package last year to bring voids back in more quickly.  That was added to in 2021 for the full duration of the year.  I have no tolerance for having houses idle or vacant for an undue length of time.</p></speech>

It is a sobering thought that the momentous events that propelled him into activism and the civil rights movement that followed in the North started with housing.  It is on that question I wish to question the Taoiseach.  Today's <i>daft.ie</i>figures are a further indication that the dire situation in unaffordable rents is becoming a catastrophe.  It is contributing directly to homelessness and to incredible hardship for people.  Will the Taoiseach seriously reconsider the Government's strategy on limiting further increases to 2% or claiming that additional supply will address the problem?  During the period of the Celtic tiger, 70,000 to 90,000 houses a year were coming on stream and rents and house prices went up.  The idea that unaffordable supply will solve the problem is nonsense.</p></speech>

At the same time, he was negotiating a disastrous Brexit deal for the same fishermen and women.  The statutory instrument he signed has made each and every one of our fishermen liable to become criminals, in many cases whether they are guilty or not.  We now find out on Committee Stage that there is another twist in the tale, as it is being proposed by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine that it will be at the behest of the Minister of the day as to what charge will be imposed on a fisherman if he wants to appeal a wrongful decision.  A fee of &euro;25 proposed by the Rural Independent Group was rejected.  What is proposed now is that different Ministers can put in a small or massive fee if a fisherman wants to appeal a wrongful conviction.  I ask the Taoiseach before the amendments are finalised in the D&aacute;il to speak to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine so that a fair fee is set for all fishermen who want to appeal.

First, there has been an unprecedented resourcing of home care packages.  The one major constraint at the moment is securing the necessary number of people to work in home care.  That is the only constraint; it is not resources.  That is a challenge in terms of making sure that we can get enough workers into the sector from a variety of sources.  That work is under way.</p>  <p>  There will be engagement specifically with the HSE on ambulance services and on the issues that have been raised by Deputies.  We constantly engage with the Minister.  We just had a meeting of the Cabinet subcommittee on health in respect of that, because of the enormous pressures on the health service at the moment, not least brought on by Covid, which is having a very significant impact.</p> <p>The two big hits to the health service in the last 18 months have been Covid and the cybersecurity attack, which have hit front-line services hard and put enormous strain on everybody working in them.  We are very conscious of that.  The winter initiative will be published this week to try to deal with that.</p></speech>

However, in the Cork-Kerry region, children are facing waiting times of up to 12 months for equipment, such as wheelchairs and other medical equipment, while in other parts of the country there are no waiting times.  For example, the HSE has confirmed to me that in area 5, covering Carlow, Kilkenny, south Tipperary, Waterford and Wexford, there is no waiting list for equipment for children, whereas in Cork the waiting time is up to 11 and 12 months.  Three weeks ago, there were 28 children waiting for equipment.  As a result of raising this matter with the Minister, &euro;30,000 was provided and equipment has been ordered for ten children, but there are a further 18 cases where the parents have not been given any date for when equipment will be provided.  This is a matter of urgency.  I ask the Taoiseach for the appropriate funding to be made available.</p></speech>

There should be nobody waiting.  No child with special needs should be waiting for equipment in the health service.  That is my view.  There is plenty of capital money there.  They have come back in now towards the end of the year and there will be underspends in some capital areas.  As a bottom line, there is no excuse for it.  I will again engage with the Minister in that regard.  People with special needs should get timely provision.  I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s point.</p></speech>

I remember when the Zappone scandal happened that the Minister said lessons needed to be learned from this and we needed to make sure it does not ever happen again.  An Oireachtas committee recommended that appointments to the council go through an open process.  The Government collectively rejected that and now we know why.  The Taoiseach let Fine Gael walk all over him with the Zapponegate scandal.  Now, it appears he does not have any control over his Green Party Ministers.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, is a Minister in the Taoiseach's Government.  Is the Taoiseach going to keep turning a blind eye to that?  Is he happy that the Fianna F&aacute;il-Fine Gael culture has now rubbed off on the Green Party when it comes to giving plum positions to political friends or is it that he is so desperate to be Taoiseach that anything goes in his Government and he has lost control of it?  Which is it?</p></speech>

I will give an example.  A doctor called an ambulance for a woman in her late 80s a couple of weeks ago in Cashel at 1.40 p.m. and it came at 7.40 p.m.  The doctor was in such a panic due to the health of this woman that he called it.  The family contacted me at 5.30 a.m. the following morning and the woman had spent another ten hours on a trolley in the hospital.  I have been told that the last review of the National Ambulance Service was in 2014 and I remember raising the issue when ambulances were taken out of Cashel.  The Taoiseach is talking about engaging with the health service.  How long is the engagement going to last?  I guarantee the Taoiseach that while it may not be in Cashel or in Tipperary, someone will lose their life because of the shambles of the ambulance service that this Government and previous Governments have created.  It is going to be on their hands when families lose a loved one.</p></speech>

I want to raise it in a constructive way, not with the antics that we had again yesterday from across the floor.  There is undoubtedly a shortage of substitute teachers.  I rang a few principals this morning before I came in.  One of them was short 22 staff last Friday between SNAs and teachers, so there are very grave difficulties.  I acknowledge some of the measures the Minister has taken in terms of people coming back from career breaks and job sharing to substitute but I believe further measures need to be taken.  I will give one suggestion that the Taoiseach might take back to the Minister, which is that where people are contracted, especially at second level, for 22 hours a week, scope would be given so they would be able to work, if they so choose, an extra two, three, four or five hours a week supervising those classes, if required.</p></speech>

I accept there is an issue around substitution and that there are very significant challenges.  Various measures have been taken by the Minister to date to try to improve the situation in terms of additional teachers being added, and in terms of supply panels and existing new areas where significant challenges have been demonstrated in substitution, and the Minister has appointed 100 extra teachers.  I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point that people would work over and above the 22 hours.  I will discuss with the Minister whether that is a further step, in addition to the steps that have already been taken.</p>  <p>  The Teaching Council has about 111,000 teachers on the register at the moment, although that does not mean they are all available for substitution.  Work is under way to communicate with the entire number of those who are registered.  I will take the Deputy&rsquo;s suggestion and others he has made, given his experience in the field of education, and I will pursue that with the Minister.</p></speech>

I welcome that and support it, but I wish to point out that it requires an urgently accelerated investment programme in infrastructure.  Otherwise, the targets cannot possibly be achieved by 2030.  I ask the Taoiseach to use his considerable influence in that area, along with that of the Minister, to ensure those targets are achieved in the shortest possible time.</p></speech>

In order to guarantee the security of energy supply into the future, we need accelerated investment in infrastructure.  We also need to work collectively across the House and on councils to try to create a culture of prioritising security of energy supply and electricity supply, with a view to saying that we cannot be putting obstacles along the route every time something is proposed.  We want to decarbonise.  That means more wind energy and, in particular, more solar.  It also means we have to upgrade the transmission infrastructure.  I agree wholeheartedly with what the Deputy is saying.</p></speech>

There is a current backlog of 5,000.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that the Government takes action?  I met a number of representatives from the Social Economic Environmental Forestry Association and it is asking for the full implementation of the McKinnon report within a certain timeframe and to ensure that every application made contains a timeframe for the processing of these licences.  There is a deep crisis and we need to ensure that urgent action is taken.  We have 10,000 jobs on the brink, sawmills are losing serious revenue and a lot of jobs are at risk.  We also have foresters and hauliers affected within the sector, as are people who are trying to build homes.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider taking those two actions I have asked about.</p></speech>

Progress is being made but we need to make faster and more accelerated progress and implement all the reforms that have been indicated with the agreement of the Minister.  We are also looking at other measures to try to ensure a faster planting situation, particularly of native woodlands in line with our climate change agenda, and to provide supports to the farming community to facilitate initiatives, repairing schemes and so on that would help to avoid pollution of our waterways and grow more trees.</p></speech>

I raised this specific issue with the Minister for Education in the Chamber on 13 May.  The email states: "We missed a huge chunk of our in school learning due to the lockdown when we were in 5th year including the lack of group work and peer learning."  Importantly, it goes on to state: "I think we are now incredibly behind and a lot of us are stressed and getting ourselves into a mess with the thought of the leaving cert."  These students are looking for the option of accredited grades, just like last year's leaving certificate class.  I am asking the Taoiseach to make that option available to them.</p></speech>

We want to evolve from where we were and from the measures we had to take because of Covid-19 and we would like to think that next year's leaving certificate exams will be taking place in a different environment because of the vaccination programme and the ongoing successful impact of that programme in being able to reopen society and return to some degree of normality.  There is a broader issue of the reform of the leaving certificate itself and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is doing that.  In respect of the State Examinations Commission and the leaving certificate, mechanisms can be developed that take into account the experiences of fifth year students in preparing for the exam and the amount of curriculum covered so that greater flexibility, breadth and options and questions can be put, which help in that regard.</p></speech>

Many families and campaigners would have been joyous during the summer when the medicinal cannabis programme was to commence.  Sadly I learned in a parliamentary question response today that not one patient has been given access to the programme thus far.  That is a huge disappointment to the families that this treatment could provide life changing benefit to.  What does the Taoiseach say to families who feel let down by the programme, who have to look at other treatments and who will probably get no treatment?</p></speech>

As to the precise reasons why people have not been able to access this programme, I will follow up with the Minister for Health to get an understanding of that.

These are workers who provide essential services in our communities.  They care for older people, people with disabilities and people with addiction.  They also work in homeless clubs, homeless services and homework clubs and I could go on.  They do this work on the cheap from the point of view of the State.  Many of them are precariously employed with no pension cover or sick pay and they have suffered from pay cuts since 2008.  The least they deserve is a 3% pay rise.  Will the Taoiseach agree to meet their unions and will the Government agree to their claim?</p></speech>

They are excluded from driving for many years while they are suffering from epilepsy.  That is a huge difficulty for people who want to get to work, go about their normal lives and so on.  While there is recognition by the State of the medical condition and support in the form of the long-term illness scheme, there is not a recognition of this exclusion from travel.  Can the State provide free travel access for people while they are excluded from driving?</p></speech>

I am a member of a similar task force in Limerick and the concerns of this group are similar, namely it does not have the funding to carry out its important work.  The programme for Government commits to reviewing these task forces.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to carry out that review and to make sure the task forces go back to being community-led and not HSE-led because that arrangement is destroying the functioning of task forces and is not making them effective like they can be.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is meeting the unions and there is an established industrial relations process involving those groups which has been under way since 2018 as a result of a resolution of some of the larger organisations.</p>  <p>  Deputy Aindrias Moynihan was prophetic in his comments last week about the local property tax application process and Revenue subsequently followed suit on his suggestion.  He raises a good point about epilepsy and I will pursue that with the relevant Ministers.  The Deputy is saying that people who are debarred from driving as a result of their condition could have access to free travel.  It is outside of the scope of the scheme but it is a fair point.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Quinlivan's question, about &euro;6 million extra was allocated this year for the drugs and alcohol strategy.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-10a.239" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1585" speakername="R&eacute;ada Cronin" time="13:32:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000029#BB00200"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Parental Leave Acts 1998 and 2006 to make provision for an entitlement to bereavement leave to an employee who is a bereaved parent of a child who has died and to provide for related matters. </blockquote>  <p>I will share time with Deputy Louise O'Reilly.  It is rare for Deputies to get to present a Bill to the D&aacute;il.  I hope and wish that nobody will ever need the Parental Bereavement Leave (Amendment) Bill we are laying before the D&aacute;il today.  The Bill allows parents to take paid time when the condition of surviving a child, as it is often called, is often a matter of survival itself.  Any kind of bereavement is a trauma but the loss of a child is a wound to the heart and soul.  Here in the Oireachtas, this has been felt and carried by some of our own Members, past and present.  We all presume and hope that in such heartbreaking circumstances, kindness will prevail by an employer and paid leave will be granted and taken, but such kindness should not be left to chance or be reliant on the kindness of an employer.</p><p>This is a short Bill but it is one with far-reaching impact.  The right to take this time and have it paid can make all the difference to the healing and recovery of a family and, though we all hate to say it, their economic security as well.  While the world is collapsing and life is turning itself inside out, parents have a right to take time without suffering financially.</p><p>People will ask who cares about the money at such times but enacting a Bill in the Legislature will mean that parents will not have to worry about it.  Nobody wants to run into trouble later on because of difficulties encountered or created during one of life's most savage moments.</p><p>The Bill includes both parents of a child up to 18 years of age and provides that bereavement leave of no fewer than ten days may be taken within 42 days of the death of a child.  The employer should be notified as soon as reasonably practicable that the parent is availing of this provision.</p><p>We all know there is nothing worse in the world than the death of a child.  As legislators, we cannot comfort parents in their loss but we can protect them.  With this Bill, that is what we seek to do.</p></speech>

We know, as I do personally, that there is no greater loss for parents than the loss of a child.  In circumstances where a person is grieving the loss of a child, we should not add economic difficulties to their stress.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Cronin outlined, the vast majority of employers will behave decently.  The Bill gives people comfort in knowing they will not rely on grace and favour arrangements and there will be legal protection for taking time off work, not only to allow them to grieve but also to attend to matters that need to be addressed during that time.  People will not have to be concerned about asking for time off because the Oireachtas will have made provision for granting them time off work as a matter of course.</p>  <p>  In an ideal world, we would not need this legislation.  I trust that many employers will think this is not necessary and that they would, of course, always look after an employee or worker in such circumstances, but it does not always happen like that.  This Bill will give workers the comfort of knowing that they have a guarantee of some time off in such circumstances, not only to grieve but also to attend to matters that require their attention at a very sad time in their life.</p>  <p>  I hope this legislation will enjoy full cross-party support.  I do not think there is a Member in the House who would object to it.  It is a short Bill and if it needs amendment or further debate, we will be more than happy to work with all parties on all sides to ensure we get it through and do this small thing for parents.</p></speech>

I had an opportunity to engage briefly with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Johnson, during the summit, and we agreed to meet in the near future.  I also attended a number of events hosted by him during the summit.</p>  <p>  I spoke by telephone with Mr. Johnson on 20 July in light of the cancellation of our meeting planned for the previous day for Covid reasons.  The Prime Minister and I had a good discussion across a wide range of issues on how we can refresh the bilateral relationship for the post-Brexit era.  We also discussed the Northern Ireland protocol and I stressed the importance of utilising the EU-UK framework for issues related to the protocol.  We exchanged views on the Covid-19 situation, especially in regard to the Delta variant.  I also raised legacy issues, including serious concerns at the British Government's proposals and the impact they would have on victims and families.</p>  <p>  Previously, I met with Prime Minister Boris Johnson in Chequers on Friday, 14 May.  On that occasion, our discussions focused on ways our two Governments can continue to work together to support all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and promote peace and prosperity on both a North-South and east-west basis.  We also discussed implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol and legacy issues.</p></reply>

As we all know, tensions continue to rise.  A meeting between the EU negotiator, Mr. Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič, and Lord Frost on Friday ended without any form of agreement.  It is reported today that face-to-face talks are taking place this week between senior Irish and British Government figures.  The Taoiseach might outline to the House in detail what that involves and who is taking part in those discussions.</p>  <p>  Discussions between Irish and EU officials to plan a response should the UK trigger Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol have also been held.  The Taoiseach outlined to us his discussions and meeting with Prime Minister Johnson which, it seems, were not of much value.  In relation to the Taoiseach's discussions with US President Biden, will the Taoiseach outline what was said and what, if anything, was helpful?</p>  <p>  There is a real risk in the coming period.  We all know that this dispute will end up in an all-out trade war.  Unfortunately, the odds on that are growing all the time.  Obviously, there are worries in relation to unrest in Northern Ireland, which is the last thing we all need.  What are we doing collectively to minimise tension and conflict in the North?  How will the approach of the Governments change?  Will the approach change or will other tactics be employed, working with the EU, over the coming weeks?</p>  <p>  I will meet the Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Ms Louise Haigh, who will address my party's conference on Friday night.  I will express our views from our side of the House to her.</p></speech>

Can he confirm that he raised the issue in his exchange with Boris Johnson at last week's conference?</p> <p>Will the Taoiseach elaborate on what contact has been had with the British Prime Minister over the past two weeks in respect of plans that are at an advanced stage, we understand, to introduce amnesty legislation - a Statute of Limitations - in the coming weeks?  I know the Government is opposed to the legislation and while that is welcome, it is not enough.  I am eager to hear what political and diplomatic moves and pressure have been used in respect of the British Government.  I ask that the Taoiseach be as specific as possible.  </p> <p> We await the triggering of Article 16.  Received wisdom seems to be that matter is also imminent.  How advanced are the Taoiseach's plans on a response to that triggering?  </p> <p> It would be a mistake for anyone to try to overstate or ratchet up any sense of crisis or tensions on the streets.  We have had limited incidents.  They are regrettable and unacceptable but the vast majority of people from all communities and perspectives support the protocol and do not wish to see a triggering of Article 16.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-10a.270" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1552" speakername="Se&aacute;n Haughey" time="13:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000030#CC00200"><p>As we have heard, last week the Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il that the triggering of Article 16 would be irresponsible, unwise and reckless.  It certainly looks as though that is about to happen.  Is that the Taoiseach's understanding of the position?  It is totally unnecessary and will be seen as a hostile act.  It would add to political instability in Northern Ireland and cause economic disruption on the island of Ireland.  The breach of trust would further damage relations between the EU and UK and it would lead to a deterioration in British-Irish relations, which are at a low ebb at present.  If the UK triggers Article 16, the EU is sure to retaliate in some way.  Tariffs could be imposed by the EU.  There could be a trade war.  Ultimately the trade and co-operation agreement could be suspended and in 2022, we could be back to the possibility of a no-deal Brexit again.  This is in nobody's interest.  We need calm heads and to be solution-focused.  Ireland within the EU would have a big role to play in formulating the EU response.  Procedures are in place for the triggering of Article 16.  A month's notice must be given and the provisions of Annex 7 would kick in.  The triggering does not abolish the protocol, as we know.</p>  <p>  I want to ask the Taoiseach about his personal relationship with Boris Johnson.  I know the Taoiseach's policy is to engage directly with political leaders and to build up personal relations with them.  How would the Taoiseach characterise his personal relations with the Prime Minister now?  As he has been critical of Opposition leaders in the past for not consulting and engaging with dialogue, I would be interested in his response.  Will the Taoiseach impress on the Prime Minister, the next time he meets him, that he has to engage with the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement?  Both Governments are co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement.  They have to act impartially.  The peace process is fragile.  It needs the two Governments to support and engage with it and the ensure the full implementation of all the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement.  </p></speech>

The one thing that I will give him a little credit for, and on which I think that the Taoiseach should take a leaf from his book, is that in the UK, you can get free antigen tests - as many as you want or need - as part of the effort to screen for the presence of Covid-19 whereas here in Ireland it costs &euro;100 to get 20 tests.  I heard a public health doctor suggest that the reason the Government may be slow in making antigen tests available and using them as a weapon to deal with the pandemic was because of cost.</p></speech>

I am not saying that Boris Johnson has been top of the class in dealing with the pandemic but this is a measure which many scientists and public health people are saying could be part of dealing with Covid.  The UK policy of giving them out free to people when they need them, and as many as they need, is a good policy that we should follow.</p></speech>

Deputies Kelly and Haughey referred to my remarks last week on the protocol, which still stand.  We have been here before.  The meeting we had in May was comprehensive and lengthy.  We had subsequent meetings with the European Commission.  In the autumn the situation was on a good track with the European Commission looking at the overall situation and coming forward with a package of quite far-reaching proposals.  In particular, European Commissioner, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič, went to the North and met all the interests, parties, industrial stakeholders and so on.  He did listen and came back with a comprehensive set of measures, which were not a <i>fait accompli</i>in themselves but were the basis for further negotiations with the United Kingdom Government.  It is very regrettable that in advance of publication of the &Scaron;efčovič package, Lord Frost announced the issue around the European Court of Justice, ECJ.  One would have formed the view that it may have been an effort almost to torpedo the &Scaron;efčovič package before it was published but I do not think it had that impact.  The &Scaron;efčovič package is strong and substantive: it deals with sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, matters, customs and the supply of medicines, which were the legitimate issues that people on all sides raised in relation to the protocol.</p><p>I met all the parties in Northern Ireland last month to go through all this with them.  That was immediately in advance of the publication of the &Scaron;efčovič package.  I had Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič before that, as had the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Discussions are still ongoing.  I would sound a note of caution that we do not automatically assume that anything will be triggered.  It is important that we do not fall into a self-fulfilling prophecy.  My view is very strong that I do not think there is a need to trigger Article 16 and it would be wrong to do so.  Deputy Haughey mentioned two words, namely, trade and trust.  Trade would be disrupted.  Access to the Single Market is important to people and businesses in Northern Ireland and is having a beneficial impact.  Any triggering of Article 16 could jeopardise that access in the shorter term.  What is important now is that we double down on dialogue and engagement.  That is what is happening and with the legacy issue.  </p></speech>

There is no dedicated Cabinet committee dealing with transport; rather transport-related matters are discussed in a number of Cabinet committees as appropriate.  This occurs most usually at the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Investment which last met on 30 September and is due to meet on 22 November and at the Cabinet Committee on the Environment and Climate Change which last met on 3 November.  Issues relevant to the transport sector can arise at other Cabinet committees such as the Cabinet Committee on Northern Ireland and Brexit and as with all policy areas, they are regularly discussed at full Cabinet meetings where all formal decisions are made.</p>  <p>  In addition to meetings of the Cabinet and Cabinet committees, I regularly meet Ministers, including the Minister for Transport, to discuss particular issues.  As outlined in the NDP, the Government is clear in its commitment to deliver quality transport infrastructure and services in a way that is sustainable.  As set out in the Climate Action Plan, which we published last week, we have to take definitive action now to reduce our emissions.  The transport sector must play a central role in this and we are working to significantly reduce transport emissions by 2030.  We will achieve this through investment in transforming and decarbonising our public transport  services, in accelerating the pace of electric vehicle take-up, and in improving our walking and cycling infrastructures.  Specifically, budget 2022 allocates &euro;3.4 billion for transport, of which &euro;1.8 billion is supporting sustainable transport.  In this way we are ensuring we continue to improve our transport infrastructure to meet people's needs, address the objectives of compact, sustainable growth and regional connectivity and meet our climate and environmental targets.</p></reply>

It will be at least 2031 before MetroLink is in place.  For growing towns like Swords it confirms what the NDP pointed out, namely, this project has no actual start or completion dates.  Is that not fair to say?  Will the Taoiseach respond?  Suburbs like Lucan and Finglas are also facing another ten years of congestion with new Luas lines years away.  So many people are so depressed by what was revealed as the reality facing them in the past couple of days.  No matter how much the Government spins it, that is the reality.  Plans for the underground DART line in Dublin have been shelved until at least 2042.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach spoke about the COP and about us really needing to play our part and obviously dealing with transport.  How does that marry with the timelines stated in the plan that has been announced and that we are now fully aware of?</p></speech>

Last Friday, lifts at nine railway stations were out of order, meaning people with disabilities could not access public transport and trains at those stations.  It is completely unacceptable this would happen.  It is vital public transport be accessible to everyone.  This issue has been going on for years and Irish Rail has failed to rectify it.  Lifts at railway stations frequently becoming broken and being out of order mean people cannot access trains to go to work, school, college and other activities.  It is utterly unacceptable.  Will the Government ensure Irish Rail acts urgently to rectify this so everybody can access public transport, which is what Irish Rail is funded to do?</p></speech>

There are 29 children who require school transport but none was planned as the school opened at the end of September, a full month after all other children returned to school.  In fact, there are a number of children who are yet to set foot inside the school because they simply cannot get there.  The Minister seeks to lay the blame at the door of the education and training board, ETB, and Bus &Eacute;ireann but the truth is the fault lies with the Department and its failure to plan for the educational needs of these children, despite the fact most of them were already in the education system.  Due to the nature of the education provided, many of these children live a significant distance from the school.  There is temporary transport for just 12 children and even the transport provided in that case is not appropriate to their needs.  The children attending at Carrigaline Community Special School have a right to their education and the Government has domestic and international obligations to uphold and deliver these rights.  Surely it is not beyond the capacities of the Department and semi-State partners to ensure these 29 children get what they need.  I ask the Taoiseach to resolve this matter urgently.</p></speech>

I commend the Access for All campaign for highlighting the constant problem at DART stations.  We have many of them in our area.  A key aspect of that is the lack of staff in DART stations to actually assist people when there are difficulties with lifts and to report these difficulties and so on.</p>  <p>  I also wish to ask the Taoiseach about something I have asked him about before, that is, the grants for taxi drivers moving to electric vehicles.  The scheme was discontinued and I got answer from the Department saying the &euro;15 million funding had been used up.  There are many taxi drivers who want to move to electric vehicles.  The &euro;20,000 is inadequate and for some it is &euro;10,000 because you have to scrap a vehicle.  We need to make this available.  Some are saying companies can get up to ten or 20 grants while individual taxi drivers cannot access the scheme, which is completely wrong.  We need to put more money into that scheme and re-establish it as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

I presume the Taoiseach will say the Government is prioritising this but it is certainly some type of prioritisation when the Government is delaying it for a decade.  The word "prioritise" loses all meaning in that context.  People will scratch their heads and wonder how on earth it makes sense to be talking about a cut of up to 50% in carbon emissions from transport on the one hand and literally the next week to have this cutting of vital public transport investment.  However, if one looks at the National Transport Authority's Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2022-2042 it begins to make sense in a certain perverse way.  In it the height of the ambition is to increase public transport use at morning times by 4%, specifically, by 20% to 23.9%.  That is it.  That is the height of its ambition.  It also wants to reduce car usage by less than 10%.  It is incredible but it explains the whole focus on electric cars as opposed to what we need, which is investment in free, green and frequent public transport.</p></speech>

The plan clearly states the railway order applications will be made for the Metrolink and the DART+ west next year and the Finglas LUAS in 2023 or 2024.  The draft strategy also envisages the roll-out of BusConnects between 2022 and 2024.  All of that is welcome, though I would like to see the roll-out of the bus routes a little bit faster.  Other elements of the plan represent significant shifts in policy.  It is regrettable to see the DART underground pushed out to at least 2042 and the shelving of the LUAS green line being upgraded to metro standard.  It is important all stakeholders have the opportunities to analyse and make considered submissions to the strategy.  Institutions, industry, residents, local authorities and Members of this House will all want to have, and should have, their say.  The NTA is proposing a very short period of consultation.  Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to request the NTA extend the consultation period until mid or late January?</p></speech>

The reopening of the United States of America for non-essential travel is an important moment for Aer Lingus.  The company is running 70 flights to the United States this week and every seat on those flights has been booked.  The company now plans to increase transatlantic capacity for the months ahead.  This should be the moment Aer Lingus withdraws the austerity proposals with which it has confronted its workforce.  Those proposals, as the Taoiseach knows, include a wage freeze to 2024, lower starting pay rates and cuts to both shift allowances and sick pay.  However, Aer Lingus has not withdrawn these proposals.  The Taoiseach's Government has the power to put pressure on that company to do so.  The fact Aer Lingus's wage bill is being paid in large measure by the State through the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, gives the Taoiseach's Government real leverage here.  Will the Taoiseach now take the opportunity to take appropriate action to defend the wages and conditions of these key workers?</p></speech>

It has been completely and deliberately spun in a different direction by Deputies; for what reason I do not know.  The three key priorities are BusConnects, DART+ and MetroLink.  All three of those key projects in the national development plan, NDP, are being moved very quickly by the Minister.  They will be brought before the Government, some before the end of the year, and in January or February next year, with a view to getting the planning application for MetroLink in particular, early in 2022.</p></speech>

Major work has already gone into MetroLink and we have to get it ready for planning.  As public representatives, the most effective thing we can do is to collectively get behind it when it gets into the planning process.  That will be challenging because Deputies will come to the House saying different things when we get to that stage.</p></speech>

This is very significant because further investment in DART and Luas, which are already fully electric, is how that reduction will happen.  It will also be as a result of the complete transition away from fossil fuels for buses within 13 years, although I would like to see that happen faster.  Acceleration of investment in walking and cycling infrastructure will also deliver substantial greenhouse gas reductions.  That is the agenda.</p>  <p>  There are a whole range of other projects, such as the rail line to Navan and so forth, that are provided for in that plan. </p></speech>

It was a very good announcement and decision that we, together with the ETB, got that school up and running so quickly, which was necessary.  The ETB and Bus &Eacute;ireann should ensure there is proper school transport.  I will engage with the Minister and the parties involved in the development of that school, which is providing good quality education for the children who needed access to special education in what has been a challenging context for quite a number of years.  We have put a particular focus on facilitating access to this school for the children involved.</p>  <p>  I take Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's very fair point on Irish Rail and access issues.  I will work with the Minister in making this an absolute requirement across the board in respect of that issue.  Deputy Boyd Barrett raised it also.  </p>  <p>  I will revert to the Minister on the issue of more funding for the electric vehicle, EV, taxi system.  I have no issue with more funding to facilitate more utilisation and take-up of electric vehicles by taxi drivers.</p>  <p>  I have dealt with the issue raised by Deputy Paul Murphy.  We are not cutting public transport initiatives.  Some &euro;165 billion over the next ten years has been allocated in the NDP, at a ratio of 2:1 in favour of public transport over cars.</p></speech>

It has been a huge cost for us to have missed our afforestation targets in Ireland in recent years.  Over the past five years, we have missed planting targets by more than 15,000 ha.  Had this area been afforested, these forests had the potential to remove 5.4 million tonnes of carbon.  This is a major missed opportunity.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, afforestation for 2021 will be approximately 2,000 ha, which is well below where we should be.  Simply put, as the Taoiseach knows, not enough licences are being granted to plant land and increase our current record low levels of afforestation.  The Taoiseach also knows we are now in the planting season.  Last week, forestry workers were outside the gates of Leinster House protesting because they want to get to work.  I stand in solidarity with them.  If the Department can only administer a 2,000 ha programme, what changes will we see to immediately address the licensing crisis to ensure future targets are reached?  How will farmer confidence be restored and meaningful afforestation be incentivised?</p></speech>

Despite recent protestations by Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il on the deal, it is worth reminding ourselves that the Government agreed to the negotiating mandate for that deal, which included beef.  Throughout the negotiations Sinn F&eacute;in called repeatedly for beef to be taken out of the negotiating mandate but no action was taken by the Government on that.  We warned consistently that this deal was incompatible with the EU's climate action commitment.  In fact, the outworking of some of this deal would be utterly destructive to the planet and to climate.</p>  <p>  When the deal was done, we again called on the Government and the Opposition to reject together this deal outright.  Fianna F&aacute;il agreed with us at the time, yet the position articulated by the Taoiseach was not reflected in the programme for Government agreed with Fine Gael.  The only reference to the deal is an economic and sustainability assessment.  Last week, the Taoiseach told us that the Mercosur deal is not reconcilable with the climate objectives of the European Union.  As that is absolutely the case, my question is straightforward.  Has the Taoiseach or the Government informed the EU Commission of Ireland's opposition to Mercosur?</p></speech>

Last time around, participants in the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, were prohibited from planting their land during the five-year programme.  If we are to have availability of land in the next five years of the CAP forestry programme, it is essential that the environmental scheme formulated in the next CAP provides farmers with afforestation measures that will allow them to qualify for that scheme.  We have only reached 25% of our afforestation targets this year.  Land available for afforestation has to be part of this new environmental scheme.</p>  <p>  I also ask that the requirement for a thinning licence should be removed from the legislative process.  Thinning is just a tool to get a crop to reach its correct maturity.  It is ridiculous to have a requirement for a thinning licence.  It is holding up the issuing of licences and further clogging a licensing system that is under pressure.  </p></speech>

I am glad to say I got a call from Coillte yesterday informing me it had decided to abandon the sale.  Coillte tried to suggest that the sale was not finalised.  I will inform the House that there were for sale signs all around the forest when I went there.  Killegar forest was being advertised on an estate agent's website so Coillte had planned to sell it.  Intervention and public outcry stopped it.</p>  <p>  When Coillte phoned me, I was told it was considering selling because access problems were impeding the Killegar's commercial viability.  That points to one of the big problems with forestry in this country, which is that Coillte's mandate is all wrong.  It is linked to commercial viability rather than the expansion and protection of the forest estate, issues such as biodiversity and supporting farmers in developing afforestation as a viable livelihood rather than a problem for them.  The Government should consider revisiting the Act governing Coillte and changing Coillte's mandate in that context.</p></speech>

He has indicated that he aims to make up for the shortfall in methane cuts by delivering instead on carbon cuts.  Does the Taoiseach accept that he is not comparing like with like?  Methane breaks down in the atmosphere more quickly than carbon and methane cuts, therefore, have added value from the point of view of combating climate change.  Does the Taoiseach further accept that his low methane reduction targets for this State represent a blow to this country's climate change ambitions and are effectively a surrender to the agribusiness lobby and the big dairy farmers?</p></speech>

Deputies Kelly and Cahill raised the issue of afforestation and issues with the licensing of forestry operations because of changes to the appropriate assessment procedure, due to European Court of Justice and Irish law rulings relating to environmental regulation.  We are addressing these issues robustly.  I am not happy with the low level of planting over the last decade.  It is not where we should have been and we are not where we should be today.  In the context of what Deputy Boyd Barrett said, I think we do need commercial forestries but, in parallel with that, we also need native woodlands to be planted and policies and incentives that would facilitate the growth of native woodland.  Those policies need to be developed and will be developed.  I am very taken by Deputy Cahill's point about the environmental schemes, such as the new Pillar 2 environmental scheme, and that we would look at the aspect of forestry in that context.  Obviously it will have to be sustainable and in the context of an environmental scheme.  We have to move much more comprehensively, faster and more flexibly on the growing of trees in this country than we currently are doing.  That is the bottom line.</p></speech>

There is a legitimate argument about the nature of the trees that have been grown over the years but we have to follow through on commitments made.  One of the difficulties is that many involved in farming have lost confidence in the programme because of the series of objections and the difficulties in felling and getting licences and so on.  The system has to be overhauled.  Additional resources have been put into the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, including ecologists, forestry inspectors and additional administrative staff.  A team of 27 ecologists has been recruited to deal with licensing, which is an increase from only two 18 months ago.  There were only two ecologists dealing with this 18 months ago and there are 27 now.  Licensing this year will be significantly up on 2020.  We have issued more licences to date this year than in the whole of 2020, with 3,045 this year compared to 2,592 for all of 2020.  Some &euro;723 million of carbon tax funding will be allocated to a flagship agri-environmental climate measure.  That is in addition to the Pillar 2 scheme to encourage farmers to farm in a greener, more sustainable way.  That is carbon tax funding that Deputy McDonald is against.  I do not know how we are supposed to do all these things if we do not have some funding.  Deputy Boyd Barrett and Deputy Barry are against it-----</p></speech>

I am very impatient and intolerant of this whole area because Ireland is a place where we can and should be growing far more trees than we are growing.  Doing so creates a carbon sink, ultimately.  It is probably the ultimate guarantor we have in terms of emissions and getting Ireland's contribution to climate change right.  I take the overall point that the mandate of Coillte has to be a very clear one.  In addition to its work on the commercial side, it has a strong mandate and it must now be part of the solution to climate change by addressing that issue through land use strategies and through the forestry sector.  That is something we are very committed to.</p>  <p>  Deputy McDonald raised the Mercosur agreement.  I have articulated at European Council level Ireland's position on Mercosur because of the continuing deforestation of the Amazon region by the Brazilian Government.  I have made that clear.  As the Deputy knows, the European Union conducts trade negotiations on behalf of the European Union.  Individual states do not.  I am intrigued by the Deputy's constant invocation of Mercosur.  I understand why she is doing that.  For me, it is not compatible with climate change.  Of late, the Commission and the European Council are saying that trade agreements more generally have to be in line with the climate change objectives of the European Union.  One of the biggest issues on the agenda of the European Union is climate change and that will manifest itself in the Fit for 55 package.  There will be a lot of negotiations around that.  Challenging issues will arise out of this in the fullness of time but we have made very clear, and I have made it consistently clear at EU Council meetings, our position on Mercosur.  Other countries want Mercosur to happen.  I believe generally in trade.  That is why I supported the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, that is, the Canadian treaty, which Deputy McDonald opposed.  She continues to oppose it, as do other Deputies in the House.  Yet, CETA has led to a massive increase in the growth of exports from Ireland, from small to medium-sized Irish companies to the Canadian market.

There is much heavy detail in this Bill.  It is about ratification of a treaty between the Eurogroup members within the EU.  It is not specifically an EU treaty or an agreement.  It involves the Eurogroup within the EU.  There is a treaty in place.  When people read the legislation they will note it is very short but it contains very long Schedules because it relates to a treaty.  All the appendices in respect of the treaty and content are written in both Irish and in English in the Bill as presented.  It appears a voluminous Bill but much of the content is due to the appendices being very large.</p><p>The purpose of this legislation is to seek the approval of the Oireachtas to ratify two amending agreements agreed between the Eurogroup last November, with the objective of strengthening the crisis resolution capabilities of the euro area.  I stress I am referring to the banking sector for the information of people listening in to this debate.  In summary, the two amending agreements provided for the reform of the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, as well as the introduction of the common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund, SRF, from January 2022, two years ahead of schedule.  I will provide more detail on the content of the amending agreements, as well as the Bill, during the course of my opening statement.  This agreement represents a significant political development following protracted political discussions and is a substantial milestone in the development of economic and monetary union.</p><p>The two amending agreements in question, the ESM treaty and the Single Resolution Fund intergovernmental agreement, IGA, were signed by the 19 members of the euro area, including Ireland, in January of this year and are subject to ratification.  I acknowledge the tremendous work of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, who, as chairman of the Eurogroup, was involved during this process.  There was a great deal of effort and strong engagement on his part during the entire process.</p><p>The Eurogroup has agreed that following the appropriate ratification procedures in each of the euro member states both amending agreements should enter into force from the beginning of 2022.  Our ambition is to progress Ireland's national ratification procedure swiftly over the coming weeks so that we can meet this commitment.</p><p>I will give a brief overview of ESM treaty reform.  It is composed of four complementary and mutually reinforcing building blocks.  The centrepiece of ESM treaty reform is the establishment of a common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund with the ESM as provider.  The ESM is a little like the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, at national level but it will operate at European level in the banking sector with funds and the ability to borrow such that if there is a crisis in the financial sector, it will be dealt with through the ESM and the banks and the funds they will have in place and will not fall back to the taxpayer, as would have happened previously.</p><p>The common backstop necessitates amendment of both the ESM treaty and the Single Resolution Fund intergovernmental agreement.  The backstop will be available as a last resort to support effective and credible crisis management within the Single Resolution Mechanism framework.  Loans from the backstop to the SRF will be repaid via contributions from the European banking sector, meaning there will be no use of taxpayer funds.  The common backstop will replace the existing ESM tool for dealing with bank failures, the direct recapitalisation instrument.  The backstop better suits current regulation and the overall banking union architecture.</p><p>The Single Resolution Fund was established for the purpose of applying resolution tools and exercising resolution powers.  The fund is financed by levies imposed on credit institutions at national level and member states entered into an intergovernmental agreement, which established a transitional period of eight years, during which time national contributions would be progressively mutualised into a common fund.  These reforms will allow the backstop to come into operation two years ahead of schedule.  This is a significant positive decision that marks another important step towards completing the banking union.  When I refer to national contributions I am referring to contributions from the banks, not from the taxpayer.</p><p>The early introduction of the common backstop will bring real benefits and additional stability to the European banking sector while protecting taxpayer resources.  As the backstop will be repaid by bank sector contributions, the resolution of a bank will no longer put taxpayer resources at risk.  This is in line with our goal of breaking the link between banks and their sovereign states. </p><p>The second element of ESM treaty reform involves the modernisation of the ESM's financial assistance toolkit.  The ESM's precautionary conditioned credit line, PCCL, is reformed to enhance its effectiveness in order to prevent minor crises from escalating into more serious ones that might make it necessary for the member state to request an ESM loan with a full economic adjustment programme.  The PCCL is available to any ESM member whose economic and financial situation is fundamentally sound but which could be affected by adverse shock beyond its control.  The reform standardises the application process for PCCL access making it more transparent and predictable.</p><p>The third element of ESM treaty reform provides for a stronger future role for the ESM in the design, negotiation and monitoring of future financial assistance programmes.  The existing ESM treaty allocates the various tasks involved in the ESM's operations to the European Commission, the European Central Bank, ECB, and the International Monetary Fund, IMF.  The political reality is that the IMF has stepped back over time from its role in euro area financial assistance programmes.  It is therefore appropriate to clarify the roles of the institutions going forward in the amended the ESM treaty.</p><p>The fourth and final element of ESM treaty reform concerns the debt sustainability framework in the context of ESM financial assistance.  A key principle of the ESM since its establishment is that financial assistance should only be provided by the ESM to member states whose debt is considered sustainable.  This principle will be strengthened by three improvements to the ESM's debt sustainability framework.  First, a new common methodology for conducting the debt sustainability analysis of a prospective programme country has been jointly developed by the ESM and the European Commission.  The second improvement to the ESM's debt sustainability framework is the introduction of single-limb collective action clauses, CACs, in future euro area sovereign bond issuances.  Collective action clauses are clauses in bond contracts, which allow changes to the terms of the bonds to be made subject to a vote by the holders of the bonds.  This reduces holdout risk, that is, that a small group of bondholders decides not to partake in the restructuring, forming a minority to block it in the hope of getting a better deal for themselves.  These holdouts can result in delays and deepen a debt crisis.  The final amendment to the ESM's debt sustainability framework is the ESM's new role of facilitating dialogue between a member state and its private investors on a voluntary, informal, non-binding, temporary and confidential basis in the exceptional circumstances where a member state requires a restructuring of its debt.</p><p>I will briefly outline the content of the Bill.  In essence, it is mechanical legislation - people will have detected that by now - which seeks the approval of the Oireachtas to ratify the amending agreements to the ESM treaty and SRF IGA.  The Bill has eight sections and three Schedules, each comprised of two parts to include both the English and Irish language versions of the agreements.</p><p>Section 1 provides the definitions to the legislation and clarifies references to existing legislation contained in the Bill.  Section 2 provides for the approval of the ratification of the agreement amending the treaty establishing the ESM by the Oireachtas.  Section 3 provides for amendments to the ESM Act 2012.  This includes a new definition of &quot;Treaty&quot; and an update of Ireland's paid-in capital to the ESM following the end of the temporary correction periods for three of the founding ESM members, namely, Malta, Slovakia and Slovenia, during the period between 2019 and 2021.  Section 4 provides for amendments to the ESM (Amendment) Act 2014 and amending the definition of &quot;Treaty&quot; within to align it to the definition of &quot;Treaty&quot; in section 3 of this Bill. </p><p>Section 5 provides for the approval of the ratification of the SRF IGA amending agreement.  It also provides that my Department will publish a notice of this intergovernmental agreement coming into operation in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>and on the Department of Finance's website, once the conditions in Article 5(2) of the agreement have been met.  The purpose of this provision is to signal to banks and signatories of the intergovernmental agreement that it has come into effect.</p><p>Section 6 provides for amendments to the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015.  It redefines &quot;Agreement&quot; in this legislation.  Section 7 provides that any expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of this Act shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  </p> <p>Section 8 is a standard section defining the Short Title of the Bill.</p> <p> As I indicated, there are three schedules to the Bill, each composed of two Parts.  Schedule 1 is the amending agreement to the treaty establishing the ESM treaty, schedule 2 is the text of the ESM treaty and schedule 3 is the intergovernmental agreement.  All are set out in both the English and Irish language versions.</p> <p> As I mentioned at the outset, the purpose of this Bill is to seek the approval of the Oireachtas to ratify two amending agreements agreed last November by the Eurogroup, which was chaired by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, during that period.  The agreement to reform the ESM treaty and bring forward a common backstop to the SRF represents an important step forward in the euro area.  When the agreement is implemented early next year, it will make our monetary union more resilient, boost confidence in the euro area's ability to quell crises before they escalate and strengthen the crisis resolution capabilities of the euro area should they be required.  I look forward to a constructive debate on the Bill.</p></speech>

We will scrutinise it further if it proceeds to Committee Stage.  The purpose of the Bill, as the Minister of State set out, is to ratify the amending agreements between the European Stability Mechanism treaty and the Single Resolution Fund intergovernmental agreement.  It is required in order to implement the agreement reached by the Eurogroup on 30 November last year and the signing of the ESM treaty reform in January this year.  The Minister for Finance described it at the time as a crucial stepping stone on our path to strengthening the economic and monetary union.  He has a real stake in this agreement as both president of the Eurogroup and chairperson of the ESM board of governors.</p>  <p>  The provisions of the Bill and the agreements are substantive and consequential.  I welcome the opportunity to explore them and for the Minister of State to present and clarify them.  The ESM was established in 2012 as a permanent fund to provide loans to financially distressed euro area members, of which there are 19 in total.  It is the permanent replacement for the European financial stability facility, EFSF.  It was established with the superficial objective of providing loans to financially distressed euro area countries in order to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area member in question and the broader stability of the euro area.  As we all know, assistance provided by the EFSF was subject to strict conditionality.  In November 2010, the Government entered a financial assistance programme with the EFSF and the IMF.  The memorandum of understanding that was entered into with the troika resulted in far-reaching austerity measures being implemented and imposed on the Irish people that caused great hardship and damaged our economic recovery.  It was a treatment that made the patient sicker.  Among the measures that flowed were cuts to the widow's, blind and invalidity pensions.  The minimum wage was cut, there was a fiscal contraction equivalent to 17% of GDP and we saw cuts to public services that damaged families and communities.</p>  <p>  The permanent successor to the EFSF is the ESM.  It provides financing conditional upon the implementation of macroeconomic reform programmes designed and overseen by the ESM, the Commission, the European Central Bank and, in some instances, the IMF.  Those programmes are, too often, ultimately informed by the ideological bias that favours austerity and privatisation.  Currently, access to ESM financing amounts to a codification of the cap-in-hand process the troika meted out here during the financial crisis, applying imposed policy changes that did not work and will not work in the future.  The issue of conditionality plagues the architecture of Europe.  It is centre stage in the discussion around reforms to the fiscal rules.  The stated worry of some is that, without conditions, funding will simply be wasted.  In fact, the real issue is that those who impose conditions have done so from an ideological position that is counterproductive and, without accountability or oversight, undermines and damages citizens' interests and democratic rights.  The fear of moral hazard has too often been used as an excuse to impose conservative ideology on countries.  Some of those issues will be discussed in the course of this debate.</p>  <p>  I will touch on three particular areas, two of which relate to changes proposed on foot of these agreements and through this legislation and the third of which is related to the second issue.  The SRF was established on 1 January 2016 as an emergency fund for resolving failing banks.  In this country, the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 implemented the original intergovernmental agreement on the SRF.  The latter is funded and financed by commercial banks, with all banks and member states paying an annual fee that contributes to the fund.  In this regard, I acknowledge that the SRF offers some protection to taxpayers in that it is the first line to pump money into a failing bank, after bail-in tools have been exhausted.  Such tools have long been advocated for by Sinn F&eacute;in.  We argued for them during the financial crisis and they are now part of the package across all European countries.</p>  <p>  The agreements and this legislation provide for a credit line to be established between the ESM and the SRF beginning next year.  They propose that the common backstop be used as a last resort when other options, including the bail-in tool, have been exhausted and only when the SRF is depleted.  The ESM head of financial sector and market analysis has said the backstop will double the resources available to bank resolutions in the future, with a stated purpose of strengthening the resilience and crisis resolution capacity of the euro area.  I note that this reform has been accelerated in the light of what are described as reduced risks, which is often code for securitisation.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on this.  I note, for example, that Permanent TSB, a majority State-owned bank, today sold off &euro;390 million worth of loans to Morgan Stanley Principal Funding, with 57% originating from home loan products.  Those loans have gone from a State-owned bank into the hands of funds at a time when many people have lost their jobs and income during the pandemic.</p>  <p>  The Government has facilitated this by blocking legislation that would implement a requirement for the consent of families to have their mortgage loans sold in this way.  Securitisation and the sale of family home loans to vulture funds is not risk reduction, but it is all too often the easy option for banks.  This fact was noted even by the deputy Governor of the Central Bank, with Irish banks failing to work through the full suite of solutions under the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  In addition, the D&aacute;il voted on a motion yesterday regarding the reserve fund for exceptional contingencies.  While noting that the fund is empty and never really got off the ground, the legislation allows for the fund to be used for a capital injection into private banks in the domestic banking sector.  Will the reform of the SRF in the legislation before us today make that provision redundant?</p>  <p>  Returning to the changes envisaged, I note that any loans made from the ESM to the SRF under the new credit line would be paid back within three years from bank contributions, thereby meaning we would recoup any funds paid out of it.  I acknowledge that this condition goes some way to decouple the dangerous sovereign bank link.  I look forward to scrutinising the provision in greater detail.</p>  <p>  On the second proposed reform, the agreements and legislation propose changes to the operation of the precautionary conditional credit line, PCCL.  There are two types of credit line under the ESM lending toolkit, namely, the PCCL and the enhanced conditions credit line, ECCL.  The former is available to member states only when they satisfy six eligibility criteria, such as public debt, structural balance requirements and others.  Even under these agreements and this legislation, that will remain the same.  There is no change in that regard.  Criteria such as ensuring the member state that is applying for the PCCL has a debt to GDP ratio of 60% or less in the previous two years will continue to apply.  These criteria are defunct, redundant and do not take account of the failure of the fiscal rules as they were implemented prior to the pandemic.</p> <p>They fail to take account of the fact these rules must change to reflect the economic needs of member states and the level of investment required to respond to the climate breakdown.  Even the European Stability Mechanism, in a working paper published in recent weeks, called for the debt-to-GDP ratio ceiling to be increased to 100%.  Yet the legislation before us provides this line of credit can only be accessed if you hit the old defunct rules of 60%.  The structural balance, relying as it does on measures such as the output gap, is not fit for purpose.</p> <p> I recognise that other changes are envisaged.  To date, both credit lines required a memorandum of understanding, MOU, that detailed the policy conditions to be implemented in exchange for financial assistance, often policies of austerity.  These MOUs damaged economies, inflated hardship and bred resentment.  Under the proposals, members applying for the PCCL will submit a letter of intent rather than be subject to an MOU, with that letter of intent outlining the members policies intentions and the proposals then being assessed with respect to the pre-existing legislation.  It appears this seeks to replace imposition from above with proposals from below.  Insofar as this is a change, I acknowledge it and believe it moves in the right direction.</p> <p> However, in assessing the Bill it becomes clear that an opportunity has been missed, with no reforms whatsoever to the ECCL, the other line of credit from the ESM.  Instead, all loans under this credit line would remain subject to a macroeconomic adjustment programme, with a memorandum of understanding negotiated and designed by the ESM and the European Commission, in liaison with the ECB and, in some instances, the IMF.  These bodies are largely unaccountable and have displayed an ideological bias in the form of austerity in the past.  We all recognise that austerity failed in the past and this new financial crisis, brought on by the pandemic, is not being resolved through austerity because of its past failure.</p> <p> The agreement of 30 November, which this Bill seeks to ratify, provided no significant reforms to the ECCL.  Such reforms could have been negotiated in line with those negotiated for the other line of credit, the PCCL.  Therefore, as it stands, the architecture of the ECCL is not one we can support.  We acknowledge the reforms to the ESM and the SRF but, taken with the opportunity for ESM treaty reform, this is clearly a missed opportunity.  We cannot support maintaining a regressive architecture.</p> <p> I look forward to further scrutinising this legislation, if it goes to Committee Stage, and the agreement it seeks to ratify at a later stage.</p></speech>

First, it is worth providing some background context on what the ESM is, what its forerunner was and what Ireland's previous experience with it was.  While most ordinary people are probably not familiar with the ESM, they will surely be aware of what transpired and led us to requesting financial assistance from its forerunner, the European Financial Stability Facility.  That was in 2010, a year when multiple Fianna F&aacute;il Ministers told us there was to be no bailout.  I recall the then Minister, Mary Hanafin, saying we were fortunate here to have such a good banking sector.  It was a time when our former financial regulator told us our banks were well capitalised, only for the Government, before the close of the year, to turn around and go cap in hand to the IMF and EU seeking money for a bailout of the banks.</p><p>The money we received was to be the first package organised by the European Financial Stability Facility.  We received a package of almost &euro;5 billion, financed by a combination of the EU and the IMF.  The first tranche of these funds was to be disbursed on 1 February 2011 when we would receive &euro;3.6 billion.  In order to receive this money, this State had to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the troika, which would lead to harsh, long-lasting and far-reaching austerity measures being imposed on some of the most vulnerable people in this State.  It led to a mass exodus of many of our young people, some of whom never returned home.  It also led to the sale of valuable State assets at knockdown prices, representing poor value for money, and has set back the process of economic recovery, as the European Commission now recognises.</p><p>The European Stability Mechanism, in its current incarnation, is similar to the European fiscal rules in that it is regressive.  It is neoliberal in orientation and reflects the kind of erroneous, neoclassical economic thinking which has often pervaded in the EU institutions.  However, in saying that, I recognise some of the reforms the Bill is trying to enact and they are an improvement on what is currently in place.  The Bill's primary purpose is to ratify amending agreements to both the European Stability Mechanism treaty and the Single Resolution Fund intergovernmental agreement.</p><p>The Single Resolution Fund was established on 1 January 2016 as an emergency fund for resolving failing banks in the context of the banking union.  It is financed by commercial banks in member states which participate in the banking union and thus offers some protections against taxpayer bailouts.  The amendment before us seeks to create a line of credit between the ESM and SRF, a so-called common backstop, and this would be used under a scenario in which other options had been exhausted.  It is welcome on the basis it goes some way to breaking the sovereign bank link or what is often referred to as the &quot;doom loop&quot;.</p><p>Another welcome reform relates to the credit lines the ESM can access.  I am, of course, referring to the precautionary conditioned credit line.  Member states will not be required to submit a memorandum of understanding.  Rather, they will submit a letter of intent outlining their policy intentions, which will then be assessed.  Provided this new process is in good faith and member states will not be sent away until they come up with the reforms the EU wishes, this will be an improvement on the <i>status quo</i>.</p><p>One criticism which needs to be made, and which echoes the current problems with the fiscal rules, relates to the debt-to-GDP ratio criteria.  The 60% debt-to-GDP ratio is unworkable.  If a eurozone member found itself in difficulty tomorrow and tried to access this line of credit, the current debt-to-GDP ratio would preclude Germany, Austria, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Cyprus, Spain, Belgium, France and, of course, this country.  Compounding this ridiculousness is the fact that where the fiscal rules are concerned, it seems likely there will be a significant upward revision of this ratio.  The ESM criteria need to also recognise this.</p><p>I will mention the other line of credit member states can access through the ESM, namely, the line of credit for those countries which do not meet the criteria of the PCCL.  This is known as the enhanced conditions credit line.  A memorandum of understanding will still be required for this.  For the connected financial assistance, the sale of public assets can be attached as a conditionality.  This should be removed because, as we know, during such fire sales of state assets, good value for money is rarely had.</p></speech>

However, everyone in this Chamber and beyond will remember the period of austerity, when we dealt with the EFSF, the forerunner of the ESM, and we had the memorandum of understanding with the troika which was not especially understanding.  The European Union recognises at this stage that austerity is a failed policy.  However, this legislation fails to deal with the weaknesses that exist and that will remain until we get serious about the European Stability Mechanism.</p>  <p>  I accept what has been said about the SRF and that there are certain protections for taxpayers and citizens in the event that banks need emergency lines of credit.  That is to be welcomed but the fact is that we are still failing miserably.  There has been much talk about debt-to-GDP ratios in that it is a system that will not work when a line of credit is needed.  We are talking about the PCCL and the ECCL.  I am sure we could add 14 more acronyms and we would all be better off for it.</p> <p>The fact is this is part of the <i>status quo</i>as regards fiscal constraints.  We all accept that there is no magic money tree and we all have to operate within fiscal rules.  However, we must look at the situation in which we have found ourselves during the pandemic.  During that period, the European Union and other entities were able to suspend rules.  They were able to do things and change rules that people in this State and this Chamber had said there was no chance of changing.  They were changed because it was absolutely necessary to do so. <br/><br/>We are not where we would like it to be as regards the pandemic.  We have not moved beyond it and we are still dealing with day-to-day difficulties.  Beyond that, and in the context of COP26, it is fair to say there are many other crises, of which climate change is a huge one.  There is a lot of talk about the European Green Deal, European green bonds and just transition.  We need to change the fiscal constraints and fiscal rules to allow for what needs to be done.  The big step up across Europe is the fact that, as has been the case in the pandemic, states are going to have to do the heavy lifting.  It is not enough to impose carbon tax and pressure on individuals.  We will need to change the fiscal constraints.  We will have to give ourselves the ability to do what is necessary and take the required actions.  We are about to enter into what can only be compared to a wartime situation.  We need to deliver because we are running out of time.  We do not have the constraints in this particular situation or in the situations we are going to enter.</p></speech>

It is complex and technical legislation but an extremely important Bill nonetheless.  The Labour Party will support its passage on Second Stage on a qualified basis.  We look forward to going into the legislation in more detail when it comes before the committee.</p>  <p> The Minister of State and the Ceann Comhairle will be pleased to learn that I do not intend to use all my time.  Similar to the Minister of State, I view the time provided as a ceiling rather than a target, especially on a Bill like this.  While it is mechanical and technical, it is nevertheless an extremely important Bill.  It is important from a number of different perspectives, not least insofar as it will give us a sense of how far the EU has evolved since the financial crisis and the way in which the EU deals with anticipated financial crises that impact on the eurozone and the EU more generally.</p>  <p>  All of us who lived through the financial and eurozone crisis of the late 2000s and early 2010s, especially those of us who were charged, as legislators and in some cases as Ministers, to clean up the mess, will have a particular perspective on this Bill.  We also have a particular viewpoint on the role of the European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Money Fund in providing resources to the State at a time when the reality was that nobody else would do so.  The conditions attached to those resources were extremely onerous.</p>  <p>  This was new territory for Ireland and the European Union.  It was a far from perfect package of support, coming as it did with strict conditionality to which the Government in the period from 2007 to 2011 signed up.  The response of the EU and the European Central Bank to the Covid-19 crisis and the implications of that could not be more different.  That is a point worth it making. </p>  <p>  The Bill before us asks us to effectively ratify the major reforms the European Stability Mechanism treaty, which was signed late last year.  The reforms show us, at least to some degree, that many of the lessons of the financial crash and the way in which the EU managed the response have been learned and, to a degree, applied.  That being said, there are, as colleagues on this side of the House enunciated earlier, still levels of conditionality attached to certain types of supports that are concerning and require further scrutiny.</p>  <p>  The ESM was established in 2012 as the permanent crisis management mechanism for the euro area in response to the crash and financial crisis.  The EU more generally, the ECB and the mechanisms available to the ESM board swung into action rapidly in May 2020 to approve, for example, the pandemic crisis support credit line to help address the financial and health implications of the Covid-19 crisis across the European Union.  In that instance, the EU acted together with great solidarity and care.  That reflected the idea of the social Europe, an idea in which I believe and which should be the driving force of our connection with and loyalty to the European Union as a State that has pooled its resources with that combination of states.</p>  <p>  The steps taken by the EU and the firepower available to member states through the ESM financial assistance are all substantial.  It is worth reflecting on that.  The ESM can provide members with loans to cover financing needs, loans on direct equity, injections to recapitalise banks, primary and secondary debt market purchases of member states national bonds, and credit lines to be used as precautionary financial assistance.</p>  <p>  The new reforms we are debating were undoubtedly made more urgent by the challenge of the pandemic and the way in which the economic shock could have impacted on the stability of the eurozone and confidence in the EU's ability to act swiftly and intervene collectively to avert any ensuing banking, financial or social crisis.  The reforms are a welcome evolution.  They show me that the idea of solidarity is alive and well in the EU, although it can always be improved.</p>  <p>  The EU is a work in progress, as is democracy itself.  Klaus Regling of the ESM put it well when he said that the reforms "fortify the euro area against future shocks" and the agreement "broadens the EU&rsquo;s mandate to safeguard the common currency".  However, it is about much than a common backstop for the Single Resolution Fund, SRF.  It also provides for a more rapid and collective response to extreme financial shocks that might befall an ESM member state in the future.  That is reassuring given our experience in this country.</p>  <p>  The reforms will undoubtedly make it somewhat easier for a country to access lines of credit more quickly and to a degree less onerously than Ireland did just 11 years ago this month.  We are approaching the 11th anniversary of the troika bailout.  This element of the reform package can only be a good thing given our experience in the past.</p>  <p>  We have discussed in this Chamber, with the Minister of State, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and others, the fact that all of the indicators are that the EU is preparing for the swift reintroduction of the fiscal treaty rules when it determines that the circumstances, as it would see them, allow.  I have said before that the fiscal treaty rules were reflective of an orthodoxy that existed ten or 11 years ago.  They bear little relationship to the conditions on the ground today and what is needed across the European Union and in this country.  The pandemic has exposed this fact.</p>  <p>  I hope there is the collective insight and humility among EU member states and at European Commission level to accept and understand that a thriving post-pandemic Europe needs to see these rules changed to allow for greater levels of public investment in order to make Europe more resilient to future shocks we say we are concerned about avoiding or mitigating.  The fiscal rules, as they stand, will still require a general government deficit not exceeding 3% of GDP and a debt-to-GDP ratio below 60%.  This especially hampers Ireland, due to our skewed GDP figures and other circumstances.  We believe the fiscal rules have to be reformed to take account of the need for countries like Ireland, with low levels of general government expenditure, to catch up on housing, transport, health and education and to invest in climate adaptation and mitigation over the next ten to 20 years.</p>  <p> The sensible option - indeed, the only option - available to us in 2012 when we were considering the fiscal treaty bears little relationship to the needs and demands of 2021, 2022 and beyond.</p> <p>I would welcome the Minister of State&rsquo;s views at the conclusion of this debate on where the Government stands on the review of the fiscal treaty rules and whether he believes they should be reformed to allow Ireland to do the things we all say this country needs to do in the future.</p></speech>

It is not the most exciting thing we will do over the next 48 hours in the D&aacute;il.  I support the Bill, as does my party in government, because it ratifies amending agreements to the European Stability Mechanism treaty and the Single Resolution Fund intergovernmental agreement.  The reform of the ESM treaty signed in January of this year is a crucial stepping stone on the path to reinforce economic and monetary union and a significant accompaniment to our efforts to support economic recovery.  It will boost confidence in the euro area's ability to quash crises before they escalate further.</p>  <p>  All European area member states are required to ratify both amending agreements in order to implement the Eurogroup agreement of November 2020 on ESM treaty reform and the introduction of a common backstop two years ahead of schedule.  The Eurogroup agreement addresses a crucial gap in the banking union by empowering the ESM to act as the common backstop from January of next year.  The agreement further develops the ESM's precautionary financial assistance instruments and improves the operational effectiveness of the institution overall.</p>  <p>  This is good legislation.  It is not especially exciting but it is a necessary part of being a member state of the European bloc.  It helps us to build further resilience as we negotiate our way through the Covid crisis.  It helps us, leaning on our European partners, to have stability to keep the finances of the Union intact and protected.</p>  <p>  If the Ceann Comhairle will give me a minute of forbearance, I will move to another area within the Minister of State's remit, namely, insurance.  I promise I will catch up on time.  Risk equalisation is a substantial factor for people whose homes are flooded.  It is a principle that is applied wrongly and unfairly by the insurance industry.  We have had it multiple times in County Clare, where one or two homes may have flooded but thousands pay the price in their insurance premiums.  It is holding up the sales of houses in housing estates in the south of the county.  It is causing sales to fall through because when banks carry out their due diligence, they often will not lend to somebody when flood insurance coverage cannot be obtained for the house.  This area needs to be reformed.</p>  <p>  The final point I will make is also on an issue within the Minister of State's remit.  HomeBond is the largest insurer of building projects in the country when it comes to self-built and privately built dwellings but it is not stepping up to the plate with regard to pyrite, mica and defective blocks.  I have tabled a number of parliamentary questions in this regard.  The Minister of State has oversight of the insurance sector.  It needs to step up to the plate.  It cannot all be down to the Houses of the Oireachtas and the taxpayer.  Something has to be done.  HomeBond has got off scot-free so far as far as I can see, as have others in the industry, which is supposed to be a safeguard for homeowners who have put every penny they have earned into building a house, only to see that rug pulled from under them.  I ask the Minister of State to step in and seek to have them back at the table to offer redress to homeowners.</p></speech>

We were quick to utilise the EU when it looked like the Government's pals in the banking industry were in trouble, to borrow money to save them, but for ordinary people trapped in the housing crisis, the Government refuses to listen to leading experts who say we should use the EU and the advantages that it brings to borrow money to fund housebuilding.</p>  <p>  In response to a parliamentary question that I tabled about the ESRI report suggesting we use EU funds to build more houses, the Department is quoted as saying, "Jaysus, that is not helpful."  Who is it not helping?  Building more homes would help the families I deal with every day, who are losing hope of ever having a secure home.  It would also help the elderly people who feel trapped in homes that are too big for them because there is nowhere to downsize to.  It would help the children who are the future of our State and give them stable homes in which to grow up.  Outside of the Department, the only people who think it is unhelpful are developers and speculators who are profiting from the current housing crisis.</p>  <p>  We are once again here talking about legislation to bail out banks.  Where is the fund for local authorities to be bailed out?  Local authorities, including Cork City Council and Cork County Council, are still feeling the consequences of the austerity measures that were forced on the Irish Government and people in 2010, 2011 and 2012.  As a result, Cork City Council is running a budget deficit this year of &euro;1.5 million.  It needs to cover housing maintenance, playgrounds, cycle lanes and traffic calming, which will all be hard hit or even completely eliminated in some places.  If, due to dodgy deals and downright corruption, banks go bust, we are expected to bail them out again.  People in my constituency do not want to bail out any more banks.  They want to be able to have their boiler serviced, go to local playgrounds that are maintained and have roads that are safe to walk and cycle on.  We know the EU offers an ability to borrow money at extraordinarily low rates.  We should be using that to build houses and fund local authorities.</p></speech>

The European Stability Mechanism has been important in providing financial assistance to EU member states experiencing a crisis and so safeguarding the stability of the wider euro area.  The Single Resolution Fund, focused as it is on resolving failing banks, is also important in the context of the banking union.  In being financed by contributions from the banking sector rather than by taxpayer money, it shows that at least some lessons have been learned from the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009.  Had some of these provisions for economic and monetary union been in place in 2008, it is unlikely that Irish taxpayers would have been left footing the substantial bill that we were.</p>  <p>  When the Minister of State and Minister first began to attend the meetings that led to the agreement referred to in this Bill, their Department stated that they and their colleagues in the Eurogroup would make important decisions that would help to shape the eurozone in the years ahead.  The question is whether the shape that emerges is one that fully addresses the challenges that Ireland and our fellow EU member states face.</p>  <p>  This Bill is largely about deepening the economic and monetary union.  There are some positive points in it, as I have already noted.  Ireland, perhaps more than any other country, is aware of the importance of ensuring that a repeat of what happened with the banks a decade ago is impossible.  Improving resilience to future economic shocks and facilitating sustainable and inclusive growth for Europe's citizens were among the stated aims of the negotiations which brought about the reforms we are now discussing.  These were laudable and appropriate.  As I have already alluded to, it cannot be understated how important it is to improve resilience to economic shocks.  However, I do not see what in this Bill will do anything to drive inclusive growth.  Perhaps the opposite is likely, given that the Bill does nothing to enhance the kind of flexibility around fiscal policy that would allow Governments to pursue such growth.</p> <p>I will elaborate on that in a few moments.  Questions arise about the direction of travel being taken.  Economic and monetary union can have its positives but we can be sure it has negatives as well.  For example, the Stability and Growth Pact is used to "maintain stability" of economic and monetary union.  That fiscal monitoring of EU member states by the European Commission has some obvious negatives that I will address now.  I acknowledge the Stability and Growth Pact was suspended to allow for the economic and fiscal repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic but we have been repeatedly informed that these rules are coming back and the window in which they do not apply will be a short one.  Surely the economic consequences of the pandemic and the need to temporarily suspend the Stability and Growth Pact is evidence enough of the need for increased flexibility on a more permanent basis within the key elements of economic and monetary union.  The suspension of the pact was tacit acceptance of its limitations but long before the pandemic, there was criticism of the pact from the point of view of its insufficient flexibility and the need for the rules around deficits and debt to be applied over the economic cycle, as opposed to in any single year.</p> <p> Given that EU member countries no longer control their own monetary policy, fiscal policy is governments' only significant mechanism with which to react to economic shock.  By limiting governments' ability to spend during economic slumps, the rules risk intensifying recessions and hampering growth.  That is clear and it is a danger that has not been acknowledged by the Minister of State.  This is one of economic and monetary union's most obvious practical weaknesses.  When a recession lingers for several years, it makes good economic sense to implement fiscal stimulus, especially if a recession is deepening.  However, the fiscal rules as currently constituted allow, at best, the slowdown of some postponement of fiscal consolidation.  The rules are not designed for the type of persistent recession the EU experienced after 20008.  Other countries suffered worse than Ireland from this in the past decade but there is the prospect that Ireland could face such challenges in the near future.  There are too many aspects of economic and monetary union that have led to pro-cyclical fiscal tightening across Europe in the past decade.  Such policy likely played a role in prolonging the recession and increased unemployment in many countries, including Ireland.  The excessive pro-cyclicality of fiscal rules, therefore, undermines the stabilising ability of fiscal policy.</p> <p> It is not only economic shocks that require fiscal flexibility and the ability to react according to circumstances.  It is not news to anyone in this Chamber that Ireland is and has been for a number of years facing a raft of crises in different policy areas, most notably health and housing, and has now committed to taking extraordinary and unprecedented action to reshape our economy and society in order to meet our international climate-related obligations.  These are the areas I alluded to when I talked about the need for inclusive growth and for flexibility of Government policy in achieving this.  These areas will have perhaps the greatest influence on living standards in this country in the coming decades.  I fear that in spite of the obvious need for significant Government intervention in housing, health and climate, Ireland will continue to be severely constrained in our ability to borrow to finance even the most productive investments.  I made the point the other day that if a company chose not to borrow in order to invest, it would not last terribly long and the same basic rules apply to an economy.</p> <p> It is clear that increased Government intervention in the housing sector will be necessary to meet our targets there.  This was spelled out clearly recently by the ESRI.  The Government is involved in the most ridiculous housing policies, most notably in relation to long-term leasing, where the State is entering agreements with investment funds for 25-year leases where we end up paying close to market rents on thousands of apartments for the purpose of social housing.  We pay high rents, are committed for 25 years and the State has to look after the sourcing of tenants and must ensure maintenance in that period, including with issues arising from tenants or vacancies.  At the end of 25 years, the State is obliged to refurbish the apartments and hand them back.  After forking out what amounts to a mortgage in rental payments over 25 years, the State is left with no asset.  It is ridiculous and makes no financial sense.  It would be far more sensible and cost-effective for the State to borrow, which it can do currently at low interest rates.  It can borrow ten-year money for 0.25%.  It would make sense from a financial, economic and social point of view to borrow the quantum of money the ESRI referred to and to invest in social and affordable housing.  For some unknown reason, the Government will not do that.  One has to ask why on earth not, when it is so obvious and makes so much sense.</p> <p> It is also clear the reforms outlined in Sl&aacute;intecare have received insufficient financial backing, which is part of the reason for the almost imperceptible levels of progress in a key element of any civilised modern society, namely, a functioning public healthcare system that meets the health needs of citizens and contributes significantly to reducing the cost of living.</p> <p> It is perhaps in the area of climate mitigation where there is the most obvious rationale for rejecting the fiscal rules and directing significant investment into public transport projects and renewable energy generation.  Last month in our alternative budget, the Social Democrats advocated significant borrowing, which we can do at negligible interest rates at the moment.  We advocated borrowing in the range of &euro;5 billion in order to capitalise a green transformation fund, which would be used to fund some of the projects necessary to transform Ireland's economy and help us on the road to carbon neutrality.  It is obvious that the State should be investing in this critical area, in relation to the grid and to the development of sustainable and clean energy sources.  We can do that and anything that brings a return of more than 0.5% makes sense.  Why are we not borrowing during this narrow window available to us when the fiscal rules have been suspended and investing heavily in alternative, secure and clean sources of energy generation?  As it makes sense to do that, why are we not doing it?  Why are we leaving this key element of our economic and social activity to the market?</p> <p>Why is the State not setting up a semi-State body to take control and to develop sustainable sources of energy generation?  The return on that is obvious and it makes sense.</p> <p> We outlined the goal of making Ireland a net exporter of renewable energy in the years to come.  It is doable.  Let us imagine if the Government got the country to a point where we could do that.  It is hard to fathom why this option, which is open to us at this point, has not been grabbed with both hands.  With the temporary suspension of the fiscal rules, Ireland has a narrow window of opportunity to utilise historically low borrowing costs to capitalise the fund.  Without the necessary reform of the European Stability Mechanism, we will have no scope to do so once the suspension ends, despite the clear and obvious economic, social and strategic rationale for ensuring State involvement in and control of such an important and potentially lucrative sector of the economy.</p> <p> Why are we not doing this, as the country faces into a situation where there have been several increases in energy costs that are putting such a huge burden on households?  In short, European fiscal rules have not been sufficient either to ensure the sustainability of the public finances in the medium term or to allow countries to meet fiscal needs in a dynamic economy, nor do they offer flexibility when countries are faced with extenuating needs and circumstances, as Ireland is.  It is clear that frameworks to improve and enhance fiscal sustainability have a place but I argue that the current structure is found wanting.  That is without getting into the lack of proper enforcement measures or the hypocrisy of the situation that has seen Germany and France running what would be considered excessive deficits under the pact for a number of years, while resisting any enforcement of sanctions against them due to their size and influence.  That is a strategy Irish Governments have seemed unwilling or incapable of pursuing.</p> <p> There also seems to be an issue with the precautionary credit lines noted in the Bill.  There are two available credit lines in the European Stability Mechanism's lending toolkit &ndash; a precautionary conditioned credit line and an enhanced conditions credit line.  It looks to me like the eligibility criteria for the precautionary line will make it quite likely that it will never be used.  Countries availing of it must meet three conditions in the two years preceding the request for financial assistance.  First, they must have a general government deficit not exceeding 3% of GDP.  Second, they must have a general government structural budget balance at or above the country-specific minimum benchmark.  Third, such a country must have a debt-to-GDP ratio below 60% or proof that the country is reducing its stock of debt by an average rate of one 20th per year over the previous two years.  Given current and future debt levels, one would have to seriously question the last condition about debt-to-GDP ratios, or the need to be already reducing debt.  It makes it quite likely that this precautionary line of credit will not be available to the countries most likely to need to avail of it.</p> <p> The only reason Ireland might qualify for access at present is the overstated impact of multinational companies in our national income numbers, which would allow us to come under the 60% threshold and fulfil the precautionary credit line criteria.  I would welcome if the Minister of State could address those issues.  The Social Democrats will not oppose the Bill on Second Stage.  We will consider how the debate goes in further Stages.</p></speech>

I also extend my sympathy to his party colleagues and wide circle of friends.  He was a distinguished human rights campaigner, co-founder of the SDLP and a former member of this House from 1989 to 2002, serving as Minister of State with responsibility for children from 1994 to 1997.  Prior to his election to this House, he was elected as a Nationalist Party MP to the Northern Parliament at Stormont, representing the constituency of East Tyrone from 1964 to 1972, until that body was abolished, and direct rule reintroduced after Bloody Sunday.  My family hail from Coalisland, County Tyrone, and his efforts on behalf of constituents there are still remembered to this day.</p>  <p>  I will turn to the Bill before the House, the Finance (European Stability Mechanism and Single Resolution Fund) Bill 2021, which ratifies amending agreements to the ESM and the SRF intergovernmental agreement, IGA.  As noted, the reform of the ESM treaty, signed in January, is a crucial stepping stone on the path to reinforce economic and monetary union and is a significant accompaniment to our efforts in supporting economic recovery.  It will help to boost confidence in the euro area's ability to quash crises before they escalate.  All euro area member states are required to ratify both amending agreements in order to implement the Eurogroup agreement from November 2020, in relation to ESM treaty reform and the introduction of the common backstop to the SRF, two years ahead of schedule.</p>  <p>  The Eurogroup agreement addresses a crucial gap in the banking union by empowering the ESM to act as the common backstop to the SRF, from January 2022.  In addition, the agreement further develops the ESM's precautionary financial assistance instruments and improves the operational effectiveness of the institution.</p>  <p>  As the Minister of State highlighted, euro area member states have committed to completing their respective national ratification procedures by the end of 2021 to enable the amending agreements to the ESM treaty and the SRF intergovernmental agreement to enter into force at the beginning of next year.  It is a largely technical amendment and many of the changes and reforms are welcome, moving from a situation where states that need to access ESM support agree to a memorandum of understanding to a state-prepared proposal.</p>  <p>  I note some Members of this House dismiss the legislation as having no impact on Ireland.  This misses the point.  The European project is about more than one state, it is about EU solidarity and all of us working together with other EU states to make the Union stronger.  The Bill strengthens the stability of the eurozone and ultimately the EU.  This stability underpins the Irish economic model and ultimately Irish jobs, so we can see it has a critical impact on Ireland and our people.  I hope Members from across the House will support the Bill.  I welcome that the last few Members spoke in favour of it.  I hope there will be full support for the Bill across the House and that when it comes to the final Stages, Members will see fit to vote for it and we will see unanimous support for the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-10a.381" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1616" speakername="Matt Shanahan" time="15:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000040#TT00300"><p>As a member of the Regional Group, I would like our group to be associated with the comments of the previous speaker, Deputy Devlin, in respect of Mr. Currie.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Bill is to ratify amendments to the European Stability Mechanism and the introduction of the common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund.  The policy paper suggests that the agreement represents a significant political breakthrough and is a crucial stepping stone on the path to strengthen Europe's economic and monetary union.  Based on the amount of borrowing all European countries are doing at the moment, there is no doubt that we are in a very cohesive monetary alliance.</p>  <p>  It is proposed that approving these changes will strengthen the resilience of the euro area and help with future crisis management.  That is to be commended.  It has been agreed to give the ESM an enhanced mandate with improvements to its toolkit of financial instruments' and a stronger role in future economic adjustment programmes.  The question is how that will play out in terms of future fiscal rules and frameworks.</p> <p>Although many people in Ireland might not have interest or regard for the technical nature of this Bill, they will certainly understand and probably have an intimate history with many aspects, namely, our request for European support funding back in 2010 as part of our application to the IMF and the subsequent visits of the troika here to rechart our national economic management post 2010, when we saw the institutionally-imposed austerity which has scarred so many of us in this society and continues to do so.</p> <p> This agreement has pledged to address a crucial gap in the banking union by empowering the ESM to act as the common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund and, therefore, it assumes that the common backstop can provide a financial safety net for bank resolutions within the banking union.  Based on our history, that is certainly something we could have done with in the past, although, hopefully, we will not have need of it in the future.  The size of the credit line will be aligned with the SRF funds, with a target level of 1% of covered EU deposits in the banking union and with a cap of &euro;68 billion, so there is significant firepower there, without a doubt.</p> <p> There are elements within the treaty reform that are technical in nature.  The common backstop to the Single Resolution Fund and reform of the precautionary conditioned credit line will ensure the fund is made up of contributions from credit institutions and investment firms in the 19 participating member states within the banking union and, therefore, ensures the financial industry as a whole ensures the financial stabilisation of the system.  That brings up the question that, if we were back in 2010, would we have had to cover bank debts and, ultimately, would every citizen in Ireland have paid a price for covering the bondholders.  I am not sure where that lies.  I presume that when this legislation goes before a committee, some of these issues will be addressed.</p> <p> There is no doubt we are in a very important monetary cohesion system and we are very grateful for it in terms of the borrowing we are doing to facilitate spending on Covid in particular.  However, I would ask at what cost.  We know the national Government is certainly borrowing cheaply from the European framework but that is not cheap when it comes to things like mortgages, and we are still supplementing mortgages with interest rates to potentially restore our own banks' balance sheets, which were wiped out through the banking crisis.  The question has to be asked as to how long more will borrowers in Ireland continue to pay rates that are significantly, sometimes 50%, above what our European peers are paying.  This is a competitiveness threat and an ongoing competitive disadvantage to the businesses in this country.</p> <p> We also question the oversight that is at present being implemented in terms of our national bank borrowing arrangements.  Given the State is borrowing at a very low rate, it makes it very easy, first, to borrow but, second, it often derives very poor value for money.  The best time to make a borrowing application is when a person does not have the money and badly needs it.  When there are onerous terms to the lending, it will make people look long and hard about the spending they are going to do and the proposed oversight that is going to be implemented.  This is an area that Ireland Inc. has to be very careful about.</p> <p> As I said, there is no doubt we need European stability at the moment, particularly in light of where Brexit is at and where it is potentially heading to.  European borrowing frameworks are required but Ireland has probably suffered quite a bit under them, and other Deputies have outlined our inability to go beyond structural frameworks in terms of investment in transport infrastructure, for instance.  We will have to see the new direction and where these frameworks are going to take us.  We do not have a choice but to support and pass this proposed legislation.  There are benefits, as has been outlined, but there are probably some shortcomings and I hope these will be identified in committee.</p> <p> More importantly, as I said, the fact we have access to cheap borrowing rates is not a reason for us to go out and essentially throw money everywhere without significant oversight.  I have brought up in the House before the lack of clarity on the spending that Deputies are asked to vote on.  We come in here periodically and we are asked to vote in favour of voted expenditure without seeing where the money is spent.  We have a significant situation in this country all of the time where we do not have sight of all of the spending, rather than the borrowing, that we are doing in this country.  I wish to see that rectified into the future.</p></speech>

As most have said, it is a technical and detailed debate but, nonetheless, it is very important for the stability of State finances and the banking sector across Europe.  To conclude today's discussions, I want to reiterate the purpose of this legislation and then respond briefly to some of the issues that were raised by Members.  Obviously. there will be a more detailed, one-to-one discussion on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  The reforms outlined in the amending agreements of the ESM treaty and the Single Resolution Fund intergovernmental agreement are intended to enhance the mandate of the ESM in order to further strengthen the resilience and crisis resolution capabilities in the euro area.  The main provisions of the Bill seek Oireachtas approval to ratify both amending agreements to the ESM treaty and the SRF IGA.  The key purpose of the amending agreement is to strengthen the crisis management and resolution capabilities in the euro area.  The financial and sovereign debt crisis of the previous decade highlighted a number of weaknesses in Europe's crisis management systems, which have resulted in significant developments to the architecture of the euro area since 2010.</p>  <p>  In fairness, the EU is a relatively new concept and is only a couple of generations in existence.  The euro is quite a new currency and I was here in the D&aacute;il when it came in.  While we launched the euro, all of the infrastructure that goes with it has taken time to follow.  Obviously, we want to strengthen all of our management systems because we have a common currency now across many of the countries in the EU through the euro, that is, all those countries that participate in the Eurogroup.  It is important, as time goes on, that we strengthen the infrastructure and architecture behind the currency because what happens in one country can impact on another country.  In layperson's English, we have a joint bank account when it comes to our currency and if something happens in one area, it can have an impact in other areas as well.</p>  <p>  The establishment of the two rescue funds as a temporary European financial stability facility in 2010 and a permanent ESM in 2012 closed an institutional gap in the European Monetary Union, namely, the absence of a lender of last resort for euro area sovereign states.  In addition, during the period between 2014 and 2016, we saw the establishment of the banking union, which introduced EU-wide banking supervision, the Single Supervisory Mechanism, and the common resolution mechanism for failing banks, the Single Resolution Board, which is the central resolution authority within the banking union, backed by the Single Resolution Fund, which is composed of contributions from the EU backing sector.  I stress again what I said in my opening remarks, namely, the contribution to these funds will be from the banking sector, not from the taxpayers in the individual countries.  The Eurogroup agreements regarding the ESM treaty reform and early introduction of the common backstop to the SRF will build upon the architecture that has emerged over the past decade by adding firepower and credibility to the bank resolution regime in Europe via the common backstop, as well as improving the effectiveness of the ESM as an institution.</p>  <p>  Various points were made in the debate.  Much of the debate centred on what happened in the crisis of over a decade ago and the introduction of the IMF, with the European Central Bank and the European Commission, at the time known as the troika, and the various conditions.  People were almost saying this is going to happen again under this new regime.  It absolutely is not.  Anybody who has witnessed the European response to the Covid-19 pandemic will see that people on this occasion, and governments right across the EU, looked after citizens right through Covid-19.  There was great solidarity within each country and between the countries of the EU.  There has definitely been a clear sea change in regard to those issues.  Some compare the new situation and what happened ten or 15 years ago and say it proves the same ideology is ruling in Europe, but I think Covid has proved the opposite is the case.  The EU has changed its rules.</p>  <p>  For example, I do not know how many times over the years we talked in this Chamber about the cost of medicines from the pharmaceutical industry in Ireland and the billions we spend.  I was asked why we do not work with other EU countries to buy collectively from the main pharmaceutical companies.</p> <p>Look at what happened during Covid.  That bridge was crossed in a quick way and in a way that will benefit us all.  The idea of solidarity between states is strong as a result of Covid-19.  While there is no good side to Covid, we have learned lessons as European citizens and we are working together on that.</p> <p> The SRF was introduced in 2016 and it was the first kind of funding for banking in trouble.  There is a suggestion that our rainy day fund can be used to invest in banks.  That fund was utilised during Covid and it reduced the need to borrow.  The &euro;1.5 billion that was in the fund came out and the debate we had yesterday was on not putting &euro;500 million back into the fund while we are still dealing with Covid and while there are many immediate priorities.  I understand the comments about the rainy day fund.  When it is safe and prudent to do so, we will continue to commit &euro;500 million per year into that fund, as was originally intended.  We had a resolution yesterday, requiring a vote, to allow the Minister not to deposit &euro;500 million this year.</p> <p> We have had much debate in the House about the PCCL, which is reformed under the ESM.  There was also a discussion on the ECCL available to member states that do not meet the PCCL eligibility criteria.  It is important to stress that these matters are relative to the state concerned.  These funds are not about bank bailouts but about supporting individual states.  It was mentioned that to meet the PCCL eligibility criteria a state must have an approximately 3% deficit or be in budget balance or have a framework to do that and the debt to GDP ratio must be 60% or the state has to have a clear path to reduce that ratio to 60%.</p> <p> I was asked about the role of multinationals and I confirm that GDP ratio is based on GDP, not GNI*, which excludes the multinationals contribution to the Irish economy in making up those figures.  There have been references to the fiscal rules and it has been said that most countries might not be able to meet those fiscal rules and that they might be forced to go into the ECCL, which can be more restrictive.  The reason for that is that this will concern states that have a weaker financial situation than other member states.  Those states will probably need a more hands-on approach and  careful management and there would have to be a memorandum of understanding.</p> <p> On the PCCL, I note the reference to EU fiscal rules by many Members.  Deputies have rightly pointed that out and said that those rules have been suspended during Covid.  A period of consultation has been launched to update the fiscal rules.  If Members have views on this, they should contribute to this debate.  If there are changes to the fiscal rules, they will be reflected in the new PCCL rules and regulations that will apply.  Those rules will flow from the fiscal rules.</p> <p> Deputy Shanahan said there is never a great debate on spending where somebody does not say we should be spending more and I concur with him on that.  I have a simple figure I use when we talk about the national debt.  There is a debt of &euro;50,000 on the head of every man, woman and child in Ireland.  Every time we have debates like this, Members say we should spend more on this, that and the other.  We need additional expenditure where it is prudent and important but every time we require additional expenditure and borrow money, I ask Members what we should shove that debt of &euro;50,000 up to.  People do not think about that but if one thinks about it in one's household context, it is a clear situation and it is a high bill.  We need to look at that and we have to be careful about loading debt onto other people.  Those were the main points that were mentioned.  The interest rates and the issue of State spending have also been mentioned.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-10a.391" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="15:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000042#VV00600"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  It is satisfying to be able to bring the Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021 before the House.  This Bill began life under the previous Government, with a number of important and necessary issues addressed, but we have added significantly to it in light of the programme for Government and emerging issues since the Government was formed.  It is a large Bill and an important one.  It will mark a positive advance across a wide range of areas and will be an important contribution to making our roads safer and more environmentally friendly for the benefit of all road users.</p>  <p>  In this Bill we will be legislating to meet our commitments to provide in law for e-scooters and e-bikes, as well as to deal with the menace of antisocial use of scramblers, quads, and other similar machines.  The Bill will provide the necessary legislation to underpin delivery of the BusConnects project and dynamic traffic management on the M50.  It will make important advances in the area of motor insurance to tackle uninsured driving.  It will also modernise legislation in a number of areas such as: medical fitness to drive; regulation of driving instruction; and the system of fixed charge notices issued by traffic wardens.</p>  <p>  We have also committed in the programme for Government to the consolidation of road traffic law.  This is a major project, which will involve not just consolidation but also identifying and correcting any anomalies which may be identified during the process.  This Bill is our first priority in road traffic legislation, and we will turn to examining consolidation in more detail after this Bill is passed.  I would like to thank all of the various people and organisations, too numerous to list individually, that have contributed to the development of the proposals in this Bill.  It can be all too easy to say that we need to legislate for this or that, but getting it right is never easy, and always takes time.</p> <p>I would like to mention, though, the valuable input of the joint Oireachtas committee through the pre-legislative scrutiny process.  The joint Oireachtas committee made a number of important comments, and we have taken those on board.  In particular, the measures in the Bill which relate to databases have been discussed in detail with the Data Protection Commission to ensure they comply with all data protection requirements.</p> <p> The fundamental reason we have road traffic law is to ensure public safety.  We all need to travel, for work, for shopping, for socialising and to access many services, whether they are educational, medical or anything else.  We can and should reduce unnecessary travel, particularly unnecessary car journeys which add to our emissions, but we will always need travel and, therefore, safety for all road users will always be an issue.</p> <p> Ireland has made great progress on road safety since the turn of the millennium.  In 1999, there were 413 deaths on Irish roads.  In 2020, there were 149.  The story is not entirely a straightforward one.  If the general trend is down, the figures have fluctuated.  The lowest year on record was, in fact, 2018, when there were 139 deaths on our roads.  As of today, the figure for 2021 is 118 deaths, which is down 12 on this date last year.</p> <p> Everyone working in this area agrees that we are at a point where it is getting more difficult to bring the figures for deaths - and for serious injuries - down further.  The big items which needed to be addressed - getting dangerous vehicles off our roads through the NCT, improving roads and driver training - have been done.  They need to be maintained, of course, and enhanced where possible, but we are at a point where it has become harder to make an impact on the remaining annual tragedy of avoidable deaths on our roads.  This Bill will provide a number of measures which will contribute to this goal, and I will explain those in a few moments.</p> <p> We also need to promote more active modes of travel, particularly walking and cycling.  These are not only better for our environment as we take on the enormous challenge of climate change, but also healthier for individuals.  As a culture, we are attached to private cars, and we have come to use them when other, better options are available, particularly for shorter local trips.  One of the key deterrents to people walking and cycling more is a concern many people have about their safety and this is a direct result of the relative lack of proper infrasfructure for active travel.  We are currently reviewing the processes associated with the provision of active travel infrastructure and we hope to bring forward amendments to improve the legislative basis for doing this during the passage of this Bill.</p> <p> Deputies will be aware that there is a very large body of road traffic legislation, covering a wide range of issues.  This makes it all too easy to say that any given road traffic Bill, which will inevitably deal with only some of these issue, should be dealing with particular topics.  I am well aware that these arguments can be made but I believe that we are putting as much into this Bill as we reasonably can, and that all of the policy proposals which are being put forward are valuable and will have real benefits to the public at large.</p> <p> The main challenge before me, as Minister of State at the Department of Transport, is to ensure the establishment of a sustainable transport system, with an optimal modal mix to meet both the travel needs of a changing Ireland and our responsibilities to our shared climate future.</p> <p> Micro-mobility options such as e-scooters and e-bikes have an important role to play in this sustainable transport mix.  They provide new alternatives to commuting by car, new last-mile delivery options and new ways to explore our towns and cities while alleviating congestion and helping to improve our urban air quality.  The programme for Government has committed us to legislating for their use and we are firmly setting that process in motion through this Bill.</p> <p> E-scooters have become very popular in recent years, both in Ireland and abroad.  At the same time they have raised legal questions, such as what kind of vehicles are they and how do they fit into the framework of road traffic law.  In Ireland, the answer is that they were automatically captured under the definition of "mechanically propelled vehicles."  This means that you would need tax and insurance, as well as an appropriate driver licence, in order to use them in public.  Since it is not possible to tax vehicles when they are not type-approved, and since there is no category of driver licence for e-scooters, this makes them effectively illegal for use in public.</p> <p> We want to change that.  To reflect the rapid pace of technological development, the Bill proposes the establishment of a new vehicle category, called powered personal transporters, PPTs.  This new vehicle category encompasses not only e-scooters, but other new and innovative micro-mobility vehicles that may need regulations in years to come, such as hoverboards, electric skateboards or segways.  PPTs will be intended for use by one person only and will not be permitted to transport goods.  This is a matter of safety for the people using them and for others in their vicinity.  I would like to take the opportunity to clarify that these provisions will not apply to mobility scooters.  The existing legislative framework for those vehicles will not be affected.</p> <p> The proposed approach will allow us to apply the range of powers and offences that already exist in road traffic legislation to powered personal transporters, and by extension, to e-scooters.  Many of the amendments detailed in the Bill extend the powers of the Minister to make regulations for the use of e-scooters and for the minimum safety and environmental standards they should meet.  Other amendments extend the road traffic offences and the powers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to allow them to enforce road traffic law in respect of these vehicles.</p> <p> Once the Bill has been approved by Government, the regulations specifically governing e-scooters will be made.  The provisions in the Bill relating to e-scooters will be commenced in tandem with the completion of those regulations.  This will ensure that a full legislative framework governing e-scooters can be implemented from the day that the regulations are signed into law.  Until that time, use of e-scooters in public places will continue to be prohibited.</p> <p> Some of the provisions of these regulations are already clear.  As with bicycles, registration, licensing, taxation and insurance will not be mandatory, nor will the use of helmets and other personal protection equipment, PPE, although this will be strongly recommended for user safety and the safety of other road users.</p> <p> We intend to set out minimum vehicle standards for e-scooters to ensure that they are safe to use and environmentally friendly.  We will consider, among other items, their steering mechanisms, suitable weights and dimensions, braking, tyres and lighting.</p> <p> When technical standards are introduced in EU member states, a minimum 12-week standstill period is triggered to allow the European Commission and the other countries time to assess the national draft rules in light of EU rules.  This process prevents regulatory barriers to the free movement of goods and information society services in the Union.</p> <p> This necessary and binding delay allows Ireland to meet our EU obligations under the Single Market Transparency Directive, but also means that regulations will not be introduced at the time of publication of the Bill.  My Department is committed to progressing the regulations to publication as quickly as possible.</p> <p> I am, of course, very aware that this is an issue of great public interest and, indeed, an area in which many of my colleagues have taken an interest.  In particular, I thank Deputies Farrell and Lahart for the considered and informative Private Members' Bills they introduced, both of which I have taken into account.</p> <p> While we have given due consideration to each proposal, it is our role in government to legislate for the safe use of e-scooters on public roads and in public places in all contexts, not solely in the context suggested in Deputy Lahart's proposal of a pilot or rental scheme.  Furthermore, the Road Traffic Acts do not provide for powers to establish public or private vehicle rental schemes, and the Department of Transport has no function in this regard in such commercial enterprises.  The governance of such schemes would be a matter for the local authority in question.  However, each of the other issues raised by the Deputies in respect of both the vehicle standards and regulations for use and misuse will be addressed in full in either this Bill or in the subsequent regulations.</p> <p> In addition, the Bill will provide much-needed clarity to the growing cohort of e-bike users in Ireland by defining the requirements for low-powered e-bikes and high-powered e-bikes.  Low-powered e-bikes, also known as pedelecs, are assisted by pedalling and can reach speeds of up to 25 km/h.  We will continue to treat this kind of e-bike in the same way as an ordinary pedal bicycle, and the rules of the road for bicycles will apply accordingly.  This type of e-bike will not require registration, taxation or licensing.</p> <p> High-powered e-bikes, which are those that can be used without pedalling or those that can reach speeds in excess of 25 km/h, will be treated in the same way as high-speed mopeds and, therefore, will need to be registered, taxed and insured, and used only by an appropriately licensed driver.  This is because these e-bikes are capable of very high speeds - some up to 100 km/h - and present much greater danger to the user and to other vulnerable road users.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-10a.393" nospeaker="true" time="16:02:00" ><p>This approach allows us to take advantage of the existing legislative framework for mopeds and motorbikes in the Road Traffic Acts and in other legislation, in respect of registration, driver training and licensing and so avoids the need to establish new bodies to carry out these vital functions.  This also aligns our national rules for e-bikes with the approach taken in other jurisdictions and with the European vehicle type-approval framework, Regulation 168/2013, which sets out the rules for two- and three-wheeled vehicles.  As we already have a legislative framework in place for bicycles, and for light mopeds, the provisions governing e-bikes will come into effect soon as the Bill is signed into law and subsequent regulations will not be needed.</p><p>The programme for Government also committed to address the antisocial use of scramblers, quads, and other similar vehicles.  This is a long-standing problem, which can range from a nuisance to a serious danger to health and to life.  People who take these vehicles to public amenities can ruin the use of those amenities for the communities the amenities are meant to serve.  We can all agree that we want to put a stop to this.  I know that a number of Deputies have put down Private Members' Bills over the years on this topic.  Getting the legislation right has not been easy, and I would like to thank the Attorney General for his personal input in getting this right.  What we will do operates on three levels.  First, there will be a new power to specify in regulations that certain types of vehicle are banned from certain areas.  This will allow the flexibility needed to deal with this problem on an evolving basis.  For example, it would mean that if regulations were made which resolved the problem in some areas, only for the problem to move to different areas, new regulations could be made quickly to address that.  Second, there will be a new Garda power to seize and dispose of vehicles, whether at the scene of the offence or at the location where the vehicle kept.  The second part is important because it is often the case that the garda&iacute; cannot intercept a scrambler or quad when it is being misused without risking the safety of bystanders, or indeed of the rider.  Finally, we will be amending the offence of dangerous driving, so that it will apply in all locations and not just in a public place.  Taken together, these will allow for flexible regulations to address the problem, appropriate offences, and appropriate Garda powers to deal with it on the ground.</p><p>I would like to add that the problem of antisocial use of quads, scramblers and so on, is not  something we can address just by legislation.  I know that the Garda and the Department of Justice have worked on community outreach programmes to address the roots of this problem.  There have also been suggestions of a register for these vehicles.  There are, however, many difficulties with this.  My officials are looking into possible solutions, but one of the many difficulties is that these vehicles often change hands for cash quite a number of times, and it  would be very difficult if not impossible to keep track of them.</p><p>Deputies will be familiar with the BusConnects project.  BusConnects is a programme under the NTA which is aimed at providing major improvements to bus services in our urban areas.  The programme will deliver great improvements in bus priority and the reliability of urban bus networks, and will enable us to attract more people onto public transport, reduce congestion and emissions, and enhance the quality of life for all.  At the same time, BusConnects will provide an additional 200 km of cycle lanes.  BusConnects will require significant development work which will need planning approval.  The proposed amendments are deemed essential in order to clarify and strengthen existing legislative provisions and in doing so deliver vital support to the NTA's planning application for the delivery of BusConnects.  It is important to ensure that the programme's progress through the planning system is not unnecessarily impeded due to potential deficiencies which may exist with current legislative provisions, and the amendments proposed will ensure Government's ambition off the area of megaproject delivery is complemented by a robust and appropriate legislative framework.</p><p>Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, is currently in the process of introducing a system for enhancing Motorway Operating Services, eMOS.  The system involves dynamic management of traffic through gantry display of signs which can include temporary lane closures and also temporary speed limits.  This system is designed to improve traffic management so that there will be smoother traffic flow, and also to enhance safety.  For example, if traffic started to build up on the northbound carriage at a particular junction, eMOS would allow TII to slow the traffic heading towards that junction to give time for the build-up to disperse.  Equally, if there were to be severe weather conditions, eMOS would allow lower temporary speed limits to be put in place.  Enforcement will be though cameras only.  The camera system will take simultaneous photos of a vehicles and the displayed speed limit, so that it can be shown that a vehicle was breaking the limit displayed at the time.</p><p>This system is already being tested and Deputies may have seen the gantries for display.  However, we need to amend the legislation to allow it to operate fully.  This will involve two aspects in legal terms: the power to set the speed limits or close lanes temporarily and the power to display the signage.  Proposals in the Bill are intended to cover this.  However, it is a complex area and setting speed limits on this temporary basis such as, say, lowering them on a stretch of the M50 at 5.46 p.m. and then raised again at 6.03 p.m. is something entirely new in Irish law.  It may be that further amendments will be necessary over and above what it is in the published Bill, and if so I will introduce them during the passage of the Bill.</p><p>The Bill will also allow the possibility of applying eMOS on other motorways or national roads, or on parts of them.  There are no specific plans to do this, and any consideration of future application of eMOS to other roads will of course take into account the lessons learned from the M50 project, as the joint committee suggested in its pre-legislative scrutiny  report.  In addition, any future proposals would of course have to be accompanied by a business case which justified the proposed measures in the proposed location.</p><p>I mentioned database issues earlier.  Two separate matters are addressed in the Bill which relate to data storage and usage.  First, my Department already holds the legal records of driver licences and vehicle ownership in Ireland as part of the national vehicle and driver file, NVDF.  In spite of the name, there is at present no link between the vehicle ownership files and the driver licence files.  The effect is that, for example, if the Garda checks a number plate, it can find out who the vehicle owner is but cannot get any information on the owner's driver licence record.  This can create problems for enforcement, not only at the roadside but also afterwards.</p><p>There are sometimes problems linking the details of a road traffic offender to licence record.  This can mean that person who gets penalty points or who is disqualified by a court may not have their points or their disqualification noted on their NVDF record because the person cannot be linked to a specific driver licence record.  We will address this by ensuring that unique identifiers - a driver number if possible or a PPSN if necessary - will be captured when people register ownership of a vehicle.  This will then be used to ensure that the record can be linked with a vehicle ownership record relating to the same person.  We are also bringing in amendments which will finally allow the completion of a national database of motor insurance policies.  Legislation for this project was first passed in 2010.</p><p>I think I have run out of time.</p></speech>

The transport committee undertook pre-legislative scrutiny over the past few months.  Many aspects of the Bill seek to make our roads safer from variable speed limits to regulating e-scooters to giving garda&iacute; more powers to check for uninsured vehicles on our roads.  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes these provisions.  We support making our roads safer and trying to reduce the number of serious collisions and fatalities on our roads each year.  The Bill also contains a number of miscellaneous provisions, including tackling the dangerous use of scramblers, providing for the testing of autonomous vehicles on our roads, amending how fixed-charge notices issued by traffic wardens are dealt with and linking driver licence records with vehicle registration records.  There is a huge amount in the Bill.  Sinn F&eacute;in will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage which we think will improve the Bill and add positively to our road traffic legislation.  I look forward to engaging with the Minister on that.</p>  <p>  The popularity of e-scooters has accelerated in recent years, with a significant number of people now using them to commute to and from work and school.  The rapid growth has bypassed current road traffic legislation and has left significant gaps in the law that need to be addressed.  E-scooters are a cleaner, cheaper form of transport compared with cars and their use is only expected to grow.</p> <p>I welcome the efforts in this Bill to address their use on our roads.  There is considerable detail on this and we will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to unpack some of that.  Introducing laws is not about punishing e-scooter users but, rather, putting protections in place for their safety and that of cyclists, pedestrians and motorists.</p> <p> A number of issues will need further discussion and interrogation when this Bill comes to Committee Stage, namely, the wearing of helmets and high-visibility clothing; the use of lights; areas where e-scooters can be used, including geofencing; liability; maximum speeds and power; and age limits.  On Committee Stage, it will also be important to examine proposed e-scooter sharing schemes.  These are commonplace across Europe and are hugely popular with tourists and residents alike.  However, there is also concern over some of the negative aspects that can arise if a shared scheme is not introduced correctly.  We do not want to see e-scooters used on footpaths or strewn all over sidewalks and public spaces, like we see in some cases elsewhere.  This causes huge issues for people, particularly those with visual impairments, elderly people and people with a disability, as e-scooters can constitute serious hazards if they are not appropriately used or stored.  It is, therefore, vital we develop appropriate pick-up and drop-off points for shared schemes.  This will be an important issue to address on Committee Stage and I encourage the Minister of State to engage with groups such as the Irish Wheelchair Association, Irish Guide Dogs for the Blind and the National Council for the Blind of Ireland to hear their suggestions and to work with them to address their legitimate concerns and on the shape of the regulations that will follow.</p> <p> E-bikes are another aspect of modern transport this Bill seeks to regulate for the first time.  This is a positive initiative as it will help encourage this alternative form of mobility, reduce reliance on private cars and open opportunities for active and healthy travel for more people.  I ask the Minister of State to advise the House whether she is considering expanding or reforming the bike-to-work scheme to take account of the growth of e-bikes and e-cargo bikes.  As far as I am aware, &euro;1,500 is the maximum cost that can be applied for the scheme, but some e-bikes and e-cargo bikes cost in excess of that.  E-bikes cost a fraction of what an electric vehicle costs and take up much less room on our roads.  While their regulation in this Bill is welcome, I hope the Government is planning to bring forward updated incentives to increase their use.  The Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action heard about the potential of e-bikes to make medium-distance travel more manageable for people.</p> <p> On scramblers and quad bikes, Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently called for action and legislative reform to tackle the dangerous and illegal use of these bikes.  My colleagues, Deputies Ellis, Munster and Paul Donnelly, brought forward legislation in this D&aacute;il and the previous D&aacute;il to regulate this area.  Unfortunately, successive Governments have sat on their hands while communities continue to be tormented by their use.  The misuse of scramblers and quad bikes in parks and public spaces, particularly in urban communities, is a significant problem.  Many people feel frightened, unsafe and intimidated by the rogue use of these scrambler bikes in public areas, which should be shared spaces for everyone to enjoy safely.  In addition, there have been very serious incidents, including relatively recently.</p> <p> The Minister of State indicated the aim of these amendments is to ensure prosecutions for dangerous driving may be taken against those who use scramblers or other similar vehicles in a dangerous way in any location, altering the public space definition.  We are also told the Bill seeks to strengthen the powers of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when dealing with the illegal use of scramblers and quad bikes, including the explicit seizing of these bikes.  It is imperative the provisions in this Bill are fit for purpose to finally address this problem.  This is as much an issue for the Department of Justice as it is for the Department of Transport.  The Minister for Justice and the Garda need to be involved in this.  The most important step that must take place following the passing of this legislation is the implementation of these new laws by the Garda.  We will seek a meeting with senior Garda management to ensure a strategy is put in place to enforce the laws and the Garda has the resources to do so.</p> <p> Section 5(l) of this Bill amends section 95 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 which deals with traffic signs.  We welcome this initiative, which will allow Transport Infrastructure Ireland to proceed with dynamic traffic management on the M50 in the first instance, giving it the power to change speed limits on sections of the network.  Drivers will be notified of such changes via lane control signals along the road and on overhead gantries.  The aim of this is to allow TII to close lanes temporarily and slow traffic approaching an area where there has been an accident or traffic build-up, in order to improve the dispersion of congestion and avoid further collisions.</p> <p> Members of the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications visited TII&rsquo;s operations centre in East Wall this week and saw at first hand the impressive work it does there monitoring the motorway network and keeping motorists safe.  I echo the recommendation of the committee that Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the Road Safety Authority run a public information campaign before the launch of the eMOS system on the M50 to ensure motorists are aware of the introduction and enforcement of variable speed limits and dynamic lane control.  I note TII did that before it launched its early pilots.  It is also important that the Department of Transport, TII and the RSA should monitor and analyse the report on the progress of the eMOS system on the M50 before proceeding with any further projects for other Irish motorways and I note the Minister of State's comments on that.</p> <p> I briefly raise the High Court judgment from last week relating to driving licences.  The judgment quashed a decision by the RSA which refused to exchange South African driving licences, citing residency issues as the applicants were in the direct provision system.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to improve conditions for asylum seekers and specifically cites the ability to obtain a driving licence but this has still not been acted on.  It is disappointing the applicants in this case were forced to take legal action in the first place but the successful outcome of their case is very welcome.  I noted in a newspaper article at the weekend that a spokesperson for the Minister or the Department indicated an amendment to this legislation might be the place to address this matter.  When does the Minister intend to address this judgment and what impact will that have on the wider driving licence system?</p> <p> I am conscious that while the Minister for Transport was in Glasgow this week, hammering home the need to reduce emissions and get people on public transport, the NTA and the Government were announcing the draft transport strategy for the greater Dublin area which seemed to be on a completely different page.  The provisions in the Bill set out a number of measures covering automatic vehicles, e-bikes and e-scooters.  There are significant proposals and this Bill legislates for many aspects which align well with the direction of travel, for want of a better term, towards the type transport infrastructure and model we will have in the future.  However, much of what we saw yesterday in the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, many of the provisions in the national development plan and the level of funding for Connecting Ireland, for example, do the opposite.  I note the plan moves away from the Navan rail line and MetroLink projects and puts light rail on the long finger and heavy rail on a longer finger.  There is a mismatch between the rhetoric and the policy and, certainly, the delivery.  That needs to be addressed in the time ahead.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-10a.398" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1498" speakername="Ruairi &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="16:12:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000045#YY00200"><p>We have done a considerable amount of work on the Road Traffic and Roads Bill and there were many conversations during pre-legislative scrutiny as well as outside in the real world.  What we are looking for is a system that is fit for purpose and allows us to travel as safely as possible, while taking into account the changed world in which we live.  We are doing all of this in the context of COP26 and we must focus on the idea of active living and active travel.</p> <p>That is why we would start with the idea of using e-scooters.  I am sure all Deputies have got it from both ends at times.  In my case, people in my family went out and bought an e-scooter, notwithstanding that they were prohibited.  I was only too delighted when there was a problem with the battery because I would no longer have to answer for anything that may have happened after that.  It just shows the necessity for this legislation and ensuring we do the due diligence that needs to be done regarding all those pieces of work.  Everybody can see that the numbers have gone up in the past months and weeks, which also means people in the House will have got more calls along the lines of "I nearly got run over by an e-scooter and you need to do something about this."</p> <p> We just need a system that works and, in fairness, there has been mention of what needs to be done at a later stage.  Deputy O'Rourke spoke about the questions we have on helmets, high-visibility clothing, liability insurance and maximum speeds and power.  We will talk about the shared schemes that have to be a major part of a workable system but, if we compare the proposed system to bicycles, my understanding of the way DublinBikes works is that users do not have to wear a helmet.  That facilitates somebody to use the system, makes it a little easier and allows more people to engage in what is absolutely necessary.  It is about getting to that perfect point where, as I said, safety meets a fit-for-purpose system that allows us some room regarding active travelling.</p> <p> We all accept what the Minister of State said about the lacunae or anomalies that exist regarding necessary information in databases.  These are all anomalies that do not make sense so we just need to sort them out.  If people have committed road traffic offences, that information should be connected to licences and vehicles so it can be best used by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or whoever else.  It goes without saying that all those pieces of work need to be done.</p> <p> We are dealing with a changed world.  No more than e-scooters, e-bikes are something we are seeing a hell of a lot more of and, therefore, as Deputy O'Rourke said, we need to look into the bike-to-work scheme.  Bikes have changed so the scheme has to change.  I have no doubt that most Deputies have been inundated with major issues relating to antisocial behaviour associated with scramblers and quads, sometimes carried out by very young children.  Again, I would not like to think what I would have done if I had access to a scrambler when I was very young, or a quad bike for that matter.  It is likely I would have done more harm to myself than anyone else, but I have also seen people on quad bikes who should know better.  That is why we legislate; we cannot necessarily rely on good manners.  We finally have to make sure we do the work on ensuring we deal with the leverage and law enforcement part of this and the fact that we cannot allow communities to be sometimes held to ransom by people who act in a thuggish way.  We need a set of procedures and we need to do all the due diligence on that.  There is general agreement with that.</p> <p> On the eMOS system, as Deputy O'Rourke said, we had a day out to the TII control centre.  The legislation needs to facilitate the variable speed limits in this system.  The only difficulty I have with this was that when I was heading home from Leinster House last Thursday that sort of facility was not in or around the Balbriggan turn-off.  If it had been, I could have more speedily made my journey to a meeting in Drogheda and then home to Dundalk.  These are solutions that work and we just need to work them out.</p> <p> Most of the other issues have been dealt with adequately by the Deputy on my left.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-10a.400" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1588" speakername="Patricia Ryan" time="16:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000046#ZZ00200"><p>I welcome aspects of the Road Traffic and Roads Bill 2021.  I have spoken a number of times in this House about the need for tougher rules on the use of scrambler and quad bikes.  I am glad we finally have some movement on this issue.  It is long overdue.  While the majority of users are responsible and use these vehicles on private property, a significant minority have made themselves a serious nuisance.  I urge all local authorities to consider the initiative in Moyross, Limerick, where the council provided dedicated tracks for teens to use off-road vehicles safely.  This approach has been used with horses and ponies in the past, with great success.  Not all children enjoy physical sports and we must ensure there is a good mix of facilities for all.  Many of these teens have a genuine interest in mechanics, which can be nurtured for positive purposes.</p>  <p>  Some rules around the use of e-scooters and e-bikes on Irish roads are also long overdue.  These vehicles are very useful for commuter transport but we need clarity for users and An Garda alike.  I acknowledge the Minister of State has spoken about this.  However, I would not like to see these users become a cash cow for extra insurance and taxation revenue.  E-scooters and e-bikes are contributing to our action on climate and must be encouraged and supported as much as possible.  </p>  <p>  One matter I would like clarified is that it appears to be an offence to supply an e-scooter to a child under 16 years of age, but not for the child to use it.  Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify if it is intended that it will be an offence for children to use an e-scooter and if it will be an offence for a parent, or other relative or friend, to gift an e-scooter to a child under 16.  The 2004 Act defines supply as supply by way of sale, hire, loan, gift or other means of making the vehicle available to a person.  I ask that these two issues are clarified.</p>  <p>  I would like to see local authorities given the power to regulate e-scooters that are made available for public hire, having been to Brussels where several companies hire out e-scooters via an app and e-scooters are available all over the city.  I would like to see councils licensing a limited number of operators, similar to how our bin collection is supposed to operate since it was privatised.  This licence agreement could ensure that standards are met and there are consequences for operators who do not comply with the rules.  We cannot just have a free-for-all.  </p>  <p>  The legislation also includes provisions for variable speed limits on the M50 in Dublin.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure sufficient notice is given for the introduction of these measures and they are suitably advertised in regional publications, in particular, to educate those rural dwellers who rarely use the M50.  The M50 is the busiest road in the country and the system of digital signals displaying changeable speed limits, allowing operators to reduce speed on a section of the motorway, is very welcome.  </p>  <p>  The completion of the motor insurance database will assist in stopping uninsured drivers.  It will also help to bring down the cost of insurance for law-abiding drivers because the Government is not making much headway in this regard.  I would very much appreciate it if the Minister would come back to me on the questions I asked. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-10a.401" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1514" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="16:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000046#ZZ00300"><p>The Labour Party will also support the Bill, while reserving the right to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage.  On the issue of scramblers, specifically, it is most welcome to see some overdue action on their use, and that of quad bikes and other vehicles, when they are associated with antisocial behaviour.  We know there have a number of Private Members' Bills on this matter over the years and action to tackle it cannot come soon enough.  In particular, we pay tribute to the former Lord Mayor of Dublin, Andrew Montague, who has been critical of the scourge of these vehicles for many years now.</p>  <p>  Despite the Road Traffic Act and other relevant legislation available in this area, Garda authorities have indicated that the use of quad bikes and scramblers by minors and youths in public parks has proven difficult to deal with from an enforcement perspective.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are instructed not to pursue youths on quad bikes, scramblers and so on, owing to the inherent safety risk in pursuing these vehicles.  If such pursuits were to take place, there would be a high risk of them ending in collisions at speed, resulting in serious injury or death.  As a result, bringing these vehicles to a stop is challenging.  We welcome any attempts to stamp out that scourge via legislation.  That is to be welcomed in the Bill.</p>  <p>  We hope the Minister of State will offer some clarity, however, in respect of the practicality of stopping young offenders on dangerous vehicles.</p> <p>The problem surrounding the misuse of quad bikes and scramblers has become more and more prevalent in the past five years and in the past few years there have been some particularly tragic ends for individuals using these vehicles.  A number of accidents, some fatal, have been caused by individuals on scrambler motorcycles colliding with or driving into parked cars.  By restricting where such vehicles can lawfully drive, we would hold them accountable to safe driving practices, not just for the safety of the public but also their own, as we need to protect them as well.  The sad fact is that many owners of such vehicles who engage in antisocial behaviour are young and inexperienced drivers who seek the thrill of driving recklessly and think it is above the odds that they will be involved in an accident.  We welcome the provisions within the legislation.  However, we will be seeking further clarity on how they will be policed thereafter.<br/><br/>There is another provision within the Bill on which I seek clarity.  It relates to the powers of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  As I understand it, new powers will be vested in An Bord Plean&aacute;la to permit new roads, which could theoretically supersede any local development plans or county development plans.  I seek clarity on this because my thinking on it may not be absolutely correct.  As I understand it, a new power is to be vested in An Bord Plean&aacute;la to approve schemes or proposed road developments that could materially contravene any county development plan.  Section 45 of the Bill states:</p><blockquote>	The Act of 1993 is amended by the insertion of the following section after section 51A:  	<b>&ldquo;51AA.</b>An Bord Plean&aacute;la shall approve a scheme, or a proposed road development, that contravenes materially any development plan or any local area plan (within the meaning of the Act of 2000) only if it considers that one of the following is the case: <blockquote>	(a) the scheme or proposed road development is of strategic, regional or national importance;<br /><br />(b) there are conflicting objectives in the development plan or the objectives are not clearly stated, insofar as the scheme or proposed road development is concerned;<br /><br />(c) the scheme or proposed road development should be approved having regard to the transport strategy made under section 12 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008, the regional spatial and economic strategy for the area, guidelines under section 28 of the Act of 2000, policy directives under section 29 of the Act of 2000, the statutory obligations of any local authority in the area, and any relevant policy of the Government, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage or any Minister of the Government. </blockquote> </blockquote> <p>There are other areas but I do not need to quote them.  Where do local area plans and county development plans stand in light of this new provision?  Is it the case that An Bord Plean&aacute;la will supersede by its actions any plan that has been made by the members via the reserved function they have on local authorities?  If that is the case, my initial reaction is that that would be a worrying trend.  It could be argued that there is regulatory overreach inherent in that provision.  However, I remain open-minded and I await the Minister of State's response to that fear.  I am sure she will allay my fears.  I have no doubt about that.  However, I feel it is important to raise this as an issue, particularly as local authority members guard preciously their right to make their plan in the best interests of the people they represent in the areas they represent.  I seek further clarity on that issue.<br/><br/>There is another issue that is not pertinent to this Bill, but given that the Bill speaks to road safety and ensuring that there is a regime and a system in this country whereby road users have the benefits of robust legislation to ensure they can go about their business in the best way possible, I will raise it.  As we know, driver testing is now controlled by the Road Safety Authority, RSA.  I have been informed that 32 testers are about to have their contracts terminated between December of this year and April of next year, across three cohorts.  I worry greatly about that because during the lockdown, each and every one of us was inundated with requests from our constituents about driver testing, whether that was the theory test, the practical test or people not getting timely dates for testing and being sent all over the country in order to pursue their tests as candidates.  That was particularly true in respect of the theory test.  If it is the case that driver testers employed through the RSA are to be let go, and I understand there are 32 in this cohort who are on temporary contracts at present, then I worry greatly about the throughput of applicants who might get caught in the cross hairs of those job losses if they are to occur.  I seek some latitude from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on this as I know it is not germane to the Bill.  I fully appreciate that but it does speak to the issue of road safety.  If 32 driver testers are to be let go by the RSA, that would dent any confidence there is within the system.  Some clarity on that would be very welcome.<br/><br/>There is also the issue of the role of Transport Infrastructure Ireland in planning applications.  It goes back to the point I made specifically about the new role to be defined for An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  We all know that on national secondary routes in particular, when planning applications come in from genuine applicants who are seeking to build houses, sometimes on family-owned land and very often on a site they would have acquired or are acquiring subject to planning permission, when they make the application to the local authority, correspondence is put on the file by Transport Infrastructure Ireland as regards its perceived opposition to any planning applications made to a local authority where they are contiguous to, adjacent to or in close proximity to a national secondary route.  At face value, that would appear, theoretically, to be laudable as it would ensure there are not more vehicles coming out onto a national primary or secondary route.  However, it seems to have become practice regardless of taking into account the particular mitigating circumstances of individual planning applications.  Where there are genuine applications made for housing on the basis of a genuine need and fulfilling all the conditions as laid down in rural planning guidelines, there seems to be a root-and-branch rule by TII to write submissions on planning applications.  It does not quite oppose them but it expresses reservations.  This seems to be a uniform approach and it is having a detrimental impact on the ability of people to build houses in rural areas.  Is this something that could be looked at in the context of either planning or road safety?  We all accept TII's bona fides.  However, from time to time there are mitigating circumstances and it is perceived to be overly strident in its attitude towards individual planning applications where there are mitigating circumstances.  That is an issue that affects thousands of people right across the State who seek to make a planning application.</p> <p>It would be remiss of me, as I have done so previously privately, not to mention the N73 Mallow to Mitchelstown Road.  It is a national secondary route and arguably one of the worst such routes in the country.</p></speech>

It is very positive.  I was someone who up to ten months ago took off every day from Clare in my diesel Honda car and drove to the gates of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann but in recent months I have embraced multimodal transport.  This morning I took the car to the train station, from which I took the train to Heuston Station and then I took a bike.  I have seen some unusual behaviour as I have pedalled along the quays.  On one occasion I met our colleague, Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Callaghan, who was pranking me as I cycled along.  I was trying to ignore this person who was shouting me down as I pedalled but it turned out to be a D&aacute;il colleague.  Another day I saw a guy pass me out on an e-scooter.  They have a speed advantage on the cyclist.  As he got close to Bachelors Walk and was stopped by a red light he took out his Lynx deodorant and started to spray himself.  He was obviously going to work.  We have seen women apply make-up with the aid of the car mirror in the car as they are held up at traffic lights but this was a new one for me.</p>  <p>  E-scooters have become very much part of life.  The first time we saw them in recent years we craned our necks to check them out but now they can be seen everywhere.  A fabulous aspect of them is that they have given youngsters a degree of independence from the parents, be it to go to hurling training, meet their friends at the cinema or do what they whatever they do when they hang out with their own age cohort.  It gives them some independence.  It gives the taxi service provided by mum and dad a little break.  This trend took off overnight.  They can be seen not only along Bachelors Walk but throughout the countryside but there is a need for regulation.  </p>  <p>  We have been doing considerable work on this at the Oireachtas transport committee and Minister of State has engaged in that.  There is much in the legislation that is very positive but other elements still need to be stitched into it.   Earlier today I met representatives of the National Council for the Blind of Ireland and they advised there are a few omissions they would love to see included in the Bill.  They consider it is generally very positive but believe footpaths must be a no-go area for e-scooters.  If a person is walking on a footpath, regardless of their age, mobility or disability, it should be free for them to walk on it without having to dodge scooters coming left, right and centre.  Another suggestion they made, which was new to me, is that in other EU countries a noise-emitting device is attached to scooters.  It is a low-level beeping sound such that a pedestrian would know when one is passing them.  Perhaps something similar could be considered for electric vehicles.  They are upon pedestrians before they know they are there.  In one sense that is great as they have reduced noise levels on many of our roads but there is no forewarning as the vehicle approaches the pedestrian. </p>  <p>  Another issue is the designation of parking spaces for e-scooters.  I was in London two weeks ago where e-scooters are very much part of the public domain.  I came out a tube station and saw eight or ten public e-scooters &ndash; they are like DublinBikes where they can be hired for a few minutes to complete a journey &ndash; were parked willy-nilly and people would trip over them as they come out of a Tube station.  We certainly do not want that replicated in Ireland when we get to legislate for e-scooters.  We need to have designated areas where they can be safely deposited.</p>  <p>There also needs to be a degree of future-proofing.  I am a child of the 1980s.  I do not want to guess what decade some of the other Members present are from.  I grew up watching &ldquo;Back to the Future&rdquo; and Marty McFly and his hoverboard, never believing anything like that would be possible.  Now we have e-scooters, takeaways being delivered by drones in some countries and children going around on hoverboards, although I am not sure how they work.  We need to future-proof this legislation to ensure it caters for the next fad that comes along and that we will not be back here in two or three years&rsquo; time legislating for the next such item that comes down the line.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the presence of my colleague, Deputy McAuliffe.  He has led the campaign to fight back against the improper use of scrambler and quad bikes.  I come from a rural constituency.  Quad bikes belong on farms.  They would used by farmers, for example, when they are putting down electric fences to keep their sheep penned in.  They do not belong in the green areas of housing estates where people use them as if they were in the wild west and do all sorts of stunts on them.  They are dangerous.  Many farmers have opted not to use them.  Suddenly 14-year-olds are thinking this is the Wild West and that quad bikes are their horse and they can take them wherever they want.  It is welcome that we are moving along towards the legislative route to regulate those also. </p>  <p>  E-bikes are referenced in the legislation.  I use DublinBikes every day.  I love that mode of transport.  It is fantastic that I do not have to carry a bike from County Clare around Dublin all day.  It is a great facility to be able to take a bike journey, park the bike in a designated zone and then be free to walk to where one needs to go.  The little e-battery that is on them has not worked for many months.  It has been recalled for the whole fleet of bikes.  I do not expect the Minister of State to have her hand in every area of the transport brief but it would be no harm if her officials prompted DublinBikes to move that on.  It is a key component of multimodal transport in Dublin.</p>  <p>  Road legislation also encompasses many other forms of transport.  One of them is sulky cart racing, which drives me bonkers.  I am sure it happens in every constituency.  It is regulated under section 74 of the Roads Act 1993.  It allows for people to seek a permit from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to stage a road race of sulky carts.  I have spoken to members of the Garda about this.  I do not know when anyone ever sought a permit to stage a road race of sulk carts.  People can stand up and the politically correct brigade can tell us it is part of someone's culture to have a horse.  It was part of everyone's culture to have a horse at one time.  My great-grandparents had horses and they fed them oats and grazed them in the field.  We do not have horses, land or long acre grazing.  There are horses in many housing estates tethered to a rope and allowed to graze.  People think they can ride them bareback or use them to draw a sulky cart.  That culture does not exist.  Anyone who says it does is telling lies.  We need to clamp down on that.  There is no God-given right to ride a horse through a housing estate or on a dual carriageway.  That is happening every week.  Legislation allows it happen currently without any great oversight.</p>  <p>  The squaring of traffic fines comes under the Road Traffic Act and legislation.  This has been an element of road policing for time immemorial.  Garda&iacute; leaving Templemore training college are told they are empowered by the Road Traffic Act to have a degree of discretion when they meet somebody on the road.  It could be a person going to a maternity hospital or a person on their way to a hospice to meet someone who is in their final hours of living.  They might be driving a little over the speed limit.  We have all been there.  We have all driven faster than we should have at times.  The moment a garda turns on the blue beacon on the Garda car and pulls a motorist over, he or she has the power of discretion but recently there has been something of a witch hunt in the Limerick Garda division.  If a garda squares off a fine he or she is under a net investigation.  The Government needs to examine that and say that enough is enough in that regard.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State for all her interventions this week regarding Doolin Coast Guard and everything she has done for County Clare.  That mediation process, to which she is committed, needs to begin in earnest.  Much of what we do in the D&aacute;il or in committee can be inconsequential to people's lives.  The closure of a Coast Guard base, however, is fully consequential.  Lives will be lost if we do not have a Coast Guard presence on the west coast of Clare.  I am glad the Minister of State is intervening.  Expediency is the name of the game here over the next few days.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-10a.414" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="16:42:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000048#BBB01200"><p>At the outset and to be parochial, I would mention the N24 bypass of Tipperary town.  The Minister of State might be able to put in a good word for it.</p>  <p>  I would like to speak about the creation of a new classification of a vehicle to facilitate the use of e-scooters and similar devices.  Of course, we need to give them a classification of their own to provide legal clarity on the conditions of their use but there are still some issues that may remain unresolved.  For example, the Minister has previously told the transport committee that it was his intention to propose that these vehicles, which will be defined from here on, as powered personal transporters, may be used in cycle tracks and bus lanes but would not be allowed in pedestrianised areas, national roads or motorways.  Apart from larger urban areas, there are many towns and villages across the country that do not have infrastructure that includes cycle tracks and bus lanes.  </p> <p>The choice of locations for using these vehicles is already limited in many areas of the country, which is surely a contributing factor to their use on footpaths.  This is of particular concern to many people, especially older people, disabled pedestrians and those with limited mobility.  We hear reports all the time of people having near misses when these devices are used on footpaths, with pedestrians having to jump out of the way to avoid being hit.  There has been much discussion on this matter in local media in my constituency this week, with real concern being expressed about the safe use of such powered personal transporters, PPTs.  I would appreciate any comments the Minister of State might make in this regard and on the safety of pedestrians in general, particularly those with limited mobility.  Her views on the provision of the infrastructure she referred to in areas where it is sadly absent would also be welcome.</p> <p> While I understand e-bikes and e-scooters will be subject to legislation that prohibits drink-driving or speeding, policing their safe use will add to the work of traffic wardens and members of the Garda.  Has the Minister of State made provision for that added workload and has she examined how PPTs can be used safely in rural areas?</p> <p> Regarding insurance, the Bill gives legal clarity that PPTs such as e-scooters and e-bikes may be used without the need for registration, tax, licensing and insurance conditions, as are necessary for the use of multipurpose vehicles, MPVs.  In the event of a collision, how does the Minister propose that the issue of compensation be managed if the user of such a vehicle is not in a financial position to pay for the damage or injury done?  Is this going to add to the work of the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland?  In its submission, TII recommended that e-scooters should be licensed and insured under a similar system to those operating in Germany and Belgium.  What is the Minister of State's view on that recommendation?</p> <p> The Bill includes a provision that will make it an offence to give a false declaration when applying for certain kinds of permits under the Road Traffic Act 1994.  This aims to stop fraudulent applications, particularly for disabled parking permits.  This provision is welcome.  As we are all aware, permits of that nature are for an express purpose and are not meant to be a way for opportunists to secure easier parking.  I welcome action in this regard.  Will the Minister of State give consideration to how legally obtained permits are being used by people to whom they are not issued when the named person is not present?</p></speech>

I thank the Business Committee for scheduling the debate and Deputy Naughten for suggesting it.  We are debating science in the D&aacute;il this week and it will be debated in the Seanad tomorrow, which I welcome.  This week is about highlighting, in particular, the importance of science in regard to climate action, as negotiations begin to come to a conclusion, we hope, at the United Nations COP26 conference.  It is fair to say that the outcome of that conference will shape the future of our planet.  Those are the stakes and that is how serious the issue is.  Science and research are at the very core of the formidable task of understanding and addressing climate change, as COP26 is aiming to do.</p><p>As the Taoiseach said in his address to world leaders in Glasgow last week, &quot;Ireland is ready to play its part&quot;.  At COP26, Ireland has pledged to contribute to the global target of cutting methane.  We have vowed to more than double Ireland's contribution to help developing countries, with a commitment to deliver at least &euro;225 million a year by 2025 to help them fight the climate crisis.  I am delighted to note that Ireland's research sector is represented at COP26 in the form of a delegation of researchers and students from University College Cork, UCC, which is the only Irish university with official observer status at the conference.  I am sure all of us in this House are very proud of the researchers and students from Ireland.  The delegation is led by the director of the Science Foundation Ireland-funded MaREI Research Centre for Energy, Climate and Marine at UCC, Professor Brian &Oacute; Gallach&oacute;ir, who has provided updates through the media from the conference.  I look forward to meeting the UCC delegation on its return.  In a sign of the times, the delegation made its way to Glasgow in a low-carbon manner, by boat and train, and has been contributing actively to events in Scotland.</p><p>I am pleased we are having this debate during Science Week.  It is an opportunity to showcase the work of scientists and researchers across the country and, importantly, to have a conversation about what science means to all of us.  Sometimes, we can have a very narrow view of science that is perhaps shaped by our original understanding of it from our school days.  We may sometimes take them for granted but research and innovation shape nearly every aspect of our lives.  We are facing significant challenges as a society, here in Ireland and globally, and, as with the challenge of the Covid-19 pandemic, it will be science that helps to steer us through these obstacles.  Science and research can play a role in coming up with practical solutions to the many challenges we face as a society.</p><p>I thank colleagues from across the House for their support for, and interest in, the Creating Our Future initiative, which is the first of its kind in Ireland.  The idea was that we would not just talk to each other about science and research but that scientist and researchers would talk to members of civic society, whether fishermen in Killybegs, students in Munster Technological University, MTU, or children in an intellectual disability school.  The aim was for our science and research community to engage directly with the population, talk about what research and science means to people and find out what issues they would like scientists and researchers to work on.  As I said, I thank everyone for their support for the initiative, which is similar to one that was run in the Netherlands.  We wanted to give a democratic mandate, in effect, to what our scientists and researchers are doing.  We went out and engaged with the people of Ireland and they asked us to look at certain issues.  It is the right time to have that conversation about science and research and to ask the public to give us its verdict on the problems, opportunities and issues that are the most important for our society and economy.  By inviting the public to be central to these conversations, we can ensure the direction of research in Ireland is informed by the people it serves and who fund it.</p><p>The starting point for all great research and innovation is simple, namely, a wonderful idea or an interesting question.  We hope the public will speak to us about ideas that inspire researchers to use all their skills and knowledge to shape a better society.  If we want to make this country a better place in which to live and prosper, we need ideas that challenge our researchers and innovators.  We need the people of this country to outline what difficulties and injustices in society they want scientists to put their minds to and what ideas they have for making our society as fair and inclusive as possible.  All submissions will be considered by an expert panel and the results of its findings will be published early next year, if not by the end of this year, in a major report that will inform Ireland's next strategy for research, innovation, science and technology.  More than 5,000 citizens have already submitted their ideas through the Creating Our Future initiative and we are hoping that number will get to 10,000.  I understand Sligo is the county that has provided the most submissions so far, on which I congratulate it.  The roadshow continues and people can also go to <i>creatingourfuture.ie</i>to log their ideas.  It is a cross-party, non-partisan, whole-of-Oireachtas initiative that we can all embrace.  I know many Deputies have met the team of researchers and scientists involved in the initiative when they visited their counties and communities.  I encourage all Members to have their say on what we should be focusing on and what the priorities should be.  I urge everybody to get involved, use their voice and help us to overcome the challenges facing our country and our world.  I see Deputy Naughten has arrived in the Chamber.  I thank him for his role in assisting with the creation of the initiative and its linkages with the Oireachtas.</p><p>When considering potential research topics for the future, it is timely to take a look at Ireland's research past.  For many years, this country has played its part in advancing the breadth of human knowledge and creating new technologies that have had an international impact.  One of those innovators was Fr. Nicholas Callan, a professor of natural philosophy in Maynooth College from 1834 to 1864.  A pioneer in the development of electrical science, he invented the induction coil, which was instrumental in the development of the modern transformer.  It was an Irish person who brought that about.  He had an electrically driven trolley in his laboratory in Maynooth, probably the first electrically propelled vehicle in the world.  He even proposed electricity as the means of propulsion for the then newly invented railways.  Indeed, it was another Irishman, Dr. James Drumm, who devised the system of battery-powered trains on Dublin's railways 100 years later.</p><p>Another lrishman who was to the fore in research and innovation was John Tyndall, one of our most successful scientists and educators.  He worked at the pinnacle of 19th century innovation and was also known as an excellent educator.  While teaching in the UK, he developed the world's first school teaching laboratory and consulted widely with his peers.  He graduated with a PhD from Germany, where he studied under Robert Bunsen of Bunsen burner fame.</p> <p>They are just some brief examples, but in indicating some former male scientists and their contribution, they highlight the need to continue to do more to support female scientists and researchers.  I just came from DCU this afternoon where I was delighted to launch a White Paper with two incredible female professors who have had a real focus on how we make sure there is greater gender equality in science and research.  Their expertise suggests that goes right back to the early school days in terms of subject choice and empowering our teachers in schools to have the knowledge to help ensure a pipeline of male and female science leaders.</p> <p> I am happy to say that this Government continues to support the Tyndall National Institute, named in honour of John Tyndall.  For 40 years, the Tyndall institute has played a key role in securing Ireland's international prominence within the ICT industry and especially within the chip and semiconductor sector.  We have seen how the application of advanced technology, developed at Tyndall, has had a profound effect on the lives of our citizens, as well as industry, by its use in smart medical devices, high-speed telecommunications, robotics and automation and the microelectronic chips that enable all of ICT.  As a leader in industry-academia collaboration, I am proud of the work of Tyndall and I am reassured it will continue to play its unique role and guide Ireland in the next phase of technology and secure our future as a worldwide technology leader, while supporting key Irish technology companies and SMEs.</p> <p> It is fair to say the Covid-19 pandemic has given people a greater appreciation of researchers and scientists and the work that they do.  My Department, together with other Departments, has worked to address the key challenges presented by the Covid-19 crisis.  Our rapid response research and innovation funding programme invested &euro;18 million in 83 projects throughout 2020 and &euro;4.8 million was invested in the Trinity College Dublin Covid-19 research hub project under the SFI strategic partnership programme.  The resulting collaborative research engagement focused on immediate solutions such as treatments and tests, as well as longer term solutions.  We worked to collate national and global data and connected experts from across academia and industry.</p> <p> The Covid-19 rapid response research, development and innovation programme was delivered at an interagency level, with collaboration from the higher education institutions, HEIs, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, the Health Research Board, the Irish Research Council and Science Foundation Ireland.  Many of the funded initiatives address the Iong-term health and societal aspects of Covid-19 that will not be tackled with a vaccine alone.  These long-term societal solutions are crucial as we continue to live with the virus and start to open society again.</p> <p> This is important.  We have rightly thanked the science and research community for its incredible contribution to vaccination and I echo that this evening.  However, I also thank our science and research community for all its work throughout the Covid pandemic.  Any of us visiting universities throughout the country will see that there is not one that has not played a real and meaningful role in our national response to Covid-19.  I am thinking of one project I visited in UCD that has applied a broader understanding of science and research than we appreciate in looking at the impact of Covid-19 in children and the lasting impact it may have and how from a policy perspective, the Oireachtas and Government may need to respond.  I am thinking of laboratories that handed over personal protective equipment and those that changed what they were doing to quickly come up with ways to try to protect our healthcare professionals on the front line.  Sometimes they are the unsung heroes.  They are not the household names or people we know or see to the fore, but I want us all to appreciate and acknowledge the incredible contribution they have made.  I, as a Minister with responsibility for science, recognise that.</p> <p> Some &euro;4.8 million was invested under the SFI strategic partnership programme, where the research aims to answer key questions, such as why some people are more susceptible to Covid-19 than others.  These developed quick and straightforward assays to detect current or previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 and study the immune responses in different Covid-19 patient cohorts, including those with high or low risk of developing disease or those who have been vaccinated.  Outbreaks of Covid-19 in meat plants presented a threat to workers and our wider society.  Research funded under phase 2 of the rapid response programme, in collaboration with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and led by Professor Grace Mulcahy at UCD, aims to better understand why meat plants are vulnerable to the transmission of Covid-19 and crucially how to decrease those risks.  Studies will examine changes in virus genetic sequence, measurements of the impact of changes in temperature, humidity and airflows throughout plants and an early warning system using waste streams.</p> <p> The pandemic has also forced Government to examine the structures it has in place.  This is a very important point.  I hope we now have a greater appreciation in these Houses and in government of the importance of science and research and of embedding expert advice within policy-making.  I was about to say nobody here is a scientist, but that is not true because Deputy Naughten is and maybe others are as well.  Many of us who hold public office are not, but it is important we have access to that information.</p> <p> We have been at our best in the pandemic when we have listened to and been informed by public expert advice.  That does not give away our decision-making powers, but being able to have the evidence, take the information and make informed decisions is a responsibility we have as policy-makers.  We now need to look at the scientific advice structures we have in place in our country and at how we can make sure the scientific advice structures we have available to Government are more broadly available to the Oireachtas.  I believe this and have had exchanges with some Deputies on all sides of this House on this.</p> <p> As Deputies will know, the substantive post of chief scientific adviser, CSA, was effectively subsumed in 2012 and the Government then noted the intention of the then Minister to confer the duties and title of the chief scientific adviser on the current director general of Science Foundation Ireland, Professor Mark Ferguson, a brilliant leader whom I thank for his service and work.  The role of the chief scientific adviser will, therefore, fall vacant when the director general retires in January 2022.  The current arrangements were put in place in a particular context, and nearly a decade ago, and there are now lessons to be learned from domestic and international experience and all that has happened since that time.</p> <p> I announce my decision to conduct a review of the structures and in that context, not to continue the arrangement whereby the director general of SFI also acts as the chief scientific adviser.  The new post of director general was made separately as part of the recruitment process and in advance of candidate selection.  Having regard to soundings taken with a number of stakeholders in a number of Departments and agencies, my view is the two roles should now be decoupled.</p> <p> During August of this year, my Department initiated informal discussions with stakeholders on science advisory structures.  Instead of the traditional CSA model, my Department's initial review recommends investigation of structures along the lines of a science advisory forum or committee, best suited to the cross-sectoral and multidisciplinary advisory needs of Government.  To suggest one person can know every element of science shows a real ignorance of science.  Science comes in many disciplines.  I do not want to pre-empt the consultation but, as of now, my mind is at the idea that we would put in place a forum or commission of scientists who are available to advise Government and the Oireachtas, one of whom would act as our chief scientific adviser.</p> <p> We will go out to public consultation, which we will issue early next year.  This will pose questions for Government too because science impacts on all our policies, but we do not have a formal structure for receiving scientific advice.  I come to this debate in a collaborative fashion, but all too often we see pseudoscience on the floor of this House.  I remember clearly during my time as Minister for Health, the misinformation, disinformation and the downright whatever on the HPV vaccine.  We know where the science has brought us on that.  This is a vaccine that can stop women getting cancer.  It can save their lives.  We all know, through Laura Brennan's incredible advocacy, the difference that vaccine can make and we all know the work it took to get those uptake levels back to where they were and beyond.  We also know how pseudoscience here or anywhere else can be extremely damaging and there is an obligation on us, as Oireachtas Members, regardless of political persuasion, and as members of Government, to make sure we have access to scientific advice and do not engage in pseudoscience and come in here and deny things we know are scientifically undeniable.  I make that point and hope it is taken in the spirit intended.</p> <p> I will comment on the issue of STEM education because there is much debate about leaving certificate curriculum reform.  My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Foley, is leading on that.  There is much debate about pathways into further and higher education, on which I am happy to lead and am enthused about.  We need to look at how we support teachers in our school system in the delivery of STEM and at how we make sure there is science and STEM available throughout all our schools, which is not an opportunity every young person has in every school in Ireland.  We need to look at the gender inequality that can exist in the number of females versus males taking up science subjects.  I had an interesting engagement with Professor Anne Looney and others in DCU today about this and was delighted to launch a new White Paper on STEM and teaching.</p> <p> It is not a confrontation, blame game or a question of one must do this but it is more an honest conversation about how we ensure we support our children from the earliest stages in becoming equipped and exposed to science and STEM, in all its ways.</p> <p>I also want to mention the importance of North-South collaboration when it comes to science.  Whatever about the debate about the unification of the island of Ireland, which I will not have time in three minutes to get into, and all those aspirations that we share, it is important to say that science, quite frankly, does not care for political partition.  We saw that with the virus.  It does not stop at the Border.  It does not understand the history, but it just ravaged right throughout our country.  We have to look at how we collaborate more on North-South basis.  I pay tribute to the Taoiseach, and the shared island unit in his Department, for the &euro;40 million made available to the Higher Education Authority, one of my agencies, for collaborative North-South research projects.  The requirement is that the research project must have a partner in each jurisdiction.  This will do a number of things.  It will hopefully fund brilliant scientific projects but it will do more than that.  It will develop collaborative and interpersonal relationships, as well as inter-institutional relationships.  That can only be a good thing.</p> <p> I also hope that on a North-South basis we can now look at the development of all-island research centres.  Again, I am not getting into the debate about emblems.  I am talking about this in a practical sense.  Would an amazing dividend of this terrible pandemic not be to have an all-island research centre for contagious diseases or for infectious diseases?  That is what our scientists want us to do.  They want politicians to stop having political rows.  They want us to put in place the infrastructure to begin to develop and deliver on that all-island research agenda.  As a Government we will not be found wanting in looking at every opportunity to develop all-island research centres.</p> <p> In the little time available to me, I should also acknowledge the role of technological universities.  We are announcing many of them at the moment and I am proud of that.  We have a technological university for the midlands and mid-west.  There is one coming for the south east.  There is one in Munster, one in Dublin, and one coming for the north west.  This is a real chance to bring research and science capacities into the regions.  It is a real chance to collaborate between industry in the region and academia in the region.  We cannot, therefore, see science or research as the preserve of the traditional university.  We must support them to do much more.  I want to make the point that there is an opportunity through the technological universities' agenda to do more on a research basis in their regions.  Most Members who are present are regional Deputies, so they will know the benefits that can bring to economic well-being and foreign direct investment, FDI.  There is, therefore, much happening in the research area in Ireland and in the European Union.  I did not even get a chance to get into the Horizon programmes and all that we wish to harness from those.  I have had only had a chance to scratch the surface.  </p> <p> This is a dynamic policy.  We want to develop Ireland&rsquo;s new national strategy for science, research and innovation.  We wish to do that in a non-partisan and collaborative way.  Tonight's debate is a good chance to kick off a conversation about science.  We do not talk enough about it in this House.  I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle and Deputy Denis Naughten for the suggestion to have this debate.  I am pleased that the Seanad will also have a similar debate tomorrow.  I look forward to hearing the contributions.</p></speech>

It is a wonderful initiative that provides a great chance to recognise and celebrate the role of science in our everyday lives.  One of the key themes of this year&rsquo;s Science Week was the initiative Creating our Future being run by Science Foundation Ireland.  Creating our Future will ask people and communities across Ireland to submit ideas on what researchers can do to create a better future.  I obviously support that idea because reaching out to the public for sources of research topics is a good idea.  I would like to lend my voice to the call to people to make submissions before the deadline at the end of November.  I am glad that the highest number of applications is from Sligo at the moment.  I hope that will spur Mayo on to get more applications in.</p><p>Science Week is so important, given the context of climate change.  I was listening to Ulster radio few days ago and heard a woman with disabilities speaking about the importance of replacing plastics.  She has to use a straw and she spoke about how important a straw is for her.  In fact, her life depends on it to feed her, but a paper straw is not of any use to her.  There are, therefore, a whole lot of innovations there waiting to happen.  They need to be met in order for us to meet our climate change targets and the challenges around that.</p><p>One of the few positives to come out of Covid-19 is that it has catapulted scientists and scientific data onto the mainstream.  Many scientists have become household names now.  Scientific terms have entered everyday conversation.  The media and the public have shown a fantastic aptitude for debating complex scientific concepts.  The Covid-19 vaccine, and other vaccines of which the Minister spoke, such as the HPV vaccine and others, are some of the starkest examples of the value of scientific research.  While we are talking about the HPV vaccine, we need to stop charging people &euro;600 for a vaccine when their doctor recommends that they have the vaccine.  We need to link everything up to make it count.  We need to consider the young girls who have missed out on the vaccine, and not charge them &euro;600 now.  When a doctor insists that a person needs this HPV vaccine, and we have all the evidence, we should make it available to people and maybe bring it in under the treatment purchase fund.</p><p>The pandemic has shown the importance of a scientifically engaged public.  Another dynamic is the intersection between science, research and decision-making.  Science advice should have a clear and structured role in all forms of public policy creation and assessment.  I welcome the re-separation of the position of chief scientific adviser to Government from the head of Science Foundation Ireland.  This was announced today, and I welcome that.  These roles were amalgamated during the austerity years.  There is an inherent conflict of interest between these roles.  More importantly, both positions are hugely important and justify a stand-alone position.  This is a positive step, but far more needs to be done to provide a real structure for this type of engagement.</p><p>At a European level, there are structures that facilitate engagement between researchers and policymakers, such as the European Commission's scientific advice mechanism.  However, in Ireland, we do not have a strong link between public policy and academic research.  It needs to be improved.  We need to implement a structured, systematic approach.  Ireland is also unusual in having no layer of public research institutes between institutes of higher education and Government.  As a result, higher education performs the function of Ireland's <i>de facto </i>public research system.  Higher education does this well.  However, it is a role that needs to be recognised in value, if we want to deliver the public policy outcomes we all want to see, whether these are in climate change, health, agriculture, food security or in any other area.</p><p>Core funding for higher education forms the bedrock of our public research system, as the Minister knows.  The success of other research funding agencies, such as Science Foundation Ireland, the Health Research Board, HRB, and the Irish Research Council, IRC, depend on leveraging higher education to achieve specific objectives.  The funding of our higher education is the foundation of all public research investment in the State.  However, the best way to celebrate Science Week is to move higher education out of the austerity mode.  This is essential if we want to ramp up and rebalance research and development, and if we want to deliver an all-Ireland research ecosystem, to produce better social and economic outcomes.</p><p>Successive Fine Gael Governments have spent less on research and development as a percentage of GDP, GNI, and even modified GNI every year since 2011, and less as a share of public expenditure every year since 2012.  We need to look at that and to be upfront about it.  We need to put the funding where it needs to be.  This leaves us far below the EU average and the Government's own targets, set as part of the innovation strategy 2020.  An increase in publicly funded research is essential to tackle the many social and economic challenges we face to produce a sustainable economy.  Public funding should be open access, OA, and available to all academics and the wider public to ensure the greatest level of collaboration.  Economic reports show that for every &euro;1 invested in research and development more than &euro;5 is returned to the economy.  Public investment in research also leverages higher levels of industry investment, and leads to accessing more competitive research support through international funds, such as Horizon Europe.  It is vital, therefore, that we engage internationally.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in has repeatedly called on the Government to become an associated member of European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN, which is most famous for its Large Hadron Collider.  We should have access to and be involved in this amazing project.  We also need to establish a national forum on research infrastructure needs on an all-island basis.  I know the Minister and I share that vision.  I will certainly work with him and others to make that happen.  It was recently said to me by the provost of Trinity College Dublin, Professor Linda Doyle, that the State needs to fund the hardest things to fund.</p> <p>We need to look at that.  When it comes to research, once the infrastructure is provided, our brilliant researchers can do the rest.  We need to provide that infrastructure.  I would like to have a separate conversation with the Minister about that, whether that is a systematic web archive, a publicly owned genomic database or material characterisation infrastructure.  We need to ensure that we are ambitious about the needs of the public research sector.  We need to value the research and all of the researchers, including PhD students.  PhD students, researchers and workers should be recognised for the valuable work that they do.  We need to increase investment in public research and we need to make sure that includes improving the working conditions of all researchers.  We need to balance public research funding between applied and foundational research, between science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, STEM, and the social sciences, and just as importantly between the regions.  Higher education research has consistently broken down as roughly 88% for universities and 12% for the technological higher education sector.  The uneven spread of public research investment flows through enterprise research and development activity.  The eastern and midlands region saw 67% of business expenditure on research and development while the south got 21% and the north and west only accounted for 12%.  There are regional disparities that we need to address.  There are opportunities to do that with the technological universities.  The eastern and midland accounted for 60% of research personnel compared with 24% in the south and just 15% in the north and west.  We need to address that.</p> <p> I am glad the Minister agrees with me about partition.  It is a persistent factor whenever we talk about development for the north west.  We need to break down partition.  It has been a disaster for both states on this island.  It continues to severely impact it.  We can break down many barriers for higher education, innovation and science, not just for the immediate work and the innovations, but to create an understanding among all communities across the island so that we have a positive externality as well as us all caring together about the island that we live on and fulfilling its potential.  It serves all communities, regions and people.</p></speech>

Science Week is very positive.  It is focused on making sure that young people look towards STEM and science in both education and employment.  Those are the key objectives and it has been successful in that regard.  There is greater interest in those areas.  In a way, it is an obvious thing to say, but science enhances our lives in many ways.  We take for granted the advances that have been made in recent years.  It occurs to me that if Covid-19 had hit even ten years previously, never mind 20 or 30 years previously, it may have been more debilitating and difficult and potentially many more people would have become ill from it.  How much more difficult would it have been for us to continue our work to keep the economy going to some extent during the lockdown?  There is no doubt that the scientific advances delivered here in Ireland and across the globe have made a significant difference.</p>  <p>  I also think there is significant untapped potential with regard to science in politics and science in public services.  There have been significant advances and there has been slowness, at times, to take advantage of the scientific advantages that exist to enhance our public services.  Covid-19 has done much more harm than good.  One good thing to come out was the electronic transferring of prescriptions, which was such an easy, obvious thing to do.  It is hard to grasp why that did not happen years ago.  That is replicated across parts of Government public services where obvious scientific advances, which are not even necessarily at the cutting edge, could make life easier but have not been adopted.  That includes the incredible amounts of paper produced in this institution, though I am not blaming anyone in particular for that, and in our local authorities.  We need to grasp that.  It has been a part of political debate for a long time.  I think of Harold Wilson, the revolution with Ford, and the white heat of technology, but much more can be done.</p>  <p>  In the time I have left, I want to raise two or three issues.  This week is positive but it is true that we have not quite punched at our weight with regard to investment in science and research, as my colleague, Deputy Conway-Walsh, has outlined.  We spent less on research and development as a percentage of GNI every year since 2011, when Fine Gael came into government, and less as a share of public expenditure every year since 2012.  We are way below the EU average and below the Government's own targets.  We need annual current funding of &euro;180 million in higher education to deliver higher quality education and research.  It is essential.</p>  <p>  I raised another issue in conversation with the Minister but there is no harm to putting it on the record of the D&aacute;il.  Science is not just academic.  It affects large-scale industrial operations too.  There is significant potential for apprenticeships here but there are problems too.  I give the example of instrumentation.  It is crucial.  It involves the maintenance and repair of scientific instruments attached to production lines.  That is a valuable trade and apprenticeship for people who get into it.  It is a skilled trade.  We do not have enough of them.  It is essential for life sciences, pharmaceuticals and all forms of industry.  Not only do we not have enough of them, we cannot get the instructors because what they can earn in industry is so much more than they can earn in teaching.  I know the Minister visited the Cork training centre.  This might have been raised with him.  This is a significant problem because we will need more people working in that.  This is a trade that we should flag to ensure that people go into apprenticeships.  We need to change the perception of apprenticeships.  We cannot get people into it and we cannot deliver the courses.</p>  <p>  My final point is about medical laboratory scientists.  They have lodged a claim and are considering industrial action.  The Medical Laboratory Scientists Association has only taken full industrial action once in its 60-year history.  This dispute is about 20 years old.  It is not that they have not been patient.  I urge the Minister to engage with them.  They have worked hard.  It needs to be clearly stated that they were essential in the fight against Covid.  They have shown great patience and they have reached the end of their tether.  I urge the Minister to engage with them and to try to deliver a fair result.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-10a.428" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1514" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="17:22:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000052#FFF00300"><p>I welcome this debate and the enthusiasm of the Minister, who clearly knows his brief.  It is opportune that we are discussing Science Week.  I am a former Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation.  I am particularly proud of the fact that I was there at the inception of APC, Insight, IPIC, Lero and MaREI in particular, given the importance of potential offshore wind energy.  I also pay tribute to the people who you do not see in public.  They are the people behind the scenes of Science Week, in the Discover science programmes, in Science Foundation Ireland, the people who helped to create the tools for the week, and the people who developed the continuous professional development programmes.  They are the unseen people who are the real heroes of science week.  They disseminate the science or assist in its dissemination, either as teachers or in the various shows and events that take place.  They are the real heroes because they facilitate the capturing of imaginations and inculcating in young minds the idea that scientific endeavour is worthy of pursuit.</p> <p>We owe them a debt of gratitude for the hidden work that is too often underappreciated.  I express my appreciation of their work. <br/><br/>I welcome that there is to be decoupling of the role of chief scientific adviser from that of director general of SFI.  It is long overdue and was never intended to last ten years when the Minister and I were part of the Government of the day.  It was a function of a rationalisation and cost programme.  I have often wondered how many times the chief scientific adviser advised the Government on issues of scientific exploration or public concern in the intervening period.  It would be interesting to know that.  Science Foundation Ireland and its board as a funder have always sought to be as rigorous as possible when it came to funding decisions.  However, one must never allow the perception to develop that there could be a conflict of interest between the two.<br/><br/>I will speak on initial teacher education because if we do not have science teachers, we do not have Science Week.  There is a serious issue in respect of the professional master of education, PME, and the pressures trainee or candidate teachers are under in the master's programmes.  They are working quite well but it will take time for the throughput to be such that we have a ready supply.  The Minister is aware of that.<br/><br/>An interesting study conducted by Dr. Mark Prendergast, Dr. Melanie N&iacute; Dhuinn and Professor Andrew Loxley of University College Cork and Trinity College Dublin is titled: &quot;'I worry about money every day': The financial stress of second-level initial teacher education in Ireland&quot;.  If the Minister and his officials take a moment to read that report, they will see how stressful it is to be a candidate on the PME as we speak.  The research, which was conducted on a cohort of 391 people, sought respondents' views on how they were getting on through their course of study.  It recorded &quot;costs, ... financial and emotional, of entering the teaching profession in the Republic of Ireland.&quot;<br/><br/>When the authors looked at Finland, Ontario and Singapore, the lesson arising from those comparative studies was that, as a policy intervention, this country overlooks the idea of paying prospective teachers in initial teacher education some funds to allow them to allay the financial and other difficulties in which they find themselves.  That can be done either through the cost of the course, which is relatively high, or through facilitating by means of subsidisation the ability of initial teacher education candidates, particularly in STEM fields, to be utterly focused on the task at hand, thus guaranteeing a supply and throughput of teachers and allaying the current issues around teacher shortages.  The study found that:</p><blockquote>	... perhaps one lesson which has been overlooked is that all three countries [Finland, Ontario, Singapore] subsidise the preparation of teachers.  For example, becoming a teacher in Singapore and Finland is completely paid for, and candidates earn money whilst training.  In Ontario, there is a quota of 4500 free places. </blockquote> <p>I am not trying to be unrealistic but if we are serious about the shortage of teachers, particularly in areas such as STEM, this study clearly shows there are major pressures on teachers and trainee teachers.  An example I encountered today concerned a trainee teacher doing a placement in a post-primary school who was asked to do a substitution role.  That is arguably unethical.  It may be understandable from the principal's point of view but the candidate will not be paid for it.  That has an impact on the trainee teacher's ability to study.  If we talk about Science Week and STEM graduates, we need to go back to how the teacher education system works to have a qualitative look at those candidates' experience and whether more can be done from a policy point of view.</p></speech>

It is a process of inquiry and experiment that combines curiosity, creativity and collaboration with rigorous interrogation to shed light into dark corners, illuminating the realities of nature through an iterative process of understanding.  It is, in no small part, one of the reasons our species has become so successful on this planet.  It is also the key to solving the challenges associated with the unforeseen consequences of that success, namely, climate change and biodiversity loss, which threaten the future of our species and countless others. </p><p>Carl Sagan, arguably the greatest science communicator of our times, wrote in his seminal book, <i>Cosmos</i>, that &ldquo;Our passion for learning ... is our tool for survival&rdquo;.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for heritage, which includes biodiversity and nature, Earth&rsquo;s life-support system that underpins human societies and economies and provides the ecosystem goods and services on which we are entirely dependent, I am all too aware of the significance of this.  Science has made plain the scale of the impact we are having on the natural world and the unconscionable likely future if we continue as we are.  It has also made plain what we must do to get off this track.</p><p>We need action on biodiversity in order to make the supply of ecosystem services like soil fertility, water and air purification, carbon sequestration and flood mitigation more resilient to climate change.  Healthy ecosystems are better able to resist and recover from the impacts of climate change, such as fires, floods, droughts, pests and diseases.  We also need to ensure that climate-related transitions in energy and land use actively support biodiversity, that nature-based solutions are deployed to contribute to climate mitigation and adaptation and that we develop solutions that address biodiversity loss and climate change simultaneously in order to resolve conflicts and maximise synergies. </p><p>None of this is possible without scientific evidence to support impactful policy, and that requires targeted funding for academic research and scientific training across a range of areas, not least in ecology and biodiversity conservation.  The web of life is more complex than most of us can begin to imagine.  For example, we have 11,000 species of insect in Ireland, but we know little about them or the vital roles they play in the web of life, or what might happen to the way an ecosystem works if one, several or many were to disappear.</p><p>In my Department, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, benefits from the expertise of many scientific, technical and conservation ranger staff with scientific backgrounds.  It publishes numerous scientific publications and reporting outputs and currently supports a range of scientific research initiatives.  These include co-funding the 2021-22 BiodivERsA joint transitional call on supporting the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems across land and sea; partnering on the EU Horizon 2020-funded WaterLANDS project, which aims to co-design restoration with communities; and collaborating with the Irish Research Council to progress research in key areas, such as biodiversity finance.  We will be providing financial support to the new All-Island Climate and Biodiversity Research Network, which was launched by An Taoiseach and the deputy First Minister, Michelle O'Neill, this week and the importance of which was highlighted earlier by the Minister, Deputy Harris. </p><p>My Department also contributes to scientific education and outreach in other ways, not least through our work on the heritage in schools programme through the Heritage Council, our support for the green schools programme through An Taisce, and the brilliant work done by our NPWS education officers through their outreach programmes, which engage, inspire and connect communities with the wonders of the natural world around them.  Furthermore, it is my intention that &quot;review, reflect, renew&quot;, a strategic action plan for the future of the National Parks and Wildlife Service which is currently in development, will provide for a much greater focus on biodiversity and ecosystem services research and for wider scientific and educational outreach.</p> <p>It is my firm view that we must harness the passion for learning wherever we find it &ndash; in communities, places of work, primary and secondary schools, colleges and universities and, most especially, in research institutions &ndash; and channel it, with support and resources, towards the achievement of our collective goals to live well and equitably within the environmental limits of this planet.</p></speech>

He has great energy in the Department and a good, driving team around him.  I say well done on that.  As a teacher, part of me still believes there should be one Department of Education from top to bottom.  I know some would say that some days it makes sense to have two separate Departments but on days such as World Science Day it probably does not make sense.  That is just my personal view as a teacher; it is not the view of the Government.  I have always held the view that real scientific learning is probably the child out in the back garden taking apart a radio with a screwdriver and hitting it a few belts with a hammer.  We learn so much from that, or from dipping a jar into the local pond and looking at what is in it.</p>  <p>  A few years ago, I was part of a group of teachers in County Clare which the Government tasked to take part in a pilot study for STEM, bringing science, technology, engineering and maths into the classroom.  It was fantastic and raised the bar of learning so much.  I expect we will see that trajectory go across the system into second level and, please God, into third level.  There needs to be a better equipping of that kind of STEM teaching because we were pioneers in the movement and did the course.  We had to go back to schools and ask students to start washing out their yoghurt cartons and bring these and lollipop sticks into schools.  We told them to ask their mothers to finish the butter quicker so we could have the Dairygold tubs and that we needed Pringle tubes and every other kind of resource we could possibly have to make robots, electric circuits - you name it.  There needs to be a proper equipping and resourcing of schools.</p>  <p>  I saw the most fabulous teaching locally online this week.  Schools are putting up all sorts of videos.  I cannot pay tribute to them all.  One school I saw was in Cratloe, where Katie Campbell, Ian Hughes and Aaron Carroll were involved.  Some of the lessons I saw online involved marshmallows and cocktail sticks.  There is all sorts of incredible stuff happening in schools and it must be supported.</p>  <p>  Last Friday, I took off the shirt and tie and went back to the jeans and jumper.  I substituted in a school locally that is experiencing a crisis due to a shortage of substitute teachers.  It was an eye-opening day and I loved it.  I was back doing what I did for 16 years.  I began the day making "PAW Patrol" jigsaws and we moved on to long division, problem solving and everything else later in the day.</p></speech>

The day was an eye-opener.  The teachers I saw were doing everything they have done so well for many years, but now with added pressures and strains.</p>  <p>  I have a suggestion to make to the Minister.  When I was walking down the corridors last Friday there were two trainee teachers, one at the junior end of the school and the other at the senior end.  They were locked into classrooms teaching rigid lessons that were given to them by the training colleges.  They were good lessons, but rigid rather than real-life teaching.  They are on a 14-week teaching practice block at the moment.  When I did my teaching practice, we had to do two weeks and we were then sent out to think on our feet and become teachers.  We learned a little bit the hard way, but we got there.  I believe that in this academic year there would be merit in sending the hundreds of teachers on teaching practice placement into classrooms to do substitute work.  They could get the unqualified substitute rate.</p>  <p>  I remember when I was in Mary Immaculate College ditching Friday lectures to do substitute teaching because it gave us &euro;120 or &euro;130 which was like heaven the following week when we got to spend it on a night out and doing all the normal student things.  At the moment, student teachers are limited in what they can do.  This is a no-brainer.  We did it with healthcare staff last year when we got them to work as healthcare assistants.  We got student garda&iacute; to police the streets.  Let us get student teachers into schools, as we would have done in the past.  Let us end the 14-week teaching practice block this winter and get these students into classrooms.  Instead of giving them regimented, rigid lessons from the training colleges, give them a brief, like the one I got on Friday.  It was a case of, "In you go, do a 'PAW Patrol' jigsaw and long division in third class and a comprehension activity in sixth class."  That is real-life teaching, learning on your feet.  It would be a massive change.</p>  <p>  I also suggest something that will probably result in a bit of a backlash.  So be it, as that is what we are here for.  The school inspectorate cannot visit many schools at the moment.  We should send them in to teach.  Each and every one of them is a teacher.  By virtue of the rank of the profession to which they have risen, they have served for years and are supposed experts in education.  If we were to send them into classrooms, we would have a few hundred extra people going into the system overnight, reducing the pressure we have seen in so many schools.</p>  <p>  In my remaining time I wish to speak about two other issues.  The first is Green Atlantic, the fabulous offshore wind farm project being developed off the County Clare coast to bring us to a new era for the Moneypoint power station which is phasing out the burning of coal.  It is going to be one of Ireland's and Europe's largest offshore wind farms.  The most exciting part will be onshore because capacity is to be developed onshore to convert the wind energy into storable hydrogen.  Buses in Dublin are already being retrofitted for the use of hydrogen so they can be driven around the city more sustainably.  There is a fantastic opportunity here for hydrogen.  Shannon Airport is just down the road from Moneypoint where the Green Atlantic project will take place.  Given the potential of hydrogen, the developments offshore and the expertise we have at third level in universities in Limerick and Galway, including Limerick Institute of Technology, LIT, which is now a technological university, I believe Shannon Airport and the mid-west have the potential to become a driving force for sustainable aviation, in particular in the field of hydrogen, which might fuel aeroplanes in the future.  Perhaps the Minister could champion that idea in the Department.</p>  <p>  Kilrush, another west Clare town, is putting forward a proposal to become a maritime centre of excellence.  This makes so much sense.  The town is kitted out for it.  A building has been identified and the project has been costed.  There is a demand within the industry for another centre of excellence.  It cannot all be down in Haulbowline in Cork Harbour.  There are other places in the country where we need to have a capacity to train and equip people in all sorts of seafaring skills.  County Clare can offer that.  There is a proposal in at the moment with the Minister's colleague, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.  I hope to speak to her next week and to impress on her the importance of the project, but it would help no end if the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, also caught her by the arm and told her what he heard in the Chamber tonight about a great project she needs to fund in County Clare.  It will see the light of day.  It will train people to a high standard for many years.  It will be a standard setter.  I hope the Minister will back it and join me in making representations for west Clare.  Together we might deliver this project for Kilrush and the west.</p></speech>

I will use the short time I have to speak about investment in research, development and innovation, RDI.  Recently, at the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the National Competitiveness and Productivity Council, the independent body that reports in an advisory capacity to the Government on competitiveness and productivity in the economy, outlined the need for increased investment in RDI by the Government.  It is clear from even the most cursory analysis that there has been a lack of investment in this area in the past.  Since 2011, the State has spent less on research and development as a percentage of modified GNI* every year and less as a share of public expenditure every year since 2012.  This has left us well below the EU average and the State's own targets set as part of the innovation strategy for 2020.</p>  <p>  A report by the Kemmy Business School at the University of Limerick found that for every euro spent on research and development, &euro;5 is returned to the economy.  You do not need to be a scientist to work out that that is pretty good value for money.  In anyone's language, that is a very good and worthwhile investment.  The reason I raise it is that encouraging people to become involved in STEM subjects and investing in those areas and in RDI are essential if we are to deliver economic robustness and sustainability and improved economic productivity.</p>  <p>  In the minute remaining to me I wish to raise the 94% vote by the Medical Laboratory Scientists Association to pursue industrial action over pay and career progression.  If we want people to choose STEM and then choose careers in science, we must ensure they have decent, well paid jobs at the end of their studies.  We are asking young people to make the effort, put the time in, choose science as their career and choose to enhance all of our lives with their education and know-how, yet we heard from medical laboratory scientists that they are taking industrial action because of the chronic shortage of staff and a recruitment and retention crisis which they say is caused by poor pay and conditions.</p> <p>That is a very bad message to send to any young person, particularly in Science Week.  What we should be saying to them is that we want them to study science and, as a <i>quid pro quo</i>, there is a decent job waiting for them.  The Medical Laboratory Scientists Association is saying there are no decent jobs there.  I urge the Minister to use his good offices to bring a resolution to that dispute that is satisfactory to the medical scientists.</p></speech>

I am grateful to have the chance to speak on it today because I realise how important it is to be included in the debate.  As we all know, it gives everyone access and a chance to understand science in their everyday lives.  It has never been more important than this year.  We encourage people, young and old, to take an interest in science and how it shapes their daily lives.</p>  <p>  In my own constituency, we have a number of major science and technology companies which have a huge impact on jobs and investment in Cork, pharmaceutical companies like Janssen, Eli Lilly and Pfizer, which are big employers in the city, as well as those like Apple Computers and PepsiCo.  Their products are driven by science and led by science.  We also have much smaller businesses, such as artisan food producers and companies, which take a different look at producing food in a more sustainable way.</p>  <p>  One of the positives we can take from Covid-19 is remote working.  Even tonight, I was able to remote into a number of meetings using Zoom and Teams.  For politicians, as well as for everyone else, that will give us the capacity to attend more events going forward.  More investment is needed in this regard in schools at primary and secondary level and in further education.  Unfortunately, my daughter has been out of school for the last three days and she has to miss school a lot of the time.  There should be an opportunity for children like that to be able to engage with a teacher over Zoom or Teams.  I think we are all learning and I will be honest and say it is something I am now thinking about.</p>  <p>  There is a lot I would like to say and, in particular, I would like to bring two points to the attention of the Minister.  First, we have a number of companies interested in STEM but the Government needs to improve on that.  There are young people out there.  This is something we should be encouraging.</p>  <p>  Second, a college student contacted me with regard to the HPV vaccine.  She did not take it when she was in secondary school because there was a lot of hesitancy at the time but she wants to take it now.  However, there is a &euro;600 cost and the majority of college students cannot afford that.  I appeal to the Minister to talk to the Minister for Health about that.</p>  <p>  I come from the northside of Cork city, where we do not have a third level campus.  I have contacted University College Cork, UCC, and Munster Technological University, MTU, because I believe we need a campus on the north side.  To be honest, would it not be brilliant to have a science campus from one of the two best colleges in the country?  That is something we should be looking to promote.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-10a.443" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1560" speakername="Gary Gannon" time="17:52:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000055#JJJ00300"><p>With this Science Week and the Science Weeks in recent years, we can all have a much better appreciation of the work of scientists, researchers, engineers and healthcare professionals who have dedicated themselves to serving people in a multitude of different ways.  Through their craft, through their dedication to their talent and through their copious amounts of research, we went from discovery of a virus that traversed our world, causing so much pain, uncertainty and loss, to the creation of a vaccine in less than a year.  A scientific miracle of sorts was achieved.  Although we are still battling with Covid, the past two years show the scale of what is possible when there are sufficient resources invested and a global focus to tackle a crisis.  This is the learning we must take and apply to the other global threat facing us, namely, the climate crisis.</p>  <p>  While I want to give thanks and gratitude this week to those working tirelessly in the STEM fields, I want to spend the remainder of my contribution talking about participation in science and who gets access.  Earlier this month, we learned that Science Gallery Dublin was facing potential closure in 2022 due to financial issues.  I know the Minister and his Department have met its representatives and engaged with Trinity College in the hope of finding solutions to retain the gallery.  I want to touch briefly on the gallery and the need for it and maybe others like it in this country.  It is a permeable, ever-changing space where science and arts collide, a glass building facing onto Pearse Street, rather than behind the walls of Trinity, its dynamism reflected outwards.  It has housed more than 48 exhibitions, welcomed more than 3.8 million visitors and run countless transition year, TY, programmes, all for free.  It has been replicated globally as the antithesis of the ivory tower when it comes to research, science and arts.  Its loss would be deeply felt in the culture of Dublin and, as well as its preservation, I argue we should be looking to replicate it in other higher education campuses around the country.</p>  <p>  While the gallery and events like Science Week do brilliant work in bringing science onto the streets and connecting with citizens, we need to look deeper at what we are doing to ensure everyone not only engages with science, but is able to pursue a scientific career should they choose to do so.  We need to democratise not only the participation and knowledge of science, but who gets to become a researcher, a scientist, a doctor or a professor - who gets to set the scientific agenda.  The fact of the matter is that it is harder to do a PhD and harder to become a scientist or a researcher if people are not from a background of privilege.</p>  <p>  Let me back up that statement.  In 2013, the Irish Research Council PhD stipend was &euro;16,000, or just over &euro;1,300 per month.  The average monthly asking price for rent in Dublin city centre at that time was &euro;1,050, so it was difficult but technically possible to pursue a PhD and afford rent in our capital then.  Today, the Irish Research Council PhD stipend works out at just over &euro;1,500 per month, massively under the average cost of rent in the city centre, which now stands at &euro;2,032, and even falling short of the average rent nationally, which is &euro;1,516 per month, according to the Daft.ie figures released just today.  This completely changes who can afford to do a PhD.  This factor was replicated in the Higher Education Authority data for 2018 and 2019.  Among all enrolments, the PhD cohort was by far the most affluent.  That is not a coincidence.  It is a necessity because the financial burden of choosing to become a scientist or a researcher is so high currently.</p>  <p>  This is not just about a qualification; it is about careers and industries that people are locked out of, not because of talent but because of cost.  A few weeks ago, I wrote to the Ministers, Deputy Harris and Deputy Humphreys, on a particular issue that One Family, a charity representing one-parent families, raised with me regarding PhDs.  PhD stipends continue to be eligible for means testing, which means some people, like those in one-parent families, who are predominantly women in this country, are faced with having to choose between their PhD stipends or their one-parent family payment.  Many, unable to risk the loss of income, are prevented from taking the PhD, a clear poverty trap, or are made to live in an even more precarious situation.  I ask the Minister to work on this issue with the Department of Social Protection because it is very important.  I thank him for acknowledging that he may do so.</p>  <p>  I very much welcome the Minister's efforts and enthusiasm when it comes to changing the CAO, broadening access and producing a republic where everyone, to quote the Minister yesterday, has an opportunity to reach their full potential.  However, I ask the Minister whether the potential stops at a degree course.  All our efforts and attention are on the point of entry or pre-entry.  We need to have more foresight and realise that the barriers do not disappear after a degree.  While we are talking of broadening access, can we have the ambition and will to broaden it further because, otherwise, we are limiting potential?</p>  <p>  Take, for example, students with disabilities, an issue I know to be close to the Minister's heart.  Although we have made steady progress over the years with increased representation of students with disabilities studying at undergraduate level, we have not seen those same gains in postgraduate study.  In 2011, students with disability accounted for 5.1% of the total undergraduate student population and this has increased to 7.2% in 2019.  In 2011, students with disabilities accounted for 2.5% of the total postgraduate student population and it still remains at 2.5% in the latest figures for 2019-20.  We are not only seeing no growth in the overall percentage of postgraduate students with a disability, but we are seeing a bigger drop of representation between undergraduates and postgraduates.  Students with disabilities are being locked out of furthering their careers and becoming researchers and scientists.</p>  <p>  Retaining these barriers and losing this talent is to our own detriment.  Scientific discovery, advancement and progress cannot be restricted to only one type of person and one type of background.  We need researchers with disabilities, we need scientists who come from working-class and migrant backgrounds and we need female and non-binary professors in our colleges and universities.</p>  <p>  I want to end my contribution by thanking all of those working in STEM to advance their knowledge and understanding of our world.  I reiterate that we in Ireland require a diversity of experience and backgrounds in STEM fields to make better science, yes, but also fairer access to careers and a just democracy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-10a.444" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1566" speakername="Emer Higgins" time="18:02:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000056#KKK00100"><p>The aim of Science Week is to celebrate the science in our everyday lives and it is fair to say that the presence of science in our everyday lives has been even more apparent in these past 20 months.  It would be impossible to comment on Science Week without paying tribute to the scientific minds who have played such a crucial role during this pandemic, from the national and international scientists who developed the vaccines that have saved countless lives to the doctors and nurses who have kept our country and other countries going.  Throughout this pandemic we have trusted in the science and in those who have dedicated their lives to the pursuit of same.  This includes those working in: medicine; nursing; epidemiology; immunology; and virology and the list goes on.  Over the last two years the scientific community have become celebrities in their own right and they have given a new meaning to the phrase, "Trust in science."  In times of fake news, conspiracy theories and misleading information, I am grateful for scientific experts who have so capably cut through that noise and delivered straightforward and factual scientific information that we can trust in.  I want to publicly thank them and offer my appreciation for the work they have done.</p>  <p>  The focus of Science Week this year is on Creating Our Future.  Companies in my constituency such as Pfizer, Takeda, Grifols and all of the people they employ bring that to life, day in and day out.  Science Foundation Ireland is asking the public to have their say on what scientists in Ireland should explore to create a better future.  There is a huge opportunity for a national conversation in this.  Another focus of Science Week is the gender bias in our healthcare sector.  Studies show that women in Ireland are at a disadvantage when it comes to diagnostic treatment.  For example, the Endometriosis Association of Ireland tells us that one woman in ten in Ireland has endometriosis but it takes nine years on average to receive a diagnosis.  It takes two and a half years longer for women to receive a cancer diagnosis compared with men.  Women receive diagnoses for metabolic diseases like diabetes on average four and a half years later than men and women are also more likely to be prescribed sedatives rather than painkillers, despite the fact that they suffer more with pain than men do.  These inequalities are well-documented and it is important that we use Science Week to highlight these facts.</p>  <p>  Another inequality in the scientific community that we often hear about is diversity in the STEM sector or the lack thereof.  A 2019 report conducted by the STEM education review group showed a significant drop-off in interest in STEM subjects at leaving certificate level.  This lack of uptake was especially prominent among young women.  There is plenty of research which highlights the benefits of a diverse workplace in STEM areas and we know that all sectors of business profit from gender diversity in financial gain, performance boost and increased innovation.  A McKinsey report, Why diversity matters, shows that gender diverse companies are 15% more likely to financially outperform their counterparts.  It is Ireland's ambition to be Europe's STEM leader by 2026 but it should also be our ambition to drastically improve diversity within Ireland's STEM industry by 2026.  Too many people think of scientists and imagine men in white lab coats.  There is plenty more work to do to ensure Ireland has a diverse and inclusive STEM workforce and there is no evidence that men are more suited to careers in science than women.  Unfortunately the stereotypical views of gender still seem to apply among young women, yet the opportunities for young women in science and in all areas of STEM are endless.</p>  <p>  We need to do more in secondary schools to teach pupils about the plethora of opportunities in STEM.  Project-based learning in this area and education about the many female role models in science that there are would go a long way to encouraging more young women to pursue careers in STEM.  We are already making moves to encourage more women into a career in science.  Two years ago a national investment of &euro;3.6 million was made to promote STEM in Ireland.  Among the 41 projects supported by this fund, a large number were dedicated to encouraging an interest in STEM among girls and women.  I want to take this opportunity to commend STEM Women on the work it does to promote STEM among women in Ireland and on the impact it is having on students and graduates when it comes to choosing a career path.</p>  <p>  We have a huge amount to thank science and scientific innovation for.  We owe a great deal of gratitude to the scientific minds who have steered us through this pandemic.  We are not out of the woods yet but I have full faith that by trusting in science we will get there.  The theme of this years Science Week is Creating our Future, and after the last 20 months it is doubtless that many of us have science to thank for our futures ahead.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-10a.445" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1617" speakername="Marc &Oacute; Cathasaigh" time="18:02:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021111000056#KKK00200"><p>I thank Deputy Naughten for suggesting that this debate should take place this week.  On 14 November 2014, during Science Week as it happens, the Rosetta space probe lander module, <i>Philae</i>, made the first ever soft landing on a comet by a human-made object.  The probe had been launched a full decade earlier and it slung itself off the gravitational pull of Mars to intercept the comet as it arced its way through the inner solar system.  It was an unbelievable feat of maths, physics and aeronautics.  The poor students of sixth class in Gl&oacute;r na Mara in Tramore had to cope with an excited teacher the next day who kept telling them that these weird and hairless primates had managed to land a washing machine on a comet and that they had done it using sums.</p><p>Science Week was always my favourite week during my teaching career and science was my favourite subject to teach.  It is a great fit for primary school children, as they have not been indoctrinated out of their natural curiosity yet.  Anyone who has a four-year old at home, as I do, knows of an almost infinite capacity to pose the question &quot;Why?&quot; over and over.  That question is one of the most defining features of us as <i>Homo sapiens</i>; we are the thinking primate.  That is why in science lessons and during Science Week in particular I used to encourage my students to ask that question.  Anyone can look at a cool thing but a scientist asks &quot;Why?&quot;.  We can all look at a glass of water like the one in my hand being covered with a mat and flipped upside down but a scientist asks why the water stays in the glass, or at least why some of the water stays inside in my case.  I am glad my demonstration partially worked and that the Ceann Comhairle was not here because he would have been cross with me.</p><p>Science is human curiosity formalised and given a message.  It has unlocked so much of what is good and some of what is bad in today's modern world and it gives us hope for a better future that we all might be able to look forward to.  We need to foster that natural curiosity in our schools and across our entire society.  To do that we need to invest in our teacher training, which was referenced earlier by Deputy Sherlock, and we need to do so at primary level.  Science can be one of the subject areas where our primary teachers feel less confident delivering, depending on what subjects they have taken themselves during their school career.  Maybe we also need to revisit our science curriculum at primary level to see if it is fit for purpose and to see if it is a spiral curriculum that builds knowledge across a child's time in primary school.  Although I have always had a love of physics, a curriculum based on biodiversity and the natural world might sit better with children of that age.  There has been welcome progress at second level in participation in STEM subjects but we still have a challenge in recruiting suitably qualified teachers, which Deputy Sherlock referred to, and in offering some STEM subjects into smaller schools.  I fully acknowledge the contribution by Deputy Gannon on impediments to people in accessing third level and doctorate level education.  That is all true.</p><p>Science should not just be seen as a school subject or as a job but as something we should all be engaging in all of the time.  As citizen scientists, be it as birders, stargazers or gardeners, all of these activities throw us into a deeper understanding of the natural world around us.  The experiences of the last year taught us something about science and its pivotal importance.  We have been told to trust the science and listen to it.  While the pandemic has tragically claimed many lives, it could have been so much worse without advances in modern technology, including vaccine technology.  Sadly we are seeing that play out across the developing world.</p><p>With that in mind I warmly welcome the announcement by the Minister, Deputy Harris, today that he is to develop the role of the chief scientific adviser to embed scientific, awareness and thinking at the heart of what we do as an Oireachtas.  I wonder, in the context of COP26 this week and the publishing of the climate action plan last week, how much further along on the road to tackling climate change we would be if we had heeded the science on global warming ten, 20 or 30 years ago.  We ignored the science for so long because it posed an inconvenient truth.  What would today's society look like if we had made the far smaller changes that were needed then?</p> <p>Former Uachtar&aacute;n Mary Robinson remarked only today at COP that you cannot negotiate with science.  Those may be words to haunt us but I am hopeful.  I am a pragmatic optimist.  I believe in the power of the human capacity to change the world for the better once we put that job of work in front of us.</p> <p> I do not know if the Acting Chairman, Deputy Carey, has ever come across the infinite monkey theory.  It is the idea that if you put a monkey in front of a typewriter for an infinite amount of time, it will eventually type the complete works of Shakespeare.  Actually, the universe has already run that experiment.  That primate was called Will Shakespeare.  We are the outcome.  We are the product of that experiment being run by the universe.  We are the only thing in the known universe that asked the question, "Why?" - that tries to unravel the ways and workings of the wider world around us.  In some sense, we are the universe looking back at itself, trying to make sense of us and trying to make sense of itself.  There is something humbling and yet empowering about that thought.</p></speech>

This year, it started on Sunday last and ends on the coming Sunday, 14 November.  It is run by Science Foundation Ireland.</p>  <p>  Science Week includes a wide variety of events involving industry, colleges, schools, libraries, teachers, researchers and students and there are events all over the country.  I would urge everyone to get involved in the creating-our-future conversation and to attend a Science Week event.</p>  <p>  Science Week has been such an important week in our calendar since 1995 and every year it gets bigger and better.  There are enough events that we could nearly have a science month.</p>  <p>  As a proud person from County Kildare, a small sample of those events taking place in Kildare are a reptile superpowers workshop, presentations on the science of "Star Wars" and on sustainable living and an event called Let Us Talk Bats, as well as a Women in STEM event.  In fact, there are over 40 events - something for everyone.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 has been incredibly challenging for everyone and we have seen the best of what science research has to offer in providing solutions and creating a better future for us all.  Irish scientists, doctors and researchers have played a fundamental role throughout the pandemic and County Kildare is punching above its weight in this regard.  Professor Teresa Lambe from Kilcullen played a key role in the team that developed the AstraZeneca vaccine.  I welcome the establishment of a bursary fund in Professor Lambe's name and we will encourage female students to follow a path of study in the area of science.</p>  <p>  We have Professor Philip Nolan of Maynooth University, who has been the chair of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET's modelling advisory group since March 2020 and we have the workers of Pfizer in Newbridge, who have really gone the extra mile.</p>  <p>  The Government needs to do more to encourage the study of science.  Third level education remains underfunded in this country.  While we have a high transition rate from post-primary to third level, the Government provided colleges with 50% less funding per student.  It has also negatively impacted the quality of third level education provision and the ability of higher education institutes to produce high-quality research.  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that higher education needs an increase in annual recurrent funding of &euro;180 million in order to deliver high-quality educational research and we will deliver this investment in government.</p></speech>

I believe that is something that, obviously, Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, and whoever else should put huge money into because it would only be right that we be given decent working lightsabers.  It would be a much better world in that case.</p>  <p>  I would agree with much of what has been said.  We have gone through a really brutal period.  We have seen the absolute benefits of innovation, scientific research and real science versus some of the madness that we have seen in the past while.</p>  <p>  I am sure many Members have had engagements with the likes of their local enterprise office, Enterprise Ireland and others and they suddenly discovered a huge number of innovative companies that are in operation, of which in some cases I must say I was unaware, and that are dealing with medical technological advances etc.  These are vital pieces.</p>  <p>  It goes without saying we need a university infrastructure.  There are weaknesses in it at this point in time.  I have welcomed the technological university, TU, journey for many of the institutes of technology, IoTs.  The difficulty for me, and I will be revisiting this later, particularly with the Minister, is obviously TU status for Dundalk Institute of Technology.  It may be a more elongated roadmap for Dundalk to get there but we all need to ensure that happens because we are talking about a major institution that does a significant amount of work and is a really great resource in the area.  It would be terrible that it would lose out in funding and all the other necessary benefits from that TU status.</p>  <p>  Much money needs to be put in to ensure that we have innovation, that we have SFI, that we have enough PhD students and that they are basically researching into everything - the stuff we have not decided.  Whether that relates to climate change, technology, medicine or whatever, it does not matter.</p>  <p>  We also have to look at the weaknesses in our education system.  While there are many more roadmaps now, and I welcome the likes of apprenticeships and post-leaving certificate, PLC, courses as the way to make it to the end or, should I say, into lifelong learning, there are a huge amount of people who miss out on the basics.  That is where we need a huge amount of effort to be put in to pinpoint supports for families and communities to make sure that more people are engaged in the benefits of science and the benefits of education.  That is absolutely necessary.</p></speech>

I welcome the new technological universities that have been established.  There is a clear pathway now ahead in terms of the development of the status and activity of each of those entities and a great deal of what they will be engaged in will centre around the sciences because the future is all about solutions through science.  Whether it is life sciences or pharmaceuticals or the medical sector, all of those have left a mark on world markets, in that products from this country sold abroad are often innovative and used by the big companies.  It is important that we involve the SME sector in order that it can bring forward, perhaps with the universities, the ideas and the proposals that such companies have to develop a product and commercialise it and then internationalise it in the context of our work abroad.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland does a fantastic job in promoting companies abroad and it has built up a huge reserve of respect for Irish companies and for the innovations that they have brought to the international markets.  I see the new universities playing a central role in developing this whole area, in ensuring that they have a pipeline of developments that can be taken up in business here and then can be internationalised through Enterprise Ireland.  I look forward to the success in that area.</p>  <p>  I also want to mention, in the context of the universities and bringing the regions that they each represent together giving everyone an input into the universities, that every county within the region where the universities have been established should make sure that they are all-inclusive and that there is a constructive meaningful role played by every county in the make-up of the university campus, to the structure and to a physical presence in each county.  In that regard, I would mention, in particular, Kilkenny city and county, where we will be linked to Carlow-Waterford and should engage with the developments that they have established in each of their counties in terms of the colleges that they have had and the numbers that they have built up.</p>  <p>  There are many other subjects beside sciences.  In terms of Kilkenny, there is tourism and I believe there is a need for a Norman museum and study centre.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-11-10a.450" nospeaker="true" time="18:22:00" ><p>That could be part of an internationally recognised contribution to education and to the history of the Normans right across the world.  I have suggested that.</p><p>Alongside that, in my constituency, Glanbia has a great research and development section in Kilkenny.  It has invested heavily in the provision of outcomes for the food industry.  It has also won huge market share abroad and is the leader in many of those markets with its products.  These are all new developments that will shape the future.  I recall being in centres in Japan, Taiwan and China where robots were the only things that were moving on the factory floor in the construction of cars and where you would see two individuals monitoring exactly what was going on.  At the end of the line, having been constructed by computers, the outcome would be a car.  Things are changing rapidly and as they do so, we must look at all of those changes and how they affect employment.  I see the universities playing a strong central role in ensuring that people are skilled up and sufficiently qualified to participate fully in the information technology sector, life sciences and the whole area of health and its management in our systems.  There is a product, devised and created by an Irish company, that could well manage the Irish health services.  It puzzles me why the HSE is not taking up some of the home-grown products in technology, HR and financial management and that we are still stuck in the dark ages with the HSE's management of its customers, patients and beyond.  There is technology to deal with that and we should lead the companies by engaging them, not only in schools and universities but also putting into practice the technologies they have created as that would give them credibility abroad and a reference point.  That is essential in the context of our delivery and export of ideas that are created in this country.  I welcome the debate.  I encourage universities to take up all of what has been said and to develop it as swiftly as possible.</p></speech>

I thank the Business Committee for scheduling it and Deputy Naughten who was involved in ensuring that was the case.  I commend Deputy Naughten on his chairmanship of the Houses of the Oireachtas Friends of Science group, of which I am a member.  I do not get to it as much as I might like, but it is a very useful forum.</p>  <p>  There is a huge opportunity for Ireland in science, research and innovation.  There are opportunities in the green, digital, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors.  I would like to see the State take a leading role in creating the environment for progress.  I welcome the establishment of the Department.  I do not think we are there yet with the Department.  I have submitted parliamentary questions asking the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science what efforts the Minister is making to position Ireland as a world leader in renewable energy, research and development.  It is a reasonable question.  It was diverted to another Department.  Everyone in this Chamber knows what happens if one&rsquo;s question does not meet that standard and it is diverted elsewhere, it tells you something about the question you are asking or the Department's interest in responding to it.  I encourage the Department to take on a cross-cutting role in research, innovation and to set the bar high. </p>  <p>  I want to make a point on our working scientists in Ireland.  I was one before in a previous life.  Yesterday we heard that medical scientists voted for industrial action up to and including strike action.  That is a very significant move.  My colleague Deputy Louise O&rsquo;Reilly also mentioned this.  This group has taken this step only once in the past 60 years.  It seeks pay parity with biochemist colleagues, colleagues who do the same work but are paid more.  They are an excellent example of Irish science research, innovation and potential but that potential is being denied and is being lost due to the intransigence of the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Health.  That needs to change.  I find the whole thing incredible.  We have brilliantly trained scientists, experts, a wealth of knowledge, a tremendous asset and resource to our State and to science and innovation, and instead of saying &ldquo;Yes, let us realise the potential of this and maximise the benefit for the public good, for science and for innovation&rdquo;, the State is saying &ldquo;No, there is a glass ceiling and you will go no further&rdquo;.  It has built in a punitive level of inequality.  The State is cutting its nose to spite its face and losing credibility and good people at the same time.  I implore the Minister of State to take back that to his colleagues in government, to get around the table and get it resolved. It is a 20-year-old agreement that has not been delivered on. </p>  <p>  In the coming weeks, I will bring forward legislation not dissimilar to a Bill the Minister of State&rsquo;s former colleague, former Deputy Billy Kelleher, brought forward on the transfer of value and payments from the pharmaceutical industry to healthcare professionals and healthcare organisations.  It is an important thing to do.  We want to be proactive and create an environment where industry works with the public sector, third level and communities.  We saw this with the Creating our Future initiative, which is very welcome but there needs to be transparency and accountability and a public return on a public good.  I ask that the Government would engage with that transparency legislation when I bring it forward in the coming weeks.  It would be for the betterment of scientific endeavour in this country.  </p></speech>

I hope the one thing that comes out of the Covid-19 pandemic is a greater appreciation of the need for independent scientific advice in policy and decision-making in this country.</p>  <p>  Science in Ireland is at a crossroads and the decisions made by the Government over the next 13 months have the potential to be transformative in scientific and societal impact for a generation to come.  We are also at an economic crossroads with complex challenges facing Ireland in a post-Brexit, post pandemic environment and in an era where corporate tax will no longer be the incentive to encourage foreign direct investment into Ireland.  Establishing an innovation-based economy is more important than before.</p>  <p>  The Government's Creating our Future initiative is a very positive and significant step forward and is encouraging members of the public to provide their ideas on what public research should be funded to make Ireland a better country for everyone.  This process of engagement with the public, particularly focusing on research co-creation, is innovative but it must be the start of a process and not just an end in itself.  For this initiative to be truly a success it is important that the public engagement is a two-way process and that we find innovative ways to respond to communities and individuals so that we are not just capturing ideas but we are also communicating back on what we are doing with those ideas and the solutions that have emerged as a result of these ideas.  </p></speech>
