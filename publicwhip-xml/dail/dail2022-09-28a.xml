Instead, they heard by way of correspondence from the Minister that he is going to set up an interdepartmental agency group and advisory forum and that proposals for progressing some form of scheme will be delivered by the end of the year.  Many of those homeowners are nervous that they will experience long delays before a new redress scheme will be open and available.  Can the Minister outline what exactly his intention is and when a scheme will be available for these effected homeowners to get the redress they rightly deserve?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-28a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092800003#A00500"><p>As the Deputy will know, the programme for Government sets out a commitment to examine defects in housing having regard to the joint Oireachtas committee report, Safe as Houses, and to assist owners of latent defect properties by identifying the options for those affected by defects and what those financial options would be.  In response, in February 2021, I established a working group to examine the matter.  As the Deputy will know, the group was chaired by former Donegal County Council CEO Seamus Neely and included stakeholders who did good work and set the terms of reference.  I got the report on 29 July, entitled Defects in Apartments.  That is the report of the working group to examine those defects in housing.  I published it the following day on 30 July.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, I brought a memorandum to the Government to inform it of the content of the report and the next steps that I will be taking.  In that context - this not about kicking it down the road at all but about doing it properly - I will now, in consultation with Government colleagues, develop options with a view to providing support to homeowners who find themselves in a difficult financial situation through no fault of their own.  I said this is a nettle to be grasped.  We put it in the programme for Government.  I am acting on it and I am serious about doing it.  First, an interdepartmental agency group will be established to bring forward specific proposals and it is important that is done.  That will be done in a time-bound fashion.</p>  <p>  In addition, an advisory group to develop a code of practice will also be established to provide guidance to building professionals and to local authority building control fire services, including guidance and interim safety measures in line with recommendation 8 within the working group's own report.</p>  <p>  Finally, I also intend liaising with key stakeholders.  I did write to them yesterday and I have met them.  I met in advance of the budget and explained the position through Pat Montague, who I have to say is being incredibly co-operative and constructive in his response.  I did write yesterday, as the Deputy mentioned, and I intend to proceed with this.  We will need legislation to underpin this scheme.  We need to do that.  I will respond further in my supplementary response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-28a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092800003#A00600"><p>I recently met with homeowners and tenants in a development in Park West.  They have recently learned that they have Celtic tiger-era defects to the tune of &euro;70,000 per apartment.  They need redress and support now.  The concern I have from listening to the Minister&rsquo;s response and from reading the letter he sent to the Construction Defects Alliance is that it sounds similar to the long, protracted process we saw with the defective blocks.  There was a 12-month period before legislation was produced and passed.  There is a six- to nine-month period where regulations have to be put into effect.  In real terms, that means that these tens of thousands of homeowners could be looking at a scheme not being open or available until the middle or to the end of next year, with no available redress, no interim measures or no retrospective measures until 2024.  Can the Minister at least give us some indication of his timeline for these pieces of work that he has outlined?  What guarantee can he give us that we will not have the same delays in creating this new scheme as those we have seen with the controversial enhanced defective blocks scheme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-28a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092800003#A00700"><p>First, the defective block scheme, as the Deputy knows, is an Exchequer and Government commitment in the region of &euro;2.7 billion to assist homeowners in need of help in affected counties.  We needed to underpin that with legislation.  I also want to say to the Deputy that the mistakes of the first defective concrete blocks scheme need to be learned.  They were set up under regulations and not on a sound basis under legislation.  I have said to the Construction Defects Alliance that we will need legislation.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy&rsquo;s specific question around timeframes, I intend to bring options for financial assistance and for how this scheme would operate this year.  I will stay in touch, as I have done regularly, with the Construction Defects Alliance and with other stakeholders.  I am committed to helping in this space.  The Deputy is right; I know thousands of homeowners and I have met with them in my own constituency and right across the country.  This Government will help.  I ask - I know in fairness that heretofore in relation to defects we have had this - for a constructive approach from all of us, because all of us want this rectified.  I will not be dragging my feet on this, but we have to get the scheme right.  I have to bring forward options that to get agreement in government as to what we can do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-28a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092800003#A00800"><p>The one thing that we should all learn from the two problematic defective block schemes is that we should not provide a grant scheme for Celtic tiger-era defects.  The quickest, most efficient and most cost-effective way are providing these tens of thousands of homeowners with redress is to change the terms of reference for the Pyrite Resolution Board and to allow it to take on an end-to-end scheme to support those homeowners.  A grant scheme will be exceptionally difficult to operate, particularly for multi-unit developments where there will be social housing landlords, private landlords, institutional landlords and homeowners.  Therefore, I recommend that approach to the Minister.</p>  <p>  The problem, however, is this work has already been delayed.  The report was meant to be produced in the middle of last year.  That is not the Minister&rsquo;s fault, but it is because the work of the independent group took longer to do, and I not criticising it.  However, if we have to wait for legislation, homeowners who are now losing their insurance and homeowners who are at risk of fire safety enforcement are being told essentially to wait for another year or for a year and a half before money starts to come down.  Can the Minister give us any insurance that interim measures, retrospective measures or some kind of immediate support could be made available early next year because that is what these homeowners need to hear?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-28a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092800003#A00900"><p>All options will be looked at.  I actually do not agree with the Deputy and I do not think the pyrite remediation scheme or that legislation would be a sound footing to set up a significant piece of work like this.  Some 28,000 homeowners and households participated in the survey, so we have a good handle on the scope, the range and the type of defects, from fire defects to water ingress to structural defects.  We also have quite a good handle on what the approximate cost would be, although it is approximate.  We are looking at that per unit of approximately &euro;20,000.  I am aware of people who have already carried out works and fire safety works because they had to for their own good and for the safety of their families.  In advance of the end of this year, I will be bringing forward to Government both long-term options and options that we look at on an interim basis.  However, we need legislation.  We need a robust scheme, because this scheme will probably be with us for five to ten years at least.  I understand the point that the Deputy has made about the pyrite remediation scheme and the legislation there.  I know from talking to the Construction Defects Alliance that they have a concern of trying to shoehorn this scheme into that also.  We need stand-alone legislation.  I will keep the House informed and I will be bringing options to Government in advance of the end of this year.</p></speech>

Other families who received the pandemic unemployment payment, despite its temporary nature, have now been forced off the housing list.  In a perverse twist, the budget measures announced yesterday to help families will push more of them off the housing list, resulting in the withdrawal of housing assistance.  When will we see changes to these thresholds?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-28a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092800003#A01300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.  As Deputy Naughten will know, Housing for All was published in September 2021.  He is right that housing limits have not changed for ten or 11 years.  As part of the broad suite of social housing reform, I committed to reviewing income eligibility for social housing.  The review, which examined the efficiency of the current banding model and income limits applicable to local authorities, has been completed.</p> <p>I have recently approved implementation of some of its recommendations.  The review has now been published and it is available on the Department's website.  The recommendations contained in the review include the commissioning of work to scope and develop options for a revised or new social housing income eligibility model.  This work will commence shortly.  I want it done in a time-bound fashion.  The work is being done by the Housing Agency, which I believe is in the best position to carry out that work.  It has been tasked with commissioning it.  It is expected, and I am insisting, that that work will conclude before the end of this year.  Pending completion of the work, I have also approved changes to the social housing income eligibility bands in five local authority areas in counties Carlow, Clare, Galway, Laois and Westmeath, moving them from band 3 to band 2.  Accordingly, the baseline income eligibility threshold for these areas will increase from &euro;25,000 to &euro;30,000.  The change reflects the movement in rents in these areas in recent years and will ensure local authority areas with similar accommodation costs continue to be grouped together in their respective bands.  These changes will come into effect from 1 October.  I have to wait for the report to which I referred before considering any further income threshold levels for all counties.  I do believe they need to be increased, but I will have to base whatever proposals I bring forward to get Government approval on the report that I receive and any potential impact that those changes will have.</p> <p> We are doing this work while we are increasing substantially the social housing new-build stock that is out there.  However, this is an important piece of work that has not been done.  We have not had a proper review or change in income eligibility for over ten years.  I have made those first changes in the five counties to which I have referred.  I expect to receive the further work on this before the end of the year.  I am insisting on that.  I actually met with officials to discuss the matter yesterday.  It is important for the many reasons outlined by the Deputy, including to ensure that the income limits are applicable to today's world, and to see how they fit in with our affordability thresholds as well.  Thankfully, we are seeing a newer tenure coming through now, namely, affordable rental and affordable housing at scale.  That in itself is important to how we see social housing fits in with the affordable housing measures that we are bringing forward, which are taking hold now and for which around &euro;1.3 billion will be provided next year in new affordability measures.  As I have said, I am insisting that the work is completed by the end of this year.  As Minister, I believe that the limits do need to change and be reviewed.  In the short term, and it is a short-term measure, I have changed the income eligibility threshold for those five counties.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-28a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092800004#B00200"><p>Turning to the short-term measure, I welcome the changes that have been announced for counties Galway and Westmeath, but what does the Minister have against people from County Roscommon?  Did he have a teacher in school who he did not get on with from County Roscommon?  From 1 October, there is going to be &euro;6,000 of a difference in the income thresholds for people living in Baylough in Athlone who are on the same income, living next door to each other, paying the same rent and whose children play in the same football teams and go to the same school because they live on opposite sides of a white line.  Seventeen minutes up the road, in Glentaun in Creagh, it is even worse.  There is not even a white line in the middle of the road and there is that differential there.  Why are those people being discriminated against?  We need to be inclusive and not exclusive.  We cannot wait until the end of the year for these changes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-28a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092800004#B00300"><p>I have to say that the Minister's response is deeply disappointing.  First, he has had this report since December.  I do not believe for a second that the delay in taking action, whether to extend the uplift in band to more counties or to extend the uplift more generally, is to do with the need for more research.  I am firmly of the view that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is absolutely resisting the Minister's desire to raise these income thresholds.  The consequence is as follows.  There are families who are being reviewed, they are &euro;10, &euro;20, &euro;50, &euro;100 or &euro;500 a year over the limit, and they are losing five, 12 or more years on the list.  I had one case, and the Minister has corresponded with the family in question, where due to a family reunification - thankfully the family got back together and that is good for their children - they are a tiny amount of money over the threshold and they cannot even get onto the social housing list.  That family, as the Minister knows, is homeless and accessing emergency support services.</p>  <p>  This is a very straightforward decision.  The Minister has the power to bring to Cabinet a proposal to raise the thresholds.  We do not need this additional research.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has finally published the review.  I have had a quick read of the recommendations.  The recommendations are primarily calling for more research.  We know what is happening.  The Minister's own backbenchers are telling him what is happening.  The thresholds are too low and people on very modest incomes cannot get social housing support or HAP and are being removed from the social housing list.  I urge the Minister to act in the interest of these people now, rather than delaying this for another six or 12 months.</p></speech>

I was able to make the changes quite quickly.  In fairness, I recognise that the Deputy has welcomed those changes, which take effect from 1 October.  For those who have read the report, and I am not saying that the Deputies have not read it-----</p></speech>

It is not all about him.  I am just saying that I would ask those who have not read the report to do so.  I am not satisfied with elements of the report submitted to me, to be very frank, as I said during the previous oral question session that we had.  I do not believe that some of the recommendations within the report go far enough.  We need to change the income eligibility limits.  As Deputy Naughten rightly stated, it is over ten years since they were changed.  To Deputy &Oacute; Broin, I say that we do need that additional piece of research, because we need to be able to base the decision as to what the thresholds will be in different counties, whether we will have one threshold, two bands or whatever, on factual information.  I have said already, and I do not want to repeat myself, that I intend to have that piece of work done through the Housing Agency, which has the expertise to do it.  I am certain that all the Deputies here respect the work that the agency does.  I will have that report before the end of the year.  I will then bring forward proposed changes to the Government for approval.  It is something that I earnestly want to do, but I have to do it in a structured way based on fact and I will do that.  I know how important it is to people and I know that there are people who have been caught in the middle.  I am also looking to see if there is anything we can do by way of transitionary measures while this work is taking place.  It has been brought to my attention that there are some cases where people have gone over the threshold in the short term and have been removed from the local authority housing list.  That is not something I want to see, particularly for a small change.  I am earnest in my desire to make significant changes here that will be made subject to me receiving the report before the end of this year.</p></speech>

Property prices have doubled in that period of time.  In fact, the price of a three-bedroom semi-detached house is increasing at &euro;100 per day at the moment.  We need, even in the short term, some discretion in situations where people get a temporary increase in income.  There should be some flexibility so that they are not automatically excluded.  That is going on left, right and centre right across the country at the moment and it needs to be addressed.</p>  <p>  Second, I wish to ask the Minister a question in relation to the tax credit that was announced yesterday.  RAS and HAP tenancies are being excluded from the measure.  What is the story with local authority and housing association tenancies?  Can those tenants claim the relief?</p></speech>

Large numbers of people are losing access and are being denied access to social housing supports.  How do we know?  Because Deputies from all parties, including the Minister's party, have been saying it on the floor of the House for five years.  One of the big concerns now is that as a result of the income tax and social welfare changes that were announced yesterday, there may be another group of people who are pushed marginally above the limit.  I would be interested to know whether any analysis was done by the Minister's Department as to the impact of those changes on households that are at the margins of the existing limits.  What I am not hearing from the Minister is the urgency that is required.  We have been debating this, including when the Minister was on this side of the House, for years.  Can the Minister tell us when he expects to bring a proposal to Cabinet at least, so that those people who are struggling will have some light at the end of the tunnel?  I do not accept that a review that took over a year to conduct, that is now taking over a year to assess, which could then lead to even more research and assessment, is an acceptable timeline.  These people are hard-pressed and cannot afford their rent.</p> <p>They are losing years and need the Minister to act now.</p></speech>

To Deputy Naughten's point, I am looking at what we can do with regard to discretion.  I have received a number of good examples of cases where people were marginally over the limit because of a change in circumstances in the previous year and have since fallen back under the limit.  Some local authorities are insisting that those people go back for a new application.  I am happy to use this opportunity to say I am absolutely looking at that.  I have been using examples of some of the cases that have been forwarded to me by Government and Opposition Deputies to work through what we can do by way of transitionary interim measures.</p>  <p>  I am serious about making changes in this space but those changes must be made on the basis of proper research to ensure the levels we go up to are commensurate with the affordable housing piece.  We must consider the best mechanism across the country, whether that is a banding system, a blanket system or something else.  I am not delaying this.  The Housing Agency, for which I have a lot of regard, has expertise in this area.  It has been commissioned and is in charge of this piece of work.  I have already said to my officials in the Department that I want this concluded by the end of the year.  We are coming into October so I want completion within the next three months.  That is the timeframe to which I want to work to bring measures and proposals to Government for approval.  I know how important this is for people.  The Government is increasing the social housing stock to levels not seen before, which is good.  I meet new tenants all over the country who are getting a home for life.  That is fantastic and shows that the social housing programme is working.  We must get it up to a sustainable level.  We must ensure that those people who have been waiting for a substantial time for those homes get them, and that our income limits, as Deputy Naughten rightly said, are applicable to today's world.  That work is under way.  I hope to have recommendations to make to the Government before the end of the year.  I will move on it swiftly.</p></speech>

As I understand it, there are three different schemes.  Two of them involve a loan that is essentially a top-up between the mortgage such people could raise on the open market and the price of a house.  Only one of those schemes involves local authorities building houses to sell to people at an affordable rate.  That is the local authority affordable purchase scheme.  How many houses in Clare will be or have been built under that scheme?  Are there any plans for an increase?</p></reply>

Following the publication of the Government's Housing for All plan last September, I asked local authorities to prepare housing delivery action plans.  Each local authority, including Clare County Council, was asked to assess the level of housing demand with affordability constraint projected for their area based on the housing need and demand assessment, and to plan accordingly.  Clare County Council submitted an initial draft plan to my Department in December last and that plan was published in July.  It is there for everyone to see.</p>  <p>  The local authorities with the highest level of affordable housing need were asked to prepare affordable delivery plans as part of their overall plans and were set five-year affordable delivery targets.  Clare does not at this stage have a specific target, as the average price levels are still well below the national median but I understand there may be some localised affordability issues within Clare specifically where there are localised challenges.  If the affordability challenge is not met across the county, we allow that to be taken in specific areas.  For Clare, funding can be made available to develop a scheme in line with the affordable housing fund.  My officials met Clare County Council in July and two potential schemes were outlined for affordable housing in Clare.  That is being worked through between my Department and Clare County Council.  I welcome that because we have the funding to support it.</p>  <p>  I have made changes to the affordable housing fund specifically to allow us to vary the subvention.  One significant change is to allow that subvention, which means the State taking a stake in that home, to vary from &euro;100,000 up to &euro;150,000.  The affordable housing fund has the resources to support local authorities such as Clare County Council.  As I said, there are two schemes being worked on right now with the local authority.  The council has yet to send in a submission.  The last meeting between representatives of the council and my officials was in July of this year.</p></speech>

The local authority is only involved in building houses under one of those schemes.  The Minister has confirmed that Clare has no plans at the moment to enter that scheme.  That will come as a surprise to the many people in Clare who are struggling to get a home.  Incomes vary slightly across the country but perhaps not to the same extent of housing costs.  People in Clare are now being told they do not qualify for the local authority affordable purchase schemes and there are no plans for the local authority to build any houses to sell on as affordable houses at the moment.</p></speech>

There are two schemes being worked on by Clare County Council.  It must submit those plans to me.  In a broad sense, we have already approved approximately 1,800 affordable purchase homes, led by local authorities in 12 different counties and under 27 projects.  New counties, such as Wicklow, Westmeath and Limerick, have recently come into that fold.  The fund is open and those are the first authorities to avail of it.  In his opening remarks, the Deputy referenced the first home scheme whereby people will get assistance to buy private homes.  That is not a second mortgage, by the way, but is an equity stake.  That is open across all Twenty-six Counties.  I hope to get those schemes from Clare County Council, should it work them through.  We are approving new schemes every week and have the funds to do it.  I encourage Clare County Council to make those submissions to me.  These will be local authority-led affordable schemes.  There are two being worked on at the moment.  Waterford County Council has five schemes in place.  As for Cork County Council, I visited Mallow on Monday, where affordable homes are being built.  They are going to be sold this year.  The scheme is open to Clare.</p></speech>

However, the people of Clare want houses and not ideas.  The Minister told me initially that Clare does not qualify under the various criteria or that homes were deemed already to be affordable in comparison with other counties.  It came as a surprise to me when I heard that this summer and it will come as a surprise to others.  If the Minister is saying that the delay is on the part of Clare County Council, I am happy to go back to the council, but that is not what I am hearing from its representatives.  The Minister is saying the delay is a result of Clare County Council not having its act together and I would be surprised if that were the case.  If it is the case, I am happy to go back to the council.  If the problem is the criteria the Department is laying down, which I understood to be the case, that needs to be addressed at a national level.</p></speech>

The fund has been open for approximately one year.  As I said, we have already approved 27 projects across the country in that year.  Many of those are now being built.  Over 1,800 affordable homes will be provided through local authorities.  I have given examples of other counties that have made submissions.  This is not back-of-an-envelope stuff.  A proper submission must be made.  We will provide the funding accordingly.  I have changed the affordable housing fund to allow the subvention to increase and vary from &euro;100,000 to &euro;150,000 so we can ensure that people in Clare can buy affordable homes, led by the local authority.  The first home scheme is open to all Twenty-six Counties.  We have had over 460 eligibility-----</p></speech>

I am more than happy to engage directly with Clare County Council, as I have done with many other local authorities.  I have given examples of counties that have brought forward their first schemes and there are more coming.</p></speech>

Exchequer funding of more than &euro;4 billion is available in 2022 to deliver the increased number of new social and affordable homes.  Overall expenditure on the housing programme will not be determined, as the Deputy knows, until the end of the year.  Typically, quarter 4 sees the highest level of capital expenditure as my Department recoups claims submitted by local authorities.</p>  <p>  During 2022, there is no question but that the construction sector has been impacted by construction product inflation and some supply chain issues.  This resulted in delays to a number of housing projects, which are back on track.  There were consequential delays in the submission of claims from local authorities, especially post the outbreak of war in Ukraine where there were supply chain issues.  However, there has been a strong improvement in the delivery environment, supported by measures introduced by this Government to address material inflation and energy costs through the introduction of the inflation supply chain delay co-operation framework that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, brought forward.  We are now looking at very strong delivery in the last four months of this year, which will see an acceleration in the capital payments made by my Department.</p>  <p>  Budget 2023, as the Deputy will have seen yesterday, again provides for record levels of investment by the Government to support housing delivery.  Through Housing for All, since it is a multi-annual plan, local authorities know that funding is in the base and that they have that funding each year.  There will also be more than &euro;4 billion in Exchequer funding available for delivery of capital and current projects in 2023.  I can tell the Deputy there were delays, particularly in March, April and May when there were supply chain issues.  Most reasonable people will understand that is a reality of the world we are living in at present.  There has a been very strong pick-up, however, and we expect strong completions in quarter 4.  We are engaging on a regular basis, through my own teams, with the local authorities.  My ministerial colleagues and I also engage directly with local authorities on that. </p></speech>

Memos given to the Cabinet sub-committee on housing confirm the targets set for the delivery of affordable and social homes will fall significantly short this year.  Under last year's budget, more than 4,000 affordable purchase and cost rental homes were promised.  So far this year, just 300 cost rental homes have been delivered and only 325 affordable purchase homes have been advertised.  A &euro;240 million underspend in 2022 is forecast under the housing section in the budget documents published yesterday.</p>  <p>  The Minister was very clear at the end of last year.  He said 2022 would be the year for delivery on housing and that the Government would meet its housing targets.  Is the Minister confident the Government will meet its housing targets this year?  Is he saying that the memos given to the Cabinet sub-committee on housing that state those targets will not be met are wrong? </p></speech>

It is looking at mechanisms whereby local authorities can purchase such land.  We hope that councillors in local authorities will support the social and affordable housing developments that are brought forward at local authority level because we have the funding to do that.</p>  <p>  Last year, I said 2022 would be a very good year for delivery.  Even with the problems we have had with regard to the supply chain and inflation, it will be a very good year for housing delivery on the social and affordable side.  Let us also remember that no affordable housing had been delivered for more than ten years.  We are delivering that this year.  Cost rental is in place this year with tenants in place.  More than 900 cost rental tenancies have been funded and many more will be in 2023.  I cannot tell the Deputy exactly what the delivery amounts will be at the end of this year.  Most reasonable people will understand that.  I can tell the Deputy that we are on track to attaining the overall target of 24,600 for housing delivery this year, which is set in Housing for All, and are overachieving in that space. </p></speech>

We are working towards delivering social housing at scale - the highest number of new builds have been delivered this year than in any year since the foundation of the State - and affordable housing, also at scale, through our local authorities and the LDA's Project Tosaigh.  I referenced Mallow earlier, where the first affordable homes have been delivered through Project Tosaigh, with people buying those homes this year.  More than 1,800 affordable homes have been approved under the affordable housing fund.  It is moving and momentum is building in that space.  We will do everything to use and invest as much money as we can this year, recognising the fact, although some may not want to, that there were supply chain issues that caused delays on some of our sites, particularly around inflation, which we addressed through the inflation framework.  That is the real world we are living in.  Supply is increasing substantially and we expect very strong completions in quarter 4 of this year.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-28a.55.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1593" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092800006#D00800"><p>I will raise the issue of Part V affordable housing.  I have raised this previously with the Minister, his Department and his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke.  My question is very straightforward.  I will put on record that I welcome the 25 affordable houses in Castletroy, which are very beneficial, but on the Part V model, why does the 10% affordable housing requirement not apply to planning permissions granted for the period between 3 September and 31 July 2026 on lands purchased after 1 September 2015 and before 31 July 2021?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-28a.56" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092800006#D00900"><p>I thank the Deputy for welcoming the delivery of 25 affordable homes in Castletroy.</p><p>Between 2000 and 2015, Part V obligations under the Planning and Development Act allowed local authorities to avail of up to 20% of the planning gain on relevant land for social and affordable purposes.  This was subsequently reduced, as the Deputy is aware, to 10% in 2015 for social housing.  In line with the commitments in the programme for Government, changes to Part V were introduced under Part 6 of the Affordable Housing Act 2021, which was enacted on 3 September 2021.  The provisions increased the contribution required for social and affordable housing, including cost rental housing, up to a mandatory 20% for planning permissions granted in respect of land purchased before September 2015 and since 1 August 2021.</p><p>Transitional provisions were included that defer the application of the increased 20% requirement to August 2026 in the case of land purchased when the obligation was 10% between September 2015 and August 2021.  These transitional arrangements aim to ensure that near-term delivery will continue and will also encourage developers to bring land forward for development now.  This is consistent with the overall approach to supply in Housing for All, which is to stimulate development across all tenures.</p><p>In addition to the affordable homes that will be yielded by Part V as the provisions are rolled out, delivery of affordable purchase and cost rental homes will be achieved in the immediate term through local authorities supported by the affordable housing fund, through approved housing bodies, AHBs, supported by the cost rental equity loan, and via the LDA.  The Deputy may also be aware that the first home affordable purchase scheme is available to first-time buyers unable to afford new homes and I understand there have already been applications in Limerick.  I understand that funding was also recently approved for an affordable purchase scheme in Limerick, which will see delivery of homes in 2023.</p></speech>

At present, every new estate being built will have 10% social housing.</p> <p>However, if planning permission is secured to develop land that was purchased between 1 September 2015 and 31 July 2021 before 31 July 2026, which is four years away, there is no requirement for the increased Part V provision in that estate.  That is a serious issue.  I want an integrated model.  We are providing funding to developers to build affordable houses under the affordable housing fund.  We need to look at this again.  Can we now legally ensure a 10% affordable housing element in any new estate going for planning permission where land was purchased after September 2015?</p></speech>

The sunset clause in respect of the pre-existing 10% social requirement for land purchased from September 2015 to August 2021 arose from a recommendation of the Housing Agency's review of Part V.  The reason provided was that it would maintain near-term supply of all types of housing.  The review was mindful of the delay that would attach if development plans had to be reviewed.  In addition, increasing the percentage could make developments unviable where the original financial appraisal was based on the 10% contribution.  Our Department is open to looking at advance purchase arrangements for new developments.  The 10% threshold was already there.  There is flexibility through the advance purchase arrangements but we had to provide certainty.  The critical thing was that we had to ensure delivery of housing in the near term.</p></speech>

It is about the cost of building houses in an estate.  My worry is that, when developers or builders buy lands, it will normally be a couple of years before they apply for planning permission or build houses.  Most of the land that will be built on in the coming years is land purchased prior to 31 July 2021.  I ask the Minister of State to commit to looking at establishing a legal basis and funding model to compensate any builders or developers seeking permission from a local authority to build a private estate on lands purchased before 31 July 2021 for any costs involved in building affordable houses.  I want every new estate built to incorporate 10% social housing and 10% affordable housing.  I ask that the Minister of State engage with the Attorney General to seek further legal advice to see if this can be overcome.  It is a matter of funding.  The Government can provide assurance for developers on these costs.</p></speech>

It ensures that we will have a good mix of tenure in our housing stock, which is absolutely critical.  The second critical thing is the near-term delivery of housing supply.  In that regard, we have done the right thing.  On affordable housing delivery in Limerick, funding of &euro;1.875 million was recently approved for 25 affordable purchase homes at Br&uacute; Na Gruad&aacute;n, Castletroy, with Limerick City and County Council advising that it aims to deliver these in 2023.  The council has been assigned baseline affordable housing fund support for delivery of 264 units to 2026 so there is significant delivery of affordable housing.  We take on board the Deputy's point but the decision the Government made was the correct one.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the steps the Minister has taken in introducing a refurbishment grant for vacant properties in our towns, villages and rural areas.  However, the Department was slow to issue guidance to local authorities, although it eventually did come.  We now need to actively encourage the uptake of this scheme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-28a.70" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="11:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092800007#E01200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 14, 36, 41 and 45 together.  I acknowledge the Deputy's input on this.  We have discussed it.  This scheme can be vitally important in breathing life back into our towns, villages and rural areas.  I will explain where we are at the moment.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Naughten will know, pathway 4 of Housing for All sets out a blueprint to address vacancy and make efficient use of our existing housing stock.  All of us want to do that and we should do so.  Many areas in our cities, towns and villages of all sizes face the blight of vacant properties.  On 14 July this year, I launched the vacant property refurbishment grant as part of the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns fund.  That grant will benefit those who wish to turn a formerly vacant property, house or building into their principal private residence.  There grant is worth up to &euro;30,000 and is available for the refurbishment of vacant properties for occupation, as I have said.  This includes the conversion of a property which was not previously residential.  I have also made a change to planning exemptions to allow conversion from commercial to residential use without planning permission.  Where the refurbishment costs are expected to exceed the grant of &euro;30,000, there is a further grant available if the local authority designates the home as derelict.  This comes to a total of &euro;50,000 comprising &euro;30,000 where the property is vacant and &euro;20,000 where it is derelict.  </p>  <p>  On 21 September, I launched the ready-to-build scheme, which is the equivalent of the serviced sites fund for our towns and villages.  There has been a great response to that.  When I launched the original Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund for our towns and villages, I committed to an ongoing review of the schemes under it.  I am now expanding the scheme.  Guidance has issued.  In fairness, we only launched it on 14 July.  In the first four weeks, there have been 169 applications to the scheme with most local authorities making applications.  There is incredible interest in it and I believe it will work very well because it is simple.  It has been broadly welcomed.  We are retaining it in the budget.  Others who are sitting not too far away from Deputy Naughten would get rid of it.  That is something they can explain.  This is a simple grant that will help homeowners.  I have now extended it to rural areas.  That will take effect from November.  I have also extended it to urban towns like Drumcondra or Ballincollig.  It is open right across the Twenty-six Counties and has already had a very good start.  I thank the Deputy for his input on the scheme.</p></speech>

We have already put the infrastructure in place.  There is water and electricity and broadband is going in now.  In climate terms, every square metre of new-build takes 1 tonne but the refurbishment of a square metre of an existing house takes half of that.  There has already been an incredible level of interest in the scheme but we have set a cap of 2,000 premises by 2025.  Conservatively, we are looking at somewhere between 90,000 and 160,000 vacant properties across the country.  Can the Minister assure local authorities that, if demand is shown, funding will be made available to refurbish more than those 2,000 premises?</p></speech>

With regard to the top-up from &euro;30,000 to &euro;50,000 in the case of a derelict property, does the property have to be on the county's derelict sites register or can the council say that it missed it but accepts that it is derelict?  That is the carrot side of things, which I greatly welcome, but will greater use be made of the Derelict Sites Act 1990 to put pressure on people who own derelict sites to sell?  There are many people who want to buy these sites and the Government is clearly incentivising that through this excellent scheme, which I congratulate the Minister on.  The Minister has said he is expanding it to rural areas.  Do the same grant amounts and limits apply?</p></speech>

By way of clarification, when will this be a nationwide scheme?  It is in the villages and towns at the moment.  When will it go to the big urban areas, to rural areas and to city centres?  It would make a great difference in Limerick city centre and within the environs of the city.  When will it become a blanket nationwide scheme covering all older properties?  Young couples and other young people come to me.  In many cases, they can buy a second-hand house and do it up more cheaply than they can buy a new house.  It will bring benefits to towns and villages.  Will the Minister give us an idea of when it will cover all areas, including city centres, city environs and rural and urban areas in addition to towns and villages?  What are the timeframes and levels of grants, which my colleague asked about previously?</p></speech>

It is open to every local authority.  It is a simple application.  To answer Deputy McNamara's question, if the local authority designates the house as vacant, so if someone comes to it with an application when purchasing a house and the local authority says it has been vacant for two years or more, that is all that is needed.  There and then they will get the &euro;30,000 grant.  If the prospective homeowner comes forward and says the home is derelict and that is agreed with by the local authority, the &euro;20,000 top-up grant applies.  It is not "up to".  It is &euro;30,000 for vacant properties and then &euro;50,000, regardless of the value of the property or the purchase price.  I have made the further changes that I and the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, announced at the ploughing championships.  Most reasonable people see this scheme as an excellent initiative that is going to work.</p></speech>

I can assure the Deputies that if the interest in this scheme translates into applications, which is happening now, we will provide additional funding above and beyond.  There is no question about that.</p></speech>

The difficulty is that across my constituency of Roscommon-Galway we have approximately 6,000 vacant homes, fewer than ten of which are available to rent today.  Across the Northern and Western Regional Assembly area, there are 44,000 of these vacant properties.  We want to see them back in use, bringing life back into rural communities.  Will the Minister give an assurance that if there are barriers to the uptake of this scheme, they will be addressed?  Take the repair and lease scheme, for example.  In principle, it is a good scheme but the social housing test placed on it is acting as a barrier to local authorities refurbishing some of these vacant properties.  Right across this country at the moment there is a social housing need in every village.  There are Irish people or Ukrainians who will take those houses and yet we still have a social housing test in place for that scheme.  That needs to be lifted.</p></speech>

I welcome the scheme but there is a difference between vacant houses and derelict houses.  The Government has introduced a vacant house scheme but there are a lot of derelict houses across the country.  They do not accrue local property tax at the moment.  Bringing in a vacant property tax is not going to be a stick to force those houses onto the market.  We need those houses on the market because the Government is incentivising people to buy them.  We need those houses done up for the sake of the communities but most of all for those who are looking to buy houses.  Will there be a measure to get those derelict houses onto the market?  The vacant house tax announced yesterday will have no impact whatsoever.  The Government can treble or multiply by ten the local property tax but zero by ten is still zero.</p></speech>

We need that stick.  The vacant property tax is a commitment in the programme for Government and an action in Housing for All that we are bringing forward too.  We have made some quite significant changes to the repair and lease scheme recently and removed a lot of those barriers.  Repair and lease is a very good way of getting vacant and derelict properties back into use for social housing.  I have seen many of them right across the country.  Earlier this week I was with Deputy Aindrias Moynihan in Macroom and saw some fantastic work being done there in relation to town regeneration.  It is happening all over the country.  It might disappoint some people but it is.  We kept the scheme as simple as possible.  This will be on top of using CPO through the Housing Agency.  There are a number of streams there.  This Government and most Deputies are committed to keeping this assistance and making sure the scheme works.  If it needs to be tweaked along the way, we will do that.  It only launched on 14 July.</p></speech>

We launched the scheme in July to get it up and running and test the interest in it.  Without pushing it and doing a public information campaign there has already been a very good response.  There will be a public information campaign around it and we will expand it to the cities.  I am sorry; I neglected to answer that question.  It will be in the month of November but I cannot give a precise date.  We have to make sure the guidance is out there already.  I will have housing summits with the local authorities on 13 October and I will be going through this and the changes with each director of services for housing.  To be fair to the local authorities, it is another role they are taking on and they have done it very well already.  As I said, there have been 169 applications in less than four weeks.

My Department is cognisant of the current financial environment in which local authorities, including Dublin City Council, are operating, and the pressures facing them in respect of general inflation and higher energy costs in particular.  These challenges are common across the sector - indeed, across the State - and I will set out how support from central government for local authorities in 2023 will increase in recognition of their financial challenges.</p>  <p>  My officials are in regular and ongoing contact with the sector on the issue of increased energy costs and my Department recognises the serious impact of these financial challenges.  In this regard, additional support of &euro;60 million has been secured to assist local authorities in meeting the increased costs across a wide range of services.  In line with the public sector generally, local authorities will also need to seek to reduce their energy consumption.  Work is already under way in that regard.</p> <p>For 2023, the Government is making a significant contribution of &euro;333 million to support local authorities.  A large portion of this amount, &euro;199 million, will be to assist local authorities with the cumulative effect on pay costs arising from the national pay agreements and the unwinding of the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation.  This allocation will ensure that local authorities have the necessary people to perform their functions and to provide more than 1,000 essential public services to our citizens.</p> <p> As has happened in previous years, we will engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding any additional pay increases that are confirmed for 2023.  Across all schemes and funding sources, my Department has provided &euro;737 million in 2020, &euro;724 million in 2021 and over &euro;305 million to the end of August 2022 to Dublin City Council.  Included in this is an unprecedented level of support provided by central government to local authorities during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p></speech>

Dublin City Council is facing particular budgetary difficulties due to general inflation, higher energy costs and, as the Minister of State said, the public sector pay increases, which increase the pressure.  I welcome the details the Minister of State provided about the funding allocation.  Dublin City Council has particular pressures relating to homelessness and the provision of related services.  As we move towards that decision-making process for Dublin City Council in the next couple of weeks, it is important that the councillors who are making decisions on budgets are aware in more detail of what assistance they might expect from the Department as they head into negotiations with various parties in the coming months.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has secured an unprecedented increase in housing for the homeless, with over &euro;250 million, which will be a significant asset for Dublin City Council and other councils, protecting the most vulnerable.  It is important for the State to do so.  In the programme for Government, Our Shared Future, we have the move to 100% retention of the local property tax, which will take place in 2023.  This will increase surpluses for authorities like Dublin City Council.  Dublin City Council could potentially retain about &euro;40.3 million of its local property tax for its own use in 2023.  We are currently engaging with the sector about energy costs and other costs in response to the acute increase in inflation, at about 8%.  I assure Deputy Hourigan that we are engaging solidly and we will support local authorities in any way we can, including Dublin City Council.</p></speech>

I welcome his acknowledgement of the councillors' ability to retain the local property tax.  A decision on that is due on Monday.  As we know, Dublin City Council, including the parties in this coalition and beyond, votes every year to decrease the rate by as much as 15% and to actively impoverish Dublin City Council.  I think it is unfair for councillors to have to make this decision without clear information about what central funding is available to them.  We know that energy price inflation will cost the council &euro;4.5 million.  The cost of general inflation will be in the region of &euro;6 million.  Pay deal costs will be in the region of &euro;13 million.  I would appreciate if the Department could engage with the council on this matter and provide that information to councillors on the council, so that when they choose to cut the local property tax yet again, they know exactly what they are doing.</p></speech>

It has forgone almost &euro;12.3 million by decreasing the local property tax.  Timing is an issue for the Revenue Commissioners.  It needs advance notice to inform citizens what the rate will be, hence the budgetary meeting has to be in September to adjudicate on the rate.  I was in the Seanad earlier.  We discussed a particular county which has increased its local property tax for the last three years and brought in significant income.  It is now accessing huge capital funds from central Government because it has the priming finance to do so.  I call on people to be responsible when looking at their budgetary processes.  They should look at what they can gain.  We have &euro;165 billion to put into public infrastructure in the next decade.  That funding is there to be accessed.  Local authorities have to come up with their share of it.  By increasing the local property tax, they can access significant capital funds, which will improve the lives of citizens and communities right across Dublin City Council, if it chooses to do so.</p></speech>

It is about the social housing income limit.  I read the report and the initial review of income limits for social housing.  I have a couple of comments.  Only seven local authorities nationally have less than 35% of disposable incomes going to rent.  That is the benchmark.  Between 2011 and the first quarter of last year, Limerick city had the highest rate of increase in rents, at 89.5%.  When I looked through the table about the increase in the standardised average, the Minister of State has increased it from band 3 to band 2 in five counties.  However, in Limerick city, there has been a 42% increase in disposable income, or 40% for one adult, two children and a couple.  I put forward a simple model, which has been done for five local authorities.  We would increase the bands.  The Government increased them by &euro;5,000 in 2011.  I want a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 on all bands and 20% generally.</p></reply>

They want to see the Government take action that has been long-promised in respect of income limit thresholds.  The income limits were introduced, in my view, as a measure simply to reduce the waiting lists.  In the interim, they have caused undue hardship to those people who are waiting for housing.  My office advocated for a single parent who is working in a low-paid job.  She is currently living in her parents' home, sharing a box room with her child.  She was provisionally offered a house this month, which was a huge relief.  She completed the paperwork only to be then told that she exceeded the income limits by &euro;1,500 a year or &euro;28 a week and the offer of housing was withdrawn.  Worse than that, she has been removed from the housing list altogether and she was told that when she gets back on it if her income reduces, she will go to the back of the queue.  That is a scandal that needs to be addressed.  We need to know when that scandal will be addressed.</p></speech>

In the meantime, the cost of housing has continued to climb, adding further pressure to households.  We have seen the reports.  Aside from the reports, people need to see movement on the day-to-day and the bread and butter.  The cost of living has continued to increase, which puts further pressure on people on top of existing pressure.  We have seen thresholds being changed in response in respect of fuel allowance, general practitioner cards and various other schemes to support families.  This is a significant support for families under pressure to be able to change this income threshold and to give people the opportunity to be considered for housing assistance payment and the various available housing supports.</p></speech>

That is still a low threshold, which artificially keeps the housing list for Clare low.  It needs to be looked at, particularly now that we have such inflation.  There will be wage inflation, which will see fewer people qualify for social housing and will increase the pressure for affordable housing, because a large cohort will not be able to buy a house.  We previously discussed the affordable housing scheme.  No local authority houses are being built in Clare at the moment.  This forces people to try to get into the market, which puts further pressure on it.  Under the other scheme, local authorities will take an equity share but, essentially, everybody is competing for the same houses unless the local authority builds houses.</p> <p>The local authorities need to build houses, for social housing and for affordable housing schemes.</p></speech>

I am aware that some of the Deputies are not here.</p><p>Housing For All was published in September 2021 and, as part of a broad suite of social housing reforms, committed to reviewing income eligibility for social housing.  The review, which examined <i>inter alia</i>the efficiency of the current banding model and income limits applicable to local authorities, has been completed.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, recently approved implementation of its recommendations.  This included the commissioning of work to scope and develop options for a revised or new social housing income eligibility model.  This work will commence shortly under the aegis of the Housing Agency, which has been tasked with commissioning it.  It is expected that this work will be completed by the end of 2022.</p><p>Pending completion of this work later this year, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, also approved changes to the social housing income eligibility bands, as mentioned by the Deputies.  Five local authorities - Carlow, Clare, Galway county, Laois and Westmeath - will be moved from band 3 to band 2.  Accordingly, the baseline for the income eligibility threshold for these areas will increase from &euro;25,000 to &euro;30,000.  The change reflects the movement in rents in recent years in these areas and will ensure local authority areas with similar accommodation costs continue to be grouped together in their respective bands.  The changes will come into effect from 1 October 2022.</p><p>It is now appropriate to await the report I referred to before considering the appropriate income threshold levels for all counties and the potential impact of the changes that might arise.  The November 2021 report has been published - I am aware some Deputies have read it - and is available on our Department's website.  In a previous reply to a question by Deputy Naughten, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, has given a commitment to looking at transitioning measures for families going over the threshold.  The Minister is not happy with the report but he is looking to the review of the Housing Agency and to have that completed by the year end.  We are conscious there is an absolute sense of urgency on this, as highlighted by the number of questions and the comments from the Deputies.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, is committed to resolving this and looking at those transitioning measures for families who might be just marginally going over the threshold in some areas.</p><p>The research part of it is vital.  We are not sure whether it is a banding or a blanket approach, as was mentioned by Deputy O'Donnell, but it is important we complete this piece of research before the year end.</p></speech>

He and the Minister have done a body of work on this.  They have increased the income eligibility threshold in the five local authorities by &euro;5,000.  If we look back to 2011, the average industrial wage was just short of &euro;36,000.  Now the average industrial wage is just above &euro;43,000 or &euro;44,000.  That is a 20% increase.  There is now a 20% increase of &euro;5,000 for the five local authorities.  I would ask that, as a transitional measure, at a minimum, they should now look to an increase in the threshold for all local authorities by &euro;5,000 in terms of the standard in each of the three bands and increase the 20% for an adult dependant, from 5% to 6% and then for the child dependant from 2.5% to 3%.  It is very logical.  The Minister of State and the Minister have done it for the five other local authorities.  I ask they would do it for all bands.  They could take that as a transitional measure pending the outcome of the final report.  I have looked at it, and certainly it needs to be addressed.  It is coming up as an issue for me in Limerick city and in north Tipperary every day.</p></speech>

The system as it applies to County Monaghan is designed so that any couple of which a single party is working will not make it onto the social housing waiting list.  The income limit for County Monaghan for a family of two adults and two children is &euro;27,500 per annum. Those people will never qualify for a mortgage.  The prospect of private homeownership is not available to them.  The Government has provided for precisely zero affordable homes in County Monaghan under the affordable housing scheme.  What are we supposed to say to those families who fall into that trap?  Should we tell them to rent forever and face the ever-increasing rent prices and costs?  Should they essentially remain nomadic for the rest of their lives?  My appeal to the Minister of State is not only to review but to create a system so that flexibility can be allowed for those people who breach income limits that have been set too robustly up until this point.</p></speech>

People who were just under that threshold and barely ticking over now find themselves losing eligibility for it.</p>  <p>  We have seen the largest social housing push locally in my area, with more than 150 families having moved into brand new social housing over the past year and a half.  More houses are being built but I want everybody locally who has that low income to be considered and to have an opportunity to be considered for those homes as they are being built.  In the meantime, they must be able to get access to the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme.  At the moment, people are being excluded and people are losing eligibility because of minimal changes in their income.  The threshold needs to keep pace with the cost of living and with people's income so that they can be considered.</p></speech>

This may leave them in a set of circumstances where they cannot rent.  I am aware of a number of people in Dundalk in the past while who have been refused in a situation where a circumstance has changed.</p>  <p>  Previously, local authorities were able to make a determination on the basis of a four-week period. Now it is done over the entire year, so if anything was to happen, for example, if there was a period where a person was working extra time, and sometimes this can be required in healthcare setting, then their place on the waiting list is null and void and they are incapable of getting themselves on the housing list.  They are absolutely screwed and are really on borrowed time.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has fairly acknowledged that more work needs to be done and that it needs to be study based.  He said he hopes this study is done by Christmas.  If I could urge the Minister of State to do one thing, it would be to ensure this study is completed by Christmas so that we can see the criteria.  Inevitably, there is always slippage but this is very important and particularly as we are living in inflationary times.  Wages are going to rise and people's eligibility is going to drop further, putting social housing beyond the reach of a lot of people who also do not qualify for affordable housing, even if affordable housing was being built, which it is not being in every county at the moment.  The Minister of State is smiling.  The day he comes to open social housing in Clare, I will be there to congratulate him.  I am not trying to score points.  I really want to see this happen because there are so many people looking for a decent home.</p></speech>

All of the Deputies made their points very well.  Some Deputies were not here earlier when the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, was responding to Deputy Naughten.  We will do our level best to have that report ready before the year end.  The Minister has stated he is not happy and that he wants to resolve this.  He is of the view that the Housing Agency is best placed to deliver this report. He has given a commitment that changes will be brought to Cabinet to resolve this once and for all.  We can hear from all of the Deputies that the challenges facing families and households with regard to income eligibility is an issue throughout the State.</p>  <p>  It is also important to look at the issue of those transitional measures for those families who are slightly over the threshold.   We will try to bring in some mechanism to support them as well.

The Deputy will be aware I brought in a new affordable housing fund last year to directly assist local authorities to bring forward affordable homes such as in Kilcarbery.  Approximately &euro;125 million in funding has already been approved to support the development of nearly 1,800 homes for affordable purchase.</p> <p>Another five schemes that will deliver a further 270 homes are under assessment.  I hope to dispose of them in the next couple of weeks.  I have also approved funding of over &euro;90 million for more than 900 cost homes to be delivered by approved housing bodies under the cost-rental equity loan, CREL, scheme.  Further applications have come in since we made the changes to CREL last week.</p> <p> On the affordable housing supports my Department has made available, I am happy to advise that South Dublin County Council has confirmed it is delivering 16 homes in Kilcarbery under an affordable purchase scheme.  Kilcarbery Grange is a mixed-tenure development that will deliver 74 cost-rental homes, 16 affordable purchase homes and 310 much-needed social homes.  The 16 affordable purchase homes were supported by over &euro;1.1 million in funding from the affordable housing fund and, following an application process, have already been assigned to successful applicants.  It is good to see that there are people who will be buying homes at an affordable rate under this fund.  The affordable purchase price of these homes will be linked to the applicants income and mortgage capacity.  For these three-bedroom homes, the minimum purchase price will be &euro;245,600 and the maximum will be &euro;285,300.  This represents a discount of at least 22% on comparable market values in the area.  Separately, the 74 cost-rental homes in Kilcarbery Grange that will be delivered by Tuath using &euro;6.3 million provided using the affordable housing fund and CREL funding have now been tenanted.  I have visited the estate.  Cost rents are set at &euro;1,025 for one-bedroom apartments and &euro;1,229 for two-bedroom apartments.  These rents are at a discount of 32% on the market value, with long-term, safe and secure tenure backed by the State.</p></speech>

There were more than 300 eligible applications for these 16 homes.  There is clearly a need for affordable housing.  People in my area have been blocked out of the housing market for years as a result of high prices and unaffordable rents.  They are just trying to get a place they can afford.  They want to live in their area and bring up their children there.  I do not think that is too much to ask.</p>  <p>  The Minister said it costs up to &euro;285,000 to buy an affordable house in Kilcarbery.  How much of the equity stake is being paid back to the State?  He said it is &euro;1,229 a month for the affordable housing scheme.  That is a 32% reduction on general prices in the area.  How much would the affordable rental scheme and the affordable housing scheme have cost had this public land not been sold to a private developer in the first place?</p></speech>

The issue that was there with one mortgage provider in particular has been resolved and the purchasers will be able to close the sales of these affordable homes - at a cost of &euro;245,000 - very shortly.

We did not procrastinate.  We sent the matter back to the Minister's predecessor, Eoghan Murphy, to get 100% public homes on public land, with affordable purchase, rental and social units.  There is no way that the cost would have been &euro;285,000 had it been done at the time.  We were given assurances, as far as the council could do so, that the private homes would cost &euro;260,000, which is less than the affordable housing.  That is what we were told.  I checked this morning and, according to <i>The Irish Times, </i>the prices are &euro;370,000 for a three-bed house and &euro;420,000 for a four-bed one.

They are real affordable homes that people will purchase.  These are part of the 1,800 affordable purchase homes that I have approved already through local authorities right across the country.  That does not even include the first home scheme.  We have had well over 1,000 applications in respect of that scheme, and eligibility certificates have already been issued for well over 400.  These are real homes that people will be able to buy and which they could not afford previously.  We are committed to affordable home ownership.

We are doing everything in our power to tackle this problem, both by increasing housing supply, which will increase substantially this year, and investing in homelessness prevention.  Yesterday, we allocated &euro;215 million which is a substantial increase on the previous year in supports for those who are homeless.</p><p>I have introduced further measures to increase supply, including the new voids programme - some 2,450 voids will be brought back into use this year, with an emphasis on quick turnaround and reletting - the pilot expansion of the repair and leasing scheme and the reinstatement of the delegated sanction to local authorities for social housing acquisitions.  Every local authority is being given the delegated power to purchase homes that come on the market with tenants <i>in situ</i>who are HAP or RAS tenants.  I want to be clear that they do not need to come back to me for approval and they need to purchase them.  That is a very proactive measure that is there to assist people who have been issued with notices to quit and who are on our housing transfer waiting list.  I am encouraging this and have directed local authorities to do that.  I will further reinforce that measure on 13 October when I have the housing summit with the chief executives and the directors of services of all local authorities in the country.  Since I introduced that measure, we have seen over 300 new homes come in that we have purchased or we have entered into contracts with or are entering into contracts to purchase homes with tenants <i>in situ</i>.  We are bringing in that measure while we are increasing the social housing supply.  As stated earlier, we will deliver more new build social homes this year than in any other year in the history of the State.  The activation and the prevention measure through purchasing and acquiring homes with tenants <i>in situ</i>is one that is taking hold now and I want local authorities to do it.</p></speech>

We told the Government the way to do this is by cutting rents through a refundable tax credit equivalent to one month's rent and, crucially, by banning rent increases for three years.  We were very clear.  Both measures must go together in order to give hard-pressed renters the relief they so desperately need.  The tax credit for one month's rent would put a meaningful amount of money back in renters' pockets and a ban would provide renters with the certainty that they will not be hammered by further rent hikes.  To work, the two measures must go hand in hand.  On countless occasions, I have asked the Taoiseach directly to introduce these measures with urgency  Every time, his answer has been "No".  Make no mistake: the Government's refusal to act caused already unaffordable rents to spiral further out of control.</p>  <p>  After leaving renters high and dry for years, yesterday the Government showed up with a &euro;500 annual tax credit.  That is it.  The Government completely ignored the other part of the solution, namely, a ban on rent increases.  A &euro;500 tax credit is better than nothing.  I have no doubt that those tenants who can avail of it will take what they can get as they struggle to pay their rent.  Let us be very clear, however.  This will not make a dent for people paying average rents of more than &euro;2,000 per month, or &euro;24,000 a year, in Dublin or those paying nearly &euro;1,500 a month, or &euro;18,000 per annum, across the State.  Crucially, the tax credit is non-refundable meaning that those without a taxable income are left out.  Who are they?  The Government has left out students and low-income workers.  Incredibly, it has done all of this without introducing a ban on rent increases.  As a result, renters have no certainty and no real protection.  In the absence of a ban on rent increases, the &euro;500 credit will be wiped out by further hikes.  This is true even in rent pressure zones.  There is a real risk that without a ban on rent increases, the tax credit will in fact fuel a further rent hike.  That is what the Taoiseach said when I raised this matter with him in April.  He said there was no guarantee that a credit would result in a reduction in rents.  He said it would be inflationary.  He said it would add to rent prices.  What has changed?  The truth is that despite the Government's posturing, it has left the door wide open for more rent hikes, more exploitation and more hardship.</p>  <p>  N&iacute; th&eacute;ann beart c&iacute;osa an Taoisigh fada go leor.  Theip air an chinnteacht at&aacute; ag teast&aacute;il ag tion&oacute;nta&iacute; a thabhairt tr&iacute; chosc a chur ar ard&uacute; c&iacute;osa.  N&iacute; dh&eacute;anfaidh a chreidmheas &euro;500 aon rud mar beidh s&eacute; caite ar thuilleadh m&eacute;aduithe.  The Taoiseach has messed this up.  The renters of Ireland deserve much better than this half-baked measure.  I want him to correct it.  My question is very simple.  Will the Government give renters a real break by putting a month's rent back into their pockets through a refundable tax credit?  Will it give renters the certainty and protection they deserve and need by banning rent increases for three years?</p></speech>

That was clear during the pandemic, when we put in place unprecedented supports for people and for employers to keep jobs intact.  That is what has happened yesterday with the presentations by the Ministers, Deputies Michael McGrath and Donohoe.</p>  <p>  The budget needs to be looked at in its entirety.  Because of the extraordinary efforts of the Irish people and the careful stewardship of the Government, the economy recovered very strongly and gave us good capacity to navigate the very difficult and expensive winter ahead.  It is a pity the Deputy cannot acknowledge those basic facts.  Every month, she is in here looking for packages.  We resisted the pressure from Sinn F&eacute;in during the summer and so forth.  As a result - people can see this - we are using resources and the capacity that we have derived from bringing the economy back to help the most vulnerable in our society.</p>  <p>  This morning, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council described budget 2023 as sensible.  It said that the Government has managed to direct resources to those who need them most and that more money is being targeted towards those people.  In other words, it is a progressive budget and a fair budget.  That view is supported by the data and careful analysis using the ESRI's switch model, for example.  That analysis found the budget to be "strongly progressive".  The winter cost-of-living measures alone will boost the net disposable income of the lowest income households by 5% compared with 0.7% for the highest income households.  The core budget 2023 package will boost the net disposable income of the lowest income households by 5.8% compared with 2.3% for the highest income households.  I say that to dispel the propaganda that Sinn F&eacute;in has been articulating since the budget was published yesterday.</p>  <p>  The rent tax credit the Government has introduced is &euro;1,500 for 2022.  People have paid their rent but they will be able to claim a &euro;500 tax credit on that for this year.  It will be &euro;500 for next year, 2023, and on an ongoing basis.  The Sinn F&eacute;in alternative budget suggests an amount of &euro;1,500.  However, based on 400,000 renters, that proposal would have an estimated cost of &euro;600 million.  There is a massive hole in Sinn F&eacute;in's proposed provision.  There is a &euro;300 million black hole in its housing plan.  The figures do not add up.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned students, for example.  Students will have &euro;1,000 knocked off their fees in this academic year.  Those who qualify for Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants will have a double payment before the end of the year.  There has been very strong support for students to address costs that they would otherwise incur which the Deputy has completely ignored.</p>  <p>  For many renters, the income tax reductions will be a very significant additional support.  The Deputy cannot just take one item out of the budget and ignore the impact of all the rest on individuals, be they renters, homeowners, those on social welfare or pensioners.  We have expanded the supports for pensioners and so forth using a range of measures.  Pensioners were completely ignored in Sinn F&eacute;in's alternative budget.  It favours giving pensioners less for some reason.  In all its budget proposals, it favours giving pensioners less than others.</p></speech>

That is the Government's record.  The facts speak for themselves.</p> <p> I am raising the issue of renters, specifically those who rent, those who are under pressure and those who were looking for the relief that we have been seeking for years, with the Taoiseach as he spreads the largesse.  I have put this case to the Taoiseach for years.  The Government showed up yesterday with something that is inadequate and flawed, and I want the Taoiseach to correct it.  There are three design errors.  First, &euro;500 is not enough - not when people are facing the type of rents they are paying.  Second, the tax credit is not refundable.  This means that means students and low-income workers are excluded.  They do not get even the &euro;500.  Third, and crucially-----</p></speech>

With so many leaks, over so many weeks, we were led to believe that this would be a substantial package of measures designed to get struggling communities through this bleak winter and beyond.  Unfortunately, that was not what we saw yesterday.  What we saw was money spread so thinly that it will go unnoticed by many, and many of those who will benefit will be struggling already by the time the winter is out.  There is little there to address the structural problems that make people so vulnerable to market failure and a real and biting cost-of-living crisis.  We should have seen a very substantial budget.  Instead, what we got was a treadmill budget, with the Government spending money in order to stand still.  The Government has not provided people with any real pathway forward to get us through the bleak winter ahead and beyond.</p>  <p>  When we strip away the &euro;4.1 billion worth in short-term measures between now and New Year's Eve, the budget package for next year will, in truth, do little or nothing to transform this country or the lives of those who are struggling.  I refer, for example, to the young people trapped in spiralling rent prices who feel forced to emigrate because they see no future here because they cannot aspire to ever owning their own homes.  Once January arrives, it now looks like a mini-budget may well be necessary to address the real supports that are necessary for households through this winter and beyond.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, the Minister for Finance revealed that his Department has revised its inflation forecast to 8.5% for 2022 and more than 7% for next year.  With that in mind, and bearing in mind what I have said, does the Taoiseach agree with my colleague, Deputy Nash, who said yesterday that it looks like we will need a mini-budget in January?  Does he agree that such a drastic measure may well be necessary to address the real inequalities that were entrenched in some of the measures in yesterday's budget.  I refer, for example, to the tax measures.  The reality is that next year, somebody earning &euro;100,000 will be &euro;831 better off.  By contrast, somebody who earns between &euro;25,000 and &euro;35,000 will only take home an extra &euro;191.  The renter's tax credit will at best pay for just one week's rent for an average person renting in my constituency in Dublin.  The &euro;600 energy will not even cover one third of the increasing bills people are going to face this winter.  What we saw were thinly spread, short-term payouts yesterday.  What we need are structural changes in housing, care, climate, and in work.  We saw no ambition or vision from the Government in yesterday's budget.  It is not a budget that works for all.  It is time for the Government to get off the treadmill and to move us forward with proper, substantial targeted measures that will chart a pathway forward towards an Ireland that works for all of us.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the budget has patently failed to do that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-28a.256" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="12:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092800013#L02400"><p>I do not agree.  I take the opposite view.  I have already articulated to the House what the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council stated about the budget.  If we apply the ESRI's simulating welfare, income tax, childcare and health, SWITCH, model, the budget gives most to those who need it most.  Those in the lowest income cohort are getting the most from the cost-of-living package and the core budget measures for 2023.  That is in net disposable income.  The lowest income groups will get the most from this budget.</p>  <p>  In terms of the structural issues, Deputy Bacik is aware that this is a package of &euro;11 billion.  It is not spread thinly.  There are some fundamental changes happening in education, and not just in terms of school transport, which is free from this September, albeit there were issues with the greater numbers that applied - up to 21,000 extra.  That is &euro;650 saved for many families.  We can now add the fact that from September 2023 we are looking at free primary schoolbooks for all children.  That is a structural watershed change in terms of how we provide books and education materials to primary schoolchildren.</p>  <p>  The primary school pupil-teacher ratio has now been reduced to an historic level of 23:1.  This is the third year in a row that the Government has reduced the pupil-teacher ratio, which is a very positive structural change in terms of equality and fairness.  The school meals programme is being extended.  Close to &euro;100 million is being allocated to schools before the end of this year to deal with the energy costs that they have undoubtedly incurred because of the current crisis.</p>  <p>  At third level, students will see a once-off reduction of &euro;1,000 in their college fees this year and &euro;500 next year.  All SUSI maintenance grants have been increased by 10% and 14%, with a once-off double monthly payment before Christmas.</p>  <p>  The reason for those cost-of-living measures before Christmas, many of which are once-off payments, is to deal with the crisis that has been brought about by the war in Ukraine.  The latter is a very serious issue internationally, and we have got to reduce the pressure on people that it has brought about.  Those measures will be impactful.  We cannot take them all in isolation.  One has to combine a lot of the social protection measures.  I refer, for example, to the very significant lump-sum payments that will be paid to a whole variety of social welfare recipients and low-paid workers as well.  As the programme for Government states, we need to do something in terms of middle-income earners and those on more than the &euro;40,000 threshold because people were going onto the higher rate too early.  If one looks at the energy credit, one can combine all of that-----</p></speech>

We agree that a combination of measures is necessary, but we have proposed three immediate actions the Government could have taken in this budget to alleviate hardship.  I refer to a &euro;9 per month public transport ticket to heavily subsidise public transport for all, a &euro;200 per month cap on childcare fees and access to free GP care for all children under 18.  Those are the sort of measures that could have been adopted by the Government in the budget, but that were not.  We believe they are the kind of measures that are necessary.  In a rich country, no one should be left hungry, cold or homeless facing into winter.  This Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael budget has failed that test.  We need an Ireland that works for all.  We in the Labour Party have put forward serious, substantial and radical proposals that would have achieved that.  It is an unfortunate missed opportunity that the Government did not take up that challenge and introduce a combination of measures needed to address the hardships and fear so many people are facing this winter.</p></speech>

That was a substantial breakthrough that has been acknowledged by the social partners in respect of improving working conditions within the childcare sector.  In addition, in this budget, we are taking meaningful steps to improve affordability for childcare in the context of a reduction in costs of the order of 25%.</p>  <p>  In health, all inpatient hospital charges will be abolished and free GP care will be considerably expanded as a result of yesterday's measures.  That will include, as was agreed last year although it has taken a long time to negotiate, with the Irish Medical Organisation and others, the provision of GP visit cards to children aged six and seven.  Moreover, we have extended even further, on foot of what we did last year, free contraception to women up to 30 years of age.  The women's healthcare package is a significant, progressive move that started last year and that is continuing this year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-28a.261" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1482" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="12:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092800014#M00200"><p>Yesterday, the budget announcement regarding the defective concrete blocks levy smacked of an ill-timed, ill-judged decision.  It is expected this levy will raise &euro;80 million annually.  It will commence on 3 April 2023.  The levy will result in a 10% increase in the cost of concrete, concrete materials, sills, lintels, hollow-core floor slabs and concrete blocks.  At a time when thriving inflation within the construction industry is creating havoc for young people who are trying to build their own houses and for local authorities that are trying to build social housing, this will add to the overall cost of the building of all infrastructure in this country.  The levy will bring in &euro;80 million net per annum, according to the announcement yesterday, but it will not penalise people who did wrong; rather, it will impose an additional cost on people who are trying to build or buy their own homes and trying not to be a burden on the State.</p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach to think about this matter on the basis that the Government is putting additional inflation into the construction market.  It is going to add further costs to all public works contracts by increasing the cost of a vital component that is used on every building site and in every civil engineering contract in this country, as well as in housing construction.  It baffles me to think that this is being introduced at a time when we are trying to curb inflation.  There is no doubt that every concrete supplier in this country will add the cost to their sales; they will not take it on themselves.  It is wrong for young people and the taxpayer to be asked to pay for this when the cost of building a house has risen by &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 in the past 12 months.  The Government is proposing to add at least another &euro;2,000 onto that additional cost.  It is a penal levy on young people and others trying to do something on their own.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-28a.262" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="12:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092800014#M00300"><p>Again, I do not think it is fair to look at that in isolation.  I would point out the enormous supports the Government is giving to young people in respect of affordable housing.  More than &euro;1.3 billion of investment will support an overall package of measures to deliver thousands of affordable houses next year by helping people buy and rent at an affordable rate, such as the first-home affordable purchase shared equity scheme that has been introduced, with &euro;50 million allocated to that.  There will be close to 1,000 cost-rental homes, most of which will be delivered by approved housing bodies, and further funding has been given by the State to enable that to happen.  There is also the Land Development Agency, LDA, investment of &euro;600 million for 2023, which will support the targeted delivery of 1,400 cost-rental and affordable purchase homes, and the &euro;250 million for lending under the local authority home loan scheme, under which more than &euro;471 million has been lent out in recent years.  All of that is helping and the State is getting involved, not to mention the help-to-buy scheme, which has supported 35,000 buyers to date.  The State is in there, supporting people in terms of affordability.</p>  <p>  In the context of the concrete levy, the Deputy will be aware that when the Government took a decision in November 2021 in regard to a range of actions to deal with the defective blocks issue, everybody in the House wanted the most comprehensive of packages to deal with the problems caused by mica specifically.  The cost of that at the time was estimated at about &euro;2.8 billion, which the Government agreed to take on.  Similarly, the pyrite interventions have since 2013 probably cost close to &euro;1 billion and there is another &euro;500 million or &euro;600 million to go on that scheme.  Yesterday, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage brought forward a memorandum to Government on apartment defects that outlined the scale of the issues, with up to 100,000 apartments potentially impacted.  He will bring forward proposals on a scheme before the end of the year to help people remediate these units and to help the homeowners concerned.  All in all, if we take the three schemes into account, we are looking at an intervention by the State of somewhere between &euro;4 billion and &euro;6 billion on these issues.  The view was taken at the time of the mica intervention - this was signalled at the time - that some element of sustainability would have to be built into this in the form of future revenue streams to meet this enormous cost into the future.  Hence, there was the idea of a defective concrete products levy.  I accept the Deputy's point that not everybody in the sector engaged in this, but in the insurance industry, levies came in for many decades to deal with rogue behaviour as well.  There is a challenge there for everybody in terms of meeting the needs of the homeowners.</p></speech>

The core problem here is that we do not have effective building control.  Until we bring in a system of proper building control, we will continue to put billions of euro into the rectification of problems with innocent people's properties.  I do not believe the cure for this problem is to put a levy on young people who are trying to build houses.  Ironically, the public purse will be used to pay the additional costs on public sector contracts arising from this levy.  The Government will pay out money for the additional costs on houses to local authorities to build them.  I agree that help is there and I welcome the fact that the help-to-buy scheme has been extended for another year, although it should be expanded to second-hand houses.  Leaving that aside, there is something fundamentally flawed with bringing in this levy at this time.  It will do nothing to cure the problem we have and the rogue operations that are there.  That is where the problem lies, and it is where the solution lies as well.</p></speech>

The core issue is people's bad behaviour in providing such defective materials.  It fundamentally comes down to trust in people who build houses.  I think everyone would have to acknowledge the scale of the intervention, which is a generous intervention by the State because we want to help people keep a roof over their head given their first investment in their house or apartment is one they made in good faith.  The levy will not, in any shape or form, ever raise the kind of revenue the State will spend on dealing with the impact caused by whoever was involved in or responsible for the supply of defective materials.  The revenue raised by this will go nowhere near the cost that will be incurred by the taxpayer.  Equally, a clear message has to go out that such behaviour has costs.</p></speech>

This would have been a devastating blow to mental services in west Cork that serve from Kinsale to Ardrum and parts of County Kerry.</p><p>The report by the Mental Health Commission recommended the closure of the beds following an inspection of the hospital.  However, more astonishing is that the same issue of non-compliance was raised in 2019 and 2021 after an inspection and no funds were made available to carry out urgent works in this time.</p><p>The Taoiseach visited Bantry General Hospital on 29 August last.  I for one will always welcome a leader of our country to such an outstanding hospital.  However, senior people in the hospital asked me days before the Taoiseach came what the purpose of his visit was as the injury room he opened was nine years previous.  I, like others, held out hope that on the day the Taoiseach came to unveil the plaque he would announce an exact date for work to start on the endoscopy and stroke units, two desperately needed upgraded services in Bantry.  While the Taoiseach did say they will have to be built, he came and went without a date, leaving no hope to many people.</p><p>Fast-forward 15 days after his visit, when he promised extra services in Bantry General Hospital and we heard the announcement that one quarter of the mental health beds were to close in Bantry General Hospital, thus sending shock waves throughout west Cork.  This decision is now being appealed by the HSE.</p><p>When the Taoiseach visited Bantry General Hospital on 29 August last, did he visit the mental health unit in the hospital grounds?  I am sure he did not.  Worse again, when the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy Butler, visited Bantry General Hospital on 10 July with the Fianna F&aacute;il circus, did she visit the mental health unit in Bantry General Hospital?  If both the Taoiseach and Minister of State did not, all I have to say is shame on them for turning their backs on the mental health unit.  Questions are being asked.  Did the Taoiseach already know that the mental health unit in Bantry General Hospital was in trouble?  If he did not know it, surely, the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health should have some idea of what is going and should, at the very least, have called in to speak to the incredible staff who do Trojan work in the unit.  I will read a quote from the Minister of State, who said during her visit to the medical side of Bantry General Hospital that:</p> <blockquote> 	We often hear of the apparent downgrading of ... [Bantry] hospital and headlines about how the HSE want to close it.  Judging by this visit, ... [this] could ... [not] be further from the truth. </blockquote>  <p>Fast-forward eight weeks from her visit and we almost had the destruction of the mental health unit under her watch due to the incompetence of many.</p><p>The Taoiseach has been made aware of the crisis in the mental health unit at Bantry General Hospital over the past few weeks in the D&aacute;il.  He had the chance to find out what went wrong and what will now be done to deliver for the many people of west Cork who genuinely suffer mental health issues.  During the formation of this Government, I, along with my Rural Independent colleagues, sat around the table with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, and Green Party leader, Deputy Ryan.  I asked for two things only.  I made it clear that I wanted two things for west Cork.  One was a ministry for fisheries, which the Taoiseach failed to deliver, and we saw where that got us.  The other was a cast-iron guarantee that Bantry General Hospital would never be downgraded under the terms of this Government.  The time has come and we have now seen this has not been delivered.  Will the Taoiseach give the people of west Cork a cast-iron guarantee in the D&aacute;il today that this Government will give adequate funding to the HSE to retain all 18 beds in the mental health unit in Bantry General Hospital?</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, the HSE has appealed that now and it is in the district court.  I will come back to that in a second.</p>  <p>  People in Bantry were quite happy that morning in August when I visited.  I got a good welcome there.  I do not think I left with people having no hope, as the Deputy suggested.  People were quite confident about the endoscopy unit and further investment, which we have allocated through the HSE.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has a great habit of moving on the issue.  It is no longer about that the investment is going to happen; I must now come down with the actual precise date on which the builders will be off the site and so on.  Be that as it may, I have a good record with Bantry General Hospital.  As Minister for Health, I put very far-reaching investment into that hospital, which has stood the test of time in terms of the service it provides for that wider region.  We have always maintained it is a key hospital for a vast hinterland right down to the Beara Peninsula given its geographic location and acknowledged the necessity of various interventions.  It works very well with Cork University Hospital, CUH, and within the south-west hospital grouping, which is important in terms of the right treatment at the right time.</p>  <p>  In respect of the decision by the Mental Health Commission, the Deputy knows that is an independent body.  From time to time in the House, we ignore the reality of decision-making by a body such as the Mental Health Commission.  On other occasions, we will ask those regulators or those bodies to go in and give a very objective assessment of facilities.  Sometimes, we do not like it because it leads to decisions that are awkward or challenging.  It does at times drive standards and quality, however, and therein lies the tension.  It does create huge issues for the HSE and the service.  That is why the HSE is appealing the decision; it is not in the position.  The HSE maintains that it cannot afford to reduce the number of beds and it will challenge the interpretation of the regulation of 2022.  It believes it could have broader implications for other approved centres in the community healthcare organisation, CHO, areas and, indeed, nationally.  That is where it lies right now.  These issues must be resolved.  The bodies that make decisions cannot just be ignored and the advice they give cannot be ignored either.</p>  <p>  Investment continues in mental health, however.  The Minister of State, Deputy Butler, secured significant additional resources in yesterday's budget to continue to invest in mental health facilities.  Deputy Collins asked if I visited the centre.  It is an acute and enduring mental health centre; it would not have been appropriate for me to do so given the privacy needs of the patients.</p></speech>

I have actually visited the unit and I did respect the privacy of the patients; I stayed at the door and spoke to the staff there.  I have gone in to see patients because I have sometimes been asked to do so.  The Taoiseach said an independent body makes that decision.  That is fair enough.  However, the independent body made that decision in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022.  It continued to make that decision and no funding was given.  The Minister, Deputy Butler, received an extra pittance.  I am not inspired the Taoiseach's answer.  He is giving me further doubts that the full 18-bed mental health unit will be up and running in Bantry General Hospital as it should be.  It is now 25 years since the mental health unit was opened in Bantry.  The unit in Bantry had shared bedroom facilities in line with the standards 25 years ago, but the standards have changed and the unit in Bantry has not received the funding from the HSE or the Government to make the necessary changes.  The Taoiseach during his term in office has failed to give a start date for the endoscopy and stroke units in the hospital.  If what I heard were true every time it was mentioned that a block was put down for that endoscopy unit, by God there would be ten of them in west Cork already.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has a chance to redeem himself here.  I will ask him once again.  Will he give me a cast-iron guarantee for the people of west Cork that funding will be provided for urgent work for the mental health unit in Bantry General Hospital to keep the 18-beds that are there at present?  The Taoiseach is right about Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan, whom he said raised the issue in this Chamber.  He was with the Taoiseach that day in Bantry General Hospital, however.  They both walked beyond the Bantry mental health unit and shamefully turned their backs on it.  It is time to deliver.</p></speech>

Much design work has to go into all these projects.  They will happen, just as other investments happened in Bantry General Hospital.  The stroke units have been very effective across the country and they will make a big difference.  The endoscopy suite will also make a big difference.  They are welcome developments in themselves.</p>  <p>  As regards mental health, it is very important that investment would go into the acute facility.  Equally, however, investment must go into community mental health.  A strong primary mental health capacity and community mental health capacity is very often far more effective because it prevents the need for people to be taken into acute units.  I met many mental health experts who argued that if we rely more on acute services it reflects a failure prior to that at primary and community level.  Therefore, as we build up and modernise the acute service-----</p></speech>

There is a fundamental divide in this House between those who want to do the hard work of developing and implementing policies to secure both economic and social progress, and those who play empty and cynical politics.  It is a divide between those who want to solve problems and those who want to exploit them.  The desperate flaying around which we have seen from the Opposition, as it searches for a consistent line of attack, reinforces the fact that this is a balanced and ambitious budget which helps people at a moment of real need and delivers progress on urgent issues.  While protecting our economy and its ability to create jobs and fund public services, it ensures that we can withstand future shocks and surely, if there is one thing we should all understand from the last two and a half years, it is that shocks are happening more often than ever and it is irresponsible to fail to plan for them.<br/><br/>The single most important background to this budget is that it shows that Ireland has come strongly through the pandemic and the fastest-hitting recession of the last century.  It is genuinely remarkable how Sinn F&eacute;in and others cannot even bring themselves to acknowledge what has been achieved and that this Government&rsquo;s actions have been central to helping our country through the pandemic, saving lives and delivering the fastest recovery recorded in Europe.  At the heart of it, this is a widening gap in this House.  Never before has there been an Opposition so completely disinterested in the overall economic picture.  Never before have we seen an Opposition which has absolutely no concern for the need to have an economy strong enough to generate revenue for social supports.  The facts show that the twin public health and economic emergencies which hit our country and the rest of the world have been overcome.  Ireland rolled out one of the most successful vaccine programmes in the world, recorded dramatically fewer deaths than other countries and ensured a rapid economic recovery.  Today there are over 400,000 more jobs in our economy than there were on the day this Government took up office.  Our interventions saved businesses, jobs and family finances.  That is why we have the resources available to implement an unprecedented range of measures to help families and businesses in the middle of a dramatic international crisis.  Some &euro;45 billion was made available by Government, with in excess of &euro;20 billion alone provided in direct support for workers and businesses.  This was expensive, but necessary and appropriate, given the nature of the challenge faced and the needs of our people.<br/><br/>Our exit from the pandemic coincided with new challenges and the weaponisation by Russia of European and global energy supplies.  We are now experiencing the highest rates of inflation in decades.  This is weighing heavily on the growth outlook for the economy as well as bringing significant uncertainty.  This situation is having the biggest impact on households with lower incomes, as the proportion of their income spent on energy increases to new levels while they are trying to cope with other cost-of-living pressures.  Ar fud na hEorpa, t&aacute; boilsci&uacute;, arb &eacute; an costas fuinnimh at&aacute; ag ard&uacute;, an cogadh san &Uacute;cr&aacute;in agus deacrachta&iacute; lean&uacute;nacha sa slabhra domhanda sol&aacute;thair is c&uacute;is leis, ardaithe go dt&iacute; na leibh&eacute;il is airde anois leis na deicheanna de bhlianta.  Anuas air sin t&aacute; d&uacute;shl&aacute;n &oacute; ghl&uacute;in go gl&uacute;in ann i dtaobh an chostais maireacht&aacute;la.  Mar a tharla le linn Covid, n&iacute; bheidh aon easpa ar an Rialtas, agus le c&aacute;inaisn&eacute;is 2023, cuirfimid freagairt chuimsitheach, spriocdh&iacute;rithe agus &eacute;ifeachtach i bhfeidhm chun poist a chosaint agus chun cuidi&uacute; le teaghlaigh.<br/><br/>The overall budget strategy, which was unveiled yesterday by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, achieves three major things.  It ensures that we have the resources to respond to new emergencies, it provides major support for families to help when international events are driving up prices and it delivers action on a range of vital public services.  Everybody who is being honest about the major pressures of rising prices accepts that the dominant causes of inflation are international.  The facts show that inflation in Ireland is just below the average in Europe and the United Kingdom.  Some of the factors pushing up prices, and especially energy prices, will hopefully be short-term in their impact and prices will follow the historical trend and reverse.  Others will likely be more permanent.  Whatever the cause, we fully understand the scale of the impact these rising prices are having and we are responding with the measures that are part of a budget which totals &euro;11 billion.  It is, in both relative and absolute terms, the largest ever programme of direct support for families and businesses.  As well as delivering tax and social protection improvements, our budget encompasses actions across a full range of issues.  It directly helps families with children and it helps older people, students, apprentices, renters, small businesses, farmers and many other groups.  As was the case with our first two budgets, the biggest benefits go to those who are most in need.<br/><br/>During last night&rsquo;s debate we heard quite an amount of fake outrage from the Opposition claiming that this was a budget for wealthy people.  This is nonsense and it is a conclusion which can only be reached by misrepresenting the tax packages and ignoring all of the direct supports we are funding.  What we have seen is a desperate and cynical attempt to import the rhetoric seen in recent British debates.  The Opposition would clearly have loved for us to produce a regressive package focused overwhelmingly on higher earners.  We did not do that, we helped every family and did so in a progressive way but the Opposition is carrying on regardless.  Every single independent report produced here or internationally has said that our policies have been highly progressive in redistributing resources.  To refuse to acknowledge that is to refuse to accept reality.  The progressive nature of budgets is central to our programme as a Government, but it is important to make the point that we completely reject the idea of Sinn F&eacute;in that people of average and above incomes should never be allowed to benefit from any income tax change. This is a zero-sum mentality which I believe is not shared by the Irish people.  When all social payments and other income-linked measures are considered, this is, by any objective measure, a fair and progressive budget so please go somewhere else in your desperate search for a fight on this matter.<br/><br/>The independent Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, in a statement issued yesterday evening, confirmed that the special supports provided in the budget are even more targeted than in previous years.  Over the past week, it has also been shown that Governments have to be careful in responding to inflation.  They can make matters worse in many different ways.  We were determined to deal with the urgency of the impact of inflation but also to not add further fuel to the fire and to protect the basic soundness of the public finances.  The provision of reserves means that we can both respond to any new events and guard against the real issue of revenues which may not be permanent.  I welcome the statement by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council on the budget.  It has confirmed that all of the core assumptions underpinning the budget are in line with independent forecasts.  The council has also noted:</p><blockquote>	The use of the Reserve Fund is welcome.  It is in line with the Council&rsquo;s advice to unwind the State&rsquo;s overreliance on excess corporation tax receipts gradually over time and build up a buffer that can be used in future downturns. </blockquote> <p>As I mentioned before, the council notes that spending has been increased significantly in response to inflation and that the majority of funding is targeted at groups in need.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council also states that, in its view, the budget strikes a balance between providing support and avoiding adding to inflation.  So the first independent review of the budget by the body charged by the Oireachtas to review fiscal policy has found it to be progressive, generous and responsible.  The distributional effects of budget 2023 were also assessed using the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI&rsquo;s, SWITCH model, and found it to be strongly progressive.  The winter cost-of-living measures will boost the net disposable income of the lowest income households; that is, those in the lowest two deciles of income, by 5% compared with 0.7% for the highest income households, those in the two top income deciles.  The core budget 2023 package will boost the net disposable income of the lowest income households by 5.8% compared with 2.3% of the highest income households.  I know that is uncomfortable for the Opposition to hear but it is a balance which is central to us being able to deliver for people.<br/><br/>A major problem in these debates is that they are deeply unbalanced.  On one side, the Government has produced detailed proposals on every area of public spending and taxation, has costed them down to exact figures and has shown the short and medium-term impact of these measures.</p> <p>On the other side, we have policy sound bites and figures that do not come close to adding up or to providing an alternative.  For example, the costings we have heard from Sinn F&eacute;in in relation to housing are a complete fantasy.  It is time we ended the charade of Opposition parties claiming everything is costed but hiding the detail and never addressing the total cost of services or the impact of taxes.  This is a recurring feature of Sinn F&eacute;in presentations: the absence of detailed costings and a refusal to publish any detailed assessment of their impact or, indeed, the details themselves.</p> <p> As I have said, this budget of &euro;11 billion helps families and businesses to cope with the impact of rising prices.  There&rsquo;s no trickle-down side to this.  It is direct and substantial aid, with those most in need seeing the biggest benefit.  The single biggest measure, costing nearly &euro;900 million, is a permanent increase in social welfare payments of &euro;12, the largest ever increase in these payments and part of the largest ever social protection package.  We reject the Sinn F&eacute;in idea of giving less to pensioners.  Pensioners deserve our support, and we will continue to oppose the idea that they should be treated unequally.  It will apply to all people who receive a principal social welfare payment.</p> <p> Low-income families will benefit in a range of ways.  More will qualify for the working family payment.  The qualified child allowance and fuel allowance are being increased and so, too, are payments to carers and people on community employment schemes.  This is on top of benefiting from other once-off measures addressing inflation.  Families with young children will benefit from a cut of up to 25% in the cost of childcare, part of a package that will dramatically increase support for those working in the sector and for quality childcare places.  This is a historic move, representing a decisive step towards accessible and affordable childcare.  The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, will ensure this support is rapidly put in place and benefiting families.</p> <p> These are, each, permanent improvements in State supports which will directly help households in need.  However, in light of the enormous increase in energy prices, we are going further than this and are doing much more.  There are too many measures in this budget to deal with them all individually, but it is necessary to mention the &euro;600 reduction in energy bills we are implementing.  This is a practical, substantial, credible and immediate support for all households at a very tough moment.  We have chosen this way of helping people with bills because it is more direct and sustainable than alternatives.  It is an approach that is being followed in the majority of countries.  It is different from the populist sound bite of capping prices proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in.  As we have seen elsewhere, that can completely destabilise markets and is not sustainable.</p> <p> We want to be clear: we will go after windfall profits by energy companies.  Where they are State-owned, the profits will go back to fund public supports and services.  Where they are not, we will take other measures.  We will work in Europe and with our European partners to agree a common approach to these profits and, if we have to, we will go further.  I know the Opposition would love to claim that we are somehow siding with big energy companies over the Irish people, but the fact is we are doing everything to reduce costs for people and to block excess profits.</p> <p> We understand the critical role a strong business sector plays in creating jobs and supporting both our economy and our society.  Small- and medium-sized companies are facing enormous pressures because of energy prices and they need our assistance.  That is why we are introducing both a targeted support for exporting companies which are energy intensive and a wider measure which is open to all businesses.  This will be directly linked to increased costs and could be worth up to &euro;10,000 per business.  That will help them get through the enormous challenges they are facing today, as will the wider economic stimulus provided by the budget.</p> <p> The surge in energy prices has reinforced the urgent need for us to move to carbon neutrality.  The dramatic challenge of limiting climate change goes hand in hand with securing a sustainable and affordable energy supply.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, yesterday outlined details of actions we are implementing across the economy to expand public transport, reduce energy usage and support energy independence.  We are accelerating and scaling up our drive to create a new economy based on clean energy, one which provides good jobs throughout the country and that can make Ireland a leader in renewable energy and energy efficiency.</p> <p> Hand in hand with this, we are pushing forward with measures to protect and restore the biodiversity which should define our island.  There are those here who like to talk a good game about climate change but who, ultimately, oppose every tough decision.  As with so many other areas, they run away from anything they think might be unpopular, no matter how fundamental it is to tackling the problem and, of course, they remain hurlers on the ditch when it comes to setting out specific targets and actions to deliver on those targets.</p></speech>

That is a simple fact.  Therefore, we will never agree with Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s opposition to carbon taxes.  They are essential to both changing behaviour and funding a fair and inclusive transition to a sustainable economic and environmental model.  This policy is the shared view of this Government and, just as importantly, it is critical to meeting the historic challenge of limiting climate change.  As we agreed in the programme for Government, every cent raised by the carbon tax is going directly to support people in fuel poverty, investing in energy efficiency, helping workers and communities impacted by the transition, and developing a new industry in this field.  In light of the scale of the pressure on fuel prices, we have acted to offset the impact of changes at the pump, but we must not and we will not back off from the core climate change agenda of this Government.</p>  <p>  This budget should help to lay to rest once and for all the false idea that tackling climate change is a threat to our rural economy.  In fact, it is quite the opposite.  More than any other sector, farming is hit by the extreme weather events that are occurring ever more frequently.  More importantly, farmers and the rural economy in general stand to benefit directly from cheaper sustainable energy and high-quality food sectors.  Let me be clear that we will continue to do whatever it takes to ensure we have a vibrant and successful rural economy while also urgently tackling the climate and biodiversity crisis.</p>  <p>  In excess of &euro;80 million in carbon tax funding is going directly to farmers next year.  This will be used to fund the new agri-climate rural environment scheme we have set out in our Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, strategic plan.  This will support up to 50,000 farmers who undertake actions that will support improved outcomes on biodiversity, climate, air and water quality.  Because of the continued impact of Brexit on the agrifood sector, there will also be more than &euro;280 million allocated to the sector.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, has set out an ambitious and urgent plan of action which will continue for as long as is necessary.  That shows a real and sustained commitment to farming, agrifood businesses and rural Ireland in general.</p>  <p>  Central to our programme for Government is an agreed priority to invest in developing our public services and investment programmes.  For the third budget in a row, our public services will see significant developments, and the largest programme of capital development in our history will be funded.</p>  <p>  Delivering affordable housing and social housing for all takes sustained action across all sectors and across a series of years.  Every honest person accepts that making progress on housing takes time, and the facts show our Housing for All policy is beginning to have a significant impact.  The way to make housing affordable is for there to be more housing, to train more people to build and refurbish houses, to remove major delays to housing projects and to help buyers and renters at key moments.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, the D&aacute;il heard speech after speech attacking us on housing, claiming we are in the pockets of various groups and that we are committed to a right-wing ideology.  This is absolute nonsense.  Because of this Government, the State is now by far the biggest actor in housing construction.  We are directly intervening to ensure affordability and we have begun a radical new era of building social housing.</p>  <p>  Next year, &euro;4.5 billion will be spend on building and refurbishing homes, which is by some distance the largest programme of social and affordable housing in Irish history.  The highest level of housing commencements since records began was recorded over the 12 months to May.  Last year saw the highest number of first-time buyers in a decade and a half, with our help to buy scheme and other measures starting to have an impact.</p>  <p>  In this budget, we introduced a range of measures to support people directly, including a &euro;1,000 per person aid for renters over the next 12 months.  There is no area where Sinn F&eacute;in is more callously cynical than in housing.</p></speech>

As we saw when the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, debated with the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson earlier this year, the sound bites simply do not stack up to even the most basic scrutiny.  Their costings and building numbers are little more than inventions designed to claim to have a plan rather than actually to have one.</p>  <p>  It is certainly true, however, that there are key differences between us when it comes to those few areas where Sinn F&eacute;in has actually detailed its policies.</p> <p>We support the principle of home ownership and prioritising the interests of first-time buyers in the market.  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to abolish the help to buy scheme, abolish the first home scheme and abolish the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe vacant and derelict properties scheme.  Together, these schemes have helped many thousands of households and will help thousands more in the years to come.  Yet, Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s ideological opposition to helping people buy homes would see these schemes scrapped.  While it professes to care about the undeniable difficulties faced by private renters, the reality is that its plans would lead to the near elimination of the entire sector.  Blocking private owners from being able to limit tenancies, prevent the sale of properties and a host of other restrictions would lead to an even worse situation then we face today.  As with so many areas, the core tactic of Sinn F&eacute;in on housing has been to hope that the media lacks the time or inclination to look beyond the sound bites and examine its policies fully.  This budget marks a moment when its cynicism has caught up with it.</p> <p> We all saw, during the pandemic, the incredible quality of our health professionals and a system which saved so many lives.  While it faces very difficult challenges, our health system has expanded dramatically and is treating more people with better outcomes than ever before, but we must go much further and that is what we are doing.  The budget delivers on our commitment to continue to expand the core capacity of our acute hospitals, with more health professionals and more acute hospital beds.  A series of initiatives will link with this capacity to treat tens of thousands of people on waiting lists and to reduce the waiting times faced by all.  However, we are going much further to improve access and quality.  This year we removed inpatient charges for under-16s and next year, we will remove them for all patients.  Next year we will also widen the eligibility for the GP card, which will allow thousands more people to be covered.  Allied to general measures like this, we will push forward with our plans to develop new services.  Women&rsquo;s health services will receive major support, including expanding free contraception from age 25 to 30 from September next, providing supports for the first time in relation to IVF treatment, expanding women's health hubs and providing additional funding for screening.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, has set out our ambitious objectives for these and other services.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Butler has detailed, a further major increase in mental health services will be implemented.  Support for older people with a range of needs will also be extended, as will the development of the Minister of State's highly innovative and important dementia strategy.   The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has also set details of nearly &euro;30 million in new funding for expanded disability services.</p> <p> Education has been a priority in each of our budgets, and this year we are going further again to strengthen our schools, help families, support children with special needs and improve the learning environment for all.  This budget will support a record number of building and refurbishment projects, another reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio and more than 1,000 new special needs assistants, SNAs.  These and a range of other measures will help us to further develop inclusive and quality education.  The introduction of free books for primary school students is a radical move to comprehensively address one of the big costs facing families and it will benefit half a million children next year.  Our commitment to education extends to the higher education and training sector, where direct aid will benefit every student and increased funding will help strengthen the system as a whole.</p> <p> At this time of increasing division, angry debate and growing populism, ensuring that we have diverse and professional cultural and media communities in Ireland is more important than ever.  Yesterday, we signalled the beginning of a new era of support for culture and media in Ireland.  As the Minister of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, has outlined, she will be implementing range of innovative and comprehensive schemes to support activity in all parts of our country.  While the Arts Council will receive record funding, a specific initiative will be implemented to support the night-time cultural economy and to help organisations meet rising costs.  The basic income scheme for artists will continue.  Sports and language initiatives will be expanded.  However, it is important to specifically note the range of spending and tax initiatives which we are putting in place to support the Irish media.  As we enter the third decade of widespread access to the Internet and the new dominance of social media, we need to decide whether we want an independent professional media in our country.  If we do nothing, then the brute force of technology and competition will do here what it is doing in much of the world.  The media will become dominated by falling standards, falling employment and an increasingly shrill public space.  If this happens, the first thing which will disappear is coverage of local events.  I believe that just as we need to support Irish cultural creativity, so too, we need to support professional journalism.  There is a public good in a profession which seeks to inform the public on the basis of clear ethics, balanced research and the ability to challenge both itself and all parts of our society.  We can secure another century as a growing democracy if we have a media which has security to enable it to operate to the highest standards.  That is why we are abolishing VAT on published media and we are significantly expanding direct funding for public service broadcasting.  We are also creating a new media grant scheme, which will prioritise coverage of local democracy and the justice system, and are establishing an independent commission for online safety and media, addressing an urgent and growing need.  That commission will have a very significant role to play in the years to come.</p> <p> The budget announced yesterday is a broad programme of action.  It protects our economy against further shocks in the future, while delivering help to people at a moment of real need.  It is a fair and progressive budget, which benefits all but gives the greatest support to those with the greatest need.  It underpins initiatives to address urgent needs and long-term development across key public services and national challenges.  In housing, health, education, rural communities, social protection, culture and many other areas, it enables a wide range of new initiatives.  It is an ambitious, credible and detailed plan for helping our country at a difficult moment, and developing public services in the service of all of the Irish people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-28a.290" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092800018#Q00200"><p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on budget 2023.  I am sharing my time with the Ministers of State, Deputies English and Calleary.  This is my third budget as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  In these three years, we have experienced many ups and downs.  From Brexit to Covid restrictions to soaring inflation, we live in interesting times.  We have not always got things right but we have always sought to protect lives and livelihoods as best we could, and protect jobs and businesses.  We understand that the cost of living is rising.  It is more expensive to do the weekly shop, to fill your car and pay your utility bills.  So, budget 2023 is a cost-of-living budget, designed to help you and your family, with measures for the most vulnerable and the squeezed middle.</p><p>In this budget, we are putting more money back in your pocket by cutting income tax, increasing pensions, and increasing welfare payments for families, people with disabilities and carers, among others.  We are helping you and your family with the cost of living in areas like childcare, public transport, the cost of putting a child through school or saving up for your first home.  We are backing business by helping companies to pay their energy bills this winter.  We are helping with the cost of going to college, by cutting fees, raising the student grant and making it available to more people.  We are building safer and stronger communities by providing more resources to the Garda and the Defence Forces, who protect us.  We are ensuring the best start for every child with major investment in childcare and early education. We are putting &euro;2 billion aside this year, and &euro;4 billion next year, in a reserve fund to protect Ireland from unexpected future shocks.</p><p>Understandably, businesses around the country are very worried heading into the winter.  The cost of energy and of doing business is rising, interest rates are going up and consumer confidence is waning.  Irish businesses can rely on us to back them and to protect jobs to ensure a strong economy.  In this budget, we are announcing five new measures for businesses to help with energy costs.  The first of these is the<b></b>temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, providing qualifying businesses with relief on 40% of the increase in their electricity or gas bills up to a maximum of &euro;10,000 per month per business unit.  This will help small businesses the most, but also many medium and larger ones.  It will be administered by the Revenue Commissioners, backdated to September, and will run until at least February 2023.  The second is a &euro;200 million targeted Ukraine enterprise crisis scheme to assist viable but vulnerable manufacturers and exporters.  </p> <p>This is specifically for businesses competing internationally and suffering the broader effects of the war in Ukraine, as well as increasing energy costs.  There are two strands to the scheme and one strand will provide up to &euro;2 million for energy-intensive companies.  Eligible businesses must produce a business plan that shows how they will manage the crisis and get their energy costs down.</p> <p> In recent years, the Government has stepped in to underwrite low cost loans for business.  These State-backed loans are working well and 10,000 SMEs have availed of the &euro;2 billion Covid credit guarantee scheme.  To assist the wider business sector with liquidity and to invest in energy efficiency, we are introducing a &euro;1.2 billion State-backed Ukraine credit guarantee scheme.  This will provide low-cost working capital to SMEs and primary producers, including farmers and fishermen.  We are also going to make &euro;500 million worth of growth, sustainability and investment loans available to SMEs, including farmers and fishermen.  This will be the successor to the future growth loan scheme.  These will be long-term low-cost loans and a minimum of 30% of the lending volume must be targeted towards environmental sustainability purposes with the aim of helping SMEs to invest in sustainability and energy efficiency and lower their carbon footprints.  </p> <p> We are also allocating an additional &euro;4 million in funding to the local enterprise offices to include a new grant for microenterprises for energy efficiency.  The small firms investment in energy efficiency scheme will provide a grant to companies to encourage capital investment in projects to reduce carbon emissions.  Many of our schemes to date focus on energy audits, better information and consultancy, but this one is cash towards the cost of investment; it is capital.</p> <p> I am pleased to see many of my Department&rsquo;s tax objectives announced by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in the budget.  These will help to promote entrepreneurship, innovation and job creation, as well as helping with the cost of living.</p> <p> On top of the five energy measures I mentioned, there are a further ten actions making up a 15-point plan for business.  A substantial income tax cut will mean one can earn up to &euro;40,000, or &euro;80,000 for a two-income couple, before having to pay income tax at the higher rate.  This will increase take-home pay and will help with consumer confidence and demand.  It is a good basis for the Government to build on in future budgets.  We are introducing improvements to the research and development tax credit so smaller companies can get cash more quickly.  There will be a four-year extension of the knowledge development box to encourage companies to develop intellectual property, IP, in Ireland.  There are several improvements to the key employee engagement programme, KEEP, share option programme to help companies reward and hold onto staff.  There will be an extension of the special assignee relief programme, SARP, to attract more highly skilled jobs to Ireland.  Section 481 film relief will be extended to 2028 in order to stimulate the creation of indigenous films in the State, and other forms of production.  The small benefit exemption will be doubled so employers can give up to &euro;1,000 in vouchers or gifts to employees each year.  The 50% reduction in the excise on special exemption orders will help businesses in the night-time economy.  There will be an excise relief scheme for small cider and perry producers, as well as improvements to microbrewery relief to assist our indigenous drinks industry.  There will also be a VAT reduction for newspapers and news periodicals, including digital editions, from 9% to being zero-rated.</p> <p> Turning to my own Department&rsquo;s Vote, budget 2023 increased our gross allocation to &euro;940 million, representing a &euro;36 million increase.  Core current funding will increase by &euro;13 million or 3.6%.  This extra funding for the Department and its agencies, including Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the local enterprise offices, means we can maintain quick turnaround times on employment permits, help companies with the twin transition, digital and green, and create more jobs in all parts of Ireland, particularly through the IDA's regional property programme.  Core capital funding of &euro;514 million represents an increase of 4% or &euro;20 million on our 2022 core capital allocation.  The capital programmes funded by my Department have been crucial to the success of our agencies in maintaining and indeed growing our enterprise base, creating record numbers of new jobs.  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s enhanced budget will allow it to further progress the development of the advanced manufacturing centre and the National Institute for Bioprocessing Research and Training, NIBRT.</p> <p> Additional capital funding is being provided to Enterprise Ireland to bolster the green transition fund, which incentivises businesses to install energy metering systems and facilitates investment in low-carbon, energy efficient equipment and processes.  The funding for Enterprise Ireland's digital transition fund will also be increased to help more businesses to go online, export, use digital technologies to reach new markets and improve their productivity and competitiveness. </p> <p> As the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, said yesterday, the pace of growth in the economy is expected to slow throughout the rest of this year as mounting inflation and higher interest rates bite.  Negative sentiment might see firms hold back on investment and, as a result, the Department of Finance has revised downwards its forecast for modified domestic demand, the most appropriate measure of our domestic economy, to 1.25% for next year.  For that reason, a counter-cyclical response is warranted but, crucially, we will not empty the tank now.  We will keep resources in reserve so we can respond as the situation develops and prepare the country for future shocks.</p> <p> We are directing &euro;2 billion into the national reserve fund in 2022, and &euro;4 billion in 2023.  It means we will have banked a large share of the additional corporate tax revenues, will have ensured they do not fund permanent expenditure commitments and will have supplied the Exchequer with additional firepower to respond to challenges over the years ahead.</p> <p> I believe this budget should help restore confidence in the economy.  It is a big package but it is being financed by a strong economy with businesses doing well and a record 2.55 million people in employment.  It is not being funded through borrowing, unlike in many countries, and we are putting money aside because nobody can predict how long this cost of living and energy crisis is going to go on for.</p> <p> I want to comment briefly on the proposals coming from the other side of the House.  The Opposition had written their speeches well before yesterday&rsquo;s budget was announced.  It was the usual replies.  The Opposition said it was not enough, they were not the right measures and did not provide enough certainty.  We know what the Opposition's plans are.  Sinn F&eacute;in would lump taxes on ordinary families by stealth by not adjusting income tax for inflation or earnings.  Put simply, a two-income couple each earning about &euro;40,000 would pay more than &euro;2,000 in tax under Sinn F&eacute;in than under this Government, if one considers the combined effect of the income tax reductions in this budget and last year's budget.  Sinn F&eacute;in would also increase tax on inheriting the family home or a family business.  It would not renew the help-to-buy scheme, which is worth up to &euro;30,000 and has helped over 35,000 first-time buyers and couples buy or build their own homes.  It is encouraging that 15,000 first-time buyers bought their first home in the past year.  That is a 15-year high, and I want that figure to go much higher.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in also proposes four separate taxes worth &euro;1.15 billion on higher income earners, including employers&rsquo; PRSI, a direct tax on jobs and a new rate of income tax.  This would reduce foreign investment in growing sectors like pharma and ICT.  Wealth, skills, investment and jobs would go elsewhere.  The cake would shrink under Sinn F&eacute;in and there would be less for everyone.  Rather than writing blank cheques for energy companies and emptying the tank now, we are planning for the uncertainty ahead, as every good budget should, by keeping some money in reserve.</p> <p> The main objective of this budget is to put more money in people&rsquo;s pockets and reduce the bills they have to pay.  For any household budget, there are three elements.  There is what the household gets paid, how much it gets to keep after taxes and how far the money goes.  We are trying to help on all three fronts.  We are ensuring incomes rise where we have influence, through the increase in the national minimum wage, the public sector pay deal, increases for pensioners and for people in receipt of welfare payments, such as carers and people with disabilities.  We are reducing income tax so people get to keep more of the money they earned in the first place.  We are making people's money go further by helping with some of the costs of living by reducing the costs of childcare, healthcare and the cost of putting a child through school or college.  Long before this inflation crisis, many of those costs were too high in Ireland and out of kilter with European norms.  Now is an opportunity to change that.  These actions should be seen as part of a comprehensive anti-inflation strategy.  These are not one-offs but are recurring measures.</p> <p> Reducing the cost of childcare and extending early education will have wider benefits beyond improving household budgets for young families.  It will improve the labour market by enabling more people to enter the workforce.  It will advance equality for women.  It is a pro-family measure in what was a very pro-family budget.  It will improve educational outcomes for children because childcare is not just about caring for a child but is also about early education.  These measures help now but they will also help in the long term.  </p> <p> I believe this budget strikes the right balance between helping people in the short term and preparing us for an uncertain future.</p> <p>I commend the budget to the House.</p></speech>

T&aacute; an buis&eacute;ad ag iarraidh an d&uacute;shl&aacute;n seo a r&eacute;iteach do gach duine.  Budget 2023 has come at an incredibly challenging time for families and business, as a significant cost-of-living and cost-of-business challenge related to the war in Ukraine is hitting every corner of our country.  This budget places a strong focus in ensuring that our SMEs and the multinationals that invest and employ many hundreds of thousands of our citizens and that help to support our economy through difficult times, are supported now and can continue to thrive by addressing the cost of energy in doing business, particularly for small businesses; promoting balanced regional enterprise through increased investment in trade promotion; and, crucially, supporting business to embrace the opportunities of digitalisation and green initiatives in order that they can seize new opportunities and future-proof our economy.</p>  <p>  A competitive, innovative and resilient enterprise base is essential to providing high-quality jobs and employment opportunities for people to live and prosper in all regions of our island.  Businesses can harness digital technologies in many different ways, including to better understand their customers, reduce business costs and improve products.  An additional &euro;6 million has been allocated to the digital transition fund for 2023 and a further &euro;3 million to the four European digital innovation hubs in our nomenclature of territorial units for statistics, NUTS, regions to help drive the digital transformation of SMEs, the public service and the economy more widely.  The T&aacute;naiste gave details of the small firms investment in energy efficiency scheme, which is getting an additional &euro;4 million in funding in 2023 through the network of local enterprise offices throughout the country.  This will also be supported by the growth and sustainability loan scheme, with its emphasis on green and sustainable investments, which is making up to &euro;500 million available in low-cost investment loans of up to ten years to SMEs, with no collateral required for loans up to &euro;500,000.</p>  <p>  Our future success continues to be predicated on balanced regional enterprise, which is key to trade promotion and development.  That is why we are continuing to fund IDA Ireland's regional property programme, which encourages and facilitates regional investment by ensuring that suitable properties are in place to meet the needs of multinational firms.  This year, we have allocated &euro;60 million for the IDA's property budget, which is an increase of &euro;4 million on 2022.  This reflects the continuing priority of job creation and economic growth to this Government.  It specifically allows for further expansion of the IDA's regional property programme, the completion of buildings in Dundalk, Carlow, Limerick, Waterford and Athlone, and will contribute to the commencement of buildings in Sligo, Cavan, Galway, Letterkenny, Mullingar, Drogheda, Longford, Tralee, Oranmore and Castlebar.  The regional property programme will also see 19 advanced building solutions delivered in regional locations throughout Ireland during the lifetime of the IDA's current strategy, which now includes three completed facilities in Monaghan, Sligo and Limerick.  T&aacute; an m&eacute;ad&uacute; go &euro;14.450 milli&uacute;n d&rsquo;&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, an leithdh&aacute;ileadh caipitil ioml&aacute;n don &uacute;dar&aacute;s a fuaireamar anuraidh, coinnithe sa bhunl&iacute;ne don bhliain seo chugainn.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin t&aacute;bhachtach do bhuis&eacute;ad caipitil an &uacute;dar&aacute;is.</p>  <p>  We have greatly empowered the powers of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, this year to tackle cartels, bid-rigging in public procurement and anti-competitive practices and mergers.  The Consumer Rights Bill will also bring much-needed reform to consumer legislation.  The ongoing cost-of-living challenge means it is imperative to reassure consumers that their rights will be upheld so they are able to get the best value for money and be protected from misleading and unfair commercial practices.  Therefore, the CCPC will be allocated an additional &euro;1 million, which represents a 5.8% increase on last year.  The CCPC has received Exchequer funding increases of 71% since 2019, which demonstrates the significant priority the Government places on protecting consumers.  Budget 2023 will also increase the Corporate Enforcement Authority, CEA, budget by a further &euro;770,000.  In advance of the authority's establishment, we increased its predecessor budget by &euro;1.7 million, or 28%, from 2020 to 2022.  The proposed increase in the CEA budget for 2023 signals our continued commitment to ensuring it can perform and deliver on its statutory mandate.</p>  <p>  Aside from the budget measures announced yesterday to address the high cost of doing business, the ongoing work on these costs continues.  Deputies will be aware of ongoing reform agenda regarding the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  The Government will enact the Personal Injuries Resolution Board Bill by year end, beginning next week.  This will enable more claimants and respondents to avail of an enhanced service but, crucially, to also have their claims resolved through mediation, thereby reducing the need to go to court.  Increasing the number of claims settled through this enhanced process will reduce the cost and time involved in injury claims and impact positively on the cost and availability of insurance, which is vital for so many groups throughout the country and is a key priority for this Government.</p>  <p>  This budget is positive.  It supports digital transformation, trade promotion and company regulation.  It will support our businesses and help to protect consumers.  It will help to ensure that companies are regulated to the highest standards.  It will further generate and support jobs in our economy and provide important support structures for businesses, small and large, through these difficult days. </p></speech>

We are investing in innovation through all our business development agencies, such as IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and our local enterprise offices, which are working with our businesses to drive that ambition and the opportunity for Ireland.  We are continually investing in all that.  The continuous investment that took place through the various Departments has made that happen.</p>  <p>  We are also protecting our older generation who worked hard for this country for many years to help us be in a strong position.  We are giving them reassurances that we will get through the next five or six months, which might be difficult because of the price of energy.  We can deal with the anxiety and worry they have had for a long number of months as we look towards the winter.  I am glad we are able to deal with the budget early this year in order to be able to give that reassurance and confidence, not just to business owners who we will stand with through giving them business opportunities in the months ahead, but to those who are trying to manage their budgets at home.  In my view, because of much of the commentary, such people have unnecessary fears.  The Government through all its Departments will help people through this difficult time.  Yesterday's budget confirms that and gives us the resources to do that.</p>  <p>  I compliment all involved on the fact that we are in a strong position that allowed us come to the House yesterday to announce a budget of more than &euro;90 billion.  For a country the size of Ireland, that is an achievement.  Having come through the Covid pandemic and Brexit, and on the back of a financial crisis years ago, to be in the strong position of announcing that budget of &euro;90 billion yesterday, with an additional package of more than &euro;11 billion, is something we should be proud of.  While we will argue over different parts and pieces of it in the House, as a country we should recognise that is a positive place to be in and is something we can build on for the future.</p>  <p>  I listen to an awful lot of negativity about the future for our young people.  In many cases, they are coming home to live in this country, to contribute, and to take up some of the many jobs that are offer.  There are 2.5 million people at work.  There is a lot of opportunity here.  We are the first to admit on this side of the House that there are still challenges, mainly in housing and health, but we are working through them.  There are plans in place to deal with them.  This budget proves to me that this country is full of hope.  There are immense opportunities and possibilities for people of all ages to play a part in that.</p>  <p>  Through this budget, we are backing small and medium businesses by helping companies that employ more than 1 million people throughout the country with their energy bills this winter.  The T&aacute;naiste went through some of the schemes that are key to making that happen.  The most important of those is the temporary business energy support scheme.  That is a scheme that will really get behind businesses to guide them through a difficult period ahead and, again, deal with those concerns and worries.  We know and recognise that businesses have high energy bills.  This scheme puts them in a place to be able to deal with approximately 40% of those additional costs.  Other schemes that are in place to help them reduce their energy bills put them on a strong footing to get through difficult times ahead.  It will not be easy but through everybody playing their part, we can deal with that as well.  Budget 2023 is about helping them to deal with the big challenges they face - I touched on this yesterday - that they have asked the Government and this Department to help them work with.  I have touched on energy and energy costs, which undoubtedly are the number one issues.</p> <p> Business costs are increasing due to supply chain issues coming out of the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine.  Labour shortages are a major issue.  All of the supports we talked about yesterday are efforts to make this a job-friendly budget and to encourage as many as possible to take up a job and realise that work does pay.  We will make changes to the various tax measures across the board and to the various supports for people returning to work from unemployment.  Work does and will pay and we will continue to prove that case.</p> <p> As the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, touched on, we are also assisting a number of businesses on their digital journey and, more importantly, on their green journey.  All of our agencies have been working with businesses over recent years to plan out that green journey and to complete their audits and assessments.  That is now backed up with new supports and new schemes allowing businesses to invest in the infrastructure they need to continue on that green journey.  Again, this puts businesses on a sustainable footing.  That does two things.  It reduces businesses' costs and allows them to play their part in tackling climate change and reducing emissions.  We are also doing this because customers now expect our companies to go green.  The markets we feed into all over Europe and beyond expect us to show that we have a greener product.  We recognise that and, as a Department, we have been working with companies of all shapes and sizes over recent years to do that.  We will continue to do that work.  The digital journey is also really important.  In many cases, they go hand in hand.  The technology, science, engineering and skills that are now available help us on both these journeys.  We want to continue to build on that.</p> <p> It is important to recognise the crossover between enterprise and education.  Since 2014, we have been driving an agenda of reform in our education system that is very much enterprise-based and responsive to the needs of enterprise and to all other aspects of education.  We are now seeing the results of that in that we have people available to take up these 2.5 million jobs.  Businesses are asking us to continue that investment and to work with them to develop talent for the future and to upskill their existing workforces.  I touched on this yesterday.  The money is set aside across three key Departments for the further education and training concept, higher education, colleges, development following second level education, enterprise and social protection.  Three or four Departments are working together to work with businesses to put supports in place through the education and training boards, Skillnet and the technological universities to train up people already in jobs and to develop the skills we need for the future.  That is key.  I will repeat that this will only work if we all play our part.  Government and businesses must work together to develop talent for the future.</p> <p> We are also investing an additional &euro;4 million in our local enterprise offices.  I have been around the country over the last 18 months meeting the teams in these local enterprise offices directly.  They helped and assisted an awful lot of businesses through difficult times during the Covid pandemic.  We recognise their value, the number of microcompanies and small companies they are working with and the importance of investing in that sector.  This budget does that.  It gives extra money to local enterprise offices to continue that great work.  There is also finance in the budget to develop, with local enterprise offices and Enterprise Ireland, a new framework for dealing with companies who have just over ten employees or whose staff numbers can move up and down between seven or eight and ten or 15.  We now have funding to develop a framework and ensure we get the right impact from our business employment agencies like Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices.  There is extra funding to support the green transition fund that Enterprise Ireland operates.</p> <p> I chair the retail forum and know that this budget sets aside the resources we need.  The big ask of those in the retail sector is that they be allowed to compete and be given the ability to deal with their cost bases.  The energy supports in this budget will enable our retail sector to continue to thrive and compete.  Naturally, through the retail forum, we will also promote the climate toolkit for business, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's energy audit for SMEs, the accelerated capital allowances and the Green for Micro programme.  A key part of this budget is help for our retail sector to reach new markets.  We are doing that through online trading.  The trading online vouchers were a great success during the Covid pandemic.  We will continue that work.  The online retail scheme operated through Enterprise Ireland over recent years has been extremely successful.  It is being reviewed by the various Departments at the moment.  I am confident the review will show it has been successful and that we will be in a position to provide for more rounds next year.  Again, what are we trying to achieve here?  We recognise that the retail sector employs more than 300,000 people in positions in every county and region.  There is a lot of potential there because 70% of online business still goes to overseas companies.  We want to win that back and we will support our retailers to do that.  We also recognise that, with close to 1 million extra people set to be living in this country in 15 or 16 years, there is potential for more customers.</p> <p> We want to continue to invest in our town centres, our retail spaces and the experience we can offer throughout our villages, towns and cities throughout the country.  Town centre teams have been set up through the Department Rural and Community Development.  In conjunction with the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Housing, Local Government and Heritage, we will make that happen.  We value that as well.</p> <p> I also want to highlight Ireland's investment in the European Space Agency.  We are often asked in here why we are making this investment.  With the extra &euro;1.5 million allocated yesterday, we will invest close to &euro;24 million in the European Space Agency on behalf of Irish companies that then win contracts, creating jobs and driving innovation in technologies that are not just of use in space, but in many sectors.  Since 2017, we have seen an increase of 50% in the number of companies winning contracts with the agency.  More than 100 companies are now winning for Ireland in that space.</p> <p> The regional enterprise funds were touched on.  I hope that, in the coming months and through Enterprise Ireland, the T&aacute;naiste will be able to launch the next round of regional enterprise funding.  We hope a regional enterprise development fund of &euro;30 million will be opened.  The commitment is to spend more than &euro;140 million through that fund over the coming years.  It is important to get it open this year so that we can back initiatives in our regions to drive community enterprise facilities and our enterprise agenda.  I touched on the importance of enterprise in education.  One story of success with the regional enterprise development fund relates to an advance manufacturing facility in Dundalk.  This benefited from various funds administered through our Department and more money was put into these yesterday.  That is driving the future of manufacturing in this country.  Young people are being brought into that facility every day to let them see what the manufacturing of the future is about.  Again, it is about growing talent and future-proofing the country.  That is what we want to invest in.</p> <p> I will address two other areas under my Department.  I am confident that the money has been secured to fund the Health and Safety Authority and all the work it does for the year ahead.  It is really important that we try to protect everybody at work.  That is what the authority is about.  It protects people at work through working hand in hand with business to develop that culture and, more importantly, working with the agricultural community in respect of farm safety.</p> <p> The Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, plays a vital role in Irish society in delivering fair and compliant workplaces and the non-discriminatory delivery of services.  Our Department is committed to ensuring that adequate resourcing is provided to the WRC.  This budget does that.  I am proud of the work the WRC does to protect the workers in our country.</p> <p> The last thing I will touch on is the importance of working with the business community on the issue of labour shortages.  I have touched on this but resources are provided in this budget across a number of Departments to make sure we are in a position to work with businesses to make sure they have the skills and labour they need well into the future.  Doing that is also key.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-28a.296" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092800021#T00200"><p>This Government has three central goals.  We need to provide affordable housing for our people, we need to deliver health reform and we need to accelerate climate action.  We have to stick to that course and focus on those three tasks while also managing an energy crisis that arrived on our shores in a way that no one could have expected.  Energy is being used as a weapon of war and that has affected and changed everything.  This has become the issue we need to urgently address.  We have to make sure that we address this immediate crisis in a way that helps keep us on course in delivering housing, reforming public service and tackling climate change.  I believe this budget helps us, as a country, to do that.  Looking back at the formation of it over recent months, it seems to me that there are seven key strategic aspects that we needed to take into account, which we did.</p>  <p>  The first strategy of Government, even before we began to form this budget, was to recognise that, in this cost-of-living crisis and inflationary period, we could try to reduce the cost of public services.  We could put money back in our people's pockets through things we have control over.  We cannot easily control some of the international factors but we can address some of the cost-of-living factors here at home.  We are now doing that.  In that context, the 25% reduction in childcare fees is of great significance and importance.  The way these changes were thought through and designed as a two-year strategy means that the conditions are in place to improve workers' pay and conditions and to make sure that suppliers have the opportunity to meet the needs and to then bring in a significant cut in the cost that we know will go to the hundreds of thousands of parents for whom this is an everyday cost.  The thinking in respect of delivering reductions in public transport fares is the same.  There is a reduction of 20% for everyone and 50% and for those under 24.  This latter cut is expanding as we speak.  We expanded it to younger people and night-time services last week.  It is important that we do so while also expanding public transport provision, which is what our budget provision allows us to do.</p> <p> Significant investment in PSO services is another example where we cut the costs for people at a time when that is what we needed to do.  Every family will know about the costs faced by young families with children in primary school.  It is a small thing but that cost hits every September and now it is being covered for next September.  It is similar for families with people in university and third level.  That is a tough time for families and we are again reducing the cost there at this particular time.  That is really important.  We will go further.  There is a scheme to put photovoltaic, PV, panels on every school roof in order that schools can start cutting some of their bills, not just families and individuals.  We have tackled inflation at source where we could.</p> <p> The second thing is that this budget had to be progressive.  For all the budgets introduced by this Government, our first test has been whether they were progressive.  Based on independent economic analysis, we are helping those on the lowest incomes.  It will never be materially the same as someone on the top in terms of the actual gain but if we do this year in, year out, and progressively benefit those on lower incomes, that will help us bring progressivity into our system.  This budget does that, not just in the &euro;12 increase but the other long-term measures like the increases in the working family payment, the qualified child allowance and the domiciliary care allowance.  I could go on.  Critically, there is also a significant tranche of one-off payments, particularly this autumn, including the Christmas bonus double payment and so on.  We learned a lesson in the Covid crisis that giving cash to people in difficult circumstances in this way does work.  The pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, did that.  All the analysis showed that such an immediate injection of cash at the correct time matters.  The best way of addressing poverty is giving people funds, particularly at this difficult time, and this budget did it at scale.</p> <p> The third principle is that we have to be responsible with the public finances.  Sinn F&eacute;in says, rightly, that people want and need certainty.  The first certainty they need is that the Government is not going to break the books or put us in a situation where we cannot afford what we might want to do and where there is not a reserve that we can turn to.  We cannot have open-ended blank cheques or uncertain mechanisms the payment of which people cannot be certain about.  We have produced a budget in a way that is ambitious in progressivity and tackling inflation but without the uncertainty that we cannot pay for it.  We had to ask the economic question of whether we would be adding to inflationary woes here and I believe the judgment call in this regard is right and that the &euro;11 billion package is the right one.  Even though this budget is large, we are going into a period this winter where there will be significant deflationary pressures as money has to go on paying very high energy bills and as interest rates go up.  It is, therefore, appropriate.  There may be some economists out there, although I do not think there are many, who will say this is not the time for putting money into the economy.  I disagree.  What we are doing is responsible and it is responsible that I back that up.  The National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, announced this morning that it will not be borrowing further this year because it is fully financed.  In a world of real uncertainty, where bond yields, etc., are shooting up in different directions in neighbouring countries - we do not have to look too far to see that - that certainty is a real strength to our country and our people.</p> <p> It was also important that we give certainty to our businesses to make sure they can get through this exceptionally difficult period.  I am very proud of the work the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications has done with the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment on those business supports, which are vital.  It is responsible that we help keep jobs because that is the fundamental area where certainty is needed to get through a difficult period.</p> <p> The fourth of the seven principles we have to apply is that we do not leave people behind.  We need to try to make things universal because everyone is going to be affected.  It is not easy with targeted social welfare models, using the likes of the working family payment and others, which are good ways of addressing areas of acute poverty.  It is right for us to apply the energy credit in a universal way because there will be people in different circumstances.  Every family is in different circumstances and it is appropriate for us to help them.  The increase in the child benefit and the home carers allowance recognises that every family has different circumstances.  Every family has to raise their children whatever way is best for them and I believe the likes of those child benefit payments are the right way of leaving the choice with the families as to how they work their way through this.  We cannot be judgmental.  We have to cater for every different type of need.  That universal element in what we have done is hugely important.  </p> <p> Fifth, this is at its core an energy crisis caused by our dependence on fossil fuels.  We have to make sure we use this moment to pivot, not just to address the immediate cost-of-living crisis but to allow us to accelerate decarbonisation and the development of our own natural resources.  That is the best long-term security and certainty we can bring to our people.  This budget, along with the two previous ones, is doing that at scale.  In agriculture, we have provided &euro;500 million for agri-environment schemes.  That is an additional &euro;200 million, allowing 30,000 new farmers to participate in them next year.  There is a 12% increase in the forestry budget because we need to scale that up at speed.  There is an 80% increase in funding for organic farming.  This will be beneficial because there are high prices not just for fossil fuels in transport or energy but in the cost of fertilisers.  Allowing our farmers to reduce that cost base but increasing or maintaining output, which is what happened this year, is a fundamental change that is occurring and it is being supported by this budget.</p> <p> The protection of the natural world as we make the energy transition is key.  There is an 83% increase in funding for nature protection over the three budgets this Government has introduced.  That is hugely beneficial right across the country.  With regard to the circular economy, the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, will be introducing a range of measures this year and next year that will help cut the cost by reducing waste and increasing recycling.  That is supported in this budget.</p> <p> Critically, regarding energy, which is the source and core of the problem, I will go to Brussels on Friday.  I talked to the Commission again yesterday and I am confident that we will be able to get mechanisms whereby we can address the windfall profits that need to be brought back to help our people.  We will do that with Europe and within the European system because at the centre of this war is a desire by the Russian Government to divide Europe.  We will work closely with the Commission in getting the measures right for us here at home but we will do it as part of a united European approach.  When it comes to market reform, it would be easy to say the whole market can be completely altered with just a stroke of the pen.  Which market should we change - the intraday market or the forward market?  We could do that with a switch and find ourselves causing more problems than we would solve.  We will work with the European Commission on the reform of the electricity and gas markets but we will do so in a co-ordinated way, recognising the complexity of the matter.  We need to get this right in order that investment continues to flow into our country to support the energy transition.  That is happening.  It is happening in offshore wind, in the solar revolution that has started and in retrofitting, which is the best way to protect our people.  It is scaling up in a predictable, reliable and certain way every year.  The budget has gone from about &euro;300 million last year to &euro;500 million next year and will go up again the following year because of the funding mechanisms we have put in place.  That is working.  It is happening.  It is what Irish households want to do and they are doing it at speed and at scale.</p> <p> The sixth principle is one of the most important.  Whatever we are doing now in this budget and elsewhere, we have to strengthen democracy, including our own democracy.  This is in essence a war between a democratic view of the system and an autocratic one.  The front line in that is not just the energy war but a war of disinformation.  It is a war that is using social media and other networks to present simplistic, divisive, populist and nationalist solutions that are not going to work.  To counter that, to inform our people and strengthen our democracy, we need a powerful and strong media.  We need questioning journalism.</p> <p>That is delivered in this budget.  The recommendation of the Future of Media Commission for a 0% VAT rate to help our media outlets has been introduced.  We are funding RT&Eacute; with the &euro;15 million that the commission report recommended.  We are funding TG4, including children's programmes.</p> <p> We are not just investing in the media but in the arts too.  The arts can question what is happening in society, including the Government and every holy cow.  Having a strong arts culture and community is extremely important for a questioning democracy, which is what we seek to be.  My colleague, the Minister for  Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, delivered on that in spades in the budget yesterday.  She protected the money going to the Arts Council and provided new funding supports.</p> <p> The hardest test for our democracy will be how we manage taking in people from Ukraine.  This is not easy.  We all know that communities right across the country are under stress.  They are under stress from their own housing needs and it is hard if more people are coming in, but we have a duty to do that to the best of our ability.  This budget backs up the supports and provides funding, as it had from the start.  There was no question about it.  From the Taoiseach's first meeting with the European Council in Avignon, we said we stand on the democratic side and will do whatever we can, not sending weapons but every other support that we can.  That is an important part of the response.</p> <p> One of the most important elements of the budget for me, which perhaps does not grab the headlines or seem that significant, is the investment that we, as a small island, are making in overseas development aid.  There is a 17% increase to &euro;1.2 billion.  There is an additional &euro;30 million to address the immediate crisis caused by climate change in the Horn of Africa and additional &euro;10 million from my own Department for climate finance.  We will follow up on what we said at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP26, in Glasgow, in a world which is full of division, doubt and a breakdown of international order.  It benefits us to recognise that we, as a relatively wealthy country by any measure or metric, have a responsibility to help the poorest.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney, getting that funding was significant for the sense of the strength of our democracy.</p> <p> A principle in setting the budget is trust.  How can people feel trust in their Government and the State if the Government does not have trust within its own corridors?  This has been a difficult budget process.  It is not easy.  All three parties and the Independents who support us have different political perspectives.  It comes through every day.  There are different cultures, views and approaches.  In devising this budget, as with everything else we have done in the last two years, my sense, along with my colleagues, is a sense of trust that the information they provide is correct and honest and, to the best of their knowledge, it is the latest information.  When one trusts that information coming from colleagues, it allows decisions to be made quickly.  One does not have to second guess the motive or double down in the face of opposition, but instead one can find solutions.  This Government is functioning with that trust between three parties.  That is important during this time of crisis.</p> <p> From my perspective, I trust the public service and the Civil Service in the way they serve the State.  They have to be part of that trust arrangement in order that we and they can make decisions quickly.  We make mistakes in the public service and the political system, but, at the heart of our country, in our democratic republican system, we have structures, including the Seanad, D&aacute;il and the public service, which serve the Irish people.  Those structures are not always right and they make mistakes, but we hold people to account and listen to the Opposition.  That is my experience in delivering this budget.</p> <p> There is no point in having trust unless we deliver.  We need to focus on delivering what is promised in the budget.  We know that we, as a State, will have to step up to do much more to deliver housing at the required scale and speed.  We are committed to doing that.  We realise that we cannot just increase the health budget every year but that we also have to start to work within budgets to make sure we get the most out of them.  As the Minister of State, Deputy English, said with regard to the digital revolution, we need innovation in our public service in order to get the best from what we have.</p> <p> We will deliver in respect of climate.  We will deliver on turning this country around in order that we can rely on and have our own power.  The latter will ensure that we will not be held to ransom.  It will also ensure that we will create employment, as well as playing our part in protecting the global environment and our local environment.</p> <p> This budget gives us a mandate to deliver in all the different areas for next year.  Some commentators said there are many different elements.  That is the nature of government.  We have to address every sector and provide for every person as well as we can.  This budget does that.  We now need to sit down and start to make sure that we deliver.</p></speech>

The challenges households face are reminiscent of those that people faced in the late 1970s and the 1980s.  Families find it very hard to make it to the end of the week.  Soaring energy bills and motor fuel costs, extortionate rents and sharp increases in the price of food have combined to create a perfect storm for workers and families.  It is true to say that even having a full-time job does not allow workers to meet the cost of getting by or prevent a slide towards poverty.</p>  <p>  Russia&rsquo;s criminal invasion of Ukraine has added fuel to the fire, but it must be said that it is the responsibility of Government to shield people here from the sharpest edges of the crisis.  For the past 18 months, this Government refused and failed to come up to the mark in that regard.  Everyone understands that the Government cannot do everything, but it could have done more.  There is no doubt that the decisions and choices made by the Government have made things even harder for households dealing with the biggest squeeze on income for 40 years.</p>  <p>  The cost-of-living shock has served to compound the real-life problems brought on by a generation-defining crisis in housing and by a healthcare system that is persistently overcrowded, under-resourced and creaking at the seams.  In Ireland today, the very basics of a dignified life are denied to so many people, including a roof over their heads that is secure and affordable, access to hospital when they need treatment and the right to retire from work at 65 with a fair pension if they wish.  Now, working parents worry that they will not be able to put food on the table for their children.  All of this is a result of bad policies implemented by successive Governments that have refused to put workers and families first.</p>  <p>  This budget represented a real opportunity for Government to turn away from those bad policies.  This should and could have been a watershed budget and a budget to turn the tide.  The quantum of money available provided a chance to make better choices that would have made a real difference in the lives of workers and families.  There is no doubt that the Government has huge financial resources, but the reality is that this budget does not invest those resources in the right way.  It could and should have been a budget prioritising those on low and middle incomes and the generation of young people locked out of opportunity.  It could have been a budget that really tackled the cost-of-living crisis and that provided households with help and certainty to get through the winter.  It could have been a budget that builds for the future by kick-starting the delivery of the housing and healthcare that is needed.  That is the type of budget that Sinn F&eacute;in would have delivered yesterday.</p></speech>

It entirely misses the big picture.  It has no answers to the big questions in housing, health and in the cost of living.  It shows that the Government is not prepared to do what must be done to protect households really in the here and now and that it has no plan for a future in which all of our people have good and secure lives.</p> <p>When we look beyond the trumpeting of billions and the splash headlines, we see there is no change of direction from the Government.  What we get, draped in the clothes of a so-called giveaway budget, is another rehash of the policies that have failed for the past 20 years.  The Government spends so much to achieve so very little.  When the dust settles, people will see a budget with no real vision, no real ambition and no real appetite to deliver change.  Instead of backing workers, families and young people by tackling the big structural issues that affect their lives, this Government has done what it always does.  It has splashed the cash and talked up a big game but nothing is really going to change after this budget.<br/><br/>Here are the hard facts.  We had a housing crisis before this budget.  We have a housing crisis after it.  We had a two-tier health service and outrageous waiting lists before this budget.  We have a two-tier health service and outrageous waiting lists after it.  Households were hit with scandalous hikes in energy bills before this budget.  Households will be hit with hikes in energy bills after this budget.  Those on low and middle incomes struggled to make their pay packets stretch before this budget, and they will struggle after this budget too.  The most serious criticism of this budget is that it provides no visible route out of these crises and makes no long-term difference to people&rsquo;s lives.<br/><br/>N&iacute;or thug an ch&aacute;inaisn&eacute;is seo an chinnteacht a bh&iacute; ag teast&aacute;il ag daoine.

The Government presents its budget.  The Opposition responds.  Broadcasters broadcast their analysis.  Pages of newspapers are filled with reaction, and rightly so.  Amid all the political theatre, we must remember that the choices made by the Government in the budget shape the lives of ordinary people.  I want to speak about one of those lives, who is a young man I met on Monday.  He is 27 years old.  He is emigrating.  He and his girlfriend bought their plane tickets to Canada four weeks ago.  He does not want to go, but feels he has no other choice.  He believes that leaving gives him the best opportunity to build a good life.  Here is what he told me.<br/><br/>He told me he always does his best.  He really thought that if he did all the right things, he would be able to get on, so that is what he did.  He paid attention in school, went to college, studied hard and graduated.  He did a bit of travelling after college, but never, ever did he think he would look to leave Ireland for the long term.  Despite working so hard, he says he is just not able to make it.  He described a feeling like being on a hamster wheel, running faster and faster but getting nowhere.  There is no chance of saving for a house, never mind owning one.  He is barely making the rent each month and is being fleeced by big bills.  He told me his poor mother is beside herself.  She does not want him to go, but she knows it is what he needs to do.  He feels so badly let down.  He said something that really got to me and it is the reason I am telling this story.  He asked:</p><blockquote>	What was the point in doing all the right things and doing my best?  My parents worked hard to give me a good start and now I have to leave to make something of myself.  Even though I know it&rsquo;s not my fault, I feel like I&rsquo;ve let down my Mam and Dad.  It&rsquo;s an awful feeling to carry around.  But the truth is that the odds are stacked against my generation.  Those that can make a difference just don't listen.  I'm twenty-seven and I'm exhausted by it all. </blockquote> <p>That is his story and, sadly, it is not unique to him in the Ireland of 2022.  I do not know about the Taoiseach, but for me it is a damning indictment of Government that the spectre of forced emigration is now back with us.  Our young people look again to the airports for the prospect of a life in Boston, Toronto, or Perth and a life away from their family, friends, and the communities they love.  No matter how hard they work, even though they do all the right things, they cannot build a good life at home.  The sad truth is that as Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael passed power between themselves for a century, forced emigration has been regarded almost as a right of passage for our young people.  I imagine the young man I spoke to on Monday will have tuned into the budget announcement and to the debate, probably looking for a sign of a change of direction.  He will certainly have been looking for hope.  Will he find what he is looking for in this budget?  Will he find that hope?  Will he find that much-needed change of direction from Government?  The straight answer to that is &quot;No&quot;.  The truth is there is nothing in this budget that would make him want to stay.<br/><br/>I put it to the Taoiseach that one of the things forcing that young man to emigrate is housing.  It has defined life in this country for over a decade.  This Government came to office in June 2020 saying it would fix housing.  The Taoiseach himself claims it is the single most important social issue for this Coalition.  Yet in this budget, as with all the Government's housing initiatives, all we get is a recycling of the policies that got us into this mess.  These are policies that feather the nests of big developers, corporate landlords and wealthy investors to the detriment of those in housing need.<br/><br/>This Government went two and a half years without doing anything for renters.  The average rent in Dublin is more than &euro;2,000 per month.  Across the State it stands at close to &euro;1,500.  The Taoiseach knows all of this.  I have told him repeatedly that the Government must do two things.  First, it must cut rents by putting a month&rsquo;s rent back into renters pockets through a refundable tax credit and, second, ban rent increases for three years.  The Taoiseach and all the Ministers have consistently ignored these calls.  Now, in the budget they show up with &euro;500.  This &euro;500 will be swallowed up by the inevitable hikes in rent that will no doubt come and which the Government refuses to prevent.  This is a tax credit that excludes students and low-income workers.  The Government's refusal to cut rents adequately and to ban rent increases confirms this Government does not really care about renters and that they are, at best, an afterthought.  Let me say it plainly and on the record that a tax credit without banning rent increases will not work.</p></speech>

There is no increase in capital spending, no increase to the paltry targets the Government has missed time and again, and no credible action plan to stem record homelessness.  In this budget the Government blatantly ignores the lived experiences of a generation locked out of affordable housing as the Government desperately attempts to dress up failure as delivery.  People caught up in the housing crisis are not fooled.  They see this budget for what it is, which is a blueprint for the deepening of their housing nightmare.  House prices will continue to rise, exploitative rents will still go up and the number of people in housing need, including homelessness, will continue to grow.  We urgently need a plan to reverse decades of bad housing policy, a plan to deliver 20,000 public homes per annum, a plan to ban rent increases and to put a month's rent back into renters' pockets by means of a refundable tax credit and a credible emergency response to homelessness.</p> <p>That is what a Sinn F&eacute;in government would deliver.  A Sinn F&eacute;in government would house our people.</p> <p> The soaring cost of living has pushed workers and families to the brink.  At the heart of this crisis is a conveyor belt of hikes in energy bills that just keep coming.  The Taoiseach told hard-pressed households to wait until the budget in September for help from the Government.  Now, here we are, and families do not just need help, they need the right help.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in called on the Government to cut electricity bills back to pre-crisis levels and to cap them at that level until the end of February.  This would give two million households the certainty they need.  It would help them to make it through the winter and protect them from further hikes.  Instead, the Government has chosen to give energy credits, and households will only see &euro;200 this side of Christmas.  Just like its rent credit, these credits risk being swallowed up by further increases.  That is what happened back in the spring, but the Government has chosen not to learn its lesson from that.  Once again, it has failed to protect households from the barrage of hikes that are to come.  People will pay a heavy price and many more families will be pushed into fuel poverty.</p> <p> In the areas of personal taxation and social protection, the budget fails the fairness test.  For all the Taoiseach had to say about pensioners, the &euro;12 increase in welfare payments and the State pension are inadequate.  Everyone on the front line has told him so.  The increase will be cancelled out by runaway inflation and recipients will actually be worse off than last year.  In real terms this is a welfare cut and people will be poorer and more at risk than they were before.  That is why in the Sinn F&eacute;in budget we provided for an increase of &euro;17.50 in working age welfare payments and a &euro;15 increase in the State pension.  That is what this Government should have done.</p> <p> Workers are experiencing the biggest squeeze on their incomes in 40 years.  They needed breathing room, and that means tax relief, a cut in personal tax, and we are agreed on that.  However, it is incredible that at a time when so much has been said about the squeezed middle that 1.8 million workers will not get one cent from the Government&rsquo;s main tax proposal.  It has spent more than &euro;1 billion on tax measures which will give someone on &euro;130,000 an extra &euro;830 while someone on &euro;35,000 will get only &euro;190.  How can anyone call that fair?  A better, fairer approach would have been to slash the USC and make cost-of-living payments to middle and low-income workers, putting &euro;700 in the pockets of teachers, private sector workers on &euro;35,000, and those nurses - young nurses - many of whom we are losing from this country as they seek a better chance abroad.  That is what Sinn F&eacute;in would have done, and it is what the Government should have done yesterday.</p> <p> The very best idea for the future of healthcare in Ireland is a single-tier, all-Ireland national health service.  We needed a plan for that transformation.  This budget, however, delivers more of the same.  The expansion of the GP card scheme is one headline grabber, but everyone on the front line is already saying that the lack of GPs means the primary care system will now come under even more pressure.  Introducing this measure without investing to increase GP capacity is a recipe for failure.  We know that because it happened before.  This cannot be another broken promise.  We need to see delivery.  Nearly one million people are on hospital waiting lists.  The healthcare crisis presided over by Government has touched every family.  Everybody knows someone who spent too long on a waiting list for treatment, too long on a hospital trolley and too long locked out of care, yet the investment the Government has provided does not meet the scale of the challenge.  There were 508 people on trolleys yesterday, yet the Government is not providing one additional acute bed in its budget.  We are still waiting for the delivery of 300 beds that were promised two years ago.  How on earth are we ever going to ramp up to the capacity needed in our health service?  It is another year, another budget, and another failure to tackle waiting lists or the crisis in emergency departments.</p> <p> The truth is this budget cements the unequal, unfair two-tier health system.  A Sinn F&eacute;in government would bring that inequality to an end.  Our budget provided for 500 additional acute beds and a workforce planning strategy to retain, recruit, and train the healthcare workers to the levels needed.  We would have delivered a budget to begin the transformation of public healthcare and build a health service that works for everyone.</p> <p> It is a very sad truth that citizens with disabilities and those with mental health challenges are so often forgotten by the Government.  Those citizens, their families and those who work in the sectors that support them have been crying out for help.  The measures announced in yesterday&rsquo;s budget fall far short of what is needed, with only &euro;29 million in additional money for disability and only &euro;14 million in additional money for mental health.  Shame on the Government.  It is a drop in the ocean.  It means the disability and mental health sectors will remain chronically underfunded.  That is the reality.  Again, the Government has failed to provide the investment needed to ensure these citizens can access the supports they need and live full, inclusive lives as equal citizens.</p> <p> In the coming decade, Ireland has two unique opportunities to drive our progress and prosperity.  The first is the reunification of our country.  The second is the securing of energy independence by fostering renewables, particularly wind energy.  These opportunities should be seized with enthusiasm, energy, and determination, yet in both areas the Government&rsquo;s budget demonstrates a breathtaking lack of an ambition.  The momentum behind Irish unity is growing.  Generational change is under way in Ireland and it is unstoppable.  It is vital we plan for the future of our country in an inclusive and positive way.  It is incredible there is no provision within this budget and no political will from the Government for the establishment of a citizens&rsquo; assembly on Irish unity.  It is urgent and necessary that the Government shows leadership by establishing such a forum.  This is the most important conversation of our generation.  Any decent and responsible government would be leading on that.</p> <p> The energy crisis we face today underscores the importance of securing a sustainable and affordable supply of energy.  Through our abundant renewable resources, the development of our offshore capacity and green hydrogen production, Ireland has the potential to become an international hub for clean, renewable, energy and can help drive the decarbonisation of European economies.  If we get this right, we can achieve energy independence for Ireland.  We can transform not just energy supply and security but our whole economic model and meet the goal of a just transition to a green, clean, future.  When we enjoy such natural advantages, when we have a sector ready to deliver, it is incredible this budget does so little to reduce the barriers to realise that potential and develop our wind infrastructure and green hydrogen capacity.</p> <p> Budget 2023 is defined by its failure to deal with these issues which dominate the lives of ordinary people and have done for well over a decade.  Government is no doubt splashing the cash but nothing is really going to change.  It fails at a time when Government has the financial resources to make a real difference.  The budget will not make a dent in the housing disaster.  It will not even scratch the surface of what is needed to transform our health services.  The cost-of-living package is big on numbers but is delivered in a way that ensures any benefit to households will be wiped out by future price hikes and inflation.</p> <p> The Government's package does not give households the certainty they need.  These are the real headlines from the budget, headlines that expose again the big failures of the Government.  The game of musical chairs the Taoiseach intends to play with the T&aacute;naiste before Christmas will not change this reality one bit.  That cosy arrangement is a guarantee of more the same.  It is not about what is best for the people but what is best for Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  We need more than just a change of Taoiseach; we need a change of Government.  Without a shadow of a doubt, this should be the last budget delivered by this failed, directionless Government.</p> <p> Time and again, in times of crisis, our young people have been forced to leave.  Worse still, they have been told by those in power to go.  The message given to generations deprived of opportunity was that we all cannot live on a small island.  Do you remember that one, gentlemen?  We were told that emigration from the home they love was a lifestyle choice.  That was very wrong.  Forced emigration was a failure of Government then and remains a failure of Government to this day.  I believe the chapter of this generation is yet to be written.  I believe we can change the story.  For all the challenges we face, I do not accept our future must be a repeat of our past.  I want that young man I spoke to on Monday and all our young generation to be able to build a good life here in Ireland, to have a home here, to have opportunity here and to be able to make it here.  Is that not the future we all want for our children and our grandchildren?</p> <p> Our people are seeking real change.  They believe a new direction and new Ireland is possible.  It is in our young people in particular that we find everything we need to make that Ireland a reality.  The old ways and the politics of the past have had their day.  Change is coming.  With the right government, with the right policies and with the right ambition, we can build the future our people deserve.  We can build our nation as a home for all.  That is a future worth believing in.  That is a future worth working for.  That is the future our people will achieve together and for each other.  Of that I have no doubt.</p></speech>

We knew that increasing numbers of households are facing stark choices between heating and eating and that up to half of all households are likely to be in energy poverty during the bleak winter ahead.  Right now, we know Ireland is just not working for far too many people - individuals, families, households and businesses.  Of course, we acknowledge the crises we face have been exacerbated deeply by Russian&rsquo;s brutal invasion of Ukraine and international factors.  However, many of the measures urgently needed to address the crises and to support communities are within the power of the Government at national level.</p>  <p>  This week we needed Government to step forward with a radical budget of the scale and level of ambition to address the severe levels of hardship faced by communities throughout the country.  Just as we saw urgent, ambitious and radical State-led measures rolled out to get us all through the Covid pandemic, so we needed to see the Government adopt similarly urgent, ambitious and radical measures in the budget.  The Labour Party's alternative budget, published last week, put forward a clear and costed set of measures to support the building of an Ireland that would work for us all.  Our budget proposals represent a creative and radical plan - a genuine pathway to ensure a more equal Ireland.</p>  <p>  Yesterday presented the Government with an opportunity to move towards that vision of Ireland, a more equal Ireland, an Ireland that works.  It was an opportunity to provide a lifeline to the tens of thousands of people for whom this country is currently not working.  Unfortunately, it was an opportunity missed.  This was not a budget to provide the necessary pathway or track forward to ensure households and communities would be adequately supported through this winter and beyond.  Instead of providing that positive pathway forward, this might better be described as a treadmill budget, in which the Government is spending money to stand still, not to ensure any future progress or prosperity.</p>  <p>  A considerable amount of money has been put forward for once-off and short-term measures, but ultimately there is no sense of forward momentum or progressive movement.  There is no sense this budget will do anything other than provide a short-term quick fix, a sugar hit, which will wear off very quickly and likely before the new year.  As my colleague Deputy Nash has said, the signs are that we may need to have another budget in the new year once the short-term measures have faded away.  When speaking to the media this morning, the T&aacute;naiste effectively acknowledged that.</p>  <p>  With the cost-of-living crisis biting deeply, many people already feel they are on that treadmill and are running simply to stand still.  They cannot see a future of prosperity for them or their children.  This budget will not change that.  It was simply not good enough to throw money in a short-term way at the crises like snuff at a wake, as Deputy Nash said yesterday.  This was a short-term "Bertienomics" approach, as Deputy Duncan Smith pointed out, an approach that will do little for the have-nots while boosting the position of those who already have lots.</p>  <p>  We needed a clear plan to take us through the winter and beyond, a plan with ambition and vision.  That was sadly lacking in the package of measures announced yesterday.  This has been recognised by many.  One response I got from a constituent today accurately reflects public reaction.  She said, "This winter, I will have to choose between eating properly or taking the edge off the cold in my home.  I will stay in bed to stay warm.  I am a worker, a grafter.  I have not been helped in any way by this budget."  Her reaction reflects the reality for many.</p>  <p>  A different approach was possible.  As I said, the Government could instead have adopted the approach we took in our Labour Party budget last week.  We proposed a costed programme with a set of immediate cost-of-living measures and a series of longer term plans to improve public services and protect communities from market insecurities.  We know households and communities are suffering currently and need to be protected and sheltered from harm.  We had clear plans to protect and support communities in housing, care, climate and work.</p>  <p>  On housing, we called for an eviction ban and rent freeze.  These should have been key features of any housing measures announced by the Government.  In an Ireland that works for all, massive investment would have been put in place to ramp up provision of affordable and secure homes.  Instead, the tax credit for renters that was announced shows just how divorced Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are from the lived reality of renters.  Rents are out of control in this country.  Renters are paying an average of &euro;24,000 annually in rent payments.</p>  <p>  In my constituency of Dublin Bay South, which is also the constituency of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, this is a particularly serious problem.  We have more than double the national average of people who are renting, with 44% of households reliant on private rental accommodation.  Average rents in our area are more than &euro;2,000 per month.  For my constituents who are renting, a &euro;500 tax credit is drop in the ocean.  As Threshold put it, it amounts to just seven days' rent for anyone renting.  The speculative housing market has a hidden human and social cost of insecurity that we cannot afford.  Renters cannot continue to pay the price for the wasted years of Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il governments.</p> <p>The State needs to step in, freeze rents, ban evictions and commit to building more affordable homes.  It is particularly disappointing to see the failure of this budget to provide any real increase for the building of social housing.  Social Justice Ireland said another &euro;1.4 billion was needed.  That is what we allocated in our budget, but with construction inflation at 14%, the extra capital allocated by the Government fell far short of that, which means there will be fewer social and affordable homes built next year than last year.  We called for 20,000 social and affordable homes to be built next year - homes that desperately need to be built.</p> <p> Another disappointment in regard to housing in this budget is the lack of provision for households affected by construction defects.  This summer in the D&aacute;il, I raised with the T&aacute;naiste the shocking bills facing people who are living in defective Celtic tiger-era apartments.  There are many such apartments in my area and elsewhere across Dublin and beyond.  I was heartened then to hear the T&aacute;naiste say the Government would plan to provide redress for households.  I welcomed that announcement but there is little substance in the proposals brought forward this week.  We await to hear further about what is going to be done for those facing massive bills to address the fire safety and other defects in apartments through no fault of their owners.</p> <p> What the Government has proposed in a housing crisis is a levy on concrete products to raise &euro;80 million a year, which is likely to increase the cost of homes for buyers.  Our alternative proposal was for a levy on construction profits that would not have had that effect and could have ensured adequate redress for so many apartment owners.  The Government's proposal symptomises its inability to deal effectively with the housing crisis that has paralysed the lives of so many people and in particular destroyed the hopes and aspirations of younger generations.</p> <p> On care, we in the Labour Party brought forward two proposals to give immediate relief to hard-pressed families.  Free GP care would be immediately extended to every child and young person under 18 at a cost of &euro;100 million was one such proposal.  We believe that no parent should have to worry about the cost when their child is sick.  We know that Ireland is the only country in western Europe without universal access to GPs.  In spite of that, for four wasted years, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il have failed to use Ireland's hard-won prosperity to introduce free-at-the-point-of-access primary healthcare.  Last year's budget did commit to a welcome extension of the current scheme.  It is also welcome to see that this has now, finally, been done for six- and seven-year-old children in a recycled announcement made by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath yesterday.  Free GP care should have been extended to all children but that did not happen yesterday, which is a real shame.</p> <p> The measures introduced on childcare were equally underwhelming.  The Government states it will fund a reduction up to 25% in weekly fees for those availing of the national childcare scheme, but the proposed reduction will not amount to that level of reduction for most families.  Even with the new announcement, a parent in my constituency will still have to pay approximately &euro;250 per week per child.  In contrast, under our Labour Party proposal, childcare fees would be capped at &euro;200 per month.  That is a cost of only &euro;50 per week, which is in line with childcare fees in other European countries.  Such a radical and ambitious move would have cost the Exchequer &euro;275 million over 12 months, which is value for money and an investment in our children's future.</p> <p> In our equal early years campaign, the Labour Party and Labour Women have consistently called for us to opt in the longer term for a guaranteed publicly-funded preschool place for every child because parents need affordable, accessible childcare.  Early years educators deserve decent pay and conditions, and providers deserve support.  Most of all, our children deserve an equal start.  To realise that bigger vision for childcare, we would invest &euro;60 million next year to provide a clear pathway toward a universal publicly-funded childcare system on a par with other European countries.  We saw nothing resembling that level of ambition or vision from the Government in this year's budget.</p> <p> On climate, again, we saw a lack of vision and ambition or any new initiative.  Our fiscal budgets must always be seen through the lens of the climate emergency.  We know that urgent action is needed to ensure a just transition to a clean, green net-zero economy.  To do that, we needed real and radical action in the budget, and it did not happen.  In contrast, we in the Labour Party had made a flagship proposal for a &euro;9 monthly climate ticket for unlimited journeys countrywide on public transport, at a cost of &euro;300 million for a six-month period.  It is similar to the scheme that was trialled in Germany this year, which saved 1.8 million tonnes of CO2 emissions in three months.  That scheme is now being adapted across the various German regional authorities.</p> <p> The Labour Party also proposed a range of innovative measures to protect families and workers from rising energy prices and to move us towards a greener future.  We proposed a doubling of the grant available to fit solar panels in houses from &euro;2,400 to &euro;5,000.  We proposed an ambitious cycle-to-school scheme to enable parents to buy bikes for children, and a creative scheme to incentivise the scrapping of old cars in exchange for e-bikes.</p> <p> We would have imposed a 30% windfall tax on energy companies, many of which we know are raking in record profits.  Instead, the Government appears to have rejected that and proposed a very disappointing wait-and-see approach.  It does not appear to have taken on board the very sensible proposal to nationalise the Corrib field to ensure greater security and certainty on energy prices.  It is a very disappointing budget on climate.  It is not good enough for the young people who demonstrate every week with Fridays for Future, who want system change not climate change.  They certainly will not be getting it this year.</p> <p> Finally, on work, again this is a deeply disappointing budget, which has failed to address the real concerns of so many in our low-pay, high-cost economy.  Stagnating wages, the rising cost of living, and an energy crisis leading to job insecurity means that many young people are now fearful about staying in this country.  They are emigrating elsewhere, bringing their skills and talents abroad and depriving communities here of their contribution because they cannot see a future in which they can aspire to own their own home.  That is just not good enough.  Ours should be a society where low pay is addressed and where a future is provided for young people, but that is not the case right now, nor judging the contents of budget 2023.  We had a unique opportunity in this budget to build better jobs and to build a programme of jobs for good, and develop a just transition to a fairer, greener future.  Instead, what we see is a derisory increase in the minimum wage, a programme of tax cuts that patently offers disproportionate benefits to those on higher incomes and an inadequate increase of only &euro;12 per week for those on pensions and social welfare, which is well below the increase of &euro;20 that we in the Labour Party had proposed.</p> <p> The Government had a clear set of questions to answer in yesterday's budget.  Will it work to keep people warm in their homes?  Will it stop low and middle-income households from going under?  Will it support people and businesses struggling to pay energy bills?  Will it support those who cannot afford their rent or mortgage payments?  Will it keep the lights on this winter?  I am sad to say that looking at what is provided in the budget, it appears as though Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have failed those tests.  A budget should draw a big picture for Ireland, in particular at this time of crisis.  It should be ambitious and show vision.  Yesterday, we saw no ambition and no vision.  Instead, we saw a conservatism that sees every aspect of public spending as a cost, rather than an investment.  Yes, there were welcome measures to reduce costs for households and businesses in yesterday's budget, and there was an important acknowledgement that supports are needed, but at its heart this is not a budget that provides equality.  It is not a budget to ensure the building of an Ireland that works for all.  In contrast, a Labour Party budget would have sought to achieve real equality: to provide safe and secure homes for everyone; to create quality well-paid jobs that move us towards a green economy and a cleaner environment; to reform taxation to prioritise fairness and redistribution, and to fund a health and care system for children, older people and everyone in between.  That is the Ireland that the Labour Party wants to see and that we are building.  That is an Ireland that would work for us all.</p></speech>

The question is, with a cost of &euro;11 billion, whether people soon will begin to feel short-changed and whether the Government will be obliged to intervene again early in the new year.  A large intervention was no doubt needed.  We are currently battling three separate but interlinked crises, namely, the cost of living, energy and housing crises.  People all over the country are under serious pressure from soaring prices.  In January of this year, before inflation spiralled to nearly double-digit figures, we learned that consumer prices in Ireland are 40% above the EU average.  In 2016, we were 29% more expensive, so the gulf in prices between us here in Ireland and in other EU member states keeps widening.  We have the dubious distinction of having the most expensive housing and healthcare costs in Europe.  Our goods and services are the second most expensive in the EU, while the price of food and communications are the third most expensive.  It is clear that people needed to get some significant help from the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Michael McGrath, when they got to their feet yesterday, but was it the right assistance and will it help in the long term?</p> <p>Were the unprecedented sums that have been spent targeted at the people who most need it?</p> <p> As the dust settles and the numbers are crunched, it is becoming clear to more and more people that this is a regressive budget.  Tax changes saw those at the top get cuts of more than &euro;800, while those on lower incomes received just &euro;190.  This is the most glaring example of that.  Just 23% of income earners in this country pay the top rate of tax, but more than 80% of the benefits of the budget's tax changes accrue to those workers.  There are a lot of high-income earners but 23% of our workers are on low pay, one of the highest proportions in the OECD.  What did the budget do for low-paid workers, those for whom we all stood here and clapped earlier during the pandemic, such as retail workers who kept shelves stacked, delivery drivers or cleaners in our hospitals who put themselves at risk?  Under the tax changes in this budget, they will get an additional &euro;15 a month.</p> <p> Two other cohorts of people disproportionately live in poverty, namely, lone parents and disabled people.  Earlier this year, the Department of Social Protection published an ESRI report it had commissioned that warned that lone parents and their children, and disabled parents and their children, experienced high levels of deprivation.  In 2019, these two groups accounted for just over half of those living in consistent poverty, a truly shocking statistic.</p> <p> One of the meanest aspects of yesterday&rsquo;s budget, which has been billed as an &euro;11 billion bonanza, was the &euro;2 increase in the qualified child allowance.  This money targets those families with children who are in receipt of a social welfare payment and, therefore, it is paid for the most vulnerable children in society, yet they got a &euro;2 increase in the budget yesterday.  That is shameful.  The Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance has also criticised this puny increase and stated that the qualified child allowance is a crucial intervention to help the most disadvantaged children.</p> <p> The Government has given disabled people a &euro;500 lump sum as a cost-of-disability payment, which is welcome, but why has it included this payment, which is supposed to be a way for the Government to recognise the significant additional cost of having a disability, as a one-off measure?  The Social Democrats have called for a &euro;20 per week cost-of-living disability payment, which equates to &euro;1,040 annually, to be introduced.  This would have been a way to signal that the payment would be retained and increased in future years until it matched the additional cost of having a disability.  The disability capacity review was published in July of last year and we are all waiting for the Government to publish its action plan arising from this review, almost 15 months after it was released.</p> <p> Yet another example of the Government's one-for-everyone-in-the-audience approach to the budget is the &euro;600 energy credits, which will be paid to the highest earners as well as the lowest.  I cannot understand why, when there was an energy crisis for almost a year before Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine made it even more acute, the Government has not figured out a way to target these payments.  A &euro;200 energy credit was first announced in December 2021.  Has anyone in the Government even tried to devise a way to target the payment since then?  Some parents are skipping meals and going to bed hungry and children sometimes do not have a winter coat to keep them warm, and that is before huge energy bills hit the letterboxes this winter.  Is the Government really saying those families should get the same level of support with their bills as people on very high incomes, who can absorb these increased costs?  The Minister stated yesterday that the &euro;200 energy credit would mean more to people on low incomes because they have less money.  Does he think the energy bills of low-paid people are as modest as their pay cheques?  They are not.</p> <p> The main ongoing failure of this Government and previous Fine Gael Governments relates to housing, and nothing in this budget will change that.  What is most concerning is there is no acceptance within the Government that the approach it has embarked on is failing.  This is a key issue for all age ranges.  Parents worry about their adult children's futures, while adults in their 20s, 30s and 40s feel trapped and cannot save for a deposit, given the sky-high rents, and even when they do, they find they are competing with vulture funds for the limited number of homes that come up for sale.  This was a key issue in the two most recent general election campaigns and it is certain to be so again when the next election is called.</p> <p> In the budget yesterday, no additional money was allocated to capital investment and there was no acknowledgement of the fact we need a massive ramp-up in the delivery of affordable homes, both to rent and to buy, if we are ever to resolve this crisis.  Social housing has become a lucrative product in the housing market, involving long leases, usually for 25 years, where the developer retains the house at the end with no asset accruing to the State.  We were assured this would be phased out but it was provided for yet again in this budget.</p> <p> The Government has finally indicated it will proceed with the vacant homes tax but it has been set at such a low level that it will have little impact.  Tens of thousands of homes have been lying empty for years throughout this crisis, and their owners have had more than enough time to sell or rent them.  They do not need a gentle nudge to convince them these homes need to be brought back into use; they need a severe push with a punitive vacant homes tax and we have suggested a figure of about 10%.</p> <p> Similarly, real estate investment trusts, REITs, and vulture funds pay barely any tax, but the Government&rsquo;s response is yet another lengthy review of vulture funds while they continue to make windfall profits from our housing disaster.  The Social Democrats wanted to see a windfall tax imposed on the energy companies that are making off like bandits in the middle of an energy crisis.  We should similarly impose a levy on REITs and vulture funds to ensure they will pay a windfall tax on the enormous profits they are earning off the back of this housing catastrophe.</p> <p> The Government has also introduced a rent credit that will barely cover one week's rent in Dublin but, bizarrely, it has refused to introduce a ban on rent increases at the same time, despite the Minister, Deputy Donohoe,  publicly stating that a rent credit in the absence of a ban would only lead to rents increasing even further.  For once I agreed with him, but he should listen to his own advice.</p> <p> One of the main reasons the Government was in a position to announce such a large budget package yesterday related to the huge surges in corporation tax but, obviously, this is not sustainable and cannot be relied on.  We need to do much more to future-proof our economy with, for example, a massive expansion in green energy.  The Government talks a lot about developing offshore wind, but the only port in Ireland capable of delivering offshore wind is located in Belfast and not a single offshore wind project has yet even received planning permission.  Last week, Shell pulled out of the Irish renewables market, the largest energy company to do so since Equinor pulled out last year.  The Government must deal swiftly with the impediments to delivering in this space.  My colleague Deputy Whitmore will presently go into more detail about this area.</p> <p> With such a large budget, there are bound to be positives, such as the elimination of inpatient hospital charges.  It is clear, however, that the Government suffers from a poverty of ambition and an inability to deliver when it comes to big projects that would make a difference.  This budget is yet more evidence of that.</p></speech>

This is an extremely challenging time, when many will struggle to feed their families or heat their homes over the winter.  Nevertheless, out of crisis can come opportunity, and with an &euro;11 billion budget, never before has a Government had such an opportunity to build a secure, sustainable and fair future for all residents and communities.  As Archbishop Desmond Tutu said:</p> <blockquote> 	A time of crisis is not just a time of anxiety and worry.  It gives a chance, an opportunity, to choose well or to choose badly. </blockquote>  <p>What did the Government choose in this budget?  Unfortunately, rather than choose a budget of fairness and opportunity, a budget for the long term with a targeted approach, it chose a &quot;Late Late Show&quot; bonanza, with one for everyone in the audience, even for those wealthy individuals and homeowners who do not need it.  As for what path the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications chose, he chose, unfortunately, not to ramp up his climate actions to meet these challenges head on.</p> <p>Instead, he has chosen to give us more of the same by adding a few more retrofits here and there and offering some empty rhetoric about rooftop revolution and accelerating climate action.  However, the reality is that spin and public relations just will not cut it.  Giving us more of the same just will not cut it.  More of the same will just mean more missing of targets, more homes and individuals waiting in longer queues for retrofitting programmes and more people on low incomes being disadvantaged because they cannot afford to take out a loan to make their homes energy efficient or warm.  Instead, what we needed to see was ambition, urgency and delivery.</p> <p> The Social Democrats proposed an ambitious roll-out of solar panels to ensure that 100,000 low-income homes received panels free of charge.  These were homes in energy poverty that needed Government support to make the climate changes we require of them.  The Social Democrats focus on solar because it is quick, practical and cheaper to do.  Most importantly, it could reduce the annual energy costs for those in energy poverty by 40%.  Our proposals involve the State bulk buying panels at greatly reduced prices with teams of trained installers fitting out entire estates at one time.  This is the most efficient, effective and lean manner in which to deliver.  It really is a no-brainer.  This would have really been a rooftop revolution where not only would we see emissions, fossil fuel dependency and energy costs drop, but a real revolution where those most at risk from energy poverty would have been protected now and into the future.  It would have been a just revolution that, unfortunately, the Government has failed to deliver.</p> <p> All through our discussions when we talk about climate, and when the Green Party and the Minister talk about climate, they talk about just transition.  It has to mean something more than talk.   It has to be seen in the Government's budgets and where it targets its money.  This budget has done nothing for low-income households that want to install solar panels.  They are not part of the warmer homes scheme.  It will not assist those homes to reduce energy usage and their energy costs.  It is something that could be done very quickly.  I do not understand why the Minister and the Government have such a blind spot when it comes to solar energy.  We need to invest in solar.  It is one part of the jigsaw but it is an important part.  As I said, it is something that could be done very quickly.</p> <p> Having households go to a one-stop shop, which then organises a company to go out to an individual home in a town or village, is the most inefficient way to deliver both retrofitting and solar.  The Government needs to be ambitious in this.  It needs to step up to make sure that people who are at risk of fuel poverty now and next January, and who will be at risk of fuel poverty next year, are protected and that they can make savings on their energy costs.  We need them to do it.  Our energy grid needs them to do it.  Our climate and environment need them to do it.  Unfortunately, it appears to me that the Green Party mantra for this budget is could have, should have but did not.</p></speech>

More people will be cold and hungry.  More people will be energy poverty.  Do not take it from me; take it from Mr. Cliff Taylor, who wrote in <i>The Irish Times</i>that &quot;living standards will fall on average by about 3 per cent this year and 2 per cent next year&quot;.  The answer is because the crises we face are systemic crises.  I refer to the cost-of-living, housing and climate and biodiversity crises.  There is systemic crisis rooted in profiteering and the capitalist system, which is based around organising our economy to maximise that profiteering.  It is the profiteering of the fossil fuel corporations without regard to our planet or our people's needs, of the energy and food companies in this country and of the big landlords and developers.  Their interests and their profits are taking priority.  The centrepieces of the Government's budget continue in exactly the same vein.  They do not challenge that profiteering in the slightest.  Instead, they continue with it.</p><p>With the electricity credit, for example, and the temporary business energy support scheme, without price controls and without nationalisation of the energy sector, the Government is just creating a vast flow of public money through the hands of people into the pockets of energy companies.  </p></speech>

There are no windfall  taxes.  The Government will wait for the European Commission to do that.  There is no new energy infrastructure, no investment or no guarantee in controlling our supplies and prices into the future.</p>  <p>  It is the exact same thing with the renter's credit, which is a seven-day credit for those who get it.  It excludes huge numbers of renters, for instance, everybody who is in receipt of the housing assistance payment, HAP, despite the fact they are making top-ups, all students, all low-pay workers who do not earn enough to benefit from it and those whose tenancy is not even registered with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB.  Even for those who benefit, however, without proper rent controls that bring rents down to an affordable level, it just ends up in the pockets of the big corporate landlords.  It just goes into the pile of money - billions of euro per year - for HAP, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and the other schemes from which the big corporate landlords benefit.  The same applies to the help-to-buy scheme.  In reality, it has from its inception been a help-to-profit scheme for developers.  The money just passes through people's hands before ending up in the pockets of the developers.</p>  <p>  There is much talk these days about trickle-down economics because of what is happening in the UK.  The Irish Government operates a kind of perverse version of that - a sort of flood-up economics - where the money is temporarily transferred to ordinary people who are left with no choice but to hand that money back over to big corporations, which have no restrictions whatsoever on their profiteering.  This is the significant indirect corporate welfare contained in this budget.  On top of that is the direct corporate welfare of the temporary business energy support scheme of &euro;1.25 billion.</p>  <p>  We support assistance going to small businesses but it has to be done on the basis of proven need and with conditions in terms of quality employment for the workers.  Instead, we have a massive giveaway to almost every business in the State.  The very biggest corporations in this country are going to be able to benefit from this scheme to the tune of &euro;10,000 of public money for every month the scheme operates.  Even more scandalously, and I am open to and would like to be corrected here, there appear to be no mechanisms to stop the data centres benefiting from this scheme.  Is it accurate that we are going to be giving &euro;10,000 to each of these data centres per month to subsidise their energy when they are contributing to an absolute crisis of energy in this country?  If that is the case, that is absolutely scandalous.  Of course, the special assignee relief programme, SARP, continues for the super-high-income people and the knowledge development box continues the corporate tax haven.</p>  <p>  Contrast the billions for big businesses with the pennies for pensioners, carers and unemployed people.  They needed &euro;27 per week just to keep their incomes steady in real terms.  Instead, they got &euro;12.  To add insult to injury, they got &euro;2 per week extra for a qualified child.  That is &euro;2 to feed and clothe a child in the context of the soaring crisis.  It is absolutely scandalous.</p>  <p>  The sting in the tail of these increases is that because of the Government's failure to raise the income levels for social housing or even better, make social housing universal, people will be kicked off the housing list as a consequence.  They will lose their access to HAP because the Government will not deal with the issue of social housing.   It is a huge issue that the Government should address.</p>  <p>  Then, last night, the Government rammed through a vote to put &euro;5 billion in the rainy day fund.</p> <p>It is three years since the then Government declared a national climate emergency and four years since it declared a national emergency in respect of housing.  It is pouring now; we are in an emergency situation.  Instead of putting this money away to bail out banks in the future, we should be investing in public housing, expanded public transport, insulation, retrofitting and green energy.<br/><br/>I also want to raise a point about IVF.  Many couples will have had their hopes raised by a leak to the effect that IVF was going to be offered in the public system by 2023.  When you look at the small print, however, it seems that was a cruel and inaccurate leak.  The Minister for Public and Expenditure and Reform spoke about providing supports for the first time in respect of to IVF treatment.  When you read the budget book, not one cent is allocated in respect of the provision of IVF treatment.  The <i>Irish Independent</i>reports, &quot;the first phase of public funding for IVF treatment will not begin until late next year, on a limited basis at first, and details have yet to be worked on how it will be assessed&quot;.  It will be very cruel if the Government does not act now to have IVF available within the public system because couples cannot delay on this matter.  They cannot afford to wait for the Government to get its nice headlines year after year without it making available within the public health system the funding and resources necessary to provide IVF to everybody who needs it.<br/><br/>Yesterday, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage brought a memorandum to Cabinet about the issue of defective apartments.  He announced - with a big drum roll - the establishment of a group to look into the report of another group.  We do not need multiple months of waiting to have another report about a first report.  We know what the issue is - defective building as a result of inadequate regulation under Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, and a regime of self-certification.  We know what the answer is - 100% redress, with the State pursuing the builders responsible.  This should have been included in the budget yesterday.  We have provided for it in our alternative budget.  The Government should move immediately and not draw the matter out.<br/><br/>What is the alternative to all of this?  If you start from a position that does not seek to maximise profit for corporations but, instead, that comes at matters from the eco-socialist perspective of people's needs, including the need for all of us to live on a habitable planet, you end up with a different approach to the budget and a different way of organising our economy and society.  You would stop the energy rip-off by renationalising the energy sector, imposing price controls and running it under democratic public ownership on a not-for-profit basis.  You would invest public money instead of handing it over to developers and corporate landlords, and you would invest public money to build quality public housing.  You would buy up the HAP and RAS landlords' properties and nationalise the big corporate landlords.  You would take everybody in this country out of poverty.  It can be done.  Instead of cutting the budget for climate, which this budget is doing, there would be massive public investment in renewable energy, including public ownership and public investment in free, green and frequent public transport.  There would be public investment in retrofitting and insulation.  Inflation would be cut in the simplest way possible; by removing things from the market and from decommodifying things by providing vital public services as that.  Universal basic public services would be provided, including free childcare, free GP care and genuinely free education at all levels.<br/><br/>The money is there to do it.  In our alternative budget, we set out just four measures, including in respect of employer's PRSI, another rate of tax for those earning over &euro;100,000, a wealth tax and increasing corporation tax, which would raise &euro;11 billion, with the corporation tax coming on top of that.  The Government refused to do it.  The third-richest country in the world has social crises all over the place because the Government runs society and the economy in the interests of the corporate landlords, energy companies and developers.  That is why we need a change of Government.  More than that, we need system change.  We need to organise society on an eco-socialist basis in the interests of people, not profit.</p></speech>

She is 25 years-old.  Leah is in a WhatsApp group with 21 of her friends.  Some 16 of those friends have emigrated.  All of them have left this year.  Three of them left earlier today.  What does the Government offer this generation?  There is a &euro;500 tax credit for renters, which would not even pay ten days of rent over a year in Cork city and which may well end up in the pockets of landlords because of the Government's refusal to freeze rents.  It has offered an increase in the minimum wage, which will be totally swallowed up by inflation and which is, in effect and reality, a cut.  There is &euro;1,000 off college fees, which still cost &euro;2,000 but the &euro;1,000 off is for one year only.  This is cold comfort for those thousands of young people who deferred their college courses this year because they could not afford the student accommodation.  In other words it is too little and too late, certainly for Leah's friends.</p>  <p>  The Irish State is 100 years old this year.  During those 100 years, we have had no system other than capitalism and no Government led by any party other than Fianna F&aacute;il or Fine Gael.  De Valera said: "No longer shall our children, like our cattle, be brought up for export."  His words were utterly hollow.  Many more than 1 million people have been forced to emigrate since the foundation of the State.  In fact, more than 1 million have emigrated since those words were uttered in the mid-1930s.  Mass emigration has robbed this country of many of its youngest, most creative and most vital elements.  Many a tear has been shed and many a heart has been broken, but for the political establishment of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, there have always been strategists who saw this mass youth emigration as a positive, or at least as having a positive side to it.  The mass emigration of young people took pressure off conservative Governments, removed criticism from young and angry voices, lessened the opportunity for large street protests and held back the development of the left.  It is happening again today.  More than 100,000 emigrated between April 2020 and April 2022, half of them Irish nationals and many of the others were people who would have liked to have stayed here.</p>  <p>  The question today is if the Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael strategists have looked at the fact that there is a general election in two and a half years&rsquo; time.  Have they seen the level of youth alienation with Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael and the radicalism of young people on marriage equality, in the repeal the eighth campaign and the Black Lives Matter movement and now consciously decided to either open the floodgates to emigration or to at least, not stand in the way of an exodus in any serious way?  In a crime investigation, detectives will ask if the suspect has a record, form, a motive and what their actions signify.  On every one of those counts, the Government parties have questions to answer.</p></speech>

I have been in this House for more than 40 budgets.  Gradually, I have seen the procedure around budgets and the delivery of budget statements altered dramatically.  In the past, policy intentions were well-guarded and budget day was much-anticipated.  There was an air of anxiety, anticipation and excitement.  We were waiting for a bit of the mystery to be revealed.  Unlike yesterday, the Gallery was full and there was a real buzz around the House.  What has changed is that all budget measures are effectively public knowledge before the day's proceedings even begin.  Budgets are leaked in a drip-drip fashion.  As a result, budget day has lost its lustre and impact.</p> <p>The Government, it appears, considers that it is far more important to brief the media in advance, rather than briefing the elected representatives of the people.</p> <p> It is being said that a budget should reflect the values and priorities of a nation and its people.  Budget 2023 was always going to be a carefully scrutinised balancing act for the Government.  When the budget is hyped as being a landmark package expectations are bound to run high.  Yesterday's budget saw the much-anticipated inclusion of a &euro;4.1 billion cost-of-living package.  This was a welcome move that will help ease immediate financial worries for many.  However, the true impact of this budget will not be evident until March of next year, when the once-off supports expire.</p> <p> Assistance announced yesterday will help to address immediate problems, but there is a long road ahead.  It is likely that further Government intervention will be required early next year.  There was welcome news for thousands of families, particularly those on lower incomes who are struggling and who are worried about the months ahead.  Energy supports, a once-off double child allowance payment and a reduction in childcare and college fees are all family-friendly moves.</p> <p> It is appropriate that renters were singled out for assistance.  The &euro;500 credit they will receive, while not a huge amount in the light of the cost of renting, will provide some relief when added to the cash-back credit of &euro;600 on energy bills that will be paid to all households in the next six months.</p> <p> Many businesses that scrabbled to survive the pandemic find themselves facing a staggering 400% increase in utility costs.  There was a broad welcome from these businesses for the assistance announced yesterday.  That assistance will help safeguard jobs across the country.  Conversely, there was a total oversight in the context of a failure to help small businesses that do not consume much energy.  These businesses face massively increased fuel costs.  Those who operate in the services sector, those who run distribution and delivery companies and, importantly, those in the transport sector were overlooked.  This budget was not a package of supports for businesses; it was a selective action that excluded a huge cohort of businesses.</p> <p> Similarly, sole traders were forgotten.  Tradesmen in particular are mainly home-based.  They do not have business premises to maintain, yet their daily running costs have risen alarmingly.  Electricians, plumbers, carpenters, decorators and other one-man businesses are largely dependent on households to provide their work.  A reduced household income means less work for tradesmen who operate alone.  Rising fuel and insurance costs are eating into the small profits they make.  The last time this happened, the tradesmen fled the country.  We continue to have a skills shortage as a result of emigration.  This should never be allowed to happen again.</p> <p> A welcome takeaway from yesterday was the success of the zero-VAT campaign for local newspapers and their assistive digital products.  I supported this campaign wholeheartedly.  Local newspapers provide a window to our communities and are an intrinsic part of life across this country.  They are deserving and worthy of the support they received.</p> <p> Those of us who attended the National Ploughing Championships last week heard first-hand the concerns occupying the minds of those in the farming sector.  The Regional Group&rsquo;s pre-budget submission highlighted the crucial need for investment as farmers endeavour to tackle the financial challenges posed by the need to meet climate targets between now and 2030.  The extension of vital tax relief is welcome, despite it being contingent on future negotiations with Brussels.  Also welcome is the news of accelerated capital allowances for the building of modern slurry storage facilities, although concerns have been expressed in regard to the knock-on effect of the 10% levy on concrete and concrete products.  Clarity is required on this issue.  Dairy, pig and poultry farmers are relieved to be included in support to help with energy costs.  Overall, there seems to be a cautious welcome from farmers for Budget 2023.</p> <p> Last year, &euro;22 billion was allocated to health.  Recent reports indicate that Department of Health recorded an overspend on this amount.  An extra &euro;225 million is being targeted in the coming year to address waiting lists.  Year after year, we provide extra millions to reduce waiting lists.  Despite this massive investment, waiting lists get longer.  We appear to have no measurement or accountability in regard to the outcome from ongoing this investment.  Unless a concerted effort is made to address the staffing issues in the health service, waiting lists will continue to grow.  The most vital component of the health service is the people who work there, yet we continue to hear of them walking away as they cannot take the pressures placed upon them.  If there were proper staffing levels in our hospitals and health service there would be an immediate reduction in waiting lists.  Instead, the waiting lists grow.  This is particularly so for children and, disgracefully, even more so for children with sensory, intellectual and physical disabilities.  It is a poor reflection on Ireland as a country if the most vulnerable among us cannot access the health services they desperately need.</p> <p> I have a few questions in regard to Department of Health.  Is the Department of Health ready for the winter surge in demand?  Is there a plan in place to cope?  Will the funding required detract from addressing the existing difficulties in the system, including waiting lists?</p> <p> This budget, and particularly the cost-of-living package, has extended help to address immediate needs.  This is likely to be the first necessary step in addressing the current energy and cost of living crisis.  The actions on the part of the Government in the coming months to explore and revisit need to increase our energy self-sufficiency never been more important.  We are now acutely of how instability in other parts of the world can impact Ireland.</p></speech>

What the Government has done is to put an overflow pipe onto the sink, but the difficulty is that is not turning off the tap and if that the water comes in any quicker it will still overflow.  That is the difficulty with this budget.  While it is helping and while the investment that is being put in is welcome, it will not deal with any of the systemic challenges, particularly in relation to the cost of energy and the cost of electricity.</p>  <p>  We see that the retrofitting targets are falling dramatically short of what were set out in Project Ireland 2040.  Retrofitting is a measure that can reduce the electricity costs permanently for people.  Project Ireland 2040 contains a commitment to retrofit 45,000 homes per annum from 2021.  The target for next year is just 37,000 homes.</p>  <p>  There is nothing in this legislation or in this budget to address the issue of standing charges for electricity.  Electricity standing charges on families today are between &euro;500 and &euro;700 per year.  Of course, we passed the legislation in this House last July to increase the cost of those standing charges by another &euro;120.  Disappointingly, the Government, rather than making an announcement on a windfall energy tax, is awaiting the taking of measures at European Union level instead of applying the renewable electricity support scheme clawback - something that I was involved in developing that as Minister - into the renewable energy wind and solar farms that are making excessive profits under the existing old renewable energy feed-in tariff.  By using the new clawback model that has been developed, approved and adopted by the renewable energy companies in this country, we could hand money back to electricity customers across this country.</p>  <p>  The budget involves a substantial figure of &euro;11 billion that will be handed out to people.  It was only possible to put the budget together because of corporation tax.  The Department of Finance estimates that between &euro;8 billion and &euro;10 billion of corporation tax taken in this year is vulnerable to shock.  In fact, the Minister for Finance pointed out that ten multinational companies account for over one third of the total tax take by Revenue.  Without that money coming in, there would have been a significant deficit this year of &euro;8 billion instead of a headline surplus of &euro;1 billion.</p> <p>We need not just to acknowledge that, which the Minister did yesterday, but to put a replacement in place.  The only effective way to do that is to have a sovereign wealth fund that is actually built on our own natural resources.  Anywhere across the globe where there is a sovereign wealth fund, it is built on the natural resources of the country involved.</p> <p> We have a 220-million acre maritime resource off our coast, where we have the potential to develop 70,000 MW of offshore renewable electricity.  We need to think outside the box and implement ambitious solutions to clean up our energy supply, to provide sustainable long-term employment opportunities and ensure that Ireland becomes a global renewable energy exporter.  To do that, we need a radical overhaul of Ireland's industrial development policy to achieve our climate goals and grasp the opportunity that we have off our coast.</p> <p> At the weekend, there was a headline in the papers which read "EU downgrades Ireland's north and west to a 'lagging region'".  That is because of the lack of industrial development along our west and north-west.  We cannot overcome that challenge we have in our region in a piecemeal or a haphazard manner.  In the same paper, there were reports that Shell is withdrawing its offshore development plans for 1.35 GW of electricity off our coast, which follows the previous withdrawal of Equinor, which was planning to develop 1.4 GW of electricity off our coast.  Between them, those two investors alone were going to generate enough electricity to power 2.24 million homes across this country.  We can never develop that resource or create the types of employment and opportunities that we could have, in the west and the north west, providing the balanced regional development, unless we develop a strategy which is in the long-term interests of this country, and not just allowing these projects to be developer-led.  As I have said, there is 70 GW of potential electricity generation off our coast.  That is not only enough to meet our own long-term needs, but also the long-term needs of France and Austria together.  What we need to do is to ensure that we establish an offshore renewable development authority, similar to IDA Ireland, that would drive a fully co-ordinated national action plan.  It would have responsibilities ranging from research and development to supply chain development to the commercial deployment of renewable energy, and would ensure that Ireland becomes the global leader in the export of sustainable clean energy.</p> <p> In order to do that, we also need to have an export channel.  The best possible export channel for that is to develop an Atlantic electricity interconnector from the west coast of Ireland directly into the European grid.  However, we can only do that if we take a strategic approach and if that strategic approach is taken now.  There is no point in kicking the can down the road and hoping that something will happen in the future, and that investors from outside will come in and drive the type of innovative change that is needed.  We can only do that by driving that change ourselves, by setting up an agency and authority to drive that and to ensure that Irish citizens and the Irish State benefit in the long term.</p></speech>

They are playing mind games with the people.  Everyone knows that like the previous Government, for the last two years this Government has not been serving the people.  It is serving some other global masters and is not working in the interests of the people here.  We have come through the charade.  Deputy Lowry said previously that he has been here for 40 budgets.  I have been here for 15 or 16.  I missed last year's because I was sick.  It is a charade now.  It is all out in the media.  There was a press conference this morning.  I do not know what the Ministers went to that for.  Perhaps they wanted to see how the people are reacting to the crumbs they have got from the mighty table of the triumvirate that makes up the Government.</p>  <p>  I welcome some measures.  I welcome the removal of VAT from defibrillators and other medical devices.  Measures like that and the bonus are welcome, but it is the taxpayers' money that the Government is regurgitating and recycling.  It is giving them back crumbs.  What has happened to our agricultural industry, which was the primary industry in this country and served us well from the foundation of our State, when T.K. Whitaker and others decided to be visionaries and to develop our industry?  It beggars belief that agriculture is now second from the bottom in the funding received in this year's budget.  The only smaller budget is that relating to the Department of the Taoiseach.  He does not need a budget because he does not do anything as such.  It is only for PR, media stuff and God knows what.  Agriculture has been reduced to that position.  The Greens are happy with that.  The transport budget has also been cut.  Agriculture was the primary industry that dragged us by the heels out of the last two recessions.  Now, we are deep in crisis.  Small beef, sheep and hill farmers will become extinct.  They will be run off the land like their ancestors were run off the land by Cromwell all those years ago.  They cannot survive and eke out a living where they are.  It is unbelievable.</p>  <p>  Is there any point in talking about health?  It is a black monstrosity.  Look at the development of the children's hospital.  It is a monumental disaster.  Now there will be a 10% increase in the price of the concrete being used to build the rest of it.  The cost will not stop at &euro;3 billion.  One cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.  The hospital is in the wrong place and location, and is not accessible.  By the time the equipment is fitted, it will be well out of date because, as we know, all such equipment has a particular lifespan.  It is an awful charade.</p>  <p>  The national broadband plan is the same.  It is another charade, like other Government projects.  The incompetence is frightening.</p>  <p>  The Green Party's fingerprints are all over this budget.  Its fingerprints are on agriculture, and it is diminishing the sector.  Its fingerprints are all over the budget.  I could mention umpteen examples.  I am surprised that the transport budget has been cut under the Minister for Transport.  The Minister is one of the three individuals who lead the Government of this country.  He allowed that to happen in his own Department in order to get his vanity projects, to cripple agriculture and continue with the carbon tax.  He lost out where he should be watching for major infrastructural projects.  That has happened.  The carbon tax is criminal.  There was a trick of the loop down in the convention centre and it was passed with incremental increases over ten years without there being a vote on it by the D&aacute;il.  The Government has had the audacity to impose that on hard-pressed taxpayers and people who have to travel to work and put fuel in every machine.  They are buying generators now to keep the lights on.  They will have to put fuel into those generators.  That will add to their costs.  The farm contractors did not even get a mention.  The carbon tax is punitive.  There are parties that are voting against the increase now, when they voted for the ten-year incremental increase.  It is farcical really.</p>  <p>  The tourism and hotel sector has received a blow from the Government.  It is the sector that was so badly affected during Covid.  I am not talking about hotels in Dublin.  I heard someone today suggest that we should have a different tax rate for Dublin, like they have in New York.  The extortionate prices that are being charged here must be cut.  I am talking about the decent hoteliers all over Tipperary, from Carrick-on-Suir, to Clonmel, to the Cahir House Hotel, up to Cashel, and right up to north Tipperary in Roscrea, Templemore and Nenagh.  They are wonderful, hardworking, dedicated entrepreneurs who employ many people.  The hotels were unceremoniously closed during Covid.  The bigger supermarkets were allowed to stay open but the hotels were punished.  Now, they are being given the message that at the end of next February the VAT will be increased again.  Tens of thousands of people are employed in what is a &euro;10 million industry.  It is a vital industry.  People in agriculture and rural Ireland have turned to the tourism industry in a desperate effort to make their places better and more receptive, and also to put bread and butter on the table.  What has the Government done to them?  It has kicked them in the teeth.</p>  <p>  We know about the housing crisis.  The housing income thresholds in Tipperary have not been reviewed for over a decade.  In fact, it is 11 years since they were reviewed.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage stood where the Minister for Transport is now and told us in November that they were under review.  A few counties were reviewed, but Tipperary was not.  That is causing anguish for ordinary working families.  They are being punished.</p> <p>The Government claims to represent those people.  Those families are over the thresholds that are ridiculously low.  They are over the threshold for the housing assistance payment, HAP, but are also over the wealth thresholds that would allow them to get a loan.  They cannot get loans from the council.  That is terrible.</p> <p> The 10% tax on concrete will affect everyone trying to build houses for themselves, builders, road makers and anything else that goes on.  Most major projects are stopping anyway because there is no confidence in this Government.  It does not know which way it is going or which way things are turning out.</p> <p> Under the assistance scheme, first-time buyers are unable to buy a second-hand house or an old house that needs to be done up and repaired.  Where is the sense in that?</p> <p> I know my following suggestion will not happen although it should.  The biggest owners of vacant properties are the county councils around the country.  They are also the biggest polluters in our watercourses.  Will the councils be made to pay the vacant property tax?  They will not, but they should be.  It would give them an incentive not to have this carry-on whereby houses are left idle.  That is an anomaly.  The budget means medicine for the little people, na daoine beaga.  The Government is allowing the public service to expand, be unaccountable and to have many properties in dereliction.  People are trying to do up all those places.  I honestly believe the Government has lost touch.  It is tired.  It has a lack of energy and spirit to carry on.  It is sending out a lethargic message to the public.</p> <p> The Government created the reserve fund yesterday by slipping it in.  What it did was totally unorthodox and unprecedented.  I am not totally opposed to the rainy day fund but I am opposed to putting in &euro;2 billion this year and &euro;4 billion next year when we should be putting that money into projects to help our rural communities.  We do not get a bob.  The Government has plenty of money for the Luas, the DART and all that up here in the capital.  It is pathetic.</p> <p> Government representatives held press conferences today to explain what people will get as a result of the budget.  It is giving with one hand but is already taking away.  As I said last night, St. Peter and St. Paul are saints but I do not know where the saints are with this Government.  This is the island of saints and scholars.  The Government has destroyed the spirit of the people.  It has applied punitive taxes.  It is giving out tax credits instead of taxing the big power companies and the wind energy companies.  There should be a windfall tax on those companies.</p> <p> The Government has two boxes from the EU which it will not use.  It has refused to use them in many areas.  It has refused to apply for funding.  It has not applied for different schemes while other countries have shown the way.  Portugal and many other countries have reduced the VAT rate to 5%, 6% or 7%, while this Government is doing exactly the opposite and putting it up.</p> <p> The embarrassing charades of the past three years have shamelessly siphoned wealth in one direction, that is, towards the globalists and their servants, and drained the men and women of Ireland.  I mean that.  The Government has drained opportunities from the children of Ireland and their futures.  We have an enormous, globally influential diaspora.  We could put a stop to this story if the Government would serve and encourage the people and allow them to live and work, to be healthy and happy.  We should do that.  It is embarrassing that we are here now with an insatiable and drastic desire to serve our globalist masters and not the public, which our Constitution dictates and which was the reason the men who fought for this country 100 years, whom we celebrate, did so.  The Government wants to serve its global masters.  They say jump and the Government asks, "How high?"  We saw it during the lockdown.  The big conglomerates made a fortune while small businesses were destroyed.  The Government is wiping small businesses off the face of the earth.  There are no supports at all for those businesses while there are supports for the bigger companies in paying their electricity bills.  There is no help for small businesses.  People on the road, hauliers and all those people badly need support.</p></speech>

There were positive points in respect of the VAT rate, the availability of defibrillators, free schoolbooks for primary school students and the 0% VAT rate for newspapers.  Those are positive steps in the right direction.  There are, however, many weaknesses in this budget that need to be exposed.  I have received a number of calls from builders today, including from one woman whose husband and son are building.  They are devastated with what the Government has done by introducing the 10% tax on concrete products.  It is an astonishing situation we find ourselves in that such a tax will be applied next year.  People are trying to build homes at an already considerable cost.  They will probably now have to renegotiate their mortgages.  The State is going to have to pick up the tab and renegotiate new prices in respect of council housing that is being built.  The extra 10% levies will apply all the way to concrete floors.  It will apply to ready mix and concrete block products.  It is a terrible infliction on decent, honest people who had nothing to do with the issues caused by pyrite.</p>  <p>  I have many worries in respect of our health services, some of which might be ironed out as the day goes on.  We have often heard that the devil is in the detail but I hope that is not the case here.  I fought bravely for Parkinson's sufferers and neurologist nurses.  I do not know if measures in that regard are going to be announced by the Minister for Health.  It seems a lot of money is to be allocated to health but we do not know where it is going.  We badly want some funds released to mental health services.  I mentioned the situation in Bantry General Hospital to the Taoiseach earlier.  The hospital has lost seven beds in its mental health unit.  I hope there is a budget set aside to address that.  Will money be put forward for the endoscopy and stroke units in the hospital?  The Taoiseach and another Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy keep singing and talking about that issue but there is not a block in the ground.</p>  <p>  In respect of fuel and energy, many people misread the budget document.  As it was printed, it seemed as if the Government was reducing the cost of diesel by 16 cents.  People thought that would provide some relief for the mothers and fathers throughout the country who are struggling.  Sadly, the devil was in the detail.  When looked at in more detail, that is just a continuation of a relief that was given before.  That is farcical.  Carbon taxes are going up next week.  The Government is going to try to offset that somehow but there will not be one brown cent for the people reliant on home heating oil or diesel or petrol cars.  The Government has not put a price cap on the electricity companies.  People are still paying hundreds of euro in standing charges.</p>  <p>  There has been a drop in the transport budget.  Areas from Dunmanway to Clonakilty, Drimoleague to Skibbereen, Ballineen to Goleen, Bantry and Gort have received no extra transport services in the two and a half years the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has been in government.  He is supposed to have a super new dream of connecting Ireland.  The Government has provided no extra transport service.  That is not going down well in rural Ireland.  We are paying for all the carbon tax.  We have every right to kick up a fuss and ask why we do not have public transport.  In all the time he has been in government, the Minister has not provided one extra service.</p>  <p>  Relief has been given on the diesel for fishing throughout the world, where it is appreciated.  The French and everybody else are giving some relief to fisherman but, sadly, we are not.  I spoke last night about farmers, education and capitation grants.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-28a.325" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1580" speakername="Danny Healy-Rae" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092800033#FF00300"><p>I thank the Ministers for the positive aspects of the budget.  We do not have to go through that, to be fair, but I thank them.  However, what came over the Ministers to make them introduce a levy on concrete?  This is supposed to the Government with the mantra of housing for all.  What did it do?  It put a 10% levy on concrete blocks when people are trying to fulfil their basic needs by putting a roof over their heads.  A grant was allocated for farm buildings for the storage of slurry but then it was taken away by the increase in the cost of concrete.  It is absolutely ridiculous.  I honestly think that a team of men and women who spent a week in the horrors of drink would not come up with such a ridiculous proposal.  I ask the Government to rescind that measure.  It is unfair.</p>  <p>  The Minister promised people on the road who have been paying up to &euro;2.20 per litre for green diesel and petrol that he would do something for them in the budget.  He has not done so.  Green diesel is &euro;1.30 per litre.  Hauliers, farmers and people in industry are all suffering.  All the prices for tenders that were put out for public works to build houses will need to be readjusted immediately.  There are no Mother Teresas in that industry.  The Government will have to pay extra money for those people to build houses.</p>  <p>  The Government talks about the fuel allowance but still forgets the people in receipt of benefit payments, including those on illness benefits, jobseeker's benefit, maternity benefit, disability benefit and occupational injuries benefit.</p> <p>All those people paid stamps to get that benefit payment and, as I highlighted previously, they will not qualify for fuel allowance.  It is totally unfair.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-28a.327" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1569" speakername="Joan Collins" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092800034#GG00200"><p>I raised a number of issues regarding the budget during my speech yesterday.  The budget had two key tasks; to cap and reduce energy prices and to target supports at those most in need.  I pointed out that the Government did not fundamentally succeed in either task.  While we welcome some of the initiatives, such as the once-off payment, the most straightforward, effective way to deal with soaring energy costs is to cap the energy companies and the units.  The Government says this will only hand money over to the energy companies but if it brings in a windfall or emergency tax on those companies, it will get the money to put back in people's pockets.  The Government is funding &euro;600 in energy credits but that will go straight to the coffers of the energy companies, which means it is doing the same thing with that measure.  I also raised the issue of welfare payments not being high enough.  The roadmap for social inclusion committed to introduce benchmarking of the State pension by budget 2019.  That would have meant a &euro;40 increase by now, but the Government is giving a measly &euro;12 on top of &euro;5 last year and nothing for the previous two years.  I also made some points about other issues.</p>  <p>  I will go straight to the point I was at during yesterday's debate, which is the matter of the &euro;500 tax rebate that I am sure will be welcomed by those squeezed to the limit in the private rental sector, even though many will not be able to benefit from it, but in dealing with the crisis of unaffordable, insecure housing it is meaningless.  A sum of &euro;500 equates to somewhere between a third to a quarter of the average monthly rent and without a rent freeze, which the Government has said it will not introduce, it means very little.  The housing crisis has developed over decades as a consequence of what could be called a "special relationship" between the political establishment, developers and bankers and cannot be solved overnight.  A solution is possible, however, and the sooner it is adopted as a policy, the sooner the crisis can be overcome.  That policy means ending the reliance on the private sector and international investment funds, establishing a safe housing company with the ability to build 100,000 cost rental traditional council houses directly on State-owned lands already rezoned to build 100,000 units.</p>  <p>  Where are the alarm bells going off in the political establishment regarding the huge official figures for homelessness of 10,568 people in emergency accommodation, which is up 30% on last year?  There has been a staggering 47% rise in the number of homeless children in the past year, from 2,029 last July to 3,137 this July.  That means nearly three children become homeless every single day.  That is an absolute national disgrace.  Unofficial figures from Simon Communities of Ireland indicate that almost 20,000 are couch-surfing and in cars.</p>  <p>  The crisis in the public healthcare system will continue with hundreds of thousands on waiting lists for access to care, hundreds on trolleys in emergency departments, and mental health care services that are not fit for purpose, especially for our young people.  I predicted the Sl&aacute;intecare report introduced and accepted by the then Government would be filed away in a drawer in the Department of Health with a note, "not to be implemented", attached.  Unfortunately, I have been proved correct.  It has been taken up piecemeal.  The basic requirement of recruitment and retention is crucial to our health service and we are not dealing with that basic issue.  No matter what extra measures the Government brings in, they will not be implemented unless we have the staff to do it.  That is the key thing.</p>  <p>  It has been suggested that we need a change of Government.  I do not disagree with that.  Governments come and go.  We need a radical transformation in how our economy and society functions, not just in Ireland but internationally.  I was proud to be on last Saturday's march, along with 20,000 other people, as part of the cost-of-living crisis campaign.  I sincerely hope it is the beginning of a new movement that will fight for such a transformation.</p>  <p>  It is a very strange situation that the biggest giveaway budget in the history of the State will leave most people worse off.  Those who have done best out of this budget are two working adults with children who will gain more than &euro;2,000 due to income tax changes, one-off energy payments or child benefits, back-to-school reductions in cr&egrave;che costs, free GP visits for under-18s and cuts to third-level fees, but with inflation, and energy cost increases in particular, even they will be worse off and those on the minimum wage, lower wages, the State pension or welfare will be worse off. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-28a.328" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1577" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092800034#GG00300"><p>I too will pick up where I stopped yesterday, when I talked about a republic of conscience.  It is incumbent on us to reflect on what services are essential in a republic.  I do not expect to hold the attention of the Ministers of State because this has been sold as a fantastic giveaway budget.  Indeed, one member of the "supreme court", a journalist, actually clapped for the Minister when he finished speaking yesterday, which was very unusual.</p>  <p>  We want a critical analysis and not to come to the Chamber negatively.  I looked to the commentators on the ground, including Mr. Michael Taft, Social Justice Ireland and many other organisations.  I will consider Social Justice Ireland's statement in the short time I have.  It used language it never used before.  It stated that this budget "will see the rich-poor gap grow and the real value of the core social welfare rates fall.  This is a disgraceful outcome".  I do not agree with everything that Social Justice Ireland says.  I have serious concerns about its endorsement of the carbon tax but I cannot fault its analysis and its use of the strong word, "disgraceful".</p>  <p>  Social Justice Ireland goes on to look at housing in terms of "Vacant Ambition", which is a very good heading.  It states that "According to preliminary estimates from Census 2022, there were 166,752 vacant homes on Census night".  There were three vacant homes for every household on the list.  In Galway city, I understand that homeless people turning up to access services are told those services are full and that they should find a couch, although maybe it is not being put quite like that.  I quoted homeless figures of 10,568 yesterday.  The Minister of State seems to be always present for this particular part of the debate.  I recognise the bona fides of both Ministers of State who are in the Chamber.  When they look at the figure of 10,568, at what number will they say it is worth looking at the Government's housing policy and saying that maybe it is not working?  Are homeless people just going to be collateral damage?  Will it be 20,000 people who are homeless before the Government will say, "Oh good Lord, we really should look at this"?  What is the magic figure?  What is the magic figure for health?  There is a two-year waiting list to get triage for orthopaedic procedures, two more years, if you are lucky, to get on a list and, if you are very lucky, you will be sent to a private hospital in Kilkenny or some other hospital, depending on your definition of luck and so on.  If we look at the figures for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, we find we put more money aside in the budget for that.</p>  <p>  Of course, the budget in helping people to have warmer homes and food on their plates and implementing short-term measures for that is essential.  I welcome that, but such measures have to be part of an overall sustainable plan that has to be transformative.  We have no choice.  These words have to mean something.  When the Taoiseach talked his morning about a budget that is sensible, progressive and fair, quoted the Fiscal Advisory Council and mentioned the ESRI, I wonder what language we are using.  What is fair about 10,500 people, and more than 3,000 children, homeless directly as a result of Government policy?  What is progressive about that?  What is progressive about paying money to back up the huge profits of the energy companies without bringing in a cap on prices and without nationalisation or, at least, a plan to take over energy companies because they are essential?  Housing, health, energy, public health and public transport are essential for a civilised society.</p>  <p>  At what point after 2019, when we declared a climate emergency, do we realise we cannot go on as usual?  We cannot just give money to businesses.  I am absolutely for small and medium enterprises that need support but they need support based on conditions that will lead to transformative change.  If we are giving money in a non-targeted way to energy companies, those large consumers of energy, such as data centres and all the others, are getting public money.  There is something seriously amiss in our mentality.  We do the right things when we declare a climate emergency and give extra money to biodiversity, which I welcome, but overall we continue with the same vision of endless consumption.</p> <p>We give a little hand up to those who are down but we do not recognise it is the system that is keeping them down.  We give them a little bit to keep warm during the winter and we worry whether they will need a little bit more towards the middle of the winter but we will have no transformative action.</p></speech>

I have been banging on about this for a long time.  The statistics and figures show it.  Europe has downgraded the region <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>other European regions for the second time in three years.  It has now gone from a region in transition to a lagging region.  The statistics are there.  I will not bore the Minister of State by quoting them to him.  I have done that many times.  I had hoped there would have been something in yesterday's budget or some statement from either of the Ministers to give me a bit of hope this Government would do something to reverse the ever-widening gap, which is a fact.</p><p>There is something that can still be done.  I am not sure whether the decision has been taken but, if we could maintain the 9% rate of VAT for the tourism and hospitality sector, it would have a national impact, which would be a good thing, but, crucially, it would have a much greater impact in the northern and western region and in the Border regions.  It would be very significant.  There are many reasons for this.  Tourism and hospitality are very important sectors in that region.  We do not have the same number of high-value jobs as other parts of the country.  Our indigenous tourism and hospitality sector is very valuable not just for our larger towns like Sligo and Carrick-on-Shannon but for many smaller towns like Drumshanbo, Boyle, Tubbercurry, Enniscrone, Manorhamilton and Ballyshannon and for many small villages.  I will not name them because there are so many villages where the local hotel, guesthouse, restaurant or caf&eacute; plays a pivotal role in supporting local jobs and in ensuring local produce is served while also being a social space for both locals and tourists.  Given that tourism and hospitality play such a pivotal role in the economic and social fabric of the northern and western region, any increase in the VAT rate will have an especially detrimental impact on the indigenous economy and will, in fact, accelerate the growing regional disparities.  This is something the Government can do within this budget.  As I have said, it would have a national impact but it will have a greater impact in the Border regions.</p><p>The Ministers of State will be aware, as we are, that there is a more immediate issue, that of the drop in the value of sterling compared with the euro.  This will impact nationally but will hit even harder in the Border regions.  How can hotels, restaurants, caf&eacute;s and guesthouses remain competitive when their counterparts across the Border benefit from sterling being weaker?  The strength of the euro is already a great challenge but, on top of that, if the VAT rate is increased at the end of February, many businesses will be unable to compete.  The truth is Irish people will vote with their feet and travel north.  Tourists will be coming in but, with a strong euro and a strong dollar, where will they travel?  They will travel to where they get the best value in hospitality.  Those businesses will be north of the Border.  No matter how the businesses south of the Border try to remain competitive, they will not be able to.  Even in that, I am not factoring in the significant jump in energy prices.</p><p>What we could unfortunately see, although I hope we do not, is a domino effect taking hold.  Tourism businesses in the northern and western region have to absorb significantly higher costs, as do all other businesses, but they also have to compete with a sector in Northern Ireland that is much more competitive because of sterling being weak.  If we pile on a 50% increase in the VAT rate on top of that, some businesses will just not be able to take the escalating costs.  I am a making strong case for the Government maintaining a 9% VAT rate for hospitality and tourism now and for at least the next 12 to 18 months.  It is perhaps not the most popular thing to say but I have to look at the area and region I represent and that would make a significant difference.  It will matter nationally and that is good but it would be a crucial intervention in the Border counties.</p></speech>

This represents an additional &euro;1.1 billion in current expenditure and &euro;117 million in capital expenditure.  It includes over &euro;250 million for new measures, bringing the core health funding to over &euro;22.5 billion.  It includes a once-off allocation of &euro;757 million to deal with Covid-19 and its ongoing impact and the damage it has done to public health and our healthcare system.  This investment shows the Government is fully committed to delivering on the vision of universal healthcare &ndash; a public healthcare system that provides everyone with affordable and high-quality care when they need it.</p>  <p>  My focus in budget 2023, as it has been since I was appointed Minister for Health, is on improving affordability for patients, improving access to services and extending and improving services for patients.  There is no doubt but that we are facing uncertain times this winter.  As part of the wider Government plan to tackle cost-of-living pressures, I am introducing measures to improve the affordability of healthcare.  I am happy to announce that budget 2023 has provided an extensive package in additional funding for new measures, as well as significant money for once-off measures.  This funding will allow us to make GP care free for hundreds of thousands of extra people who are on, or below, the median income.  It is a landmark move and will ensure more than half the population will have free access to GP care.  We are abolishing inpatient charges for hospitals completely from April 2023.  Charges for children have already been abolished in the past few weeks.  Soon, adults will no longer face these charges, which can amount to &euro;800 a year.  I could not, as Minister for Health, stand over having debt collectors pursue patients for money that was technically owed for vital healthcare they received in our public hospitals.  I would like to acknowledge the many groups, including the Irish Cancer Society in particular, that campaigned so hard and so well on this issue.  We listened carefully and we have acted.</p>  <p>  Another measure that is being introduced in this budget is the extension of free contraception scheme to cover women from 16 to 30 years of age.  Women&rsquo;s healthcare, as Deputies know, has been a priority for me, the Ministers of State and this Government since it came into office.  We launched the first ever women&rsquo;s healthcare plan earlier this year.  Now, we are continuing to fund additional services into next year.  We will deliver a human papillomavirus, HPV, catch-up programme to girls and boys at school and to women aged up to 25.  The catch-up programme is due to commence before the end of this year.  As I said some months ago, I am determined that women and couples can access IVF in our public health service.  This will take time to phase in.  I have secured funding of &euro;10 million to support access to IVF in budget 2023.  However, I want to be clear that this is just the beginning.  My goal is to have a publicly-funded system that is accessible to all who need to avail of IVF services.</p>  <p>  On top of these measures, I am also pleased to deliver, along with the Ministers of State, Deputies Butler, Feighan and Rabbitte, extra one-off funding for the coming winter of &euro;110 million to support community-based voluntary organisations.  They are an essential pillar in the provision of health services across the country.  This fund is being made available in recognition of the challenges faced by the sector in delivering and maintaining health and social care services against a backdrop of increased inflationary pressures.  A detailed plan to disburse these funds is being finalised.</p>  <p>  It is clear that some patients - too many patients - face unacceptable delays in accessing healthcare.  For next year, I have secured overall funding of &euro;443 million specifically targeted at tackling waiting lists and getting people the care they need when they need it.  It includes recurrent funding for the HSE, as well as funding for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.</p> <p>It includes additional funding for the provision of general practitioner diagnostics, which is one of the great successes in our move towards integrated and universal healthcare.  Significant resources are also being allocated to the continued implementation of the national clinical strategies, which have received unprecedented levels of funding in recent years.  We are also funding a number of new strategies for the first time, which we are delighted to do.  These include strategies relating to stroke, bariatrics and obesity, national genetics and genomics, diabetes and neurorehabilitation.</p> <p> Budget 2023 funds our ongoing Covid response.  More than that, it is also about making healthcare affordable for people.  It is about improving access to care for patients, building, extending and improving services, and it is about building capacity.  Over the past two years, this Government has delivered record increases in hospital bed capacity, critical care capacity, and the number of healthcare staff working across our health services.  We have hired more than 15,000 staff since the start of 2020.  This includes 4,500 nurses and midwives, 2,300 health and social care professionals and 1,400 doctors.  2020 and 2021 have seen the biggest staff increases since the HSE was established.  We have made real progress in addressing a long-standing deficit in critical care capacity and other areas, including the workforce.  In 2020 we had 255 critical care beds.  We are on track to have 336 by the end of this year and we will move forward quickly.  We are delivering.  We have a clear plan.  Budget 2023 reaffirms this Government&rsquo;s absolute commitment to universal healthcare.</p></speech>

It will underpin implementation of the Sharing the Vision and Connecting for Life strategies.  It delivers almost &euro;72.8 million in additional funding for next year, comprising &euro;14 million for new developments, &euro;43.8 million for existing services, a further &euro;10 million in once-off funding for minor capital works and a further &euro;5 million for once-off funding supports.  The budget will support my continued focus on youth mental health.  Following discussions with the HSE and Mr. Paul Reid to progress mental health priorities, as is in the programme for Government, I am pleased to say that we have agreed a new post.  It is for a youth mental health lead at assistant national director grade within the HSE.  Funding for this post is included in this year's budget and recruitment will commence as soon as possible.  We will continue to progress the full implementation of the Maskey report on child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in conjunction with the current review which the Mental Health Commission is undertaking and the HSE audits of CAMHS.</p>  <p>  Some &euro;750,000 has been allocated to commence a new initiative by funding counselling psychology training places in 2023.  There is funding for the new community access support team, which is a partnership approach between HSE mid-west mental health services and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Additional funding for the Traveller health plan and implementation of the mental health actions of the plan has been secured.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to announce that I have secured an additional &euro;180 million of funding for services for older people for winter 2022 and into 2023.  Long-term residential care will be supported through &euro;47 million of additional funding for the nursing homes support scheme to maintain services and manage inflationary increases.  Today, I am delighted to announce that the temporary assistance payment scheme for nursing homes will be extended to the end of the year and refocused on addressing this year's inflationary pressures related to energy and heating.  Details are being finalised and these will be communicated in the coming days.</p>  <p>  We will allocate &euro;5.2 million to roll out the healthy age friendly homes initiative.  This will enable older people to avoid early admission to residential care by remaining in their own homes or right-sizing.</p></speech>

Additional funding has been secured to fund increased clinical obesity services in budget 2023.  To support sexual health, &euro;600,000 is being allocated to expand and further support the online testing service for sexually transmitted infections, STIs, and to support the national condom distribution service.  Supports for sexual health also include additional funding for contraception, for both men and for women.  The free contraception scheme for 17 to 25-year-old women, as mentioned by the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, yesterday, has been funded to expand the age range to those aged 16 to 30 during 2023.  Funding for sexual health also includes supports for the national condom distribution service, which, in line with increased availability of free prescription contraception for women, will be made more widely available through GP surgeries and family planning clinics.</p>  <p>  Budget 2023 provides additional supports of &euro;750,000 for social prescribing, for which supports now total &euro;950,000.  In budget 2023, I secured &euro;10.5 million in additional recurring funding for the national drugs strategy and inclusion health.  Of this, &euro;7 million is for new developments, including &euro;4 million for the expansion of  community and residential addiction services under the national drugs strategy and &euro;3 million to improve access to healthcare services for socially excluded groups.  In addition, I have provided &euro;3.5 million for community and voluntary providers to maintain the existing level of drug and alcohol and inclusion health services.  This is the first allocation to meet the costs of providing existing levels of services in recent years.  The additional funding for the national drugs strategy reflects the six strategic priorities identified for the remaining four years of the strategy, 2022 to 2025.  It will strengthen the health-led approach to drug and alcohol use, through reducing the harms for individuals, families and communities, and promoting rehabilitation and recovery.</p>  <p>  Within the &euro;4 million envelope, I have allocated &euro;900,000 to ensure the sustainability and increase the capacity of tier 4 residential services.  This funding will allow for commissioning of up to 30 new treatment episodes.  Further, I am providing &euro;850,000 to expand integrated care pathways for high-risk drug and alcohol users, including gender-specific services.  This funding will establish new residential addiction treatment services for women in Meath and Wicklow and provide an integrated community alcohol service in Mayo.  I am allocating an additional &euro;1 million to strengthen the monitoring of emerging drug trends.</p></speech>

This was published as part of the budget day documentation.  The report notes that the first three income deciles, that is, those people who have the lowest incomes in the State, will proportionally benefit the most from the package of measures introduced under the budget.  Increases in social welfare measures play a particularly important role for people in the lower income deciles.</p>  <p>  Research that I commissioned from the ESRI earlier this year on the most effective ways to reduce poverty found that measures such as weekly rate increases, fuel allowance, the improvement to the working family payment thresholds that we saw yesterday and qualified child increases are effective mechanisms for reducing poverty.</p>  <p>  As part of budget 2023, I am pleased to have secured funding to develop and implement a new scheme to tackle the issue of food poverty.  This programme will further progress the work of the food poverty working group, which I established last year and comprises officials from a range of Departments, along with representatives from the community and voluntary sector.  A procurement process will be run for the programme, which will be informed by research commissioned by the working group.  The research is currently under way and is scheduled to be reported at the end of the year.  It will also be informed by a report completed by my Department earlier this year on the range of initiatives and activities of various Departments on preventing and addressing food poverty.</p>  <p>  Regarding my role in the Department of Rural and Community Development, I wish to reassure the community and voluntary sector that we are in the process of developing a scheme to help community and voluntary organisations to cushion the impact of the increased energy bills this winter.  There will be more news on that in the coming weeks.  Yesterday also saw an increase in the budget for the community services programme, which will allow us to introduce the restructured programme next year, with the new and fairer funding model.</p>  <p>  Many Deputies will be aware of the new community centre investment fund.</p> <p>There will be news about that in the third quarter this year, which is quite soon.  It has been hugely oversubscribed but I am glad to say that yesterday we secured an increase in the budget for that.  There is &euro;20 million in funding for the community centre investment fund, to provide funding for upgrade and improvements to existing centres and to allow a new funding stream to support new centres where they are needed.</p> <p> We have a national volunteering policy that is being delivered.  We are delivering it with our partners in the community and voluntary sector across the country.  Because we are investing in it we have a funded volunteer centre in every county, with funded staff.  This budget will see the extraordinary capacity and work of our volunteer centres grow with an extra &euro;1 million invested yesterday.</p></speech>

The core budget of 2023 of &euro;6.9 billion was made up of &euro;5.8 billion in expenditure measures, much of which we have been hearing about in the past few moments, and &euro;1.1 billion in tax measures.  Given the urgency of the challenge that we face, &euro;4.1 billion of the overall package will be once-off measures to help people this year.  The Government is not borrowing any money to fund this budget.  These new measures are only possible due to the strong growth and tax receipts experienced in our economy, and our sound management of the economy since this Government was formed.  Budget 2023's strategy puts people and their quality of life first.</p>  <p>  I will now give an indication of some of the key measures we have put in place.  There will be a broad range of measures to support households on low and middle incomes.  The Government is providing for electricity credits for all households totalling &euro;600, to be paid in three instalments of &euro;200 each.  The first payment will be made in November and a further two instalments in the new year.  A &euro;400 lump sum payment to all households receiving the fuel allowance will be paid in November.  There will be across-the-board welfare increases in weekly payments of &euro;12 from January.</p>  <p>  A double week once-off payment for social welfare recipients will be given before Christmas and there will be a once-off payment before Christmas of &euro;200 to the recipients of the living alone allowance.  For example, older people living on their own will get an additional &euro;2,375 from a combination of the above measures between now and the end of next year as a result of yesterday's announcement.</p>  <p>  There will be a reduction of up to 25% in the weekly fees for childcare costs.  This will put &euro;175 a month, or &euro;2,000 per year back into the pockets of parents next year.  In November we will also make a double child benefit payment, which is worth &euro;140 per child, in addition to the normal monthly payment.</p>  <p>  To support low-income households, we are providing an additional lump sum payment of &euro;500 to those in receipt of the working family payment, formerly known as family income supplement.  This will take place in November.</p>  <p>  Budget 2023 will see funding for free school books for all pupils of primary school from September of next year.  This will reduce the back-to-school costs for parents nationwide.</p>  <p>  There is also large income tax package in the budget which means married couples each on &euro;30,000 would save a combined total of &euro;532 next year.</p>  <p>  Renters will be able to avail of two tax credits in 2023.  The new rent tax credit, valued at &euro;500 per year, is for every person renting.  The measure is aimed at those who do not get any other housing supports, and will apply in 2023 and subsequent years.  The Government is providing that it can also be claimed in respect of rent paid in 2022.</p>  <p>  The Government has prioritised education.  There will be a reduction in the staffing schedules by one point in all primary schools, which will bring it to the lowest level in our history.  This will necessitate the employment of 370 additional new teachers, which is being funded in this budget.  Budget 2023 will also deliver 686 special education teachers and an additional 1,994 special needs assistants, SNAs coming on stream in 2023.  For the first time ever, we will have more than 19,000 teachers working in the area of special education and 20,000 special education needs assistants.</p>  <p>  To support students and their families there will be a once-off reduction in the student contribution of &euro;1,000 for eligible students in the 2022-23 educational year, and a once-off double of monthly payment for those in receipt of the SUSI maintenance grant.  There will also be a &euro;1,000 increase in the postgraduate tuition fee contribution grant.</p>  <p>  The Government is extending the 20% public transport fare reduction and the youth travel card discount of 50% to all operators in 2023. There are additional payments of &euro;500 to carers.  The Government is introducing a temporary business energy support scheme to assist businesses with their energy costs over the coming months.  If there is an increase in the average unit price of more than 50%, the business will be able access this scheme.  The support will be calculated on the basis of 40% of the amount of the increase in the bill amount, based on the unit cost.  The details will be in the Finance Bill. </p>  <p>  We will also introduce a windfall gains tax here in Ireland, if the European Union does not do so.  I am pleased to see that we have reduced or eliminated the VAT on defibrillators and newspapers.  Overall, this cost-of-living budget provides much needed support in the final months of this year for all citizens in Ireland, and into next year as well. </p></speech>

Year in and year out, winter after winter, the health service is in crisis management mode.  After this budget the health service will, unfortunately, still be in crisis.  Waiting lists will continue to spiral out of control.  There are now more than 910,000 people on hospital waiting lists and a backlog of more than 225,000 people waiting for a diagnostic scan.  Children with disabilities cannot get access to vital therapies.  People with mental health challenges are abandoned to struggle in silence.  Home help hours cannot be filled, leaving older people unsupported and uncared for.  Almost 1,000 consultant posts are either vacant or filled on temporary contracts.  Even private GP services are stretched thin.  Out-of-hours services are collapsing, which is heaping more pressure on overcrowded emergency departments where the average wait is now over half a day.  Over the course of the past two years, we have seen the dental treatment service scheme collapse, with dentists leaving at a rate of knots.</p>  <p>  More than five years on from publication of the Sl&aacute;intecare report, the Government has yet to agree a new public only consultant contract, to resolve long-standing disputes with workers from junior doctors to medical scientists or to put in the capacity to create an equitable universal health service.  This budget, unfortunately, will be cold comfort for the 100,000 children languishing on hospital waiting lists.  There are 20,000 children with disabilities who are still waiting for initial contact with a disability network team, never mind the follow-up therapies and interventions.  I have travelled the State over the past number of months and have met many parents of children with disabilities.  It is one of the most heartbreaking things have to do, to listen to parents of children with disabilities talk about the love they have for their child and how they are doing everything they can to fight the system and to battle the system.  Yet, their children go without the supports and services they need.  We have so many posts funded and yet we cannot build them.  As I said to the head of the HSE today at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health, I do not see a plan that is going to solve those problems and I do not see anything of substance in the budget from the Minister of State, apart from more outsourcing.</p>  <p>  Children with scoliosis and spina bifida are continuously being told that they are a priority and that they would get their surgeries, but time and again they are let down and failed by a creaking health service.  Additional funding was made available last year to carry out more surgeries for children with spina bifida and scoliosis, and I welcome that.  We saw improvements in the wait times at Cappagh hospital.  We saw, however, a regression of wait times in the other two children's hospitals.  I do not believe that this is acceptable and I do not believe there is anything in this budget that will tackle this problem.</p>  <p>  This year's budget is yet more proof that the Government does not have a plan for the health service.  The Government does not have a real plan for waiting lists, for free GP care, or for removing private healthcare from public hospitals.  In fact, the Government has not even started that process, which is a key part of Sl&aacute;intecare.  It is clear that the Government does not have a plan to address the major workforce challenges facing the health service to train, recruit and retain enough healthcare workers to deliver additional capacity and to make real change.</p>  <p>  This year my party leader was in Australia, Canada, and the United States and met many healthcare workers.</p> <p>Some leave because they want to develop skills.  They might want to leave for a couple of years and some will come home.  Many, however, said they left because of our creaking health service, because they did not feel valued and because of a range of recruitment and retention issues where promises had been made time and again by successive Ministers for Health that had not been delivered.  We should be moving heaven and Earth to get as many of those people as possible back working in our public system and delivering the health services people need.  That will require a step change in workforce planning that I do not see from the Minister or his Government.  </p> <p> This budget was an opportunity for a different approach but it has been squandered.  Despite the best will and talent in the health service, it is in perpetual crisis because of the severe lack of capacity.  Still the Government has not included a single red cent for additional acute inpatient hospital beds next year.  Beds which were funded in previous budgets will be delivered but there is no new funding for new beds in any of the measures that I can see.  Instead, despite the big promises and big announcement the budget represents more of the same: a continuation of outsourcing and crisis management.  The amount of money that the Government is spending on outsourcing through the National Treatment Purchase Fund and outsourcing diagnostic capacity is staggering compared with the &euro;250 million of new measures contained in this budget which do not go anywhere near enough to what is required to deal with the crisis in our hospitals.  Less than one-tenth of 1% of an increase in acute services, or &euro;4 million, that is the increase in new measures in the budget.  There are people on hospital trolleys and languishing on waiting lists.  The Minister only needs to read his own budget.  I have.  It is &euro;4 million in additional new measures in acute services at a time when we have record numbers of people on hospital trolleys.  For me, that is unacceptable.  </p> <p> Making big promises and throwing out big numbers is not a plan or budget.  Two years ago the Minister announced 1,100 additional beds.  Some of those are still not delivered.  Last year he announced 10,000 staff and only half were delivered.  Now he has announced 340,000 more people will get access to free GP care.  I welcome that but there is no plan on how to deliver it.  The Minister has not put the capacity in and without that, it will fall flat on its face.</p></speech>

I listened intently yesterday as his colleagues announced an increase of &euro;57.8 million in mental health spending overall but of that, only &euro;14 million is for additional funding for new measures.  A total of &euro;43 million is for existing levels of services.  That is basically standing-still money.  After the &euro;57.8 million figure was read in the D&aacute;il, the Minister tweeted that &euro;72.8 million was actually allocated and he doubled down on that again in his contribution to the House.  The &euro;15 million that the Minister miraculously found down the back of a sofa somewhere has been allocated for 2022, not 2023.  He has attempted to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear.  Stakeholders who might have been singing the Minister's praise yesterday are already starting to see through this.  Why was the &euro;72.8 million figure not included in yesterday's budget book?</p>  <p>  I am always very mindful of people watching who may be experiencing mental health difficulties.  The last thing that they want to see is people like ourselves arguing the toss over budgets.  They want and deserve to see solutions.  Sinn F&eacute;in in government would have delivered over &euro;81 million in real additional measures compared with the &euro;14 million the Minister announced.  We are not doing the sow's ear trick.  In fact we are more like Ronseal: we do exactly what it says on the tin.  </p>  <p>  If I was Minister with responsibility for mental health I would have introduced measures including the expansion of CAMHS to young adults and an inpatient perinatal mother and baby mental health unit, a move to a 24-7 emergency mental health system and investment into early intervention for psychosis and for eating disorders.  I welcome the announcement that the Minister will appoint a youth mental health lead because, by God, it is needed.  The Maskey report into south Kerry has highlighted the abject failure in children's mental health services.  Over 4,000 children are waiting for an appointment with CAMHS of whom 400 have been waiting for more than a year.  Thousands of children have been refused treatment with CAMHS.  Some 1,200 children arrived at emergency departments seeking mental health supports.  There are 11,000 children waiting on primary care psychology service, of whom 4,000 have been waiting over a year.   Things have just got worse under this Government. </p>  <p>  I also welcome the new funding the Minister announced for trainee counsellor psychologists.  That is something we have been calling for.  Can he guarantee that when these trainees are qualified, they will be hired by the HSE?  In the past five years, the HSE has spent over &euro;38 million on salaries and fees for trainee clinical psychologists but did not hire one.  I could go on but I am running out of speaking time.  The Government is running out of time too but children simply do not have the time.  </p></speech>

It is an insult to those working on the front line, to those in our community who are saving lives and families every single day.  Sinn F&eacute;in's addiction and recovery budget was ten times that of the Minister.  It was a &euro;45 million suite of measures that would not have fixed all the problems but would have made a real difference.  The Minister delivered a weak half-hearted, unambitious &euro;4 million.</p>  <p>  A survey by Merchants Quay Ireland found that six in ten Irish adults have direct experience of addiction either through family members, friends or themselves.  The Minister has failed to deliver for every single one of those people in the budget that was announced yesterday.  We would have restored power to the community sector.  Drug and alcohol task forces are still operating with 11% less funding than they had 11 years ago.  The Minister did not add one red cent to those this year.  How can the Government stand over that budget?  With &euro;11 billion announced yesterday, what has it delivered for the addiction services?  It is too little.  It is so disrespectful to those in addiction, those in recovery and those who are trying to support them.  </p>  <p>  We are faced with a Minister who did not go to bat for the vulnerable people he is supposed to represent.  People, families and communities deserve better.  They deserve a Minister who understands, listens and acts.  They deserve a Minister and a Government that care.  The budget announced yesterday is not that.  </p>  <p>  I listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming speaking earlier.  How is it possible that a person who earns over &euro;100,000 a year will be four times better off than people who earn &euro;36,000 or less?  The facts are clear.  The people have said it today and not just Sinn F&eacute;in or the Opposition.  ALONE, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and all the other groups have said that this budget has not delivered for ordinary people.  It has not delivered for health or for housing, for pensioners or for students.  It must be unbelievable for a Government to have &euro;11 billion to spend and to make a bags of the budget.  The people will not forget it.  </p></speech>

It just does not go far enough for those who really need it.  Time and again we are reminded that the community and voluntary sector must be recognised and nurtured.  The buzzword I have heard over the past 24 hours is that we are all valued.  However, many in the community and voluntary sector are feeling very far from valued.  The cost of living and energy continue to rise and why?  It is because the Government has refused to reduce electricity prices and cap them at pre-crisis levels, something that Sinn F&eacute;in would do in government.</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party have left workers, families and the community and voluntary sector exposed to further price hikes.  While I welcome any extra funding for the sector, the measures introduced yesterday are simply not enough.  For already-stretched communities, this funding is welcome but there is great concern that there will not be enough money to shield them from the rising cost of energy.  Every day, I deal with different sections of the community.  There is genuine fear within projects that the day will come when they will have to switch off the lights and close the doors, whether it is with early days or short weeks.  One-off payments are no substitute for the certainty that a price cap would bring.  We have had debates in this House on the implementation of a living wage for all.  The &euro;3.5 million given yesterday to the community services programme will go nowhere near bridging the pay gap that projects must fund to pay their staff the minimum wage, let alone go anywhere near to achieving the living wage.  </p> <p>The details still need to be explored, but, on the face of it, the small increase will only put further pressure on the community service projects to raise the difference between what is paid by the Department and what is the new minimum wage while at the same time trying to deal with the increased living costs.</p> <p> Community centres are hubs in our communities.  They facilitate many organisations, groups and clubs.  They also facilitate politicians in holding clinics.  We know well the effects the Covid pandemic had on these centres and the lack of income during that time.  Many centres can only dream of retrofitting them to bring them up to the standards required to help them to reduce their energy bills.  The additional funding to the community centre investment fund would need to increase by at least &euro;5 million as called for by Sinn F&eacute;in, the community sector and the Wheel.</p> <p> While the headline figures may be an easy sell, the small print shows that the community and voluntary sector is again being undervalued by the Government.  We need to remember that this sector has not recovered from the savage austerity cuts that it experienced over the last ten years.  It has not got that money back.  The workers have not got the money back and the community projects themselves have not got the money back.</p></speech>

N&iacute; m&oacute;r d&uacute;inn feabhs&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar mhaithe len&aacute;r ndaoine agus t&aacute;imid in ann &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  Cinnteoidh an buis&eacute;ad seo gur f&eacute;idir linn lean&uacute;int ar aghaidh ag t&oacute;g&aacute;il ar an dul chun cinn at&aacute; d&eacute;anta cheana f&eacute;in i dTith&iacute;ocht do Ch&aacute;ch.</p>  <p>  Too many of our people are struggling to buy their own home, pay the rent or secure a roof over their head.  This budget is a major step forward to tackle these problems head on.  It marks an historic &euro;4.5 billion capital investment to underpin our unprecedented Housing for All plan and deliver the largest State homebuilding programme ever, with 9,100 direct-build social homes and 5,500 affordable homes envisaged for 2023.  People owning their own homes is good for families and good for communities.  Our Housing for All plan puts home ownership back at the heart of Irish life and back in the reach of our young people.  To support this, budget 2023 funds a comprehensive &euro;900 million homeownership package to directly support over 15,000 households to buy their own homes next year.  That includes a 30,000 help-to-buy scheme which is extended to 2024.  The &euro;50,000 vacant and derelict property grant has been extended to rural areas and cities.  There is funding of &euro;100 million for the game-changer first home scheme and &euro;90 million for the affordable housing fund.</p>  <p>  Rents are simply too high, and not enough homes are available.  Boosting supply is the key to addressing this but we also need to help renters now.  Housing for All and budget 2023 do both.  There is a &euro;1.2 billion direct renter support package to help 500,000 renters.  That includes the new tax credit of &euro;500 per renter.  That will be payable in early 2023 and backdated to 2022, meaning &euro;1,000 per individual renter in 2023.  We will continue to support over 70,000 households in direct rent-support payments via the housing assistance payment, HAP and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  We will further expand the State-backed affordable cost-rental schemes which have already taken root in our country.</p>  <p>  In order to address the scale of the housing challenge as speedily as possible, we need to make the most of existing buildings.  Budget 2023 contains &euro;209 million for a specific set of measures to help address vacancy and dereliction.  The budget also penalises vacancy and underuse of land with an unprecedented set of taxes.  It introduces a new vacant home tax with a trebling of the local property tax, LPT, for empty homes in order to tackle underused homes.  It continues to roll out the first-ever residential zoned land tax to penalise land hoarding.</p>  <p>  Housing for All is fully funded.  It is a multi-annual plan with homeownership delivery at its heart in contrast to the plan put forward by the main Opposition party which is riddled with enormous black holes.  The Sinn F&eacute;in alternative budget commits to delivering an additional 2,900 new social homes by 2023 above Government targets.  However, its cost per unit makes no allowance for inflation or supply chain issues.  It based its cost directly on housing delivery in 2021.  It is not credible for anyone to claim that they can deliver more units quicker with less money despite inflation.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin knows this but he simply stumbled over that truth before picking himself up and carrying on as if nothing happened.</p>  <p>  In addition, there is another gaping &euro;300 million black hole at the heart of Sinn F&eacute;in's new tax credit proposal.  With more than 400,000 renters eligible, the Sinn F&eacute;in proposal would cost &euro;600 million, yet it has only allowed for &euro;300 million.  Sinn F&eacute;in must publish its detailed costings and be honest with renters.  We are doing something to help that is real.  Sinn F&eacute;in needs to publish the costings and fess up to the fact that it is missing &euro;300 million</p>  <p>  The one thing we are clear about regarding Sinn F&eacute;in's alternative budget is that it is against home ownership.  Further proof of that is that it would scrap the help-to-buy scheme which has helped 32,000 households to buy and own their own homes.  It proposes to scrap the first home scheme which allows the State to step in and help with equity for the homebuyer with hundreds of homes already being delivered through that.  Inexplicably it would scrap the cro&iacute; connaithe scheme grants of up to &euro;50,000.  Therefore, we know what Sinn F&eacute;in is against, which is clearly home ownership, and it needs to be honest with its figures.</p>  <p>  Chun cr&iacute;ochn&uacute;, cabhr&oacute;idh an ch&aacute;inaisn&eacute;is seo le daoine a &iacute;ocann c&iacute;os, le daoine at&aacute; ag iarraidh teach ar phraghas r&eacute;as&uacute;nta a cheannach agus le daoine at&aacute; ag fanacht ar theach s&oacute;isialta &oacute;n gcomhairle &aacute;iti&uacute;il.

This figure represents a doubling of the 2020 allocation, with overall capital funding increased by more than 80% and current funding increased by 75%.  Such significant investment speaks strongly and eloquently to the commitment of the Government, including the Minister and me, to the built and natural heritage sector.</p>  <p>  While maintaining that trajectory of growth in funding for heritage programmes and agencies, we have also ensured that the operational budgets of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, the National Monuments Service, the Heritage Council and Waterways Ireland have also been considerably enhanced.</p>  <p>  Following the commitment in the programme for Government and the Government decision earlier on this year, I have delivered on the funding committed to the strategic action plan for the renewal of the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Its core capital budget has been increased by over 45%, the current programme budget has been increased by 20%, and its operating budget by a further 20%.  Coupled with the EU funding secured by the organisation and additional funding for the expansion of the local authority biodiversity officers programme through the Heritage Council, combined funding for nature for 2023 is more than &euro;90 million.</p>  <p>  The built heritage arena has also benefited greatly from these increases and I am delighted to announce significant increases in capital support schemes for communities, custodians of heritage properties and also for Waterways Ireland and the Irish Heritage Trust.</p>  <p>  Overall, the funding increase made available to heritage today will benefit six national parks and 74 nature reserves, enable the continuation of NPWS reform and renewal, provide for significant investment in the conservation and restoration of our precious habitats and species, and just as importantly, in the rangers and conservation staff who drive the organisation forward.  It will allow for the continued extension of the biodiversity officers network, progress the completion of the network of heritage officers, further support the national biodiversity data centre, progress the extension of the Ulster Canal with shared island support, and benefit over 1,500 built heritage and national monuments projects.  This funding will touch every community in the country, and will no doubt be deeply appreciated by the 14 million users of our national parks, nature reserves, waterways and national monuments sites.</p>  <p>  I will now deal with the other element of my brief, electoral reform.  I am delighted to have delivered its legislative elements, with the Electoral Reform Act having been enacted in July.  I am determined to further progress and implement those reforms in the course of the coming year.</p> <p>This will include the establishment of an independent electoral commission, to be called an coimisi&uacute;n toghch&aacute;in, which will bring about a more cohesive and efficient administration of electoral functions in Ireland.  It is now in the process of being stood up and its formal establishment will happen in the coming months.  I am delighted to provide an coimisi&uacute;n with significant funding of &euro;5.7 million for the coming year.</p> <p> It will also include the modernisation of the electoral registration process, and the implementation of a new, simplified and more accessible system.  I am pleased to be providing &euro;2.77 million for this work, which will also support local authorities to engage with their communities to improve data quality in respect of the register.</p> <p> I acknowledge the tremendous work of officials in the heritage and franchise sections of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I thank the many advocates for biodiversity, heritage and electoral reform here in the D&aacute;il and also in the Seanad, not least the Minister, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, and the Taoiseach.  By working together collaboratively, this Government is making real, transformative change in these areas, and that is something we can all be proud of.</p></speech>

The housing adaptation grants were significantly increased to try and support people to live in their homes independently, especially people with disabilities.  We have a significant programme of work that will continue in 2023.</p>  <p>  The sum of &euro;27 million has been provided to support the Traveller community, as well as &euro;20 million in increased capital funding, which is an 11% increase.  During my tenure, all the Department&rsquo;s capital funding has been spent, working in conjunction with the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan.  It is very important that we try to keep up the momentum that we developed through Covid-19 to support the community and implement the expert review, which we are doing.</p>  <p>  We have some &euro;333 million in the Local Government Fund, an increase of &euro;108 million.  We have included a number of support mechanisms to stand by local authorities as financial emergency measures in the public interest have been unwound and a number of national pay agreements proceed.  We want to support them in realising the funding and ensure they will not fall short in the delivery of services.  Right throughout the pandemic, local authorities operated the community call with 48 hours&rsquo; notice and provided more than 1,000 services to citizens.  Incredible work was done on the ground.  We are ready to support local authorities.  We also have a &euro;60 million fund for other supports that will happen during the year.  I am aware that 2023 will be a very challenging year for the sector and we need to have a resource base to stand by it.</p>  <p>  I chair the planning and advisory forum, which is reforming the planning and development legislation and ensuring that it is stress-tested and fit for purpose.  There is a significant increase in funding across the planning headlines, with 22% for An Bord Plean&aacute;la, to continue the programme of reform and to ensure that it is fit to deliver the &euro;165 billion of public infrastructure and capital funding with which the Government is going to transform communities in the next decade.</p></speech>

Just as he started to make overinflated claims about his success, the alarm bells started to ring and he, his fellow Ministers, departmental staff and the assembled media had to be evicted.  What that tells us of course is the gap between the Minister's claims and delivery on the ground is growing ever wider.</p><p>With the greatest of respect to the Minister, it takes a certain brass neck to claim that his plan is working when house prices and rents continue to rise and homelessness is at historic levels and set to rise further, and social and affordable housing targets are being missed for the third year in a row.  One of the first things we need to hear from the Minister at some point is how much of this year's budget he will not spend.  We know there is a &euro;240 million carryover from capital spending from last year to this year, but we are only allowed to carry over 10%, so what is the total underspend that the Minister was not able to deliver this year on top of a similar failure last year?</p><p>The Minister likes to hide behind Covid, Ukraine, inflation and supply issues, but the private sector has rebounded.  The private sector is able to meet and exceed its targets, yet we are way behind in social and affordable housing.  The reason is not because of any of the excuses the Minister gives, but matters that are in his gift to reform such as the four-stage approval process and the procurement and tendering rules, yet he has done nothing to address that.</p><p>The Minister has a penchant for quoting large numbers.  If we read the budget book, however, it tells us that the total extra capital spend for housing next year compared with this year is a paltry &euro;37.9 million.  That is in the budget book.  The Minister knows that as well as I do.  His failure to deliver any significant extra capital spend for genuine social and affordable housing will have an impact on delivery.  Social housing targets were only at 7% at the end of the first quarter.  The second quarter's report has mysteriously not appeared, even though we should be getting the third quarter report.  Worse than that is the fact that the Minister has not rolled over the lost social housing units from his missed targets in 2020, 2021, and 2022 into subsequent years.  It means there is a gaping hole in his social housing plan, a key contributor to rising levels of homelessness.</p><p>Likewise with affordable housing, it is way behind target, but the Minister's cost-rental equity loan targets for next year are less than this year's.  The Minister did not include in the budget book what the affordable housing fund targets are going to be for next year and, as a consequence of the under-supply from the local authority and the approved housing body sector he is going to be over-reliant on the LDA.  That is the very same LDA that is to deliver 1,000 cost rental and affordable homes this year and, at best, will deliver a few hundred.</p><p>We need at least 8,000 affordable homes a year, including 4,000 affordable-purchase homes because, unlike the Minister, who says he believes in home ownership but only for people on &euro;100,000 or more a year, I believe in home ownership as well as affordable rental and social rental for ordinary working people, which is something the Minister is not delivering.</p><p>There are historic highs relating to homelessness.  We could be approaching an official figure of 11,000, and there is not a single additional initiative to prevent homelessness or to move people on.  We must consider following Nicola Sturgeon's move in Scotland and introduce a ban on winter evictions.  We also need an acceleration of the tenants <i>in situ </i>scheme and an increase in Housing First.  I hope it does not happen, but the question for the Minister is what he will do if we get a report from his Department in the coming months with an official homeless figure of 11,000.</p><p>With respect to defects, the Government was very silent in its letter to homeowners yesterday that it had only increased its own capital investment in defects by &euro;5 million.  I accept there is a levy.  I have called for one for a long time, but in fact the more detail we hear from the Minister for Finance, the more it seems that the Government is taking a good idea and doing it badly.  It will be hard-pressed homeowners in Donegal and Mayo who will pay the additional cost and not banks, large-profited developers or those responsible for defects.</p><p>With respect to the Sinn F&eacute;in alternative budget, it is clear the Minister has not read it.  First, the parliamentary questions on which this is based are already published.  They are on <i>oireachtas.ie</i>.  They are from the Department and they are 2022 costings, but because we like to have a belt-and-braces approach to our numbers, we also availed of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's service.  It gave us real-time costings for everything.  Not only am I happy to publish them, but why do we not have a debate in a town hall anywhere in this country where we can set out our stalls?</p></speech>

While high-income earners reap the rewards of another budget, it is the same old story we have heard throughout countless Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il Governments.  This budget lacks nuance.  It attempts to tick boxes with one-off measures that will barely scratch the surface of the crisis facing those fighting for survival in this country.  The Government continues to ignore them.  Temporary supports look great on the front page.  The billions being thrown around this Chamber yesterday clearly sound impressive on the face of it, but how many people will it take out of poverty, which one in five in this country is experiencing?  In the coming weeks and months, it will mean nothing to those who need it more to avoid being crippled by inflation.  For that, the Government alone is to blame.  The budget could have made a real difference.  It needed to make a real difference but instead thousands of families look ahead to the winter thinking about decisions they will have to make each and every day to heat their homes or feed their children.</p> <p>There is a danger these devastating decisions will become platitudes for real people who will suffer this winter, and the Government has condemned them, without remorse, to months of unthinkable sacrifice.  At its most basic, poverty is about sacrifice; it is about what families will choose to go without, whether that is heating, eating or warm clothes.</p> <p> Meanwhile, the &euro;6 billion in the rainy day fund will not do much to feed hungry stomachs, house the homeless or provide essential services as it sits idle.  Today is a rainy day - it is absolutely lashing for families - and a storm is approaching our shores.  Why is the Government waiting for people&rsquo;s quality of life to be devastated further before intervening for those who need it most?  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has already admitted he cannot rule out dipping into the fund.  Of course he cannot, given people will go hungry and leave the country in their droves if the Government does not act fast.  A small portion of that fund could have been used for targeted measures to alleviate the pain and struggle of those on the margins.</p> <p> One such example would have been to make education genuinely free, something the Social Democrats costed in our alternative budget, showing how effective such a measure would be for those worst off.  Instead, the Government pretended we do not offer education to those children over the age of 12 in secondary schools, because second level supports and books apparently do not count.  It has told parents to grit their teeth and fork out hundreds of euro for iPads that are compulsory in many secondary schools throughout the country because their child does not deserve the same State support once he or she begins secondary school.  It has told them to buy new editions of expensive textbooks every year, as though their household income should have increased due to their putting their 13-year-old to work in secondary school, because I have no other concept as to why free schoolbooks for secondary school students have not been provided for.</p> <p> Nothing has been done to protect thousands of families from incurring those exorbitant costs in secondary schools.  Publishers will continue to kill the second-hand market, book rental schemes and the sharing of texts between siblings by pumping out yearly-updated versions just so that students can scratch the code on the covers and chuck the books in the bin.  For those families with sixth-year students who have turned 18 before the academic years begins, after covering five years of books, uniforms and so-called voluntary contributions that are never voluntary, they will not even have the child benefit to get them through the year, and the Government simply says, "Too bad".</p> <p> The Social Democrats believe in free schoolbooks for all, along with abolishing voluntary contributions and school transport fees.  The Government could have made that happen but it chose not to, just like it chose not to focus on any long-term measures to alleviate poverty for those experiencing it.  Making these resources free would have required only a 2% rise in the budget, a meagre price for a policy that would have had a massive impact on those struggling to make ends meet, but of course, it is not as though we have billions of euro sitting in a rainy day fund, from which we could have taken out the &euro;250 million or &euro;300 million it would have cost to make education genuinely free.</p> <p> Second level education is only one example of the many severe shortcomings in the budget that will impact those on the margins of our society.  The qualified child allowance increase of &euro;2 is shamefully inadequate.  This miserly increase is an insult to vulnerable families and proves the Government is not serious about ending the scandal of child poverty.  The Government was delighted to provide generous tax concessions for the better-off and universal energy supports for all income brackets, including high earners, but chose to ignore targeted measures that would have made a difference to those in need.  As the Children's Rights Alliance announced, an increase of &euro;2 a week will not be enough to keep families and their children from poverty.  The Social Democrats' alternative budget proposed an additional &euro;7 for children under the age of 12 and an additional &euro;12 for teenagers, bringing the weekly sums to &euro;47 and &euro;60 per week, respectively, but this was apparently too much to ask of a Government that continues to show it does not care if this winter puts families through an unimaginable struggle.</p> <p> At the heart of it, this budget fails to target those most in need.  We see that in the treatment of energy supports, income tax and healthcare, and as my colleague Deputy Cairns will demonstrate shortly, in disability supports and housing.  Those who were hopeful of a helping hand in this budget have been subjected to shortcomings in all aspects of life and I refer in particular to those who are most on the margins.  As the Government was patting itself on the back last night, thousands went to bed wondering whether there was still life to eke out in this country.  Watch now as they continue to leave for a better life elsewhere.</p></speech>

In 2018, the State set a goal of investing &euro;1 billion per year in childcare by 2028.  With the &euro;346 million one-year increase in budget 2023, we have achieved that goal, a full five years early.  As Minister with responsibility for children, this is something I am very proud of, and it demonstrates the commitment of the Government to investing in our children.  That substantial increase in funding will bring significant benefits for parents.  We are increasing investment in the national childcare scheme, NCS, by &euro;121 million next year, reducing costs to parents by, on average, 25%.  We will do this by increasing the maximum subsidy in the NCS from 50 cent per hour to &euro;1.40.  This means parents will see their fees reduced by an average of &euro;1,200 per child per year and up to &euro;2,100 per child per year.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge that for parents, affordability is just one issue that needs to be addressed when it comes to childcare.  Parents in some parts of the country can still struggle to find available places for their children, particularly for younger children.  I know the frustration this causes and I am determined to address it.  In September of this year, core funding came into effect, with services receiving significant State investment and incentivised to increase provision for younger cohorts.  I am delighted to say this is already bearing fruit.  More than 90% of services are signed up to core funding and we are seeing increased capacity, not least in the age groups underserved by the sector currently, namely, children under the age of three.  The geographical breakdown also indicates expansion in urban and commuter areas where there has been significant pressure on places.  To meet the costs of this expanded capacity and an increase in the numbers of graduates, the original allocation for core funding next year will be increased by &euro;59 million.  Budget 2023 also provides for a capital programme that will support services to modernise.</p>  <p>  With the total investment in childcare now surpassing &euro;1 billion per year, it is worth reflecting on what has been achieved in this area since the Government took office.  A month before the general election of February 2020, 30,000 parents, providers and childcare staff were out on the streets protesting over a lack of investment, high fees and low pay.  Since then, as Minister, I have increased childcare funding by &euro;400 million.  We have secured a pay deal for childcare professionals with a clear wage structure, ensuring those staff can see a future for themselves in a job they love.  We have introduced a new funding source, core funding, with an additional &euro;270 million going to childcare providers, and now, with budget 2023, we have reduced fees for parents substantially.  We have transformed the sector in just over two years and delivered for staff, providers, parents and, most important, children.</p>  <p>  As well as childcare, my Department will support some of the most vulnerable and marginalised people in Ireland.  One of my Department&rsquo;s main focuses this year has been on providing accommodation for those fleeing Ukraine and people claiming international protection.  Clearly, this remains a great challenge for the Department.  We are now providing accommodation for more than 52,000 people, whereas this time last year, we were accommodating 8,000.  A total of &euro;213 million has been allocated to cover the costs of international protection accommodation.  The focus will be on transitioning to a new model with expanded, State-owned capacity and a greater focus on commissioning NGOs and not-for-profit organisations to provide services and supports, not least to vulnerable applicants for international protection.</p>  <p>  Throughout 2023, we will also continue to respond to the legacy of mother and baby institutions.  This year, we passed the Birth and Information Tracing Act to allow adopted people a full and clear right of access to their information.  We also passed the Institutional Burials Act, which provides a legal basis for the excavation and exhumation of the site in Tuam.  Within budget 2023, there is more than &euro;7 million for the 2023 costs of that excavation.  Alongside these measures, we will increase funding for Traveller and Roma groups, the National Women's Council and LGBTI+ groups.   I am also delighted that we will increase funding for youth services, recognising the fantastic work they do in supporting young people.</p>  <p>  Throughout all this work, my Department is working to achieve a fairer and more equal Ireland but we have demonstrated, through the priority we have placed on supporting parents and children, that at a time when the pressure of the cost of living is so significant on families, the Government, my Department and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and I are working to support parents, children and the childcare sector, and we will continue to do that throughout 2023.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-28a.364" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1484" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="17:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092800043#VV00100"><p>I thank the Minister for sharing his time with me; it is greatly appreciated.  I have secured a figure of &euro;242 million for disability services in budget 2023.  Let me bring Members on a whistle-stop tour of exactly how that is broken down.  There is &euro;109 million for existing levels of service, &euro;29 million for new developments, &euro;39 million for Covid-related issues, which are once-off payments to support the assessment of needs, and &euro;65 million to support the section 39 voluntary community organisations.</p>  <p>  Let me break down what is the existing level of services.  This is to ensure that services for people who are in emergency placements, residential placements, respite care or who may have personal assistants and personalised budgets can continue to be operationalised and that staff wages are paid.  The new developments are the expansion of everything thereon, including respite care, emergencies and responding to the critical number of emergency placements as they arise.</p>  <p>  The new developments within that which have not been seen before are a response to the community neurorehabilitation teams.  I have put &euro;900,000 into two community rehabilitation teams.  That is in response to the request of the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, which represents 31 organisations including those representing people affected by multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, motor neurone disease and Huntington's disease.  We will have clinician nurses based out in the community across all our community healthcare organisations, CHOs.  Two were delivered within the strategy in the past number of years.  I am doubling that in this budget and having those four operationalised.  We do not just stop there with neurological services, however.  It is an expansion of the neurological strategy, where &euro;1.7 million has been secured to invest in the neurological nursing workforce, with more than 23 additional neurological nursing whole-time equivalents across neurological centres.</p>  <p>  The next stage of the strategy roll-out is to areas in which we already have trauma in CHO 4, and to have the neurological team in place to work with the community team along with paediatric neurological supports.  There is, therefore, a whole package looking after 31 organisations, which we meet on a daily basis, be it in the audiovisual room or over in Buswell's Hotel.  They are in all our communities and they are looking for clinical nurse specialists.  That is what I have responded to and it is a top line within the new developments.</p>  <p>  I am also making a huge priority of assets within assistive technology and partnering with the WHO.  When I talk about once-off funding, I am talking about the assessment of needs and the court case and the requirement to clear the backlog.  It is very fortunate I got the funding now.  It is not the first time I have sought funding to clear a backlog of assessment of needs; this is the second time.  I got &euro;7 million when I took up office two years ago.  I have now sourced &euro;11.7 million to ensure that I can work with the various section 38 and 39 organisations and the HSE, but also with private operators, to ensure that we have assessments completed in order that families can have the proper interventions, pathways and supports that are required in a timely fashion.  That is why that money was so important.  For far too long, parents have been left for long periods on waiting lists.</p>  <p>  There is another &euro;27 million to respond to the emergency cases arising from Covid-19.  There are 143 emergency cases to which the HSE has responded.  That funding is in place.  It will be going into my base next year.  However, it reveals the high level of need and unmet need within the disability sector.  I was very fortunate in sourcing that funding with the Departments of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and Health to be able to meet the need and respond to the needs of the families in crisis.</p>  <p>  Finally, it has not been a week since we had section 39 organisations walking the streets.  They have been all over the country telling us about how expensive it is for them to run their organisations be it from the increase in food and transport costs to the increase in energy costs, and how difficult it is for them to retain staff.  Thanks to the support of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, the Department of Health secured &euro;100 million of inflationary measures in response to nursing homes, hospices and section 39 organisations, of which I got the lion's share of &euro;65 million within disability services.</p>  <p>  The wrap-around figure again is &euro;242 million within disability services with &euro;109 million for existing level of service, &euro;29 million for new developments, &euro;39 million for once-off payments and &euro;65 million for the section 39 organisations.  That is the work that has gone into the response to meeting the needs of children, families, growing adults, services staff and workers.  That is the funding that has been sourced for disability services.</p>  <p>  I am very grateful to my two senior line Ministers, Deputies Stephen Donnelly and O&rsquo;Gorman, who have  supported me not only today but for the past 12 months.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, who has given me the funding to not only meet current needs but also to be ambitious and drive on with regard to neurological services.</p></speech>

I will look specifically at the area of children and childcare.  I will start by welcoming the most recent announcements.  It was unusual to have been sitting in the Chair and listening to all the Opposition party speeches.  I thought mine might be a little different but it is important to give credit where it is due.  I would have liked to have seen more, and our job in opposition is to always to push for more.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will be particularly aware that I have spoken for years about the early years sector and the wages, in particular, but also the fees.  It is, therefore, great to see progress on both those issues.  It is important to acknowledge that.</p>  <p>  There is always more that can be done.  It is up to us to keep pushing that and we will continue to do so.  We had an allocation for a decrease of one third this year and two thirds next year in our alternative budget.  As a sector in which there has been underinvestment for years by previous Governments, however, it is good and it is welcome.  It is progress and is a step in the right direction, particularly for workers in respect of the employment regulation order, ERO, recognition, which is been hard fought.  That is positive and it is progress.</p>  <p>  I want to touch a little bit on child poverty, given that we all know about the increased costs of living over recent weeks and months.  No matter how much people try to budget or think that a bill might have doubled, people's bills are just getting to the stage where they cannot really predict at all what they will be.  It struck me when I was looking at this that so much of it does not just fall to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  Some of it falls to the Department of Social Protection in terms of the increase.  There has been some criticism of the &euro;2 increase for a qualified child, for example, which falls to the Department of Social Protection and how that does not really go far enough.</p>  <p>  Given the number of children who are going to be at greater risk of child poverty, however, is there some plan to look at a joined-up approach between the Departments of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Education and Social Protection?  We already have heard at committee, for example, about people relying increasingly on food banks.  It strikes me that we are going to see more children potentially at risk of child poverty.</p>  <p>  My other question, and I know there is not really time for a response, is about Tusla and possible increases for domestic violence services.  Perhaps at some point the Minister of State could come back to that issue.  I know it is going to the Department of Justice but I refer to the refuge spaces.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-28a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1513" speakername="Pauline Tully" time="17:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092800043#VV00300"><p>Disabled persons organisations and disability representative groups have called for more clarity on how the budget is actually broken down.  The Minister of State provided some of that this evening but if we could have an even more in-depth view, it would be welcome.  Even the Parliamentary Budget Office could not provide much clarity to me today.  One figure the Minister of State gave was the &euro;11.7 million to deal with the backlog of assessment of needs.  Has she a timeframe for how that will be dealt with?  She said previously, as did the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, that it is not actually a monetary issue; it is more a recruitment and retention issue.  What plans does the Minister of State have to deal with the recruitment and retention issues?  I welcome the fact that she indicated there is an allocation to deal with the issues in respect of section 39 organisations.  The section 39 organisations are haemorrhaging staff to the HSE and they will continue to do so until there is equal pay and conditions for the work they do.</p>  <p>  Much of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, is around independent living.  We have an increasing number of disabled adults living with aged parents who are languishing on local authority lists.  Until the HSE provide the support and care packages or the personal assistance service to them, they cannot live independently.  We need a breakdown on how many people will be provided with independent living supports and be allowed to actually move into and live in the community.  How many people will be moved from congregated settings to do so?  How many people aged under 65 who have been placed inappropriately in nursing homes will be moved?  We need to have a target on those.</p> <p>I refer to the implementation plan for the capacity review, which still has not been published.  The Minister of State said in July that it would be published in a few weeks and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, told me that disability would be moving to his Department in August as well.  Neither has happened.  Do we have a date for that?  The sooner we do the better.</p> <p> There needs to be a long-term strategy in this budget to properly support, recognise and acknowledge family carers, without whom our health system would completely collapse.  Measures are unduly weighted towards one-off interventions rather than sustained solutions.  Disability poverty is not one-off issue; it is a constant one.  One in five disabled people lives in constant poverty and another two in five are at risk of poverty.  Supports have to be put in place to deal with that.  It is disappointing that no funding was allocated to specifically assist disabled entrepreneurs and business people.  There are supports for people to employ disabled people but there is little support for disabled people to set up and run their own businesses, which is important.</p></speech>

It is welcome that there is progress on those issues.  I want to start on a positive note because sometimes there is a lot of negativity around here.  I will get to the negative part later. A lot of money was splashed out in yesterday's budget.  In my time here, this is an unprecedented financial intervention by the Government.  It is warranted because we are facing a cost-of-living crisis the likes of which we have not seen for a number of decades.  When working people see their standards of living going down rather than up then we have a serious issue.  The cost of living has shaped this budget, and it will probably shape the next one because these inflationary issues will not go away.  There are external and internal factors.  There are also people profiteering from this crisis, including the energy companies and companies such as big supermarkets and retail companies that are making vast amounts of money on foot of the ongoing crisis.</p>  <p>  The fundamentals of the issues at hand are still real and that is what shaped the last general election two and a half years ago.  The reasons that people rejected Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il come down to issues relating to public services, namely, housing and health, and income inequality.  They were the fundamentals that still exist to this day and that is why people are listening today and yesterday to hear what effects the budget will have on their lives.  A great deal of money has been passed around and that will trickle down, but the big question is whether it will have an effect on people's livelihoods or mitigate the cost-of-living crisis, which is the idea.  There is a big question mark around that because there are major shocks on the horizon in people's livelihoods in heat, food and so forth.  Questions have to be asked in that regard.</p>  <p>  On the Minister for Health's contribution to the debate, I welcome the progress made on hospital charges and GP visits, which is very good.  Nobody has said this but the overall health budget has gone down relative to inflation.  The mental health budget is 5% while Sl&aacute;intecare has always stated that it should be 10% and again that has not kept up with inflationary pressures.  Inflationary pressures are at least 9% so that is a cut.  Most workers in the State are taking a pay cut of up to &euro;2,000, which is unsustainable inflation.</p>  <p>  There are welcome factors in this budget and there are also the fundamentals that are still not being challenged.  They have to be seriously addressed, particularly housing.  It is unacceptable that 10,000 people and more are in emergency accommodation.  Even if we had &euro;120 billion, having 11,000 people in emergency accommodation is completely unacceptable and in other countries the Government would be expelled completely and there would be a general election.  There are huge issues, particularly for working people who feel poorer than they did last year.  Will this mitigate the decline in their standard of living?  There are big question marks in respect of that matter.</p></speech>

The record Department of Justice allocation for 2023 of &euro;3.3 billion will help keep our communities stronger and safer.  It will support victims and maintain a momentum of modernisation right across the justice sector.  It represents a 5% increase, which has been welcomed by all.</p>  <p>  The total gross allocation for the Garda Vote is a record &euro;2.14 billion, an increase of over &euro;7.8 million.  This will make a real and tangible difference in our communities.  We recognise the devastating impact crime has, not just on individuals whose lives have been affected but on the wider community.  I am committed to increasing the number of garda&iacute; and civilian staff and to investing in the resources they need to do their vital work protecting the public.  High-visibility policing is crucial to making sure that communities across the country are safe and feel safe and that is why we will see up to 1,000 new recruits enter the Garda College in Templemore next year, as well as the recruitment of 430 civilian staff to free up more front-line garda&iacute; for core policing duties.  In order to make sure we have the numbers to put through Templemore we will open another campaign next year to supplement the 11,000 men and women who applied this year to help us guarantee that there are 200 new recruits entering Templemore every three months over the coming years.  Beyond next year, those kind of figures will continue.  More garda&iacute; plus additional civilian staff will help people feel safer and reduce crime.  We will also provide more money for overtime, which means that garda&iacute; will be deployed as needed to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour in our communities.  There will be additional funding for ballistic vests and we will start the roll-out of body-worn cameras.  There is also additional funding for ICT equipment and mobile technology, all making sure the Garda can do its work more efficiently and effectively.</p>  <p>  On the general justice Vote, the gross allocation of &euro;445 million for my Department includes an additional &euro;63 million which will be used to support victims, vulnerable people and to provide vital supports and services to those who need them.  Tackling domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is a priority for me as Minister for Justice, both providing victim-centred supports and services and ensuring that the responsible perpetrators are punished.  A zero tolerance plan, which was published earlier this year, is an ambitious five-year strategy to help achieve zero tolerance in our society for this appalling type of violence and abuse.  The year 2023 will see us establish a new agency for domestic violence, which will become fully operational in 2024.  This budget provides an extra &euro;9 million for 2023, a 23% increase, which is record funding for combatting domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  This includes increased funding of &euro;7 million for organisations funded by Tusla to address the acute service demands in existing services throughout the country, acknowledging the huge amount of work they do and the support they need, and for investment in new services.  We have significant plans to expand and develop the services across the country.  This funding will also strengthen the nationwide supports that will help to maintain the momentum in implementing the ambitious goals I have set out in our national strategy.  We also have an additional &euro;2 million, which has been allocated to help set up the agency.  There is also a funding increase for victims of crime and there are other supports looking at the various different campaigns around consent, including the Still Here campaign, the No Excuses campaign and other areas that will be developed, particularly focusing on the preventive side of domestic violence.  In addition, &euro;2 million has been allocated for the criminal injuries compensation scheme.  This is for the payment of claims from victims of crime.</p>  <p>  As a country, we can also be proud of our response to the Ukraine crisis.  I am particularly pleased with the additional funding of &euro;9.2 million this year for my Department's response.  So far we have welcomed, as of today, just over 50,000 Ukrainians to Ireland and we will continue to ensure that those fleeing this conflict and seeking temporary protection receive the support they need.</p> <p> Since the pandemic, we also have seen a significant rise in immigration and international protection applicants.  Again, this figure is reaching approximately 10,000, whereas in previous years, it would have been approximately 3,000.  Additional funding of nearly &euro;18 million will go towards increasing efficiency in processing applications, to reduce the risk of people remaining in the system for long periods and allowing uncertainty about their own status.</p> <p> I will shortly announce the first successful applicants to the community safety innovation fund.  This was established to reinvest the ill-gotten proceeds of crime seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau into the communities that are impacted by this crime.  I am pleased that because of this budget, the fund will now increase by 50%.  This year, the figure will be &euro;2 million and next year it will be &euro;3 million.  I hope to see that increase further in the years ahead.  An increase of &euro;2.8 million will bring the total allocation for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission to &euro;16.2 million and this is to support its vital complaints investigation work.</p> <p> I am also pleased to have secured additional funding of &euro;4 million for the Legal Aid Board and &euro;2 million for the Probation Service to support their essential work.  In terms of the prison Vote, the gross allocation in 2023 is &euro;411.2 million.  Some &euro;6.5 million of this is for additional staff and this is the first time in many years that we will have additional staff members.  At least 100 prison officers will be recruited across a range of functions.  There will be additional prisoner capacity in the new Limerick women's prison and it will support a new wing in Limerick Prison that will become operational shortly.  It will also mean that these officers will be available for other types of duties, particular educational programmes and supports in healthcare needs that are currently not being pursued or that are not possible because of the other work that has to be done.  </p> <p> In terms of the Vote for the gross allocation of the courts, the figure is &euro;176.5 million.  This includes capital funding of &euro;67 million.  The Courts Service modernisation programme is vital to improving access to justice.  Additional funding of &euro;2.5 million will continue the delivery of the digital solutions and user-centric services.  A further &euro;2.5 million will future-proof judicial support staffing in light of current backlogs, expected demands and future reforms across the system.  It will complement a report that I will bring forward on additional judges.</p> <p> We are supporting the night-time economy and these businesses are integral to a night-time culture-----</p></speech>

The future of our communities lies with our young people and I warmly welcome the allocation of &euro;24 million for youth justice, which is an increase of &euro;2.5 million and over 11%.  This will have a significant impact on individual young people, their families and their communities.</p>  <p>  I cannot emphasise strongly enough the importance of youth diversion projects and the services they provide.  I have seen first-hand the enormous and often life-changing differences these programmes can have on a young person's life and on the choices they make.  In some cases, these youth diversion programmes are a lifeline that could shift a young person from an ill-advised path to a much better one.  These programmes provide education.  They provide training and employment supports, which can be a valuable second chance for young people who, for many reasons, may not have had an ideal first experience of the education system.  They show young people that there are other options and opportunities out there for them.  Sports activities and personal development initiatives can offer a new focus and new interests.  They can be key in helping vulnerable young people to move away from a pattern of damaging behaviour.  My aim under the youth justice strategy is to achieve full coverage of youth justice initiatives across the country so that every young person who might benefit from them can have access to them. </p>  <p>  Let me turn briefly to the issue of gambling.  We are much closer to ensuring that modern and effective licensing and regulatory measures are in place for the gambling industry in Ireland.  Legislation is currently being prepared for publication to ensure that we have safe and fair gambling in Ireland.  This is an important social issue and we need to get it right in order that we can reduce the significant harm that happens to vulnerable people as a result of gambling.  The establishment of the new authority is a key programme for Government commitment and the additional allocation of &euro;1 million in 2023 brings the total funding to &euro;1.7 million.  This will support the CEO designate in the preparations she needs in order that the authority can start its important work as quickly as possible once it is established.</p>  <p>  Overall, the record allocation this year for the justice group of Votes gives us the resources we need to progress our programme for Government commitments.  I look forward to updating the House as these commitments progress.  </p></speech>

I commend the budget spend this year in the area of justice.  There is a clear commitment to provide the numbers of garda&iacute; that we need to see.  That is welcome.  All those we talk to, whether rank-and-file garda&iacute; or senior members of the force, tell us the one thing they need is more numbers and more garda&iacute; out on the beat, in the community and doing the job.  That is what we need to see.  I seek clarity on the number of the 1,000 trainee garda&iacute;.  Earlier, the Minister stated the figure would be 200 every three months, which would add up to 800 per year.  I understand that is at present the approximate capacity within Templemore.  Are there plans to expand that capacity to find more innovative ways to make that happen?</p>  <p>  The announcement of an additional 450 civilian staff within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also welcome.  An issue was raised in regard to the Courts Service in the Minister&rsquo;s speech.  She spoke about modernisation and the work to be done there, all of which it is to be hoped will deal with some of the backlog.  The key thing that is needed to deal with the backlogs is the appointment of more judges to the Circuit Court and to the District Court.  That is something that we really need to see movement on, a clear way of doing that and a budget put in place to make that happen.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, mentioned the youth justice programme and the Garda youth diversion programmes.  They are vital and this is direction we need to go in.  It would be useful if we see something provided for within the Probation Service and the Prison Service to ensure that we are able to reduce the number of people who are presently in our prison system and who continually re-offend.   We need to come up with better programmes and more ways of doing that.  I understand that is part of what the new additional staffing levels within that sector are about.  However, we need specific programmes to deal with that. </p>  <p>  In a more general sense, one criticism that many of us on this side of the House have in regard to the budget is that it does not deal enough with the with the issues of poverty.  We all understand and appreciate the link between poverty, social deprivation and crime.  How do we manage that and make sure that that happens?</p>  <p>  While I welcome the increases in social welfare, we feel that they do not go far enough.  There also has not been enough done in the way of assistance of working people who are on low incomes.  The taxation measures have been geared too much towards those on higher incomes.  People who are on lower incomes or who are on the minimum wage need to see more return for the work that they do.  That would assist a lot.  However, in general, the budget that has been put in place for justice is the direction to go and it is welcome.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-28a.375" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1621" speakername="Johnny Mythen" time="17:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092800045#XX00600"><p>I commend the justice budget, which will go a long away towards protecting communities.  I will speak generally on the budget itself.  Much has been said about this budget during the last day or so.  However, there are flaws in the analysis in tackling the cost of living and the rise in inflation.  For example, the &euro;12 increase in the State pension and welfare payments will not cover inflation.  In real terms, there will be a real drop of 8.1% in the pension rate between 2021 and 2023.  Our proposals would have given people who are living on their own &euro;17.50 per week and &euro;15 per week as standard.  Even though the tax bands have been widened, take-home pay will fall substantially in 2023.  Again, the buffer against inflation is insufficient.  Some 1.8 million workers will not gain one cent from these tax changes.  In fact, the Government&rsquo;s idea of fairness always is skewed towards the top earners and it leaves the rest to shuffle the crumbs in the best way they can.  A person who is earning &euro;35,000 will get &euro;190, while a person who is earning &euro;130,000 will get &euro;830.  We should all remember these are the same people whose taxes bailed out the banks and restored the economy.</p>  <p>  We live in the most uncertain times.  Security and stability are key to a prosperous and healthy society.  We are told that Putin is holding Europe to ransom on energy and gas prices.  Surely, then, the energy companies are doing the same to our own economy.  Therefore, we want an immediate introduction of a windfall tax and the capping of electricity bills at 2021 levels until February 2023.</p> <p>This would give security to many families and small businesses who manage their finances on a weekly and monthly basis.  We believe the three &euro;200 once-off payments will be swallowed up by inflation and the inevitable increases of energy bills.</p> <p> On the rental sector, introducing the &euro;500 tax credit without the follow-up of a rent cap will result in many rents spiralling upwards once again.  My county of Wexford has experienced rent increases of 17%, which is almost on a par with the increase in city rents.  Yet, we are not considered to be a rent pressure zone.  This budget has done nothing to help the citizens who are earning just above the threshold to qualify for social housing, and not earning enough to secure a mortgage.  With an &euro;11 billion spend available in the budget, the Government could have at least raised the threshold to give some real hope to those families and individuals who find themselves lost in despair and trapped in the battle to provide a roof over their heads.</p></speech>

Everyone will welcome additional garda&iacute; on the beat and new recruits passing through Templemore.  I wish to make a point about my constituency of Waterford.  It may be an issue for the Office of Public Works, OPW, but we are waiting for upgrades to the Garda station there, which is now the headquarters south east Garda division.  There are additional civilian staff coming in and there is nowhere for them to be accommodated within the station.  I ask for that matter to be raised with the Minister.  We need funding and the development of that station if it is to have any chance of actively trying to fulfil its remit.</p>  <p>  Yesterday's budget of &euro;11 billion was of a scope before never seen in the country.  Certainly, the economic and social challenges facing the country, because of the energy crisis and the resulting inflation, are also of an extraordinary magnitude.  Whatever our politics, we hope that this budget will have a significant impact in the context of reducing the chronic pressures facing households and businesses.  There has been must talk in the House, yesterday and today, of the need to support households, but I would like to focus for a few moments on the SMEs that are facing catastrophic energy costs and extremely difficult trading environments.  The SME sector is constituted by micro, small and medium enterprises.  Between them, they employ over 1 million people.  The SME sector has for many years been the bedrock of national revenue generation, long before the money tree of foreign direct investment arrived, with the associated corporation tax it has brought, which is most welcome.  The SME community has heretofore, and largely on its on, generated the taxes that have put garda&iacute; on the beat, teachers into classrooms, nurses at bedsides, and secured Department of Social Protection payments.</p>  <p>  What is happening in this sector?  I will provide the Minister and Minister of State with an idea of where things stand.  I wrote to the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of this issue recently.  I highlighted the case of a manufacturing business in the south east that currently employs more than 40 people.  Its monthly utility costs rose from &euro;9,000 in January to &euro;21,000 in April and to &euro;42,400 in August.  The company makes a range of components for sale through trade and retail outlets.  It uses electricity predominantly in heating and cooling processes as part of its production.  It has no way of mitigating its electricity usage without reducing its output, and thereby reducing revenue.  Under the proposed Government SME support scheme, the firm would be able to claim 40% of its increased electricity costs from its average base where 150% of the annual cost increases have occurred.  It well qualifies for the scheme.  A rough calculation delivers a support of &euro;13,300 per month.  However, that is capped at &euro;10,000, which means that this company can see support extended which would reduce the firm's present energy bill from &euro;46,000 to &euro;36,000.  The revised annual energy cost would be &euro;432,000 per annum versus &euro;108,000 for the previous year.  That is a net 300% increase year on year.  In euro terms, it is an additional operating cost of &euro;324,000 annually, or a whopping &euro;27,000 per month.</p>  <p>  I know the business very well.  It is operating in a challenging and competitive sector and has tight margins.  I can promise the Minister and the Minister of State that there is not a spare &euro;320,000 lying around anywhere for the business to plug the gap.  It is a business that would have been severely impacted during Covid, and it is only getting back on its feet.  It is also extremely sensitive to consumer demand activity at retail level.  Reducing energy bills for this business means reducing activity, and thereby reducing turnover.  It is not possible for this business to scale down in order to save costs.  It will not improve its profitability and it will not make the business viable at present to support the levels on offer.  It is a rural business that employs 45 skilled and semi-skilled operatives.  If it stops manufacturing, the products it makes will most likely be replaced by cheaper imports.  The employees working in the business will struggle to find jobs to which they are suited, and a number of them who are middle-aged will quite likely end up in long-term unemployment.  My question for the Minister and Minister of State is as follows.  How does it advance our national interest to support crisis cost-of-living measures for families while not supporting adequately the businesses which keep many of these family breadwinners in employment?</p>  <p>  The SME support package that Government has unveiled will not do enough to keep these businesses viable, which they were up to some months ago.  If we do not make significant efforts to keep these businesses operational to some degree, we will have very little on which to build an economic recovery into the future, which we obviously want to see following this crisis.  Yesterday, the Government announced contributions to a rainy day fund.  How much water will be bail before we take a significant look at how we can meaningfully support SMEs over the next 12 months?  I urge the Government to examine this issue.  I also ask the Minister and the Minister of State to engage with officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in particular to ensure that they stay close to business groupings to understand the pressures that are coming down the line.  What is going to happen here is that a number of business promoters are going to try to keep trading in the hope of reducing their costs.  They will then start to fail to meet supplier payments and return their VAT payments.  Ultimately, their businesses will become insolvent, at which point they will fail and go into liquidation.  We are going to see people who spent 50 years of their lives developing intergenerational businesses basically becoming insolvent.  Those people will ultimately become liable for loans and possibly debts.  That is not fair to anybody.  As I said, these were all very viable businesses before we arrived where we are now.  What I am saying very clearly is that the Government support of 40% is not adequate.  It is not enough to address what is happening.  We need to get major actors to sit down and work out at what point a support is viable, at what point it is better to keep companies trading and to keep employees employed, and what support moneys should be directed to that point.  I can say that we had, and have had, a very vibrant SME business sector in this country for years.  We have been slightly overtaken of late with the windfall taxes that are coming from the FDI sector.  However, as has been said by both the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, that revenue may well be transient and may be gone in 12, 18 or 24 months.  We do not know where it will finish, but we need to sustain our SME bedrock in this country.  That means we need to support them.  I call on the Minister, the Minister of State and those in Government to ensure that we do not have a catastrophic failure in the SME sector before we try to step in and provide adequate support.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-09-28a.378" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="17:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022092800046#YY00300"><p>It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak on budget 2023 and on the immediate cost-of-living package that the Government is introducing to support families, citizens and students right across our country.  I am very pleased to have worked with the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, to try to put in place a budget package that helps everybody - because the cost of living is something that everybody requires assistance with - but which also tries to target supports to those most in need.</p>  <p>  The budget we unveiled yesterday is a cost-of-living budget.  It is designed to help everyone in our country.  It is designed for the most vulnerable, for the squeezed middle and for those who need our public services.  We know that families need support.  We know that students need support with their education and training and the costs associated with that.</p> <p>We are aware that students and their parents are not immune from the cost-of-living crisis that is being experienced in this country and many other parts of the world.  We understand that daily costs are rising.  It is more expensive for everyone to do the daily shop and to pay electricity bills.  We know that students and parents are also facing those costs.  Therefore, we have tried to take real and tangible steps in this budget to support people and to help them access third level education and achieve when they are there.</p> <p> We are putting money back in the pockets of students and their parents by introducing seven immediate measures that will be implemented straight away in order to provide tangible relief for students from the challenges of the rising cost of living.  There will be a once-off &euro;1,000 reduction in the undergraduate student contribution fee for higher education students eligible for the free fees initiative.  To be clear, students who have paid this fee will receive a &euro;1,000 refund from their university or college.  If some of the fee is outstanding, the money will be knocked off the outstanding amount.  We have introduced a once-off reduction of one third in the contribution fee for apprentices in our third level education system.  This is important.  We are also introducing a once-off double payment for all student maintenance grant recipients.  Before Christmas, students will receive double the amount of whatever student grant payment they are due.</p> <p> For our postgraduate students, we are announcing a once-off increase of &euro;1,000 in support to all postgraduate students who qualify for Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, support.  That level of support will increase from &euro;3,500 to &euro;4,500.  We are also putting a further investment of &euro;8 million into the student assistance fund for the current academic year.  We are introducing a once-off payment of &euro;500 for PhD students who receive an Irish Research Council, IRC, or a Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, award.  Accepting that it is going to cost more to put the lights on in our colleges and institutions across the country, we are putting in place a once-off ring-fenced fund for the third level sector to assist with rising energy costs.</p> <p> This is my third budget as Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science.  This budget sees an additional investment of &euro;288 million from the Department for the sector, bringing our budget to well over &euro;3 billion.  With this significant new investment, we are now able to fund a number of major priorities for this Government.  In my role, I have met apprentices, students and their families.  I have met researchers and staff across the country.  They have been clear about their requests and hopes for the future of third level education.  They want the third level system to be adequately and properly resourced.  That means a workable staff-student ratio, decent facilities and additional places and capacity.  This budget provides additional resources to advance our world-class education and training.  As part of budget 2023, we are providing an extra &euro;150 million investment to the higher education sector over the rest of this year and next year.  This will deliver a reduction in the staff-student ratio for our universities, taking us a step towards OECD norms and helping to improve our global rankings.  This is probably the first reduction in staff-student ratios in many years.  In addition, the funds will provide for the extra 60 medicine places in higher education at an agreed and sustainable rate, co-funded by my Department and the Department of Health.  Most importantly, due to the work of the reform programme, Funding the Future, we will fund a university or intuition by an additional 25% for every new student who enters higher education next September.  At the moment, we are paying approximately &euro;6,500 for every student who goes in the door of a university or college.  That will rise to just over &euro;8,200 from September.  I thank the Irish Universities Association, IUA, the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA, and Professors Anne Looney and Tom Collins, my co-chairs of Funding the Future.  We have a lot of work to do but this demographic work and the new core funding work, coupled with the money we are providing in light of the energy crisis, will assist.</p> <p> In respect of further education and skills, my Department will provide 3,000 Skillnet Ireland places through Skills Connect, which aims to reskill the unemployed, returners and other impacted groups for industries facing labour shortages.  We will support the Government's climate action plan by providing over 2,000 Skillnet places to provide upskilling opportunities in emerging technologies and expansion of programmes to include sustainable finance, green tech and responding to climate change.  To support business through the impact of Brexit, this Department will also provide 7,400 training places through Skillnet Ireland to assist our SMEs to adapt to new market and regulatory realities.  A further 1,000 places will be provided to support the digital transformation and sustainability journey of larger companies, including those impacted by Brexit.</p> <p> Supporting our Housing for All strategy, my Department is providing &euro;30 million funding as part of the budget to increase capacity for apprenticeships in 2023, including addressing the backlog in apprenticeships exacerbated by the pandemic.  I am delighted to inform the House that there is also additional funding for social inclusion measures in apprenticeships, such as a bursary for apprentices for under-represented groups, and funding to roll out the access to apprenticeship programme, which will be transformational for the lives for many.</p> <p> My Department will also invest a further &euro;4 million in further education and training to deliver on our further education and training, FET, strategy, our transforming learning strategy and, crucially, the adult literacy for life strategy, tackling adult literacy, numeracy and digital skills.</p> <p> Budget 2023 does more than all this.  We are trying to fundamentally shift our student support structures.  There are many one-off payments, as is right and proper, to help students and their parents between now and Christmas.  We have also taken real steps to drive down the cost of education more permanently.  We cannot have a situation where this country urgently requires a workforce and society that is educated and skilled, yet some people still feel as though aspirations are out of their reach.  Every single person studying in third level today is the bedrock upon which our future prosperity will be built.  It follows that third level must walk in the footsteps of second level.  That has to mean universal access for all.  In this budget, we are providing an extra &euro;75 million to increase our student supports on a permanent basis through the student grant scheme.  We are increasing the student maintenance grants effective from January.  Students will not have to wait until next September.  Effective from January, the monthly student grant rate will rise.  The special and band one maintenance grant rates will increase by a further 14% and all other maintenance grant rates will increase by 10%.  We are also making sure that the permanent amount of students who will benefit from half fees will increase.  At the moment, people whose household earnings are &euro;55,240 only pay 50% of fees.  That will rise to &euro;62,000.  From now on, anyone earning &euro;62,000 or less will never pay full fees and will only pay a maximum of &euro;1,500.  We are making permanent the undergraduate student contribution reduction of &euro;500 for anybody earning less than &euro;100,000.  We are also keeping the funding in place for metal health well-being supports.  There will also be a permanent increase in the PhD award stipend of &euro;500 and a permanent increase in the postgraduate fee contribution grant of a further &euro;500, from &euro;3,500 to &euro;4,000.  These are some of the measures that I and the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, are working on.</p></speech>

I thank the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputies Donohoe and Michael McGrath, for their engagement with us to arrive at a total voted spend for our Department of approximately &euro;3.9 billion.  That significant sum of money will be spent on people engaged in the further and higher education sector, research, innovation and science.  It will help to drive forward the agenda, give people skills, upskill and educate people for the workforce and to address the gaps we have in our labour force.</p>  <p>  I welcome the positive impact that yesterday's budget in its totality will have in every community in Ireland.  It is important to remember where we have come from.  We have come through a pandemic when we were one of the best operators globally.  We had the lowest number of deaths as a result of Covid-19.  That is a testament to everybody up and down this country.  We came through the pandemic and are now dealing with a war in Ukraine and a cost-of-living crisis that is impacting many people up and down the country.  This country was able to deliver a budget with &euro;11 billion to address the cost of living and other measures that will roll out next year.  It is significant that we are able to do that without borrowing.  There has been chaos next door in the UK since its budget was announced.  It is borrowing to fund tax cuts and the unlimited liability of the cap on energy prices.  There has been a fallout from that recklessness.  The stability we have here is, by comparison, remarkable.</p>  <p>  I will comment on some of the positive aspects in our Department, including the one-off &euro;1,000 reduction in the undergraduate student contribution fee; the one-off reduction of up to 33% in the contribution fee for apprentices; the one-off extra payment for all maintenance grant recipients, which is a doubling of one monthly payment; and the one-off increase of &euro;1,000 in the supports for SUSI-qualified postgraduate students, which will mean a rise from &euro;3,500 to &euro;4,500.  Our changes to the student assistance fund are important.  We invested heavily, and rightly, in the student assistance fund throughout the pandemic and thereafter.  We will continue to do that  Students face many challenges in their daily lives.  We give a lot of taxpayers' money and resources to every college and campus around Ireland so they can exercise their discretion and engage with students to support them in their hour of need of assistance through the assistance fund.</p>  <p>  We have been able to increase our budget, fund more apprenticeships and continue to expand our range of apprenticeships.  We are also dealing with legacy issues arising from core underfunding and addressing pension liability hangovers.</p></speech>

On behalf of the people of Kerry, I have a very important message for them about what happened today.  While we discuss the budget and while people are particularly concerned about business, everyone in Kerry who has a business, be it big or small, got a revised rate demand today.  I will give some examples of the changes in their rates.  A business owner whose rate was &euro;26,000 per year has had it increased to &euro;68,000.  Another person's rate has increased from &euro;3,000 to &euro;16,500 per year.  These businesses include jewellers' shops, bakeries, ordinary shops, hair salons and tyre centres that are facing increases of 200%, 300% or more.  This comes at a time when we are talking about protecting small businesses and are trying to encourage them to stay in operation.</p>  <p>  The Ministers and Ministers and State know that changes to these rateable valuations were deferred due to the pandemic.  I tabled parliamentary questions on this issue in advance because I expected it to come.  Surely the Government should have seen fit to have stopped this and that this was not the time to go ahead.  It was not the time to re-rate businesses.  It is totally insane and will put people out of business.  All I can tell the Ministers and Ministers of State is that my phone was on fire today with people telling me their stories about trying to figure out how they will survive.  That is an issue that needs to be debated by the House in full.  Since it is so fresh, and they are the Ministers representing the Government, I want to place on the record of the D&aacute;il that ratepayers in County Kerry, be it north, east, south, west or mid-Kerry, are suffering and are worried tonight because of the bills they got in the post today informing them their businesses were being re-rated.</p>  <p>  Budget 2023 is so fragile that a senior economist at the Department of Finance warned at a press conference yesterday that a cold snap across Europe this winter would have a significantly negative impact on Ireland's economic outlook because the country is on the brink of a recession.  The budget did nothing to avoid a recession or steer the country into a better place by developing a roadmap for energy self-reliance, which would provide cheaper energy prices.  The Government's budgetary strategy, like its energy strategy, is devised on the basis of hope.  That hope revolves around hoping a cold snap across Europe this winter will be avoided and that the wind will blow at home in order that wind energy can be produced, even though it only has the potential to provide up to 30% of electricity supplies.  Yes, budget 2023 involves spending and tax measures amounting to &euro;11 billion.  However, despite this record level of spending, the true factual reality is that most people will still end up worse off when inflation and cost-of-living increases are factored in.</p>  <p>  I could go on for a long time about the budget.  I ask the Government to please look at the rates situation as well because that will have to be stopped, if businesses are to survive.</p></speech>

Why was this not dealt with before the budget?  There is no recognition for the amount of technology that agriculture has embraced.  Farmers have changed everything about the way they farm so they have played their part in addressing climate change.  If this Government fails to recognise what agriculture is doing, it will see lower yields leading to fewer commodities and a shortage of products, which will, in turn, lead to food shortages, yet agriculture got the lowest amount of expenditure in yesterday's budget.</p>  <p>  The role of biodigesters was highlighted by me and the Rural Independent Group a year ago.  The Government is a little late and years behind Europe.  So many young farmers in Macra na Feirme looked to this budget as one that would provide additional measures in respect of farm succession from older to younger farmers in a way that would attract future farmers.  There is no cover for escalating fertiliser costs.  Further support is only available for beef and sheep farmers and there is nothing for the pig farmer.  Unfortunately, the rollover of the fodder and tillage scheme in the budget, while welcome, is completely insufficient to mitigate rocketing farm input costs, which are now at least 40% higher than a year ago.  Increased feed, fertiliser, energy and other costs simply cannot be sustained by many farmers.  Failure by this Government to allocate a once-off farm payment to mitigate the dire situation will result in many farmers pressed to the brink and forced out of business.</p>  <p>  What the Government decided to do was to put a 10% levy on concrete products to fund the mica-pyrite rebate.  Why not go after the culprits, such as the manufacturers and insurance companies that certified the defective products?  The Government has made provision for a slurry storage scheme in the budget; such storage is all made from concrete.  What the Government has done is put inflation into the farming sector.  On the one hand, it came up with a scheme for slurry storage, while on the other it put on a 10% levy.  It did not only do that; it put on 10% plus 13.5% for supply and fit, in addition to 10% plus 23% for supply only.  The Government has inflated the cost for farmers who are trying to do their bit for climate change.  It has created more inflation.  This is across the board, from any young person who is trying to build a new house to any person who wants to renovate or upgrade his or her house.  The Government has put on a 13% levy across the board for everyone in this country.  Well done to the Government.  It has now hit another nail into people in rural Ireland who might want to build a future for their farming and family sectors.  It has helped to upgrade, and make more, inflation for this country.  Well done.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for special education, Deputy Madigan.</p>  <p>  Budget 2023 provides for an increase of more than &euro;440 million in core funding for the Department of Education.  This is a very significant increase and one that furthers the work of recent years in reducing class sizes, reducing costs for families, tackling disadvantage and supporting the achievement of all students.</p>  <p>  The introduction of a new scheme to provide schoolbooks free of charge for all students in primary school has been a priority of mine since taking office and signifies an entirely new chapter in Irish primary education.  This permanent initiative will greatly reduce the burden on families and reflects the importance this Government places on education for all children.</p>  <p>  In this budget, the Government is also continuing to deliver on its commitment to reduce class sizes.  For the third consecutive year, I have brought in a measure to reduce class sizes by lowering the staffing schedule for schools, bringing it to an historic low of 23:1 in primary school.  When the new staffing schedule will be implemented in the next school year, we will see further reductions in average class sizes and in the pupil-teacher ratio.  It is a remarkable achievement that in every budget for the past three budgets over which I have presided that we have successfully reduced the pupil-teacher ratio by one point, as I said, bringing it to a historic low of 23:1.</p>  <p>  Since 2021, the Government has invested in an enhanced summer programme to support students at risk of educational disadvantage and help mitigate learning loss as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.  The programme has been extremely successful and the Minister of State and I are very pleased to announce funding this year to maintain the availability of this programme for all schools.  It has been enormously valuable to students and continues to grow in popularity and impact.  The Department is currently reviewing the summer programme in order to maximise the number of schools offering it and the number of students availing of summer provision in schools.  The review involves engaging with other jurisdictions and stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Other new measures are included to address the impacts of Covid-19 and increase retention rates of students in schools, especially those from groups at risk of educational disadvantage.  I am also announcing social inclusion measures that include enhancing the capacity of the education welfare services in Tusla that come under my Department's remit, as well as an increase in schools completion programme funding and funding for the home-school community liaison programme.</p></speech>
