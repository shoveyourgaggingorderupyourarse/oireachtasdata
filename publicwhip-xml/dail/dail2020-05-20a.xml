    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000003#A00600"><p>I want to begin by offering my condolences, as always, to the families who have lost loved ones during this pandemic and to again pay tribute to all of those who are on the front line for our country in this time of great challenge.</p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to update the House on the ongoing economic and budgetary situation.  The necessary measures introduced to protect public health and to combat the spread of the Covid-19 virus have resulted in a severe contraction in economic activity at home and abroad.  Recently, my Department published the stability programme update.  We indicated in the debate in the House on that report that we expect the national income of our country to fall by 10.5% this year and, unfortunately, we expect approximately 220,000 jobs to be lost, with unemployment already peaking in the second quarter of this year.  On the budgetary front, the general Government balance, as I indicated at that point, stood at &euro;23 billion.  That was on the basis of decisions that had been made up to that point and I indicated the possibility of it growing further beyond that, towards &euro;30 billion.</p>  <p>  Given the radically uncertain outlook we now face, it is very important that I emphasise the level of uncertainty that attaches to the figures I have just shared.  I want to stress that the indications we have regarding the performance of our economy, particularly the budgetary indicators when expressed as a share of the national income, are currently in line with what we see unfolding internationally.  All countries are facing very similar challenges.  This is, of course, most evident in where we are with the number of people who have lost their jobs during this crisis.  Approximately 460,000 citizens are now in receipt of income support from their employers through the temporary wage subsidy scheme and there are just under 590,000 recipients of the pandemic unemployment payment.  Along with the 215,000 individuals on the live register, this means that 1.25 million of our citizens are in receipt of income supports from the State.  In the longer term, this is neither sustainable nor affordable for an economy in which we have growth that is based upon a private sector that generates employment upon which we can then deliver the public services that we need.</p>  <p>  We are seeing the change that is taking place in our national finances as a result of this change in employment beginning to have a sharp effect.  Exchequer returns for April showed a deficit of &euro;7.5 billion and, to date, the level of support to the economy from the Government amounts to more than &euro;13 billion.</p> <p>It is the right and appropriate economic policy for the Government to run a deficit when the private sector has experienced a demand shock of this magnitude.  We are doing this so we can limit the loss of income for companies and employers, and to preserve economic activity and living standards in the face of this terrible shock.  These decisions now, I believe, lay the foundation for a recovery at a later point.  We, however, can only do this because of decisions that were taken in the management of our public finances in recent years, in particular the deliberate policy of gradually over time eliminating a budget deficit and then running to a budgetary surplus.  This has given us the credibility and the capacity we need, as a State, to be able to borrow the level of funding we are now borrowing to respond to the shock that is being felt in every home and every parish in Ireland.</p> <p> Moreover, the economic turmoil is the result of a public health crisis.  It is the result of a public health decision, not the result of an economic decision.  We are entering into this period from a position of strength.  My approach has been to try to improve our public finances gradually in anticipation of a difficulty at a point in the future, but, of course, this kind of difficulty and its magnitude could not have been foreseen then.</p> <p> We expect public debt to increase significantly this year, and that is appropriate and in line with what is being seen internationally.  We can finance this at a very low cost at the moment, but I cannot ignore the reality of constraints that will emerge at a point in the future, whether they be budgetary, whether they be monetary or whether they be decisions that need to be made by a future Government.  The Taoiseach and I have both pointed this out recently.  We know only too well what can happen if sentiment towards a country changes, and it is very important that our budgetary position in the future does not become an outlier versus the experiences of other countries.</p> <p> As Deputies will be aware, the gradual unlocking of our economy began on Monday.  However, it is already very clear that the new economic normal will be different from that of the old.  Activity in some firms, including, of course, in our hospitality sector, is likely to be below capacity for some time to come.  This will necessitate the kind of supports that are now in place.  Some firms and some business models that were viable pre-Covid-19 may no longer be viable in the future, so the priority for this and the next Government must be to galvanise our resources to support companies and employers to be in a position to succeed in this new environment.</p> <p> On 2 May, the Government agreed a further package of measures to support businesses negatively affected by Covid-19 to accelerate their readiness for dealing with this new reality.  The House is already familiar with what they are: the restart grant, the commercial rates waiver, delivering and developing the pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund, getting the legislation ready for a credit guarantee scheme, and the warehousing of tax liabilities for a period of up to one year following the recommencement of trading.  These measures complement the previously announced measures that mainly, though not exclusively, focused on households and employees.</p> <p> We have the ability, because of these measures and because of the agility and entrepreneurship at the heart of the Irish economy, to rebuild from this crisis.  Protecting those who have seen their lives and their livelihoods upended is the most responsible course of action the Government could take, and this is what we have done.  However, these measures that we have introduced, which we can sustain for a period of time, cannot and will not last forever.  They are appropriate at this phase of the pandemic and the budgetary impact of these measures that we have taken during this crisis will, in large part, be addressed by our citizens going back to work.  However, it is an inescapable reality that there will be a cost to the State from these measures and these costs will have to be addressed.</p> <p>Responsible budgetary policies over the medium term will do much of the heavy lifting.  Sustainable and steady increases in public services and living standards underpinned by sustainable steady economic growth is the best way of correcting the budgetary challenges we will have.</p> <p> I need to remind the House that while there has, understandably, been a huge focus on the pandemic in recent weeks and months, it is also the case that this is not the only challenge facing us.  Negotiations between the EU and UK on a future relationship are ongoing.  The current transition will end on 31 December unless a decision is taken jointly to extend it.  Overall, the interplay between the economic impact of the pandemic and the possible end to the transition period without a future trading relationship being in place, or with a limited trading relationship being in place, will have significant implications for our economy and our public finances.  Just as the Government, with the support of the House, has to be ready for these scenarios, I also emphasise, unfortunately, to businesses today, that our period of preparation for dealing with reopening our economy and the consequences of Covid-19 must also have an eye to where we all could be in dealing with Brexit towards the end of the year.</p> <p> While I am aware of how great the risks are, and the level of uncertainty in companies and families and with our citizens today, I have little doubt that we can rebuild our economy and get our citizens back to work and that we can yet again build an economy that is capable of meeting the needs and aspirations of all who depend upon it.</p></speech>

On the issue that has arisen about women returning to work from maternity leave not being able to access the temporary wage subsidy scheme, my question is whether it can be fixed on an administrative basis by Revenue.  Does it require a change in primary legislation to fix the issue?</p></speech>

It is the case that the description of payroll in the primary legislation and the date have created this issue to which the Deputy has referred.  I am examining it with the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners to identify whether there is a way to resolve it.  I am not at present in a position to be able to inform the House that there is but we are examining it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="12:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000005#C00400"><p>The stability programme update to which the Minister referred was published on 21 April and the central scenario provided for a projected deficit this year of &euro;23 billion.  It set out other scenarios and the severe downside scenario projected that the deficit could be &euro;29 billion.  One month on, and taking account of the extra fiscal commitments the Government has made and the up-to-date economic environment, what is the best estimate of what the deficit will be in 2020?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="12:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000005#C00500"><p>Of the decisions made by the Government on the business support package, the ones that are likely to impact on our deficit position for this year relate to where we are with the restart grant and the rates waiver.  While, of course, hundreds of millions of euro is a considerable amount of money those decisions of themselves only move us beyond that &euro;23 billion figure by that amount.  However, I believe it is inevitable that further decisions will have to be made in the coming weeks on, for example, income supports and how we support our health services.  Because of this, and the external environment we are in, the figure will be ahead of &euro;23 billion.  I expect that we are already approaching the upper end of the deficit horizon published in the stability programme update.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1459" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="12:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000005#C00600"><p>I thank the Minister.  He and the Taoiseach met the main five retail banks on 11 May.</p> <p>A statement issued by the Government following that meeting indicated that business and mortgage customers would have the option of having the term of the loan extended so they do not face a rise in monthly repayments when they resume paying.  The banks have not made a similar public statement, at least not that I am aware of.  Was a commitment given at the meeting that in respect of the five banks, all personal and business customers who are availing of a payment break can have the term of their loan extended to whatever extent is required so that their repayments remain the same?  Is that the commitment that was given?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="12:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000006#D00200"><p>Yes.  In the meeting we had with the banks we put that to them.  However, a number of them had already indicated that an extension to the time by which the loan could be repaid might be a better way for some loan owners to deal with the issue of the management of the repayment of debt.  I am not aware at the moment of any bank that is not complying with that.  If it is the case, and it may well be, prompted by the question the Deputy has put to me, I would certainly be interested in getting the information from him.  The point that we made in that meeting and that I made in the House when we had this discussion three weeks ago was that, throughout this period, no bank should have excess profit available to it as a result of the way in which businesses and families are being treated.  As the Deputy will have seen from the quarterly trading statements that have been published by our banks, all of them are now moving into a position of considerable losses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1521" speakername="P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan" time="12:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000006#D00300"><p>An ch&eacute;ad cheist at&aacute; agam, t&aacute; s&iacute; mar gheall ar mhorg&aacute;ist&iacute;.  People who are on the wage subsidy scheme are currently having a difficulty in drawing down mortgages.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of it.  Will he make a statement on the matter to clarify it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="12:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000006#D00400"><p>I am aware of the matter and I have seen the work that has been done on it, in particular by the<i>Irish Examiner</i>, which has been examining this issue.  My view is that participation in the wage subsidy scheme should not be a reason for treating an applicant in a different way.  What I expect to happen is that if somebody's income has come down as a result of what has happened with Covid-19, the banks will assess whether that person will be in a position to repay the loan in the future.  It would be appropriate, if the incomes of families, workers and businesses are coming down, that care be taken to ensure that if loans are taken out, people are in a position to repay it in the future.  I am not in a position to get involved in any individual decisions in this regard but the Central Bank has indicated that care needs to be taken and that where loans are granted during this period, those who give the loan and those who receive it are both equally confident that it can be repaid.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1521" speakername="P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan" time="12:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000006#D00500"><p>An dara cheist at&aacute; agam, t&aacute; s&iacute; mar gheall ar an wage subsidy scheme ar&iacute;s.  We in this Chamber are well aware that the wage subsidy scheme is a taxable source of income.  I am not so sure that message is quite out there among the public.  It is out there is some circles but I do not think it is as obvious to most people as it is to those of us in here.  Does the Minister have any plans to relay to the wider public that the wage subsidy is a taxable source of income and explain how that will be rolled out going forward?  It is just to give taxpayers reassurance that they will not be hit with a massive tax bill later in the year and that this will be done in a progressive way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="12:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000006#D00600"><p>This issue gained some prominence a few days after the wage subsidy scheme was launched.  I acknowledge the co-operation of this House in allowing the passage of the wage subsidy scheme such that we now have over 400,000 citizens depending on a job because of that wage subsidy scheme and over 50,000 employers.  In its absence, our live register and pandemic unemployment payment recipient figures would be even higher.  I will use this opportunity to restate what I said at the time, namely, that the payment of the subsidy will be taxed later in the year.  The reason is that we have to maintain equivalence between that payment and, for example, many social welfare payments that are taxed.  Take, for example, a situation where we might have two firms, one of which has seen its income fall and is on the wage subsidy scheme, while the income of the other has fallen but not by enough for it to be on the wage subsidy scheme.</p> <p>In that case I have a duty to make sure that the employees for both schemes are treated the same way.</p></speech>

For this reason I believe that we must disregard the conventional approach to the cyclical economic downturn and develop new world solutions that serve the people and not the fiscal templates of pre-crisis and pre-Covid-19 textbooks.</p>  <p>  I welcome the suggested financial package of &euro;1 trillion that was mooted in the EU in recent days but I am afraid that much more will be required.  The Federal Reserve in the United States has committed $3 trillion between April and June as a start.  Europe needs to think much bigger.  The EU population is 445 million and the US population is 328 million, but granted our economy is a little smaller.  I feel that we have an awful lot to do.  What they do for us will be contingent on what we can do for our people.  We cannot countenance another period of austerity in this country.</p>  <p>  I will bank the following questions and perhaps the Minister's officials will respond to me later by email.  This is to allow other Members in to make their points.  What have been Ireland's asks with regard to EU grant aid?  I am conscious that we cannot strangle businesses with debt and think that we have dealt with the issue.  Given the negative vibes from the Governments of the Netherlands and Austria and other northern EU member states over the last 24 hours, has the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, had bilateral contacts with his counterparts in those Governments?  If the Minister has not, why not?  Will the Minister have those contacts to state Ireland's position and to indicate what our asks and needs will be?  Does the Minister accept that the &euro;1 trillion that has been announced, half being for grant aid and half for loans, is insufficient in what it can mean for Ireland?</p></speech>

Ireland is just 1.1% of the population of the EU whereas Italy, for example, is nearly 14% and they are in a very bad way themselves.  While I appreciate that many of our supports will be contingent on what the EU gives to Ireland, the SME sector is made up of some 250,000 companies, which is 1 million employees, this is substantially less than the figure for foreign direct investment and Enterprise Ireland with 500,000 between them, the average rates grant of up to &euro;10,000 to be payable will be some &euro;2,000 to &euro;5,000.  This is not going to do anything for those businesses.  Is the Minister prepared to consider up to &euro;30,000, as suggested by me a fortnight ago and echoed by my colleague Deputy Troy in recent days?</p>  <p>  Does the Government intend to extend the current moratorium on redundancies or will the Government reintroduce what existed previously whereby firms that are faced with a situation of an employee who was unemployed for six weeks are entitled to apply for redundancy?  Will the Government give up to 60% or more by way of a refund to those employers?</p></speech>

There are issues regarding the Covid-19 insurance and emerging issues out of claims under that insurance because of insurance companies not wanting to cover them.  There is also the legal mess that may emerge because of the collapse of US and international funds.  Will the Minister put together in his Department an immediate analysis of these issues, which were raised at the committee yesterday?  Will the Minister provide the House with the information on how the State sees it?  Will the Minister then put in place a mechanism to avoid the legal mess that can be created by claims and disputes with these State projects and contracts?</p></speech>

I met the CEOs of all the insurance companies earlier in the year but that was pre-Covid.  I have met the Alliance for Insurance Reform and I plan to meet both the alliance and Insurance Ireland again in the coming weeks.  My message to the insurance sector is that there was no difference between advice the Government gave for companies to consider trading on public health grounds and a mandate for them to close.  We were very clear that the guidance was the same.  I made very clear my requirement that all companies be treated fairly throughout this period.  The insurance sector will need to have clients at the other end of this that they are in a position to reinsure.  The issues relating to insurance, as the Deputy well knows, are complex but I am also aware that not making progress on this issue and not trying to alleviate some of this difficulty are big constraints on companies reopening at the moment.</p>  <p>  I will revert to Deputy McGuinness and either the House or a committee in the coming weeks with our perspective on the issues raised yesterday.  Important issues were raised and we agree on some of them, including on the risks there will be.  I will make two points to the Deputy.  First, many have been critical at times about how long it has taken to complete tendering processes for important projects.  We tried to put in place contracts that would give safeguards to the taxpayer.  We will now evaluate contracts that are in place for important projects to see how they respond to the issues the Deputy raised yesterday.</p>  <p>  My second point relates to the issues I have debated with the Deputy in recent years regarding the difficulty in getting companies to deliver public projects, the competition for the workers needed to deliver homes and other projects these companies could do that may be easier and more commercially attractive.  That economy has changed also and there will be a value in public contracts that this Government or the next will stand over for those who have them.</p></speech>

I ask that the Ceann Comhairle be ruthless and let me know when my time is up.  I will ask the Minister a number of questions and use my time to go back and forth between us.</p>  <p>  In his response to Deputy Michael McGrath in respect of women returning from maternity leave being excluded from the wage subsidy scheme, the Minister said the matter was being examined.  I think the question the Deputy was putting related to whether primary legislation was necessary.  The Minister said he was getting advice on the matter.  On 15 April, the Minister announced that the subsidy would increase from 70% to 85% for a group of employees, despite the clear provisions of the legislation.  My colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, wrote to the Minister on 20 April and sought legal advice as to how that change was made in the absence of legislation.  The Minister replied that he had asked Revenue to operate the scheme as if the legislation provided for 85% and not 70%, promising that the necessary change would be made to the legislation further down the line.  If that mechanism can be used to change the percentage from 70% to 85%, surely the Minister can use the same mechanism to instruct Revenue to deal with the issue of women on maternity benefit.</p>  <p>  I think there is cross-party consensus in the Chamber, including in the Minister's party, that the current position is unacceptable and discriminatory and needs to be sorted.  Let us sort it collectively.  I ask the Minister to answer my direct question.  Given that he has already used the mechanism to increase the percentage from 70% to 85%, can he not do exactly the same for the group of women I outlined to get this issue sorted quickly?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="12:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000008#F00500"><p>It was because of the legislation that I was able to make the change I did to the level of subsidy that would be available for participants in the wage subsidy scheme at different levels of income.  The decision I made then, by offering guidance to the Revenue Commissioners, did not change the eligibility criteria for the scheme or the number of people who were able to access the scheme and the reasons for so doing.</p> <p>It influenced the rates for groups and citizens already on the scheme.  If I could have given a clear answer to the Deputy on whether we can deal with this matter by administrative means, I would have given that answer to Deputy Michael McGrath because he asked the same question.  Maybe Deputy Cullinane could tell me whether, if it turns out that legislation is needed, he would support the formation of a new Government that he would not be part of in order to allow us to deal with this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.38" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="12:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000009#G00200"><p>With respect, smart alec answers about Government formation do not cut it when we are dealing with women on maternity leave.  The Minister's party refuses to talk to mine so let us stop the nonsense.  I asked a straight question.  Deputy Donohue is the Minister for Finance and he has officials at his disposal.  I do not.  The Minister has been given advice.  Deputy Doherty made a phone call to the Revenue Commissioners and was informed that they are examining this matter and would work with the Minister's Department on it.  I am asking a fair question.  Can this be resolved for the women on maternity leave?  The Minister should not make a political point of this and come back with glib responses.  I asked him a fair question and I sought a fair response.  It is unacceptable that the Minister politicised his response in the manner he did.</p>  <p>  I want to move on to the matter of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  This matter is also important for significant numbers of people because there is some speculation that the payment could be cut back at some point.  I know the Minister has written to the Business Committee requesting that the Estimate for Vote 37 be taken next week.  He indicated in that letter that he would take the additional spending in the 12-week period and the additional money required until the end of the year into account.  He also stated that he would take projections on the employment situation into account.  I have a number of straight questions for the Minister on this matter.  How many people on the PUP does the Minister expect to return to work over the next while?  How many will be left on the PUP?  Given that people need certainty, as they have had all the same bills and stresses in recent weeks, it would be wise if the payment remained at &euro;350 until the end of the year.  We want to get as many of those people back to work as possible.  That will depend on the policy choices made on stimulus and investment, as was said earlier, rather than the path of austerity and cuts that was chosen previously.  People want that reassurance that their incomes will not be cut or pared back.  Can the Minister give that commitment?</p></speech>

It sometimes seems that Sinn F&eacute;in thinks it is the only party that can make political points about anything.  What I was saying to the Deputy was reaffirming what Sinn F&eacute;in heard from the Revenue Commissioners.  It is my intention that all people will be treated equally under this legislation.  I explained why this issue has developed and I made clear my desire to see if there is a way to deal with it.  My approach appears to have been confirmed by the conversation the Revenue Commissioners had with Deputy Doherty.  I will not allow any allegation to be created in the development of this issue to the effect that it is my intention to not treat people in a way that is not fair or respectful.  It is my intention to treat all in a fair and respectful manner.  That is why I am examining this issue to see if there is a way of dealing with it.  It is perfectly appropriate for me to ask that if it turns out that I am not be able to deal with this issue in the way I want, I will ask for co-operation in dealing with it.  I accept the concerns that have been raised by Deputies on this matter and I am simply examining it to see if there is a way in which it can be dealt with.</p>  <p>  To answer the Deputy's question on how many people we expect to be on the PUP during the latter stages of the reopening plan, I would say that we will probably be in a better position to answer that question with data next week.  The reason I say that is that even as recently as this morning I met officials from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to see if we could get a sense of the number of recipients of the PUP who are leaving it at the moment.  Unfortunately, we only have two days' worth of information and I would be wary of drawing any conclusions from it.  By the weekend or by Monday, we will know how many people have left the PUP because of the reopening of the economy at that point.  I will then be in a position to be able to give the House an informed estimate on what we think is happening with the number of citizens who are on the PUP and what we think is likely to happen as the economy reopens.</p>  <p>  On the continuation of the PUP throughout the remainder of 2020, there is a timing difference between the end date of the payment and where matters stand with the reopening of our economy.</p> <p>The reason for that, as I hope Deputy Cullinane can appreciate, is that we made the decision on the phased reopening of our economy after we put the PUP in place.  The Government will have to consider the issue in the coming weeks.  As soon as a decision has been made on it, we will, of course, update the House.</p> <p> I will make a concluding point.  If the PUP were continued at the level the Deputy is suggesting, up to the end of this year, we would then face the understandable issue whereby citizens who were unemployed before the Covid-19 pandemic would be asking why their jobseeker's payments were lower than the current PUP.  We would all face demands for an increase in the levels of income supports to the level of the PUP.  That merits consideration.</p></speech>

This is happening every day of the week, yet we still see insurance companies fighting tooth and nail to cripple the same small businesses.  These are the businesses that have come through the recession and battled through everything.  I spoke yesterday evening to a businesswoman who has been in business for 40 years.  She does not know whether she will be able to continue in business.  Affected businesses are employing many people, particularly in rural areas and small towns.  The insurance companies continue to play with the words but they are also playing with people's livelihoods and those of their communities.  They are doing so on two fronts, as the Minister knows.  First, they are flatly refusing to honour claims made through the business interruption clauses, even where the policy document is very explicit and states the business is covered in instances where a national or local government instructs temporary closure.</p>  <p>  One of the pillars of insurance, which is compulsory after all, is good faith.  When business interruption insurance is taken out, it is done in good faith on the grounds that the insurance company will provide cover in the event of a loss.  Therefore, there are many business owners who consider the immoral behaviour of the insurance industry as theft.</p>  <p>  Some insurance companies are refusing to refund even part of a premium while a business is closed.  Has the Minister sought uniformity across the insurance industry in respect of its approach to businesses that have been closed?  He spoke about this earlier but it is not happening on the ground.  I am speaking to businessowners every day who tell me their insurance companies are showing complete inflexibility towards them.</p>  <p>  In Britain, the Financial Conduct Authority is seeking a court judgment on behalf of businesses to clarify the issue.  As Deputy Donohoe is the Minister in charge here, is he considering doing the same thing?  Are any instruments of sanction available to him to take control of the situation in regard to the insurance industry and to ensure it acts in an ethical manner?</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has written to the Central Bank to ask whether it will take similar actions here.  I presume the Minister has had similar conversations with the Central Bank.  I remind him that it is precisely for scenarios such as this that Sinn F&eacute;in tried in vain to progress the Multi-Party Actions Bill in 2017.  That would have been a game-changer, enabling groups of cases that share characteristics sufficiently to be dealt with collectively.  Currently, the only real option is for a test case to proceed and related cases to follow subsequently on that basis.  Justice delayed is justice denied for many of the small businesses that do not have the financial capacity to take on the might of the insurance industry.  Does the Minister agree that blocking the legislation was wrong and that it should be revisited?</p>  <p>  On the banks, I thank the Minister for the information.  He had a conversation with the banks on the way they are increasing outstanding balances by thousands of euro because under the current payment breaks, interest will still continue to accrue.  Has the Minister advised the banks that this is unacceptable?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.42" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1588" speakername="Patricia Ryan" time="12:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000010#H00300"><p>I asked the Minister to do everything in his power to ensure the bank branches that have closed temporarily because of Covid-19 will reopen when it is safe to do so.  On 24 March, Bank of Ireland closed its branches in Monasterevin and Kilcullen in County Kildare, along with approximately 99 other branches throughout the country.</p> <p>Most of these branches are in small rural towns.  They are an integral part of the community within those towns and the smaller branches are a key part of the local economy in the likes of Monasterevin and Kildare.  They are particularly important to people who are older and not equipped to follow the trends that banks are pushing towards online banking.  I have written to Gavin Kelly, CEO of Retail Ireland for Bank of Ireland.  Despite being asked directly if he can confirm that the branches in Monasterevin and Kilcullen will reopen, he has refused to confirm this.  The presence of a bank in a small town is a key reason small businesses choose to locate there.  Such banks are also an important consideration when people choose to move to rural areas.  We have already seen Covid-19 used as an excuse by Debenhams to close its Irish stores.  I would not like to see this crisis used by our very profitable banks to offload branches that may be as profitable or, more importantly, offload workers who may be on a higher rate of pay because of their expertise.  I am glad to see that the Debenhams workers have a very active campaign, aptly named The Devil Wears Debenhams.  I urge people to stand in solidarity with employees of Debenhams in Ireland and not to purchase items from Debenhams under any circumstances.  This is a company that has transferred its assets to England in an apparent attempt to avoid having to make redundancy payments that are due to staff here.  Workers in Laura Ashley, Oasis and Warehouse have also become victims of the virus of greed.  It is high time we had a government that stands up for ordinary workers and their families and puts the common good ahead of vested interests.  We need to ensure that the banks, which will not pay corporation tax for many years to come, make some effort to show contrition for what happened in the decade appropriately referred to as the noughties.  The very least we can expect is that local branches in small towns stay open and available to their customers.</p> <p> As this is my maiden speech, I would like to thank the people of south Kildare and the Portarlington-Laois area who put their trust in me and my party, Sinn F&eacute;in.  I assure them that I will work to the best of my ability to represent them in this House.  I would also like to thank my husband Michael and my two sons, Conor and Mitchell.</p></speech>

I cannot give her information now as to what the future plans are for the status of that branch - it is not a decision I make - but I will certainly correspond with the bank and relay its answer back to her.</p>  <p>  Regarding the points Deputy Conway-Walsh made, the Central Bank has now engaged directly with the insurance industry on many of the matters to which she referred.  The Central Bank has written to the CEOs of all the major insurers and stressed to them that customer-based solutions to these issues have to be put forward.  If the insurance policy is not clear and if there is doubt about the meaning of particular terms, the interpretation that is most favourable to the customer is the one that should prevail.  I have said this to the insurance sector, I have said it publicly, and the Central Bank is engaging on the matter.</p></speech>

For them, turning up to work every day is brave.  Not only do they play a central role in ensuring that 70% of Covid-19 patients recover from this deadly virus, but they comfort terrified patients and spend time with the dying in their final hours.</p>  <p>  Too many people have paid too high a price for doing their duty.  Almost one in three health workers have now contracted Covid-19.  Nurses deserve more than our thanks and applause.  They now work long hours on modest pay to provide this most vital service in our time of crisis.  Despite the absolute necessity of the work of nurses and the dangers they are exposed to, their overtime is taxed at the higher rate.  In financial terms, we thank them for going the extra mile by taxing them.  It seems inevitable that we need some sort of stimulus package to kick-start the economy back to life and the Minister has clearly outlined exactly how that will work.  Will he consider providing tax relief to nurses as part of such a stimulus?</p></speech>

A person who has an average mortgage of &euro;200,000 at 3.25% would have paid approximately &euro;2,500 in interest over the period of the pandemic.  People are concerned that our interest rates are distorted compared with the eurozone and that banks are passing this on to customers.</p>  <p>  This week I was speaking to an individual who is self-employed.  He has 4.75% on his variable rate mortgage.  He is self-employed so it is not the case that he can go and switch his mortgage.  The banks have strict protocols and procedures now.  It is clear that we need to do something on this.</p>  <p>  The deputy governor of the Central Bank has been on the record as saying that the banks are charging double the interest rates that are needed to be profitable.  The banks should show solidarity.  There is no need to be gouging customers with such interest rates through this serious and significant challenge to our country.  I welcome the engagement the Government had with the banks last week.  We need to continue to take a tough stance on this.</p></speech>

I have pulled together the group of mid-west Oireachtas Members.  We had an inaugural meeting of the group this week to support Shannon Airport.</p>  <p>  It is clear that key sectors in our economy, including aviation and tourism, will need recovery plans and stimuluses.  I want to get the Minister's views on that.  I also want to get the Minister's views on the extension of the wage subsidy scheme.  This is key for aviation, tourism and all our sectors.</p></speech>

I will begin with the point that was brought to me by Deputy O'Donnell on how money from the European recovery fund will be allocated.  The European Commission will perform an independent assessment regarding how countries have been affected by Covid-19.  I would expect that included in the criteria will be the mortality levels within particular countries, the level of income those countries have per head of population and any fall across that period.</p> <p>The Deputy raised the maternity leave point and again I indicate my understanding of why this is an issue.  As I have said, we are looking at a number of avenues with the matter.</p> <p> Deputy Peter Burke mentioned interest rates but neither I nor the Central Bank is in a position to determine or set interest rates.  Interest rates are high in existing contracts for mortgages for many different reasons.  One is our historical position with non-performing loans and another is the level of capital that many of our banks must hold currently, which is very different from the European norm.  I have emphasised the point in the past, and I have seen progress on it, that new loans offered should be at interest rates that are more competitive.  There has been some experience of that happening.</p> <p> To respond to Deputy Joe Carey's comments, I absolutely understand the role of aviation as a catalyst for economic recovery and as part of that, I understand the role of Shannon Airport.  In a previous role as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I had the opportunity to meet its representatives on many occasions with Deputy Carey.  I will work with him and his group on the role of different airports.  The Deputy is aware, for example, of the announcement recently made by Dublin Airport Authority.  This is a sign of the challenge that many airports are facing.  We will have to see if there is a way of working with the sector as a whole or with those State airports in their entirety to see how they can be supported as we look at how our country is reopened in the coming weeks, months and beyond.</p> <p> The Deputy mentioned the high rate of income tax for overtime payments for nurses and I absolutely understand why the point was made.  I concur with him in recognising the major contribution being made by nurses in hospitals day and night.  I hope he understands, however, that I cannot single out any particular public servants, no matter how much I value them, for additional tax treatment compared with others.  We will enter a period, as our economy recovers, when we will need to be very careful about how we manage money to ensure it is used in the most effective way.  I understand why the Deputy is making the point and I absolutely share his appreciation for the work done by nurses.</p> <p> I understand Deputy Carroll MacNeill's point on the maternity leave issue and I have indicated to the House that I am aware of it.  There was also the point on the recovery fund and my expectations of what will happen with deficits across Europe in future.  As we work our way through this Covid-19 crisis, the deficits for 2020 of every member of the European Union are increasing very quickly.  Over time, for reasons related to the financial markets and the gradual normalisation of the budgetary framework of the European Union, I expect those deficits to fall.  The pace at which they will fall is currently unclear as we are still unclear about where we stand with Covid-19 and public health in Europe.  It is the safest route for Ireland to have a credible pathway for reducing our deficit once we regain our public and economic health.  It is in our interests to do that but for 2020 it is already clear, as I mentioned to Deputy Michael McGrath, that we will deliver a very significant deficit for the year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.60" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1559" speakername="Neasa Hourigan" time="13:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000013#L00200"><p>I will not be sharing time with anybody so the Minister will only have to deal with one Green Party Deputy.  I thank the Minister for the update.  Despite the implementation and further proposals for some of the largest collective stimulus measures in our history, it seems a partial recovery in 2021 is the best we can expect.  Now is the time to act but it is also a time to reflect on how we organise our economy in order to find new ways to structure our economic activity.</p>  <p>  I am very heartened to hear the Minister flag the need for new business models.  Given the distress that many businesses now face and the increase in savings by individuals, the Green Party believes the co-operative business model could and should provide a core part of rebuilding efforts after Covid-19.</p> <p>This model of community-based economic organisation ensures that our business community is guided by the principles of economic democracy and that such organisations are rooted in the interests of their localities.  They offer not just a new source of financing for businesses, but will help us to build a better, more environmentally conscious and more equitable society.</p> <p> According to the IMF, the world economy will lose a cumulative &euro;8.1 trillion in output due to Covid-19 over the next two years.  This impact will be felt faster and harder than that of the 2008 financial crash.  Our economy is expected to contract by 6.8% this year.  In a survey from Chambers Ireland, half of SMEs expected their revenues to decline by at least 60% over the next three months.  Six out of every ten companies have been forced to seek deferrals on their overheads, mostly on payments to landlords, banks or the Revenue Commissioners.</p> <p> This is an extraordinary disruption of economic activity.  We are potentially heading into one of the worst recessions in our State's history.  As the Minister pointed out, unlike in previous recessions, we have strategic national economic strengths on which to draw.  Although the nature of employment was variable, unemployment was low, economic growth was steady and consumer spending was strong.  This economic downturn will be unlike anything before it, though.  The collapse in consumer spending and the resultant cash flow problems that this has resulted in for businesses were not the result of instability in our financial system or the collapse of a property bubble, but the result of social distancing restrictions and the consequential closing of retail outlets, the hospitality sector, businesses, offices and the like.  Consumers are not spending because they are unable to do so.  Instead, they are saving their money and businesses are struggling with cash flow.</p> <p> We should take advantage of the situation.  We must look to the co-operative business model and begin to promote community-based economic organisations that focus on community wealth.  This will provide not just a place for Irish savers to invest their money, but also a new source of financing.  The co-operative business should be an integral part of rebuilding our economy post Covid-19.  Co-operatives are guided by principles of solidarity and economic democracy and are rooted in their local communities.  They run according to the interests of their members rather than some unknown and disconnected shareholder.  Studies in the UK have shown that co-operatives create higher profits than conventional businesses and are more likely to survive their first five years of operation.  The five largest co-operatives in the UK paid 50% more corporate tax than Amazon, Facebook, Apple, eBay and Starbucks combined.  Employees of co-operatives report higher levels of job satisfaction and economic well-being as well as higher rates of productivity.  Compared with conventional businesses, co-operatives have lower levels of staff turnover, lower rates of pay inequality and lower rates of absenteeism.  Co-operatives must form the foundation of our efforts as we move forward.  They would be better for workers, consumers and communities.</p> <p> The legal, regulatory, auditing and financial institutions of our economy are predominantly designed for private companies and tailored to their needs.  As a result, co-operatives operate under a framework that disadvantages them, burdening them with a layer of rules and regulations that equivalent conventional firms do not face.  Will the Minister indicate how he might address this competitive disadvantage faced by co-operatives?  Will he speak to introducing right-to-own legislation to support employee buy-outs and the co-operatisation of existing businesses?</p> <p> I have reports from constituents who are being advised by mortgage brokers to wait until three months after their last temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, payments before applying for mortgages.  Some have had approved mortgages pulled by pillar banks as they went to draw down their mortgages.  Other constituents have had issues with Rebuilding Ireland's home loans, which are provided to people who have already been refused mortgages.  While I appreciate that the banks need to be prudent in their lending, it is disheartening to see those that we bailed out being so quick to abandon mortgage applications.  From the banks' perspective, I understand that the uncertainty around the Covid payment and the TWSS might not help their decision-making processes.  Will the Minister advise when the Government will be in a position to provide a definitive view on what will happen to the Covid payment and TWSS in the months ahead?</p> <p> It is highly likely that there will be an increase in the levels of personal insolvency and home repossessions over the coming months.  This is on top of the number of unresolved cases from the previous recession.  A number of legislative and regulatory updates can and should be made to facilitate the efficient and fair processing of any such insolvency or home repossession.  In anticipation of an increased number of cases, the funding allocated to agencies and NGOs dealing with and advocating on behalf of those involved in personal insolvencies and home repossessions should be reviewed.</p>  <p>Does the Minister have plans to review funding and supports allocated to the Legal Aid Board, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service and Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC?</p></speech>

It is very different from what has happened before in that it is happening in Ireland and across the world because of a public health decision that governments have taken and citizens are complying with.  It is so different from where we have been before.  The Deputy also made a point regarding how savings have gone up and by how quickly they have gone up.  When we take a step back from the terrible harm with which we are all grappling at the moment and our efforts to repair it, we could say that until this crisis arose, the economy had been performing very well.  This, in turn, has allowed the State to take the place of spending from the private sector, which is now translating into really high savings rates.  If the next Government and this House were able to give confidence regarding the future public health and economic health of our country  - which I believe we will be able to do - that current very high savings rate and the ability to spend it in our shops and invest it could be a very powerful force in what happens in the economy, even later on this year.  We have a number of bridges to cross before we get to that point.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's question regarding the personal insolvency legislation, the existing personal insolvency legislation has been successful to date in preventing many of the worst expectations of many regarding repossessions in Ireland from being realised.  There are more than 80,000 restructured loans in place and in the case of more than 85% of those loans, terms are being met.  I believe that the personal insolvency legislation we have in place is capable of dealing with the difficulties that may lie ahead.  However, it does need to be reviewed and we need to consult the Insolvency Service of Ireland to ensure the framework in place will be fair for everybody in the types of challenges that could unfold. </p>  <p>  On the question on income, I respectfully make the case that I am not sure the issue is the continuation of the wage subsidy scheme or pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, in the future that might be causing the difficulties to which the Deputy referred in regard to the handling of loan applications.  I know the difficulties are real because I have also experienced these cases.  The question is around how quickly income will rebuild.  We all need to be in a place - I know this is a very difficult and sensitive matter for many - that where loans are given, the person giving the loan and the person receiving it are both confident that the terms of the loan can be met.  The Deputy will recall the difficulties into which many entered when it became clear that could not happen.  There is a need for care to be taken now.  These issues have to be dealt with sensitively by banks which are dealing with families who are in situations they never thought they would be in.  </p>  <p>  On the co-operative model to which the Deputy referred, we have a credit union movement in Ireland.  I am sure there will be an opportunity for the Deputy and I to discuss this matter later.  I reiterate that I welcome those who want to set up a different banking model in Ireland but if they want to do that, with respect, they cannot expect the State to capitalise that model.  I have met the leaders of the credit union movement on two separate occasions since the Covid-19 crisis began.  They would understandably question why, if we were making money available for a new banking model in Ireland, we were not making that money available to them.  If there are organisations or entities that believe they can set up a different banking model in Ireland, I know there are many, including the Central Bank of Ireland and me, would be willing to engage with them on that.</p> <p> However, in terms of moving this forward, it will have to be on the basis of their ability to fund it themselves, as is the case with the credit union movement.  As a next step, in the aftermath of a report that was done by me and the Minister for Rural and Community Development on the community banking model in Ireland, we have a consultant who is doing some work in this area for the Department of Finance and the Department of Rural and Community Development.  We can perhaps use that as a process for dealing with the issue to which the Deputy referred.</p></speech>

A few short months ago, nobody could have envisaged the impact Covid-19 would have, not only on Ireland but on the world.  This is a different crisis, a unique and unprecedented crisis, but there are lessons we can learn from the last one.</p>  <p>  The first lesson I want to address is on the issue of EU solidarity.  The initial attitude to the last economic crisis, as the Minister will recall, lacked solidarity and a spirit of cohesion.  In the initial stages of that crisis, countries like Greece, Spain, Portugal and ourselves were left to our own devices and were required, for example, to take upon our own taxpayers the burden of recapitalising of banks.  Victim countries, if I use that phrase, in this particular crisis cannot be blamed.  There cannot be that attitude because Covid affects everybody, not, let me be quite clear, that there was any justification for blaming anybody in the past.  What is now required is a genuine sense of solidarity.</p>  <p>  There is a glimmer of hope in that regard in the Franco-German proposal.  It is a modest enough proposal.  Looking at the politics of it, from my perspective - I am interested in the Minister's view on it - it is almost what Angela Merkel has discerned would be acceptable to the Germans, namely, funding of &euro;500 billion.  On top of the moneys available through the European Central Bank, it is a significant sum.  It is not sufficient but it is a start.  However, even that is not over the line and I am interested in the comments the Minister has had to date in relation to how it is going to be expended.  We still have to get over the next European Council meeting and the so-called frugal four, comprising The Netherlands, Austria, Sweden and Denmark.  Their opposition may well be sufficient to block it.</p>  <p>  Does the Minister agree with me that a eurobond-like fund, whatever we call it, that allows money to be deployed not as loads but in the way cohesion funding was deployed in the past, supporting grant aid to countries affected by this crisis, is absolutely an essential component of our recovery?  If he agrees with that, how is such funding to be deployed?  Is it to be buckled onto the multi-annual financial framework, which seems to the German-proposed solution?  I think it is a good proposal because the moneys would be part of the general financing mechanism and could be deployed front-up.  What work has the Minister done to support that proposal to date?</p>  <p>  I have a linked question.  Has the Minister been briefed, and can he share such a briefing with us, on the consequences of the German constitutional court's findings last week regarding future German participation in funds like this?  Obviously, the finding does not yet pertain to this fund.  We know the Eurosceptics in Germany, including the Alternative f&uuml;r Deutschland, are likely to take a case against this proposal.  What is the Minister's view on that?</p></speech>

I wish to make one point.  I saw Deputy Howlin having to deal with many of these issues in this House from 2011 onwards.  The ability of our country to borrow in the way we are able to now is in no small way attributable to the work the Deputy did when he was in my job for a number of years.  I want to acknowledge that because I know the consequences he has faced as a result of the decisions he made.</p> <p>I have looked to build on his work. If he had been told in 2011 that our country would be able to borrow the amount of money we are now borrowing and at the rates on offer, even an optimistic soul like Deputy Howlin would have thought it unlikely.  We are doing that now, however.  I acknowledge Deputy Howlin's role in this regard.</p> <p> Taking the Deputy's first question on the adequacy of the proposal, I believe that the proposal of more than &euro;500 billion from the French and German Governments is considerable.  I see this issue in the round, however.  The European Central Bank has indicated that it is willing to make up to &euro;1 trillion of funding available to debt markets in Europe.  The package of measures I hope is going to be agreed fully by European finance Ministers this week - an additional &euro;500 million and the package that France and Germany have indicated they are willing to support - potentially takes the entire framework up to &euro;2 trillion.  Some of that consists of loans and some could be grants-----</p></speech>

I did that because, while nearly all of the time I am very much aligned with my Dutch colleagues, for example, regarding issues such as taxation and the responsibility we have for our own budgetary affairs, I genuinely believe - and Deputy Howlin touched on this - that the issue of Covid-19 is fundamentally different.  Moral hazard plays little role if we are dealing with a virus causing thousands of people to die in our countries every day.  That is why the Taoiseach and I supported the recovery fund concept.  It is not without challenges for us, which we will have to work our way through, but I have supported that concept as recently as yesterday morning during a meeting of the finance Ministers of the European Union.</p>  <p>  Turning to how the recovery funds will be allocated, I think I touched on that earlier with another Deputy.  What is going to happen is that the European Commission will bring forward its own formal proposal on this issue in the middle of June.</p></speech>

In fairness, it needs to be allocated primarily on the basis of those countries that have suffered the most from this disease with loss of life and loss of income.  That means there is a group of countries that are more likely, therefore, to benefit from it.  That is in our interests as well.  If we do not do that, we will exit this crisis at some point with countries growing further apart.  If that happens, it will pose a major question for the European project and as a small open trading country it is in our interest to avoid that happening.</p></speech>

Sometimes I hear commentary, even in this House and even today, about people choosing austerity, as if anybody picked austerity when there was no other option because there was no other money available to us.  We are in a different landscape now and I hope we can have that sense of solidarity that will allow us to make the necessary decisions.  I would like to put several questions to the Minister, but I will focus on one final thing.</p>  <p>  I refer to a strategy to deal with the commercial semi-State companies.  Many of them are suffering incredibly under the Covid-19 restrictions.  The Minister will have seen the announcements from the Dublin Airport Authority.  He referred to them yesterday.  We can go through all of them, from Bord na M&oacute;na to the CI&Eacute; Group, but in the minute available to him, can the Minister provide a brief outline of his discussions to date in support of the semi-State companies, where he sees them emerging and what he can do to ensure that all of them continue to thrive in future.</p></speech>

Again, I am strongly in favour - as was Deputy Howlin - of good, strong management of our semi-State companies by those who run them.  They are dealing, however, with circumstances they played no role in triggering.  Regarding the larger issues developing, there is no doubt there is a challenge concerning public transport.  I support what the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Shane Ross, said some days ago concerning our desire and need to support public transport.</p> <p>It is of great intrinsic value.  If it was unavailable, that would have a significant effect on the ability of our economy to reopen.  Some of the issues in that regard are very significant.  How can we support Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus, for example, if they have far fewer passengers than was previously the case?  That would be through no fault of the companies but, rather, due to public health reasons.</p> <p> Significant work needs to be done regarding what will happen in our higher education institutions, including universities, where there is likely to be a large amount of change in areas such as the student mix.  We are not yet able to conclude what the needs of any of these sectors will be but as we move into the summer, the work that is now under way will need to conclude such that we can indicate to companies where they stand.</p></speech>

I will try to make my questions as short as possible.</p>  <p>  On maternity leave, I note the Minister's comments to other Deputies on the legal aspect being under consideration.  Is consideration being given to extending maternity leave as part of that process?  Could that be done?  It is not an ideal time to have a baby as the support that would normally kick in for the women concerned is lacking.  Is that issue under consideration?</p>  <p>  Is the Minister considering other changes relating to people who, for example, have underlying health conditions and whose workplace is open but it would be too big a risk for them to go to work?  I ask the Minister to respond and I will then ask my other questions.</p></speech>

If we cannot find another way of dealing with it, my preference is for it to be dealt with as a tax policy or administration matter.  Changes in other areas of policy, such as the length of maternity leave, may cause other issues that would need to be considered.  This is an important and pressing matter for many.  If there is a way to deal with it through the administration of our tax code, my preference would be to do so.</p>  <p>  I am not currently considering any issues relating to underlying health conditions.  Did the Deputy raise that issue as a way of dealing with the maternity issue or does she have another issue in mind?</p></speech>

When we were dealing with the legislation, I raised the fact that it appeared to be an anomaly that the issue of persons with very compromised health whose workplace was open was not addressed.  The Minister is not giving consideration to such issues.</p></speech>

Various issues have been raised.  Many have been addressed through the wage subsidy scheme and I have dealt with many of them in the House in recent weeks.  The issue of workers with underlying health conditions having to return to work has not developed in the way the Deputy may have feared.  If she has evidence to the contrary, I ask her to send it to me and I will look at it.  Our response to the virus was put together at speed.  It is benefiting more than 400,000 citizens.  It is never my intention not to respect the equality of citizens.</p></speech>

That does not necessarily involve countries taking an individual approach but, rather, having the same approach across the European Union.  All Members are paying great attention to the matters currently under discussion at European level.  There have been several very interesting proposals, including the Spanish proposal which I raised with the Taoiseach last week in the House.  It seems to be a very good idea.</p> <p>I wish to ask about the metrics or variables that might be used by the European Commission.  I accept that the countries that are most impacted should get the lion's share of support.  The metrics that are used are important for our economy because we really have two economies here.  We have the domestic economy and we have the economy that multinationals would inhabit, to a greater degree.  Indeed, the technology and pharmaceutical sectors may do very well during this crisis.  Does the Minister know what metrics will be used?  Will it be GDP or GNI?  What will the European Commission be looking at when considering the impact on our economy, particularly in the context of grants?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.85" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000019#R00200"><p>That is a very good question.  The European Commission is a number of weeks away from presenting proposals to the European Council or to finance ministers on this topic.  Obviously there is a lot of merit for us if the GNI approach is used because in many ways that offers a more accurate picture of how our economy is actually performing.  However, because a paper has not been tabled and we are not even at the point of informal consultation with the Commission on how performance will be measured, I cannot answer the Deputy's question.  Obviously we will try to ensure that our own economic circumstances are fairly and accurately appreciated and understood in any process that goes on.</p>  <p>  I briefly reiterate the point that I made to Deputy Howlin, namely, that many other countries, from an economic point of view, are dealing with difficult situations too.  It is worthwhile saying now that we are approaching this whole process as a net contributor to the European Union.  That is going to have a very big influence on our approach to this issue.</p></speech>

Clearly there is the crisis impact, the crisis period of Covid at the extreme end and then there is the recovery component.  Is a relaxation of the rules on the excessive deficit procedure being considered?  Living within the fiscal rules would be a bit of a straitjacket in terms of investing or providing a stimulus in the form of capital spending on housing, sustainable transport, human capital and so on.  Have there been discussions about that at this early stage?</p></speech>

My expectation is that almost all, if not all, countries will be in a position whereby their deficits are considerably above what would be expected in normal times under the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact.  There has not yet been a discussion regarding the normalisation of those rules again because we are a long way away from that point now.  In any discussions that are happening at European level, there is an appreciation that deficits will be going up for this year, as will debt.</p>  <p>  I do not think we should be seeing one part of this economic response as dealing with the harm of Covid and then another phase of this as the recovery phase because it all blends into one.  The wage subsidy scheme, for example, is a recovery plan for the Irish economy.  In the absence of that scheme, tens of thousands companies might not have been around today.  They merge in a different way than would have been the case previously.</p></speech>

Given that has now been stated publicly, controls such as enhanced oversight of capital projects will be necessary pretty quickly.</p> <p>Is the Minister enhancing that capacity within the Department or are there plans to enhance that capacity?  Is he talking to the State Claims Agency or any other agency in regard to beefing up what is needed to make sure there is not gouging, essentially, and that it is done in a way that takes account of the reality?</p></speech>

They are considering, insofar as they can, what are the consequences of Covid-19 for current major construction projects.  On the one hand, those in the construction sector are saying they are able to get back to work quickly and then, when they get back to work, they are then coming to those in this House, indicating the higher costs they are going to face.  Any claim in this area is going to be inquired into and treated very seriously by my Department and the other Departments that are responsible for projects.  I have heard many different demands placed upon me to get construction up and running and open again.  It is now happening for big projects in the first part of the reopening and, a day or two after it happens, this issue is now being raised.  Claims are going to be made, which is understandable, but we are going to challenge them and seek to understand exactly what is driving those kinds of claims.</p></speech>

Does the Minister agree it would be completely unacceptable for companies that are hugely profitable and paying large dividends to shareholders or, for example, that are registered offshore for tax purposes, to gain significant benefits?  I am aware of one company, which I will not name, but which has 1,000 employees.  Despite getting the wage subsidy scheme payments, it paid &euro;25 million in dividends to its shareholders, and it is also availing of wage subsidies in the UK.  In the meantime, it has slashed its contributions to the pension scheme for its own employees.  That is not acceptable.  Boston Scientific, another well-known company with &euro;1 billion in profits last year, is availing of the wage subsidy scheme although it pays very little tax as it is.  Perhaps the Minister can inform us how many offshore companies operating here are availing of the wage subsidy scheme or any other grants or supports from the State.  I hope we will get answers on that, if not today, then subsequently, or in writing.</p>  <p>  In contrast to that, and while those companies may be undeserving, the Minister talks about tapering off income supports for others who really need them.  I urge him not to do that, particularly for sectors where adherence to public health guidelines and the fallout of the public health emergency mean there will be no return to normal or to viability for the foreseeable future.  I ask the Minister to engage directly with workers and representatives from those sectors to discuss their future and viability.  In particular, I want to ask about the arts, live entertainment, music and so on, which are facing a very bleak future, if any future, in the short term.  Taxi drivers are linked to things like the arts, live entertainment, tourism and so on, which means their future is deeply precarious.  I ask the Minister to meet those groups, and perhaps others, and to engage with them urgently to discuss how we can secure a future for these workers, who are very important for us, but whose future is very bleak.  The English and foreign language education sector might be another we need to consider.</p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister on behalf of people who were on maternity leave and who are returning to work.  They should be given the wage subsidy scheme payment.  It is complete discrimination against people who were, in effect, working but on maternity leave to be denied that payment. </p></speech>

I will deal with the maternity leave issue.</p> <p>I explained earlier that I am considering options to see whether we can resolve this matter because the legislation as drafted was absolutely seeking to treat everybody equally in a time of great need.  In all of the different issues now being raised regarding the operation of the scheme, please let us also recognise that well over 400,000 citizens are now availing of the scheme.  If they were not, the companies for which they work might no longer be around.  It has been an invaluable intervention in supporting our economy at a time of huge strain.</p> <p> I will see whether it is possible for the Deputy to get information on the so-called offshore status of companies.  It may not be.  He will appreciate the challenge that I face is that if those companies are employing people in Ireland, I want those citizens to continue to have jobs.  That is what I was seeking to respond to.</p> <p> In the context of the point the Deputy made about dividend payments, we have a number of criteria in respect of the pandemic stabilisation fund to deal with some of the issues to which he referred.  If the State goes all the way towards providing credit at a very low rate to companies or goes so far as to take an equity state in companies, the issues to which the Deputy referred will be very important.  We need to ensure that companies act appropriately and are not advantaging themselves or their shareholders at a time at which the Government ends up playing a significant role in their affairs.</p> <p> On the point made about the future of the various income supports, as the Minister for Finance who, along with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Regina Doherty and the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation,Deputy Humphreys, introduced all of the supports, I am absolutely aware of the important role they play.  I know that where the Deputy will differ with me is that I am also of the view that we have to find a way in which we can afford these types of measures in the future.</p> <p> With regard to the various groups to which the Deputy referred, to be honest I cannot give an indication to him that I will be able to meet all of them.  Many Ministers are meeting groups at present and, in turn, those Ministers are meeting me.</p></speech>

They are some of the almost 2,000 workers who have been opportunistically thrown on the scrapheap by a company that had been seeking to exit the Irish market, a company of which Bank of Ireland is a part owner.  Of course, the public is, in turn, part owner of Bank of Ireland.  My first question is very simple.  Will the State continue to just sit idly by while a jobs massacre begins in retail?</p>  <p>  Last week, the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, caused a degree of outrage among the workers by suggesting that it is some comfort to them that they are getting the &euro;350 PUP but went on to say that the latter is only temporary.  In other words, the Government is preparing, and this was indicated again this morning by the Minister, to reduce the PUP for those Debenhams workers who have been unfortunate enough to have to deal with such a company and for the more than 500,000 other people on the payment.  My second very simple question for the Minister is whether he is prepared for the massive opposition that will face any attempt to reduce that payment, which has been implicitly accepted as the minimum level to allow people to live their lives?  Instead of this divide and rule between people on just &euro;200 and those on &euro;350 and attempting to level matters downwards, the Minister should accept that we need a basic minimum welfare payment.</p>  <p>  Does the Minister remember water charges?  Does he remember the level of opposition that defeated those charges?  Does he remember the fact the opposition to the water charges was not confined to the D&aacute;il Chamber but was based on people power outside the D&aacute;il which ultimately succeeded?  If he goes down the road of the substantial austerity he is talking about in terms of the PUP and public sector pay, that is the type of opposition that will face this Government or the next Government, which, presumably, will also involve Fine Gael.</p></speech>

I will speak about the role of the State in respect of an issue such as this.</p> <p>I also want to appreciate the huge amount of stress that has been caused to all who worked in Debenhams by the decision that has been made and how understandably angry and upset those workers will be at the very sudden loss of their jobs.  It is, however, the case that we cannot intervene directly as politicians in issues like that.  We do have the Labour Court and Workplace Relations Commission.  We have all of the organisations that are available to help at times of difficulty like this to see if fair outcomes can be reached.  Deputy Gannon raised this matter with me a couple of weeks ago and I have written back to him today with more up-to-date information on where this issue stands.  I will share that information with Deputy Paul Murphy as well today on conclusion of this question and answer session.</p> <p> On the future of the payment, what the Deputy would want, and I understand why he would want it, is for me to be in a position to say that the current jobseeker's payments that were available to people before Covid happened and future jobseeker's payments that might be available in the future should be increased to the level of the pandemic unemployment payment.  I am not in a position to give that commitment to the Deputy.  This is not about dividing and ruling.  It is not about trying to treat different parts of our country in different ways.  It is simply the challenge that I and the next Government will face of trying to ensure that what we are doing is affordable.  The Deputy makes the claim to me about austerity.  I expect we will have a deficit this year of at least &euro;23 billion.  I indicated to Deputy Michael McGrath that it will be at the higher end of the forecast we published in the stability programme update.  We are borrowing to sustain the incomes of citizens precisely at the time we should be doing so.  I would hope the Deputy would welcome that and welcome what we are doing.</p></speech>

This is even though they are technically still employees as they have not received their P45.  By law, women on maternity leave cannot be discriminated against in the workplace, yet this is what is now happening, in effect, through the wage subsidy scheme in the case of women due to return to work since the lockdown was introduced.  This anomaly would also affect people who are on illness benefit or unpaid leave, including parental leave for caring for a sick child.  In cases like this, the Revenue Commissioners have advised employers either to operate the scheme by ignoring those on maternity leave in January and February 2020 or else to pay the employee the appropriate wages without receiving the subsidy refund under the wage subsidy scheme.  In such instances, employers are footing the bill for staff wages where they have been forced to close their doors under Government instruction.</p>  <p>  I accept that the Minister is in a difficult position with regard to the anomalies within the wage subsidy scheme because he has no legal mechanism to change it without a new Government and a new Seanad.  I welcome his comments earlier that he is currently engaging with the Revenue Commissioners to see how he can address this unintended anomaly.  If it is the case that he does not have the legal mechanism to correct this law, would he extend the current maternity leave provision for up to three months to overcome this anomaly, and in light of the fact that childcare facilities are closed and parents do not have childcare options if they need to return to employment where that employment cannot be done from home?</p>  <p>  We have a bizarre situation where the semi-State company, Bord na M&oacute;na, is availing of the wage subsidy scheme for some of its employees while using the pandemic unemployment payment for other employees.  At the same time, some of the staff receiving these Government supports are waiting for the company to approve their voluntary redundancy applications.</p> <p>This action goes against the spirit and primary intention of the emergency Covid-19 legislation.  Will the Minister explain why the taxpayer is paying people who are unemployed just because the relevant company will not decide on its voluntary redundancy application?</p></speech>

The Deputy has acknowledged the work under way on the maternity leave issue that has arisen due to the implementation of the wage subsidy scheme.  I am examining if we can resolve that.  As I said to Deputy Catherine Murphy, my preference is to address this through the administration of tax law rather than having to look at other policies that need to be changed.  In my experience, once one gets into changing other areas of policy, it creates issues that may slow down the resolution of the matter, such as the one referred to by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  I cannot comment on the Bord na M&oacute;na issue raised by the Deputy because I do not have specific information on every semi-State organisation.  I will ask for a briefing on the matter.  Once I have followed up on it, I will try to give the Deputy some information or an answer to the question he raises.</p></speech>

I will give him a copy of a letter I gave to the Taoiseach on 28 April specifically on this issue.  I have been promised by the Taoiseach on a number of occasions since that I will get a response but I have not received one.  This matter is causing huge frustration and there is no justification for public moneys, which are now being borrowed, to be used to subsidise and pay wages of staff who have been waiting for months for a decision on their voluntary redundancy applications.</p>  <p>  I now turn to the national economic recovery and the huge opportunity we have to involve Ireland's 241 credit unions, with assets of more than &euro;18 billion, in assisting with cashflow and credit facilities for small and medium sized businesses, the main employers in this country, particularly outside the cities.  Fundamental to this is the need for statutory recognition by the Central Bank that credit unions are not-for-profit, community-based and volunteer-led organisations.  The Central Bank seems to have forgotten that in many parts of rural Ireland the credit union is the only open and accessible financial service in the community.  Credit unions are not the same as banks and they should not be treated the same by the regulator.  They are being discriminated against.  The Irish League of Credit Unions has sought the type of assistance and flexibility being provided to the mainstream banks by the Central Bank to help the credit unions through the Covid-19 crisis, but to date no flexibility has been shown to them.  I put it to the Minister that many of the customers who use credit unions are not wanted by the big banks.  If these families cannot get access to loans in times of financial pressure, they are forced into the hands of loan sharks.  That is in nobody&rsquo;s interest.  Will the Minister direct the Central Bank to deal equitably with the credit unions?  Will he commit to amending the primary legislation in this area to clearly reflect the unique community nature of our credit union movement?</p></speech>

I found these very helpful and I plan to have another meeting in the coming week or two.  I heard from them some of the concerns raised by Deputy Naughten.  The Deputy will appreciate that some of the issues they refer to are regulatory matters on which I am not the decision maker.  They are decisions that are made by the Central Bank of Ireland.  I have passed on to the Central Bank some of the issues that were raised.</p> <p>There has been further communication from the Central Bank with the credit union movement since the last meeting I had.  I will meet the credit union movement again, have a discussion about where it stands, and see where these different issues are.  I cannot intervene in many of the issues the movement has raised but I appreciate the really valuable role our credit unions are playing.  As Deputy Naughten has rightly said, they support many citizens at the moment who otherwise would not be supported by our banks.  I value the work they are doing and I will try to recognise that in the period ahead in my engagement with them.  If there are things they ask for that I can do, I will look at those requests carefully.</p></speech>

The reason I bring that to the floor of the House is that I believe there is a fundamental problem with the culture within the Central Bank of Ireland.  When it comes to any type of draconian measure, clearly the credit union movement is considered the same as big financial institutions in this country.  However, when it comes to giving a break to the financial institutions in this country, credit unions are treated very differently, as we are now seeing in practise in terms of Covid-19.  There is blatant discrimination on both sides in respect of the credit union movement.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank needs to make up its mind.  The credit union movement needs to be treated uniquely, and the only way that can happen is if that is clearly reflected in primary legislation so that a different, balanced approach is taken to its regulation.</p></speech>

I will have to see what he is looking for first and I am sure he will share that with me.  I believe that the legislation we have in place regarding how our credit union sector is regulated is very proportionate and fair.</p>  <p>  On the comment he made about the culture of the Central Bank, I have to firmly disagree with him.  The Central Bank of Ireland recognises the really valuable role our credit union movement plays and looks to treat it in a way that is fair and different from how it treats the established financial services in Ireland.  I know there are issues that are always being looked at between those that are regulated and the regulator.  In my experience of dealing with the Central Bank, however, it values the contribution that credit unions make to our country.</p></speech>

I, too, was contacted by a number of workers and union representatives in Shannonbridge.  A number of workers were let go some weeks ago and were given the pandemic unemployment payment, but the whole idea of the payment is for companies to keep their workers on the payroll.  There is an issue in that regard.  I have received no response even though I sent the email a number of weeks ago.  The matter needs to be looked into in addition to clarity being provided for workers who have looked for voluntary redundancy.</p>  <p>  I raised the issue of the Minister's engagement with the banking sector a number of weeks ago and emphasised that many mortgage holders in distress felt they had no option but to look for the mortgage break, only to find out they would be paying an additional &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000 because of having to avail of it.  I pointed out to the Minister that mortgage holders felt they were being punished in this regard and I asked for some further engagement with the banks to sort out the matter.  Since then, the Minister has engaged further with the Central Bank of Ireland, Banking &amp;amp; Payments Federation Ireland and the Revenue Commissioners to support customers in difficulty due to Covid-19.  Will the Minister provide an update on the engagement?  I understand that the engagement included discussions on how extensive supports for SME customers will be rolled out, which I welcome.</p> <p>However, as I am sure the Minister is aware, while many SMEs are availing of the credit guarantee scheme, there is a problem in that microenterprises and SMEs involved in agriculture, horticulture and the fisheries are excluded from the scope of this scheme.  It appears that there are restrictions under state aid rules and I would like some clarity on that.  The current SME credit guarantee scheme is about encouraging additional lending to SMEs by offering a partial Government guarantee, currently 80%, to banks against losses on qualifying loans.  The same sort of guarantees may be of immense importance to the sectors I referred to previously and these sectors need these guarantees now more than ever.</p> <p> We are in an entirely different space at this point with respect to the rationale for the state aid rules.  It is no longer about competition.  It is merely about survival.  We need to do all we can to support those sectors.  I know that farming organisations such as the IFA have called for these measures to be introduced and I want to ask the Minister if he could make a comment on such financing and the state aid rules.  Also, have there been any negotiations on easing or relaxing the state aid rules?</p></speech>

I want to re-emphasise to the Deputy that it is critical that a number of things happen during this period.  First, if breaks are being entered into, as they are for over 40,000 loan owners, everybody must be clear on what that break entails, so that those who are receiving the break and those who are administering are completely clear on what their commitments will be in the coming months and years.  Second, across that period and this period, nobody should be profiteering from what is happening.  The early signs are that will not be the case because of the degree of loss our banks are already experiencing.</p>  <p>  Regarding the questions the Deputy put to me on the relaxation of state aid rules and the engagement we have had with the banking sector on how money can flow directly to SMEs, we are engaging with the banking sector on that point.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Government made a decision to say we are preparing legislation on a credit guarantee.  We are looking at how that credit guarantee has been rolled out in other countries and at how we can ensure that when we make this available in Ireland, we will have the balance right between protecting the taxpayer, which I know the Deputy will want to do, and in getting the decision right so that credit flows to the SMEs on terms that they would want.  I apologise to Deputy Michael Healy-Rae but I will be brief on this.  State aid rules have been relaxed by the European Commission and I am not aware of how their current status would affect our ability to lend to the agricultural or horticultural sectors, but if the Deputy could give me the detail of what she is referring to I will follow up on it for her.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to ask the Minister questions on the record today.  Our country faces unprecedented levels of economic difficulty and many sectors are in crisis, facing closure or a sustained period of inactivity.  I intend to leave enough time for the Minister to answer my questions but he might reply to me in writing if he does not have enough time.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister finally extend the Covid-19 payment to seasonal workers and to those over 66?  Many of those work in the hospitality sector and face the prospect of not having a job to return to.  They have fallen through the cracks.  This is not fair and it needs to be addressed once and for all.  The hospitality and tourism sector across Ireland faces its biggest challenge yet but as the Minister knows, we will be victims of our own success in County Kerry, the tourism capital of the world.  A sector that employs more than 15,000 people and generates in excess of &euro;600 million in County Kerry has been decimated.  The predicted losses are greater than &euro;500 million and there is almost 100% unemployment in the sector.</p> <p>There are simple steps the Minister can take to help, including grants.  Businesses need grants, not loans; they have enough loans.  While the restart grant is very welcome, it does not go far enough.  Pubs and hairdressers, for example, have changed the very fabric of what they have always known.  Adapting their business will cost them money before they can even open their doors, if they will ever be allowed to open them.  Further grants are needed.</p> <p> Local authority rates need to be waived for 12 months from the date of reopening.  The three-month waiver that was announced is not sensible and does not go far enough.  I am under the impression that when a business is shut, it is not liable for rates anyway.  Therefore, the waiver should apply from the reopening date.</p> <p> The hospitality VAT rate needs to be reduced to 0%.  I note with disappointment that the Taoiseach has dismissed this idea but I ask the Minister to reconsider it very seriously.  If it is not to be 0%, why not 4%?  The Minister should definitely consider that very seriously.</p> <p> For far too long, insurance companies have had their foot on the throat of businesses in this country.  No longer can that be tolerated.  I respectfully ask the Minister to intervene directly, bring in the representatives of the industry and demand that they help the very people who keep them in employment.</p> <p> The restart grant, while welcome, discriminates against sole traders, simply because they do not pay rates to the local authority.  This is not good enough.  These people need help.  They have been affected by this pandemic as much as anyone else.  The grant should apply to all affected businesses, not just some.  While the Minister is not the Minister directly in charge, the matter falls within his Department's remit.</p> <p> The OPW recently announced Skellig Michael would not be reopening for visitors in 2020.  I totally understand the health concerns of the country and I am not taking from that.  Why, however, was it not announced that Skellig Michael would remain closed until 1 July, for instance, or even 1 August, with a review every two weeks?  Nobody knows what number of cases we will have or what the situation will be.  One of the main reasons for the closure was that there are multiple touch and clutch points when travelling by boat.  The locals in south Kerry and I argue that there are just as many and probably more touch points on public transport, including rail and bus.  Another reason given for the closure was the narrow paths and people passing each other in close proximity.  Will this not also apply to public footpaths and narrow staircases in shopping centres?  Kerry County Council is putting together a programme for staycations in Kerry to try to save what it can of a very poor year for tourism in the county.  The OPW has now trampled on the hopes of many businesses in the area.  I ask for this to be reviewed; it is only common sense.</p> <p> Will the Minister consider waiving this year's local property tax obligations?  People are hard pressed enough without this horrible tax.  The family home should not be subject to tax.  People have paid enough on their homes already.  Could the Minister answer in writing those questions he cannot answer now?  I respectfully ask him to answer as many as he can now because he took some of my time at the beginning.</p></speech>

I will, however, comment on the one matter he said might be outside my responsibility, Skellig Michael.  I had the opportunity to visit it at the end of last year so I know how amazing the location is.  As somebody who just about got to the top, I can see, in fairness, why the OPW made its decision.  I know how steep it is at different points but I will pass on the Deputy's concerns to the OPW and ask it to make a statement to him regarding why the decision was made.  I travelled out to Skellig Michael with those who depend on it for their livelihood.  I am aware of the effect the decision will have on the livelihoods of the constituents the Deputy is representing.</p>  <p>  The Deputy raised many other issues but, in fairness to the Deputies who have been waiting for a while to ask me their questions, I will respond to them in writing.</p></speech>

I will use some of the five minutes and then Deputy Harkin can take the rest of the time.  My first question concerns the insurance business and insurance costs.  The Minister outlined in his responses earlier that he was meeting the banks and insurance companies and so on and outlining to them that he wanted them to deal with insurance costs.  I was wondering specifically about people who are looking to make a claim.  For example, I have one letter from an insurance company to a business in which it asks the business to make a claim in order that it can look at it and make a decision on it.  The information the insurance company asks for is: the date on which the notifiable disease on the premises occurred and when it was brought to the business's attention; the date on which restrictions by the competent authority were put in place; and the period of the restrictions.  I think the Department of Finance or the Government or somebody could respond to that business person with a letter outlining the relevant dates, which the business person could then put forward to the insurance company for it to make a decision on the matter.  It would be interesting to bring it to a head and force the insurance company into making a decision on it.  That would be very important for business people in this difficult time.  Will the Minister comment on that?</p></speech>

As I understand it, he wants me to reply with answers to those questions.  Is that right?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.124" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="14:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000027#Z00300"><p>Yes, but the Government should respond to business people with answers to those questions in order that they can then put those responses forward as part of the claim.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.125" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000027#Z00400"><p>I understand.  Some of those matters were raised with us by the Alliance for Insurance Reform, and I dealt with those issues with the alliance.  Subsequently, I wrote to the insurance sector asking for a response to particular issues that were raised with me, some of which were touched on in the communications the Deputy has just mentioned.  If he gives those communications to me, I will see if I can give clear answers to those matters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.126" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="14:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000027#Z00500"><p>My final question concerns a totally different issue, that is, aviation fuel and the fact that it is exempt from tax.  I know that now will be a difficult time for the airlines restarting, and that has to be considered, but in terms of fuel usage the airlines are very large contributors to the overall climate change issue, and that also needs to be taken into account.  Now might be an opportune time to introduce an aviation fuel tax to ensure that the airlines, when they start up, start up with a realistic cost.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.127" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1558" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000027#Z00600"><p>As the Deputy will know, decisions on the taxation of aviation fuel are made at an international and a European level; they are not a competence we have here in Ireland.  I would, however, be cautious about this.  Looking at where we are at the moment, when it is possible on public health grounds to allow aviation - business travel and then tourism travel - to happen, and we will be guided by the public health advice, that will make an immense contribution to where we are economically and a vital contribution to lots of the communities the Deputy represents.  I have seen at first hand how successful his county has been in marketing and taking advantage of the Wild Atlantic Way.  I have seen how attractive it is to international tourists.  I hope that when our public health advice allows it, if it does allow it, we will be in a position where those kinds of tourists are able to visit Ireland and sample all we have to offer.  When the public health guidance has considered those matters, I would be reluctant to add to any kind of difficulty by making a decision on our own on the taxation of aviation fuel.  However, the matter is now being discussed in the European Union in a way in which it has not been in the past because the impact of the aviation sector on climate change and in emissions is now being examined in a new way, given how urgent the issue is.</p></speech>

The Minister has said he will try to find a solution and I welcome that.  I have just two comments to make.  First, this needs to be done very quickly as many women find themselves in that position right now.  Second, the Minister indicated that he might not be in favour of extending maternity leave.</p> <p>I know it is a complicated issue but will he, in conjunction with his relevant ministerial colleague and employers, look to show some flexibility?  Many issues make it difficult, none more so than that relating to childcare.  I would appreciate that.</p> <p> I have two questions.  I will give the Minister the first one briefly.  I have been contacted by several people who, unfortunately, have had to close their businesses.  Given the requirements of social distancing, etc., they know that because their premises are so small, they cannot continue in business and are winding down.  Yet, energy and telephone companies want to charge them extortionate rates to cancel their Internet and telephone contracts early.  I know of two small business owners of whom over &euro;400 is being asked by an Internet provider simply to cancel contracts early, as well as a charge of &euro;99 per telephone.  Are there any protections to stop such extortionate penalty clauses from being imposed on people who have to close their businesses?  They were told to do so in the first instance and now they know they cannot reopen.</p></speech>

The reason I was careful not to commit to a review of maternity leave as a way of dealing with the issue the Deputy raised is because I am aware of the first point she made.  This is an urgent issue and I know it is more likely that we will find a resolution of it within the tax code as opposed to having to look at other things.  As stated, I am not saying there is one there at the moment that we have established but I am examining it now.</p>  <p>  The Deputy made a point regarding utilities and providers.  The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, has put in place an agreement with utility providers regarding how we are asking that companies and citizens be treated across the period.  During the past 24 hours, I have heard the issue Deputy Harkin referred to being raised.  She is the second person who has raised it with me.  I will talk to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, about the matter.  Among all the people who are now feeling the strain economically, those who are feeling it most are small business owners who, a little while ago, had viable business models but now find that they do not.  My message to them, and to our entire economy, is that we want to work with all of them to recreate and rebuild an economy that, only some weeks ago, had been doing so well and running successfully.  If Deputy Harkin gives me a specific example of the issue, I will follow up on it.</p></speech>

I know of people whose properties have been sold to vulture funds.  The Minister knows this story.  Right now, public auctions are being planned to sell distressed properties.  For example, one is advertised for this day week and another for early in June.  Now, we are only creeping into phase 1 of the lifting of the restrictions that are in place.  Are there any protections for these people?  Is it possible for public auctions to take place at this point, particularly in view of the phase we are in as far as Covid-19 restrictions are concerned?</p></speech>

They have played a role in over 80% of those who are involved in those restructured mortgages and who are meeting new loan terms.  For those whose loans have been sold, the protections they have now are unaffected.  That said, if we are at the point where a property is being sold, then clearly the procedures and rules in place have not yielded resolution of the issue in a way that works for the person concerned.  This leads on to the question on whether public auctions are allowed.  To be frank with the Deputy, I do not know the answer to that question, but I know people who do and I will get the answer for her.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.135" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="" time="15:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000029#FF00200"><p>First, I will address the cancellation of the scheme to deliver childcare to essential healthcare workers.  The scheme was intended to be temporary.  Other countries had maintained a level of service to the children of essential workers; in Ireland, for strong public health reasons, it was deemed that full closure of childcare services was necessary.  As a consequence, staff, to a large extent, disengaged with the day-to-day delivery of childcare services.</p>  <p>  The scheme had to operate within the strict parameters outlined by public health concerns.  Providing care in childcare centres was not an option.  Providing the service in the homes of childminders was not an option.  There was only one option and one way to provide the service within the public health guidelines.  This could only operate by having childcare professionals going to the homes of essential health workers and caring for the children in the child's home environment.  This approach was also recommended by representatives of the childcare sector as they believed it would protect the health of children, families and childcare practitioners in this early phase of the easing of the Covid-19 restrictions.  They had earlier proposed a centre-based model but as the public health concerns to limit the risk to children, staff and families became more evident, they too took a safety first approach and the outreach model became the model of choice to safeguard all concerned.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health and senior officials from other Departments considered the scheme and recommended that we proceed.  My Department was aware of a similar smaller-scale initiative developed voluntarily elsewhere in the country that suggested our scheme could work.  Under that scheme, 1,400 people were identified who were willing to provide childcare to essential workers.  Despite the similarity of the scheme to ours, the issues that arose in the State scheme did not arise for the voluntary scheme.  These issues related to insurance, public health fears, supervision, the non-provision of lunch and rest breaks and working in an unfamiliar work environment.  On this basis, my Department developed a plan and I secured &euro;4.2 million per week to deliver it.  This funding enabled childcare practitioners to be paid a recommended average of &euro;15 per hour.  Childcare managers would also receive payment for oversight of the service.  It is not true to say there was no consultation with the sector; both my Department and I invested very significantly in consultation and we are happy to provide details of that.</p>  <p>  I will now focus on the phased reopening of the childcare sector.  This is critical to the well-being of children and parents and it is also vital in restarting the economy.  As Members are aware, the Government's road map for emerging from this crisis gives 29 June as the date for the phased reopening of childcare. This is a big step and I am focused on supporting centre-based services and childminders.  I do not underestimate the challenge and I do not underestimate the anxiety for parents and childcare professionals. Parents should know their children will be in good hands and almost all staff working in early learning and care have a level 5 qualification in early childhood care, with 25% having degrees.  Good hygiene practice is a cornerstone of their work.  They are trained in this and there are policies and procedures in place.</p>  <p>  Many parents witnessed their children coughing into their elbows long before Covid-19 and they were conscious of handwashing requirements.  My Department will build on this by providing further training relating to Covid-specific needs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.136" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="" time="15:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000030#GG00100"><p>  It is worth pointing out that bringing children together in groups for care, education and play has never been free of infection risk.  Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, risks of infection, including meningitis, verotoxigenic E. coli and others, were accepted as essential to overall child welfare and development and were therefore managed, although they could not be eliminated.  In the context of Covid-19, public health experts are considering the aspects of this situation that have changed and may need to be factored into our thinking as we progress.</p>  <p>  There is a view that information from multiple sources and reviews supports a conclusion that Covid-19 infection in children appears to be no more frequent, and probably less frequent, than in adults.  I am advised that the evidence also indicates that it is generally associated with less severe diseases than in adults.  However, we will all be aware of recent reports that some children have serious illnesses and that the recent emergence of paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome is a cause of concern.  There are also indications that children infected with the virus are less likely to spread it than adults.</p>  <p>  It is significant that our public health professionals have signalled that the time is right to begin this phase of restarting our lives.  I spoke to Professor Martin Cormican on Monday.  He is the HSE lead for healthcare-associated infections and is helping us to plan the reopening.  Professor Cormican was clear that reopening childcare services could not be done with zero risk.  We need to minimise that risk while acknowledging the risk of not providing early education and childcare.  Not providing childcare is a significant risk.</p>  <p>  For the phased reopening, we will be referring to the Norwegian model, among others, and how this might apply to Ireland.  As a starting point, it is important to acknowledge that children under six years of age cannot do social distancing.  Attempts at social distancing would be traumatic for children and the adults caring for them.  Young children have had enough to cope with without having further abnormality thrust on them as we hopefully begin to emerge from the crisis.  Regular hand washing, as most children have been doing at home, will be the norm at cr&egrave;che and preschool.  There was already good practice in place before Covid, and we will strengthen that further.</p>  <p>  Our preliminary guidance is pointing towards preparations whereby childcare will operate in pods.  As far as possible, this will entail small groups of children with the same childcare practitioner in the same room with the same toys every time they are there.  We are exploring the number of children that could be cared for by a single adult childcare practitioner.  They will play together and will be encouraged to stay together in their pods and use outdoor spaces as much as possible.</p>  <p>  We need to examine the extent that adults working in a childcare centre can social distance from one another.  In order to keep children, childcare practitioners and families as safe as possible, we also need to examine ways of limiting interaction with other parents and guardians.  This will require practical arrangements to help us minimise contact.  Other countries have done this by staggered opening hours, but we will also examine other practices relating to the reception of children.  One option is to devise a way for children to be received at the cr&egrave;che while their parents remain in their cars, with practitioners collecting the children from the cars, if that is how they travel.  For parents and children who come to the preschool or cr&egrave;che on foot, we could put in place demarcated outdoor waiting areas for them.  This could allow the childcare professional to collect the child without having contact with the parent.  We will need to factor in sheltered spaces for when the weather is bad and any other mitigating factor that may arise.</p>  <p>  Our preliminary advice is that the wearing of face masks by children under six years of age is unlikely to contribute to improved infection control.  It may be the case that children would not use them consistently without a degree of reinforcement or coercion.  This would not be desirable.  The initial thinking on the wearing of face masks by adults working in childcare settings is that it may not be practical.  This matter will be considered and further explored.</p>  <p>  We will consider practical guidelines for food preparation and serving.  This will need to be done in such a way that it avoids the sharing of crockery and utensils.</p> <p>This is a work in progress and we will be publishing detailed guidance as soon as possible.  As the House will be aware, I am chairing an advisory group on reopening early learning and care and school aged childcare services.  There are six sectoral representatives of the group who have been nominated by the childcare sector.  I have also appointed SIPTU and Childminding Ireland to the group.  With public health input we are working to develop the safest and most pragmatic way to deliver this vital service.  The group has had three meetings in the past week.  I am exceptionally grateful to the advisory group for the intense level of continued engagement to make this a success.  The expertise and experience of the group is essential to help us to make this reopening as child-friendly as possible while protecting everybody.  As stated earlier, this is not zero risk.  We will minimise risk.  There will be an incident-----</p></speech>

With the permission of the Minister, I will engage in rapid fire questions and answers.</p>  <p>  There are three major issues in the childcare sector which I wish to raise, the first issue being childcare for health care workers.  I listened to the Minister's statement.  What amazes me is that her first mention of the Department's provision for emergency childcare for essential health care staff is, "document first appeared in NPHET's minutes on 16 March."  That is nine weeks ago.  The Minister today mentioned that she engaged last Monday with Professor Martin Cormican.  I am at a loss.  Less than two weeks ago the Minister, on the floor of this House, announced a fantastic scheme at a cost of &euro;4.3 million per week and she outlined all of the plans.  I am wondering why the Minister did not have the buy-in of the sector.  Why did only six providers sign-up?  Where did it all fall apart and who was advising the Minister on it?</p></speech>

I have noted that in the speech.  This particular scheme was one of two schemes we were working on devising, as there is a centre based scheme as well.  We were working with the Department of Health and the HSE in regard to that and in terms of any kind of concerns in regard to infection control.  That is the first issue which the Deputy raised.</p></speech>

When it was becoming apparent that the outreach model was not going to work did the Minister examine the possibility of extending the partial state indemnity to childcare providers for Covid-19 related claims and did she consult with other insurance companies?</p></speech>

I outlined in my opening speech the processes of various types of consultation we had in regard to developing the scheme, including with the sector on some of the issues that it was still then raising in terms of the reasons why they did not sign-up.  They did identify some of those reasons.  We did fight for the insurance, as I have described.  In anticipation of a later question I can point out that we do have the insurance cover now for the centre-based scheme in regard to Covid-19 related claims.  That is a major breakthrough, I think.</p>  <p>  On when we actually announced the scheme, my personal view is that as time continued to pass the issue in regard to the fear of going into the homes of health care workers became larger.  That is one of the things they said inhibited sign-up.</p></speech>

Under the Government's plan to reopen Ireland, more workers will return to their places of work and this will create enormous pressures on the childcare sector.

The Taoiseach has launched a road map which includes a heading for childcare and education.  Under education, there is nothing.  Under childcare, there are three phases, with phase 1 being to provide support, confidence and a nine-week wait for essential front-line workers.  Phase 3 is the reintegration of the outreach model into the in-service provision for essential front-line workers.  However, we will already have had two other phases before moving on to phase 3.  Workers want to know whether they are deemed essential.  How do we restore people's confidence when they have seen phase 1 fall off the map?</p>  <p>  Finally, when phase 4 comes along, will we be telling workers going out that they can only have care or provision on one day out of five?  Are we saying to the woman going back to work that she must tell her employer she can only show up on one day out of five?  Can the Minister explain this road map to me?</p></speech>

First, as the Deputy is aware, the road map is following the advice in terms of the reopening of childcare services and what happens during that reopening for the childcare profession.  We are following the public health advice, and the advice we got in terms of this first effort is that we had to go into the homes.  As I have already described, we worked with the Department of Health, the HSE and the sector.  We looked at an example and developed the best scheme we could in the context of one option, namely, going into the homes of healthcare workers.  It was not a question of <i>carte blanche</i>.  That is what we had to do.  Those restrictions were given to us.</p></speech>

What is the Department of Children and Youth Affairs doing to address that?  I go back to the point that if we are telling workers that they can only use the service on one out of five days, how is the Department addressing that capacity issue and what measures is it putting in place?  Are the city and county childcare committees currently heat-mapping right across the country to understand, first, who the essential workers are and, second, how many of the services are going to sign up to the plan?  The rumour on the ground is that, on 29 June, the Minister may not have the buy-in of all service providers.</p></speech>

I am working with the group and I expect that the scheme we are developing will effectively assist people and ensure we have many more providers signing up.  Second, on the question of capacity, we have almost completed a survey that we will be sending out to providers and another survey to parents to assess the capacity and the potential for capacity.  We will get that information in time for the coming phases and it will give us some sense of the demand.  The Deputy may be aware, because I know she has been doing the research, that in other countries, when childcare services have reopened, the demand has been lower than anticipated because of the fear of parents for their children.</p></speech>

Those are the people who are there.</p>  <p>  I made the decision that we needed childminders because they are going to be a key part of the solution, especially as we move forward, and also the unions.  I am going to establish a reference group and we are going to invite several other people who represent certain parts of this sector.  Apart from the federation, there are other groupings and people with representatives.  We are going to look at that and I am going to set up that reference group next week.</p></speech>

They are already struggling to balance changing shifts, using up holidays, reducing their hours and many different ways to try and cope with this situation.  It is not exclusively an issue for front-line workers.  As more people return to places of work, this is a greater concern for more families.</p>  <p>  T&aacute; br&uacute; ollmh&oacute;r ar dhaoine maidir leis an tsl&iacute; ina bhfuil c&uacute;ram leana&iacute; &aacute; l&aacute;imhse&aacute;il, n&oacute; nach bhfuil s&eacute; &aacute; l&aacute;imhse&aacute;il.

The Minister also referred to pods.</p> <p>Will the pods be family-based or will other individuals be brought together in such a situation?  Is that plan realistic, given that it was originally set out that childcare would reopen to the wider public within six weeks?  The plan was that childcare would be made available for front-line workers in phases 1 and 2.  Will the Government be able to achieve its goals or is the Minister considering reviewing the proposals and putting a new timetable in place?  I ask the Minister to set out the road map in that regard.</p></speech>

I identified how that is proceeding.  We have already met three times.  Some of the Deputy's questions are related to those asked by Deputy Rabbitte, such as on the issue of how one prioritises, especially in the case of a phased reopening in line with the public health advice.  It must be phased; we cannot bring all children back in at once.  Along with the advisory group, I am looking at and working through issues such as that of essential workers, as well as the already vulnerable children who attending a private provider or other centre.</p></speech>

I will share time with Deputies O'Rourke and Gould.</p>  <p>  I do not wish to be repetitive.  In her opening statement, the Minister addressed some of the issues I intended to raise, including guidelines, reopening and pods.  The issue of consultation has been raised several times in the House.  It is essential that childcare and early years settings are given adequate time to put the required measures in place.  Unfortunately, it is often the case in the early years sector that a measure is announced and there is panic about getting it done in time.  That was the case with the wage subsidy, where there was a delay of a few weeks after it was announced, and the cancellation of childcare for front-line workers.  Places should not be told they can reopen on 29 June without being given the guidelines, time or training to put in place whatever needs to be done to open.  The sector needs time to deal with whatever guidelines and measures need to be put in place.</p>  <p>  I refer to sustainability.  At the risk of sounding like a broken record, there is no point in discussing the early years sector or childcare if sustainability is not at the heart of that discussion.  Without sustainability, there will be no services to open.  Unfortunately, places are closing because they cannot afford to stay open.  That will have a major impact on people returning to work, particularly women, because, as all Members know, childcare generally falls to them.  It will also have a major impact on children.  We should not forget that children are at the core of this issue.  They have endured many u-turns in their lives in recent weeks.  The vast majority of them are an excellent example of how one can deal and cope with change.</p>  <p>  That leads me on to my next question.  The Minister earlier touched on the issue of children with additional needs and those in the vulnerable or at-risk categories.  As Members are aware, all children benefit from early years education.  Some people think the children benefit as a result of the work that they do there but, rather it is a combination of their work, social interaction and everything else they learn in the facility.  Children with additional needs who are going through a difficult time trying to cope with the current situation, as are their parents and wider families, should be given priority.  Will that be done?  Similarly, children who have been referred to Tusla or are in a vulnerable category should be prioritised for a return to childcare.  It is often their safe place and where they get their food and stability.  It is important that we prioritise such children for return rather than focussing on the children of parents who are returning to work.  Obviously, it is important that people be able to return to work but we must remember that children are at the heart of this issue.</p>  <p>  The Minister touched on the issue of insurance.  There seems to be a question mark over whether facilities will be covered.  Has there been any update in that regard?  We do not want a situation whereby providers think they will open on a particular date but the issue insurance suddenly arises as a problem and no providers reopen.  Services should not be at a financial loss.  If they can only take ten children instead of the 20 they previously catered for, they should be allocated funding for 20 children such that the business is sustainable.</p>  <p>  I refer to Tusla, foster care, birth parents and access.</p> <p>In the vast majority of situations, access has been suspended and the use of WhatsApp and Skype video calls and other forms of access have been encouraged.  Is there any time frame for resuming access?  Are there guidelines available for both foster and birth parents?  This has been extremely difficult for children and for many birth parents who have not had the opportunity to physically see their children over the last number of weeks.  Is there a time frame and plan for that?  </p> <p> My last point relates to maternity leave.  There was some discussion earlier with the Minister for Finance about whether it would be possible to include women returning to work after maternity leave in the wage subsidy scheme.  Is there any update on that, particularly with regard to childcare workers and early years workers?  Is the Department of Children and Youth Affairs doing anything on that?  Again we have a situation where it is women who are being left out.</p></speech>

While this public health advice has a significant impact on us all, it has a very profound impact on children at risk.  I refer to children who live in homes that are not safe havens or sanctuaries; unfortunately for some children, home is the exact opposite.</p>  <p>  People working in this area say that we have a perfect storm.  We have children forced back into abusive homes but without the usual, normal protections provided by the mandated people who help to keep them safe and out of harm's way, like teachers, for example, who would otherwise spot something untoward.  They also say that offenders are more active online now and are acting with more freedom.  On the one hand, opportunities to abuse are greatly increased while, on the other hand, opportunities to intervene and help are reduced.  I am sure we are all concerned about this matter and I ask the Minister to provide an update to the House on it.  What has been the impact of Covid-19 restrictions on children at risk and on our ability to identify, protect and support them?  One indicator might be referrals to Tusla, for example.  Have these increased during this period, as one might expect in the circumstances, due to increases in cases of abuse or have they decreased, as one might fear, due to reduced reporting?  I ask the Minister to provide an assessment and to outline her plans to respond and intervene. </p></speech>

The closure of schools, colleges, sporting clubs, arts organisations, including dance and music groups, and so on has left a huge void in the lives of young people.  Not being able to socialise with their friends, classmates and teammates as well as with their extended families, particularly their grandparents, has had a highly negative effect on them.</p>  <p>  Young people have not been given the support they need to get through this crisis.  We know the crisis is going to continue and will not go away in the short term.  Has the Government put a strategy or plan together, along with funding, for a vision of how we will engage with young people?  I have been involved with young people through coaching and training teams at my local GAA club, St. Vincent's, for over 35 years, as well as through my work with youth clubs and community groups.  Our pitches are locked and our complexes are closed.  All of our facilities are closed to young people.  We would love to get young people back in but because of social distancing and the rules around that, we cannot do so.  What we are seeing now, however, is more and more young people hanging around on street corners and other areas.  My worry, both as a parent and as a person who works with young people, is that some of them will get involved with alcohol, drugs and anti-social behaviour.  Many children are going to have serious issues with their mental health and there is a big job of work to be done by the Department in that context.  I ask the Minister to give us some insight into what the Government is planning to do in that regard.  </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, young people with disabilities or additional needs are the forgotten victims of this crisis.  The nature of the virus necessitates social distancing, which has led to the withdrawal of supports and the closure of schools.</p>  <p>I speak to parents who are under tremendous pressure in trying to mind their children and maintain social distancing while getting them through every day.  Many of these children do not understand what we are going through.  Will the Minister update me on the Government's plan to give these families support, which they need now?</p> <p> I note the provision of such education comes under the headings of both education and disabilities, which come under different Departments.  My problem is that parents are contacting me because their children cannot get into pre-school, primary school or secondary school if they have disabilities or additional needs.  The question they are asking me is why the Government is not ensuring that every child is equal.  We see in the Proclamation that every child should be equal.  However, in this country, if a parent has a child with a disability or with additional needs, they are not equal in the current circumstances.</p> <p> I am a new Deputy and the Minister is the old regime.  Nonetheless, I respect her and the work she has done in her role and I hope that, before she departs, she could do some work on this issue because these families need support at this time.  My fear is that the Covid-19 crisis and the provisions we have put in will hurt the families of children with disabilities, special needs and additional needs.</p></speech>

I will start with the last question.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is working with the Department of Education and Skills to develop transition supports for children with disabilities who will be moving from pre-school to school this September, so that is certainly one of the things we are doing.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also asked what kinds of supports are in place for youth in these pandemic times.  My Department is continuing to work closely with the different youth organisations and, in different instances, it has provided some additional financial support.  In the youth sector, many organisations have stepped up to the plate and themselves identified the ways in which they can re-purpose their own resources in order to provide support to youths who are particularly in need, for whatever reason, and the Deputy mentioned mental health issues.  Many organisations have taken their own initiatives in regard to the supports the Government continues to provide for them during this period.</p>  <p>  I want to come back to the questions asked by Deputy Kathleen Funchion, who referred to the different schemes and the need for a realistic timeframe for the third scheme, which we have been asked to develop in a relatively short period of time.  As the Deputy is aware, I consider the first scheme very successful and 84% of the providers have already signed up.  It provides that sustainability and the financial and other resources which the Deputy, myself and others are so clearly concerned about in order to ensure that our childcare sector is there as we move forward.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct that the timeframes are very tight.  It is very ambitious.  Everybody will be aware, as the Deputy is, that the Department and those involved in childcare and the early years sector are being asked to come back a couple of months before the schools and the schools are also planning for that.  It is very ambitious and we know we need guidelines and training for the practitioners and professionals before they re-open.  These are things we are discussing and trying to come to agreement on with the group I have established, in particular the timing as well as the content of these issues.</p>  <p>  I will be delivering a report to Cabinet at the end of this month which will, hopefully, outline all of the ways in which we have consolidated critical aspects of the planning for this scheme.  My hope is that we will be ready to open when there is NPHET guidance to the Department to prepare for that.</p></speech>

We are the ones being asked to open first.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Deputy's question on sustainability, the calculation is that by 28 June a total of &euro;42 million will have been spent on the temporary wage subsidy scheme.  This is a significant amount of money going into the sector.  I am very clear, as are representatives of the sector I am working with, that, as we move to a new normal, issues of sustainability will be addressed.  We will ask for wider consultation or submissions in this regard.</p>  <p>  I want to clarify the insurance issue.  With regard to this coming scheme, we have been in contact with the insurance sector on what cover can be provided for the phased reopening.  Allianz, which provides insurance for 95% of centre-based providers, has confirmed it will provide insurance for services that reopen in accordance with the road map and that it will not apply a Covid-19 exclusion.  It has confirmed this.</p></speech>

The cancellation of the healthcare worker scheme has been a source of great anxiety for many parents who have been in touch with me, not only those who are healthcare workers but those who work in other essential roles and those working in other positions.  The cancellation was, perhaps, quite predictable.  When we last met in the Chamber many Deputies raised concerns about the issue of insurance and a lack of indemnity from the State.  The issues that led to its cancellation were predicted by many of the Deputies here.  It is disappointing but perhaps not surprising.</p>  <p>  The Minister spoke about the fear among essential healthcare workers of working in the home and the potential for transmission, and the rising fear among staff and providers.  Many of the parents struggling to work from home to whom I have spoken are not healthcare workers.  They would have liked an outreach scheme such as this.  They are struggling to manage working from home while providing care and education for their children.  It is a source of huge anxiety and huge stress.  Many Deputies have spoken about it.  The reality is that for many people working from home there is no acknowledgement by their employers of the additional burden of having to work two jobs at once, the added stress this causes and the added stress of delays in work.  This outreach scheme could have been very helpful for a huge variety of people and a wider drawing of it could have helped with that anxiety, and helped with the uptake with regard to what the Minister has spoken about.  Obviously the stress on working families is significantly worse in single-parent families who cannot share a day or arrangements with a partner.</p>  <p>  Generally, many of the parents who have been in contact with me feel there has been very little support for them and for families in general.  Deputy Funchion mentioned this, as did speakers in the discussion with the Minister for Finance with regard to women returning from maternity leave.  This is one example of how parents and families feel they are not being properly supported.  At the end of April, RT&Eacute; reported that An Taoiseach said special paid leave would be provided for the partners of public sector workers to provide childcare at home but a HSE circular earlier this month stated no special leave is available for Covid-19 caring arrangements.  Workers were promised one thing but are not getting any of the supports they need and feel they are being let down.  Many families speak to me about feeling isolated and being without support, feeling under stress and feeling no acknowledgement from either the Government or their employers with regard to this additional stress they are under.</p>  <p>  These are anxious times and the last thing we want to be doing is adding more anxiety to parents in general.  Exiting the lockdown is another source of anxiety for parents in terms of infection and whether the creche will still be open to provide for the education and care of their children.</p> <p>We have a history in this country of some of the lowest levels of investment in the early years sector in the European context.  That is quite telling in that many European countries were able to respond very quickly and provide outreach services and better supports for essential healthcare workers.  There is a wider conversation that we all need to be having about the future direction of the early years sector and how we support it.  However, there is also an anxiety among parents about what happens right now.  Many of them feel that they are at breaking point and need those wider supports.  One of the things we need to do is try to find some creative approaches.  The last time we met, other Deputies addressed the issue of State indemnity for the outreach scheme, which would have helped address some of the concerns.  Looking at a wider pool of parents and families could also have addressed some of the current concerns of providers.  On the Minister's ideas of the pods in centre-based schemes when those providers open up, has her Department had any links with the Department of Education and Skills?  The schools are sitting empty.  If there is a limit to the number of children and staff who can be in a physical space, providing an extra space on a temporary basis, when many such spaces are already accessible to the State in the form of primary schools that are sitting empty and not being used, that kind of thing could support the phased roll-out and could allow for greater provision at that stage.  Certainly a primary school would have more room for social distancing than a typical creche.  The other question that was raised with me was whether there is a plan B.  If the services are not there when we go to exit lockdown, what is going to happen?  That uncertainty is feeding a lot of people.  One person quipped that they felt there was no plan A after the cancellation of the service.  Is there a plan B if we get to phases 3, 4 and 5 and the service providers are not there?</p> <p> I also want to ask about child protection and Tusla.  There has been a fall in referrals and, as lockdown ends, many of those protective people are going to start coming back into the children's lives.  At that point, we will see a surge in referrals to Tusla.  Is Tusla ready for that?  Do we need to put extra staff in?  Are they thinking about moving staff, even temporarily, to duty teams?  Is that part of our thinking on moving out of the lockdown?  It is entirely predictable that there will be a surge in referrals.  Some students were in contact with me, as I am sure they were with other Deputies, on having their social work placements cancelled and the difficulties they were having with the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, CORU, in terms of registration and adequate hours.  Tusla has been creative and has responded very well to the small number of students.  It has reached out to them and found a way that will work for everyone to enable these students to finish their placement while also working supporting Tusla.  This is great and Tusla should get a pat on the back for it.  However, it does not work for students who do not want to work for Tusla, which is quite a lot of them.  Can we do something else for this group of students who are having difficulties with registration because of Covid-19?  Has Tusla had any contact with the unions on pay and conditions of the students on its scheme?</p> <p> To pick up on something the Minister said in her speech, she said there is a view from multiple sources and reviews that support a conclusion that Covid-19 infection in children appears to be no more frequent and perhaps less frequent.  I am struck by this in the context of Deputy Whitmore's very valid point the last time we met, when she spoke about the language we use around children, the language of vectors and super-spreaders.  It seems that language and those contentions have not held up.  It really underlines the point Deputy Whitmore made that we need to be very careful in the language we use around children.</p></speech>

One of the Deputy's primary questions relates to whether the Government recognises the stress that parents are under because of the double or triple-jobbing.  This Minister does and my colleagues do too.  We are particularly aware of it because the schools remain closed.  School is where many children spend the majority of their time, and the others spend time in childcare centres.  In general, most children spend more time in schools than in childcare centres.  We are aware of the pressure that exists.  We are all aware that one of the reasons for this measure is that it is the public health advice and is what we have all agreed to follow.  We are now in the process of reopening society, which includes, effectively, our early years education and care and our school-age childcare and education, although we happen to be first.  We understand.</p>  <p>  On the question of what resources are available while we wait for this, my Department has done work in respect of supporting parents and in other areas.  We have launched a website by means of which we offer free online resources to parents.  More than 2,850 users have visited the site since its launch.  There is an ongoing social media campaign that contains practical advice and support for parents.  There is a whole-of-Government approach, Let's Play Ireland, that promotes the importance of play.  There are lots of supports, including a web page and other online resources for parents.  Certain aspects of some of our web pages offer support for parents who are working at home with very young children who have not been able to go to preschool. I assure Deputy Costello that generally we are aware of the issue, most people are parents themselves, and those are the kinds of supports that have been put in.</p>  <p> The pods plan, which was also raised by Deputy Aindrias Moynihan, was based on advice given to us by the public health expert.  It is not something that I am saying, it is the public health expert saying that.</p></speech>

I have been meeting parents in Limerick.  Ironically, while access to childcare is certainly having a huge impact on front-line workers, for many of parents who are not able to work because of Covid-19, their children are at home and so their demand for childcare is not as it would normally be.  It will be shortly.  There is a road map for reopening different sectors.  As that happens, parents will require childcare services.  What level of due diligence and comprehensive planning is the Minister doing to dovetail the reopening of facilities in line with the road map and the reopening of businesses, taking into account social distancing, which is the key element in the context of how we now operate?  We must prepare for this as a matter of urgency.  The Minister stated that she had three meetings in the past week.  We are aware from parents of the pressures they are under.  As we try to reopen the economy, we want people to be able to get back to work and they must have adequate childcare services available to them.  Perhaps the Minister will provide an idea of the time frame in this regard, the type of due diligence she is carrying out to ensure that it is robust and her interaction with the various stakeholders.  This is a matter of serious concern for parents in Limerick and north Tipperary.  I want the measures to be pre-emptive rather than reactive.  Will the Minister please give me an idea of the position in that regard immediately?</p> <p>The Minister might respond to that within my time.</p></speech>

That is the reality in light of the public health restrictions we are operating under.  I am sorry about that, as I am sure we all are, but my hope is that a reopening will begin then and we are planning intensively for that.  There will be fewer children and, as I said before, the schools will not be open.  We are still finalising the issues with staff-to-child ratios, the space that is required in premises and whether they need to change it or whether they need more than they had before, etc.  Those are the things we are looking at.  They are the key things for which we need to have the public health advice finalised so that we can then start making decisions in that regard and plan further.  Those are some of the priorities and that is what is happening.</p>  <p>  It is a phased approach, given that we are within the public health restrictions.  We start with a little bit, and we move on and get more and more.  It will not be until July that we say it will be open for everyone but the capacity will nonetheless be lower than it was before.  The demand may also be less, which we are aware of.</p></speech>

We should be looking to see what is the additional space that service providers need and whether we will need to put in place supports to enable them to rent additional space.  I am hearing that from providers and across sectors, and reality has to be faced.  With due respect to the Minister, saying we will see what happens in July and that we will let it be a kind of pilot is, unfortunately, not good enough.  We need to be pre-emptive.</p></speech>

I understand we need to be pre-emptive and that we need to plan for it.  It is absolutely something we are considering if additional spaces are required.  More support will be required.

She has been a vision for equality and social change and has fought hard to reduce poverty.  It has been very difficult for Ministers who lost their seats to carry on so I thank her very much.</p>  <p>  I agree with other Deputies who spoke about mental health and young people.  It is a deeply concerning area, and while I acknowledge that the Minister has addressed it, I want to share in the thoughts of many of my colleagues in the House.</p>  <p>  Many of my constituents have talked about the SIPTU childcare model.  It is a big start to be introduced by the next Government.  I refer to a public model for childcare and high quality, affordable early years and school-age services.  Will the Minister share her thoughts on the proposal?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.224" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="" time="16:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000040#RR01900"><p>I thank the Deputy for his kind comments.  I am very familiar with the campaign and am happy to share my thoughts on it.  I am on record as saying that, from a personal perspective, I would be in favour of a public model.  I am aware, from working with my Department over the years, that the model - if this is what the Deputy means - would cost approximately &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion more than what we are currently investing in the education sector.</p> <p>I am aware of that and, therefore, as Minister I established an independent expert group to examine, on the basis of an increase in public resources, what would be the best public funding model to develop to provide for our children in a way that is genuinely more affordable, while maintaining high quality.  This would also make the sector better for the professionals and practitioners who work in it.  It so happens that this group has been meeting in recent days.  It started its work a number of months ago.  Many of its members are from abroad but as of yesterday they were still in town.  The group is continuing to plan.  If there is a Government that wants to do that the next time around, we have begun the plans already.  Norway and the Nordic countries have public moneys and there is some public provision, which means public servants are involved.  There is also some private provision.  That is called a mixed model and in my view we should aim for that model.  We also have to consider that we have 4,500 private providers in the country, between not-for-profit providers and for-profit providers.  We will need to move away from private providers if we want a full public model.  That is one of the challenges.  There are also challenges around increased investment.  That is why we needed some good guidance and to see how it is done in other places.</p> <p> Deputy Funchion asked about moving to the next reopening phase.  Hopefully we can just have one scheme for that reopening, even if it is over different phases.  There will be an acknowledgement of the need for significantly increased investment, even in that period of time as we move to a new normal.  I am not promising that there will be &euro;2 billion available.  I do not believe there will be but I have nothing to do with what happens next.  I know that conversations are taking place around this and perhaps Deputy Rabbitte could tell us more about them.  Perhaps there will be an acknowledgement from the new Government that significantly increased investment is required, not just to provide the same level of care to fewer children as we phase through the reopening, but to learn from some of the things we did in the temporary wage subsidy scheme.</p></speech>

We have the first research findings from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, on the adverse effect it is having on working women in particular.  The CSO press statement on the employment and life effects of COVID-19 survey published on 13 May states:</p> <blockquote> 	It found that more women ... than men ... are caring for a dependent family member or friend because of the COVID-19 crisis.  It also found that women are more likely to report childcare issues related to the COVID-19 crisis ... and women are finding it more difficult to work from home because of family being around. </blockquote>  <p>We now have an evidence base to show this pandemic is having an adverse effect on working women in particular.  I said this the last time I stood in the Chamber to speak to the Minister and I am saying it again today.  In the intervening period, a milestone was missed.  We had much expectation about this milestone being reached but it was missed.  It is pertinent for us to ask why it has been missed.  If there is a certain amount of scepticism about the next milestone being reached, that would be understandable by any objective analysis.</p><p>I seek a cast iron guarantee from the Government and the Minister that the next phase of this scheme will proceed on 29 June.  If the Minister can give us that guarantee, will she also indicate, given that phase 1 for essential workers was missed, whether there are plans to put in place a revised scheme for the period until 29 June?  Is work ongoing to devise a scheme for those who were missed in phase 1?</p> <p>That is the first question.  I will take the answer now, if I may, please.</p></speech>

The Deputy referred to the evidence base for working women.  I thank him for raising the research in the Chamber.  It is really important to put it on the record and to remind ourselves about it.  The Deputy will respect that I am aware of it.  I have done a lot of work over many years to ensure and call for supports for women who may have taken on more of the responsibilities for caring, not just for children but also for parents and so on, while working and wanting to move on in the world of work.  I acknowledge that.  In light of the pandemic, stress has increased, especially for women.</p></speech>

Will the Minister intervene directly to ensure that the federation, which I understand represents 1,400 providers, will be included in the advisory group?</p></speech>

The Deputy could respect the principle that it chooses the representation.  That is the first point.  The second is that I will be including the organisation in the reference group in order to have additional consultation with it and others.</p></speech>

There is no reference in her speech to floor space.  This will be crucial to the operation of any model because it will have an impact on the number of children who can be catered for at any given time.  Regarding full-time provision for children between zero and six years, I understand the floor space is anywhere from 3.5 sq. m per child to 2.3 sq m. per child.  Under the Danish model, on which I have information, the area is anywhere from 4 sq. m to 6 sq. m.  The regulations associated with the Norwegian model state: "The indicative norm for indoor play area is 4m&sup2; per child over 3 years old and approximately 0.33m&sup2; for a child under three."  I want to tease out with the Minister the issue that has been raised by other speakers in respect of the capacity of providers to provide highly regulated early years childcare in the new paradigm we are facing in a way that ensures every child gets a chance and that none is left behind, and that there is no lottery system for children and their parents in regard to provision.  If necessary, will an increase in capacity be sought beyond the providers, or will the providers be allowed to rent or be subsidised for seeking extra space?  What is the internal advice to the Minister from her officials on the permutations for the provision of space and the regulations at present?</p></speech>

That is influenced by public health advice.  It is something I discussed with Professor Cormican.  He is going to continue to advise us on that.  I am going to bring him in to the group.  Ultimately, we are going to decide the appropriate amount, with reference to Norway and other locations.  That is the way that is going to be done.  Once that is decided, we will have a better sense of what is required in terms of ongoing capacity with a view to providing for the number of children who required capacity before the pandemic, at the very least, and to growing that capacity.</p></speech>

I seek a clarification from the Minister on the statement I understand she made to the effect that Allianz is providing 95% of the insurance cover in this area at present and that Covid-19, or the risk of it, does not arise.  I may have misinterpreted what she said.  I just want further clarity as to who exactly she or her officials are talking.  Is it an umbrella body or is she talking to specific insurance providers.  If it is the latter, to which providers is she talking?</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware, Allianz provides the insurance to childcare providers so we do not have that kind of interference.  At the same time, I am aware of the fact that there is no Covid-19 exclusion, but this is subject to the following of the public health guidance and advice coming out regarding centre-based childcare.</p></speech>

I wish to ask about the transition task force, an issue I raised with the Minister two weeks ago.  I put forward the proposal that the Department bring together all the key Departments and the NGOs to look at how we can transition our children and young adults back into both their school communities and the general community.  A cross-departmental approach has to be taken on this, and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will be the key Department to bring those bodies and Departments together to do it.  The Minister said at the time that she was open to that suggestion.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, informed Deputy Shortall that he was also open to considering it.  Has there been any progress in this regard?  Will the Minister provide an update on the matter?</p></speech>

I will have to get some information as to whether they have been able to do it.  I think their primary focus right now, though, is on the reopening on 29 June.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.250" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1627" speakername="Jennifer Whitmore" time="16:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000043#UU00900"><p>I am pleased to hear that the Minister has put the request in.  It is a matter of urgency because time is going very quickly and a lot of planning would need to happen before we can make sure we have the supports for those children in place when they need them.</p><p>On the issue of insurance, I echo the concerns and frustration of other Deputies and of parents and front-line workers who will not have access now to the outreach childcare scheme that had been mooted two weeks ago.  It would appear that insurance is, or at the time was, one of the main issues raised as a barrier to that scheme functioning.  The Minister says she has spoken to Allianz and that it has committed that it will provide cover to <i>in situ</i>childcare providers as long as the public health guidance is adhered to.  Why was there an issue with the outreach scheme?  That too was in adherence with the public health advice.  If Allianz considers that there was an issue in adhering to that and a risk associated with people adhering to that advice when it was happening in people's homes, why now has there been a shift such that Allianz will now consider the public health advice as the key determinant in whether or not there is a risk associated with providing childcare?</p> <p>One aspect of this has been disappointing because there was considerable expectation about the outreach childcare provision.  I wonder whether the fact that the State did not take the option to indemnify was really the nail in the coffin for that programme.  I know the Minister raised the matter with the Department.  What were the main challenges raised by officials when the Minister spoke to them about it?</p> <p> The other main barrier to the outreach scheme seems to be possible virus transmission.  Obviously, the health and safety of children and childcare workers needs to be paramount in the establishment of any of these schemes.  The Minister referred today to a pod approach.  Is that based on advice put forward by the National Public Health Emergency Team?  Will the Minister publish the advice?  It is important to have some transparency and clarity for childcare providers and parents in the context of what that advice will mean for them.</p> <p> Yesterday in the D&aacute;il concern was expressed about the amount of time people were spending in the Chamber.  The expectation is now that we can only spend two hours in this huge space when we are all socially distanced from one another.  How are we going to move to a position where children will be in the company of one adult childminder, even in a pod situation?  How can they be in that space for longer than two hours at a time?  Has that issue been considered?</p> <p> What are the testing arrangements?  Has consideration been given to the testing arrangements that need to be in place for the sector?  I specifically have in mind arrangements to support the new childcare measures that the Minister has spoken of.  That would give additional confidence to workers and parents.</p> <p> The physical health of children and childcare workers must be one of the fundamental blocks in setting up any new childcare scheme.  However, one thing becoming apparent as we move though this crisis is how, for children in particular, emotional health and well-being needs are as important as physical health considerations.  Many of us have seen images online of children in playgrounds standing in little square boxes marked out on the ground.  They are kept at a distance from all their friends.  As a parent, I find those images rather upsetting.  There has also been discussion in the media recently about how, in any childcare service that we implement, children may not be allowed to bring comfort toys such as blankets and dodies to the cr&egrave;che or preschool.  These things are important to children and give them a sense of attachment to home.  The Minister mentioned that children would be able to use the same toys on a daily basis when they are in childcare settings.  Does that imply they will be unable to bring their dodie, blanket or favourite teddy bear into the cr&egrave;che with them?</p> <p> We need to focus not only on the physical health measures but also the potential for these to impact adversely on the developmental health of children in future.  I have serious concerns about this.  We need to ensure that we take emotional well-being and the developmental needs of children into consideration.  The question is how we get the balance right between achieving physical safety and emotional safety.  The key to getting the balance right is ensuring that we have the correct expertise feeding in to the advisory body.  Currently, however, there is no expert on child development or child psychology on NPHET or its subgroups.  What measures has the Minister taken to ensure that the emotional well-being of children has been taken into account in the NPHET decision-making processes?  Is there an opportunity to include a child psychologist on the team?  The list of people at the moment includes immunologists and general practitioners.  It is all very much at the medical end of things.  We need someone in place who will speak up for the mental health of children as we move forward.</p> <p> There have been renewed reports in the media of shops that are banning children from entering, despite all the advice.  This sends out such a negative connotation to children and makes it really difficult for one-parent families to do simple things like shopping.  Will the Minister make a statement and give clear guidance to retailers on that?</p> <p>It is unfortunate that we have got to a place where those bans have been put in place and we need retailers to revise them.<br/><br/>Will the Minister make public the Crowe Horwath report on the cost of providing childcare, which was meant to be released late last year?  It would be good to have that released as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I will answer a couple in the time now but we can feed back some more to her.  The Deputy raised questions of what happens with children in centre-based settings when those facilities reopen, both from a public health perspective and a child centre perspective.  There were questions around toys, pods etc.  Let me be clear about this.  I am receiving direct advice from Professor Cormican, who has been offered to us by the Department of Health because of his expertise in infection control and other issues.  It is not the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, <i>per se</i>.  We had terrific initial conversations with him and that will ultimately lead to written advice that our advisory group will consider.  Ultimately, as well as looking at the way other international settings have acted, we will have published guidelines for everyone for the reopening.  We are aware that needs to be done in a timely fashion.</p><p>The Deputy's last point concerned balancing children's mental well-being with physical safety and Professor Cormican has that in his considerations.  I expect that once we get something in draft form, I will bring it to some of the other experts with whom we have been in consultation for them to have a look at it.</p></speech>

The failure of the State the Government to provide basic childcare for our front-line workers, particularly nurses and doctors in the middle of this pandemic, is breathtaking.  After eight weeks of spin and public relations management - two months in which the problem was recognised - there has been an abject failure to deliver any kind of childcare for those on the front line.  This is because we have a hopelessly fragmented and complex system of preschool childcare and a hopelessly inadequate and equally fragmented system of after-school childcare.  We have multiple schemes with the burden of cost shouldered mostly by parents in a sector with many large and small private providers employing dedicated but low-paid staff, often on precarious contracts.</p>  <p>  There is little or any attempt to have oversight or attempt to ensure universality in terms of working conditions and standards across the sector.  It is a fragmented system of childcare in which the State has absolved itself of responsibility and has overseen a largely privatised system growing in response to the needs of working people.  As with many issues, this failure stems from a wider failure of this State to provide for universal care.  We have seen it in nursing homes, our hospital system and direct provision, where we contract and subcontract the care and needs of key public services.  We can thank consecutive Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments for this move towards neoliberal privatisation.</p>  <p>  I suggest this failure is not about public liability insurance, although it may form an element of it.  It is not just about the lack of uptake from childcare workers, although how it was not possible for the State to provide rewarding terms for those workers is beyond me.  It is a wider and systemic failure, and this pandemic is revealing much about how normal privatised and neoliberal models that let us down in normal times have become massive roadblocks in the middle of a crisis like this pandemic.  We have ended up firefighting the symptoms and, so far, we are failing in the childcare area.</p> <p>The only real question I want the Minister to address relates to the demand from nurses' unions and others for the &euro;4.2 million per week of the defunct scheme that she mentioned to be transferred to front-line workers to compensate them for the money they have paid, and will continue paying, for childcare because the State has failed to provide it.  I support that demand.  Will the Minister?  If there is &euro;4.2 million to provide for the care of front-line workers' children, why can it not be transferred into the pockets of workers and doctors, many of whom we know from their evidence are paying hundreds of euro per week to have their kids minded while they go to work for our sakes?</p></speech>

It is estimated that there are approximately 35,000 non-cr&egrave;che childminders, many of whom work out of their own homes or the homes of the children they are minding.  They are not well paid, but unless they had another job in the formal economy, they have not been able to access the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP.  They are low-paid workers, and that income has now been taken away from them.  Does the Minister agree that we need to find a way for them to access State supports, for example, the PUP?</p></speech>

I wish to ask about the availability of primary care facilities, particularly for children, and raise the example of a campaign that I presume the Minister is aware of, that being, the active and long-running campaign for a primary care centre in Fettercairn.  Despite having approximately 7,500 residents, Fettercairn incredibly does not have a single GP.  That has real consequences for the health of everyone in the area, but children in particular.  Does the Minister agree that communities like Fettercairn's need access to GPs and primary care for the benefit of everyone, particularly children?</p></speech>

It relates to private clinics in the new national children's hospital.  The proposal seems to be that, despite everything that we have gone through in recent months, there will still be private clinics operating out of the hospital.  Is the Minister not concerned that this points to children's access to healthcare being rationed on the basis of their parents' income or wealth as opposed to the children's need?</p> <p>Would the Minister not agree, in the context of the need to move forward rather than backwards towards a national health service, that all of the facilities in the national children's hospital should be used to provide healthcare for those who need it?  In other words, it should be organised on the basis of need with proper quality healthcare for all of the children who need it regardless of the income or wealth of their parents.</p></speech>

I am sure it will be such that we will come across one another again.</p>  <p>  Throughout this crisis many parents and families in Wexford have expressed to me just how they truly miss daily interactions with their childcare centres.  They have expressed huge regard and respect for the profession, valuing these relationships as an integral part of their family.  The failure of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to provide a set of clear guidelines such that the childcare providers, be they public or private, can decide on reopening is somewhat deplorable.  There is grave concern in the sector that it is being taken for granted by the Department, leaving it vulnerable by such lack of preparedness.</p>  <p>  We are in the midst of phase 1 of the reopening and childcare providers are unable to reassure parents and families as to how they will deliver care for their children in the weeks ahead.  They cannot inform their staff as to whether or not they are going to returning to work.  They need a clear, coherent plan for the reopening of the childcare sector.  Government needs to show a real sense of urgency as the provision of childcare is the backbone to many in the workforce being able to return to work.  I am calling on the Minister to undertake in the next week to provide a clear protocol and set of guidelines to the childcare sector that guarantees a strategy for reopening and will ensure the health and safety of all involved.</p></speech>

I must beg to differ with her on an issue already broached with her by some of my colleagues, namely, the advisory group and the acceptance of the Federation of Early Childhood Providers.  The issue here is that none of my Wexford constituent providers was contacted in regard to who should join the advisory group.  The Minister will find that Seas Suas which, I am informed, has 103 members is partaking in the advisory group.  Leaving out the federation which represents some 1,400 members will not result in reflecting what the providers require.  I would caution the Minister that this could turn out to be another fiasco, as happened with regard to what was supposed to be provided for front-line workers.  I ask the Minister to reconsider that.</p>  <p>  Can the Minister tell us why early childhood providers have been excluded?  The Minister said they were informed by the sector in regard to representation.  Wexford constituency providers are telling me they were not consulted.  I ask the Minister to, if she can, tell the House why they were excluded.</p></speech>

Second, I believe I have already answered the Deputy's question a couple of times.  Over the course of the past four years, since I have been Minister, we established an early years forum.  That forum, and a sub-group within it, got together and recommended who would be on the advisory group, and that is who is on the advisory group.  The Federation of Early Childhood Providers is not the only group that feels it has been excluded by its own peers.  As I indicated, I am setting up a reference group in order to get more representation, consult with people and try to do the best job possible.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that within the time frame we face and also in terms of the general process of designing things that need consultation, one can never consult with absolutely every single person.</p></speech>

She is now telling us that the advisory group was picked from some section that was already there advising Government, which means the Federation of Early Childhood Providers was never considered in the first place.  What is important and what I would like the Minister to note, particularly on behalf of providers in Wexford, is that there are 1,400 members of the federation.  If the Minister wants her plan to reflect the requirements and have it accepted, I really think she should reconsider the federation, not as part of the subset but as part of the advisory group.

There certainly seems to be some consternation about why this particular group is being excluded.</p>  <p>  Early childcare providers and educators play an important role in children's development and provide valuable support for families and young children, particularly those in the access and inclusion model, AIM, support scheme.  Our most vulnerable children depend on these services but were effectively abandoned by the State when funding was withdrawn during the Covid-19 emergency.  It is essential that we ensure the right standard of care for these children.  Continuity of care lies squarely with the State, not the providers, if funding is withdrawn.  Financial intervention by the State must be guaranteed as part of the recovery strategy to ensure as many parents as possible can return to work.  Can the Minister inform the House of what funding she has sought to ensure continuity of service will be provided and if she has received confirmation of that funding being granted by the Department of Finance?</p></speech>

As I understand it, six sectoral representatives, nominated by the sector, participated in the group.  Despite such intense collaboration and wide-ranging consultation, how is that the availability of childcare facilities for front-line workers has still not materialised?</p>  <p>  I will explore that question further.  Many Members would have been supportive of the decision to roll out that service, but it appears that a roadblock around insurance and State indemnity has been the rock on which this scheme perished.  If that is the case, why was there no representative from the insurance sector on the advisory board?  Was the sector asked to participate and did it refuse to take part?  It is something on which I would like clarity.</p>  <p>  From what I and other Members can see, the insurance sector has been nothing but obstructive in the entire process of getting us back to normality.  Not alone is that confined to the childcare sector, the insurance companies have also been extremely obstructive regarding businesses.  I have raised that point here.  It is absolutely outrageous that this has been allowed to continue.  Having said that, however, it is also clear that responsibility for some of the confusion around the roll-out of childcare services can be put down to the lack of communication by the Department.  That is certainly the sentiment being expressed by the childcare representatives on the ground.  Despite the composition of the advisory group, they feel that clarity on what exactly is happening is not reaching the providers.</p>  <p>  Turning to a different matter, the Minister might provide me with an update on the work of the school meals programme.  As I understand it, the Minister's Department, in conjunction with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Education and Science, has devised updated guidelines for 1,580 schools and organisations in the programme.  What has been the feedback from Tusla's education support service, which I understand is communicating with all home school community liaison co-ordinators and school completion programmes on this issue?</p>  <p>  My final question concerns family resource centres.  I know they are experiencing some service pressures regarding funding and their wish to increase staffing levels.  Will the Minister please clarify if she has engaged with the family resource centres and outline how she proposes to respond to the challenges this sector is experiencing?</p></speech>

One of the primary reasons was that the profile of the children being cared for was shifting.  The profile of the children in their original and current insurance plan is the diverse groups of kids who come into the centres.  The profile of these children would be that of healthcare workers and the risk, therefore, would be higher.</p></speech>

I wish to focus on the fact that there are ongoing conversations with my officials and providers in respect of insurers and that insurance cover will be provided for a return to the centre-based model, which is extremely helpful.</p><p>On the Deputy's comments regarding a lack of communication and so on, as we move towards the new scheme, my Department and I are communicating directly with providers via email.

It would have been very easy for her to walk away.</p>  <p>  On maternity leave, does the Minister support the extension of maternity leave?  That proposal has been raised with me and almost 20,000 people have signed a petition in support of it.</p>  <p>  There is very little information or guidance on how cr&egrave;ches and childcare facilities are to reopen.  Will numbers be reduced?  Is social distancing being suggested for children under five years of age?  If centres open with reduced capacity, will they get increased funding such that they can remain open?  These businesses understand that they will have to make changes, but they have not been given clear and proper guidance in order that they can prepare.</p>  <p>  The lack of childcare for front-line staff has been raised repeatedly.  It is simply not good enough and must not continue.  Many of the problems arise from the lack of consultation with childcare facilities.  I thank the Minister and hope she will be able to provide comprehensive answers to my questions.</p></speech>

I completely agree with him in that regard.  In my opening statement, I outlined and identified the process whereby my Department is developing such guidance in consultation with the sector.  I understand the particular need for such guidelines based on public health advice and for the sector to have the opportunity to identify its questions on that advice, etc.  The guidelines need to be developed and published prior to opening and that is what we are doing.</p>  <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of social distancing.  As stated earlier, social distancing is not a reality or a possibility for children.  That has been confirmed by the public health advice we have received. There are procedures and guidelines with which adults and children will need to engage in order to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus.  Children already follow much of what will be in the guidelines while they are in childcare centres.</p></speech>

The other really helpful element in terms of the phased reopening of society will be childminders.  My Department's recommendation is that childminders will again be able to mind children in the childminders' homes.  I hope this will be accepted in the relatively near future by other Departments and by the Cabinet so that we can move forward in that regard.  We need to have that additional support and supply for essential workers.</p></speech>

I have spoken to many providers about this and I get a sense that there has been a certain erosion of trust between the providers and the Department.  The issue is consultation.  People told me that a 17 page document arrived, it was a fait accompli and they just did not know what to do.  There is real concern within the sector.  One of the issues that arose is that many childcare workers work part-time rather than full-time and so could not provide the service.  I am interested in something the Minister said a moment ago about childminders.  One of the issues that was raised with me is that the workers in this sector see themselves as education providers and not childminders.  I ask the Minister to address that point.  I take on board the fact that the Minister has set up an advisory group and I acknowledge that a lot of good work is being done.  However, I still think trust needs to be rebuilt.</p>  <p>  I wish to ask about childcare providers signing up to the official contract to provide staff wages and about the &euro;300 per week payment for sole traders.  My information is that many providers, especially the smaller ones, have not signed up because initially it was really a blank contract.  Does the Minister know how many providers have signed up and how many have not?  While the &euro;300 per week will tide sole traders over and people are grateful for it, there are significant extra costs involved in reopening.  Does the Department have plans in place to support providers when they reopen?  Will the pod system to which the Minister referred mean the number of children who can be cared for will have to be reduced?  If so, who will bear the cost?</p></speech>

We are working hard to rebuild trust.  Does the Deputy's question on sign-up numbers refer to the temporary wage subsidy scheme?</p></speech>

The scheme is still open to those who want to sign up.  People have different reasons for not doing so but the number is really high, which demonstrates the success of the scheme in terms of meeting the sector's needs.  Even though it is not necessarily all of what the sector had originally, it is still a significant support and the take-up is better than in most other sectors.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about financial supports and guidelines for reopening.  </p> <p>We are aware of that and are factoring it in.  No decisions have been made in terms of what that actually means and we have to first assess what would be the cost to the centres and so on.  We are certainly aware that there are going to be costs associated with the reopening.</p></speech>

For both of those reasons, there will be a reduction in the number that are cared for in the centres, certainly initially.  These are some of the real struggles and challenges right now in terms of how to prioritise, especially in terms of the initial reopening and, as we continue to grow, we will need to find ways to meet the demand.  At present, we are not fully aware whether there will be the same demand as there was before the pandemic.  This is why we have constructed and will be administering a survey of parents, on the one hand, and providers, on the other, to try to get some evidence to help us with those decisions.</p></speech>

First, has Covid-19 interfered with the mother and baby homes report?  Will it be published promptly and, if so, when?  Second, has Tusla carried out a risk analysis on the effects of the closedown on child protection and, if so, has it produced a paper on that?  Third, with regard to historical sexual abuse in scouting, there is no specific date for the learning review.  It is now two months later.  Has the Minister had any input since the report was produced?  When did she see it and what is its status, given its horrific contents?</p></speech>

I know Tusla has done a risk assessment and it has identified strategies in order to mitigate that.  As to whether it has a paper, I do not know but I will find out and I will ensure the Deputy gets that information.  With regard to Scouting Ireland, my officials saw the Ian Elliott report before it was published, although I cannot say exactly when.</p></speech>

I realise this is difficult and I thank the Minister for her professionalism in regard to how she is approaching this subject.  However, I have to say I do not believe that childcare was given appropriate attention at the level of NPHET.  Perhaps that was not its role but, certainly, when we look back on the minutes from 16 March, it comes up as an item under discussion and it is then pushed on to another date, but it does not appear.  I went through the dates, which run from 16 to 31 March and on to 3 and 7 April.  During that time, there was talk about essential workers, then talk about essential care workers and then it was to be kept under review and a paper was presented.  I asked the Minister on the last occasion whether there is a copy of that paper that was presented and noted in the minutes because, surely, all the problems were identified.  Perhaps the Minister will tell me before she finishes.</p>  <p>  My point is that it is clear that what we need is public childcare.  We need delivery of childcare by the State.  The State did not do that and problems have been created.  Of course, we always have to go in and pick up the pieces, for example, in regard to the nursing homes.</p> <p>The problem in childcare has arisen for many reasons.  I thank the Nevin Institute for a research paper which the Minister might get the Department to look at.  The researcher, Dr. Lisa Wilson, has set out quite clearly that there is a misalignment between the road map for opening up and the absence of childcare facilities.  Childcare did not appear in the road map published by the Government except to say cr&egrave;ches will open on a certain date in a very reduced manner.  There is no policy intervention and no realisation of the extent of the service provided by childcare workers and families.  The figures are very interesting.  Approximately 50% of childcare is provided by families.  This does not feature in any policy document.  In 62% of those cases, the parents are full-time workers. </p> <p> There are all sorts of interesting facts in the paper which have not featured anywhere in NPHET's work or in any Government policy statement.  I am not blaming the Minister for this but it is time that we recognised childcare and grasped the opportunity that there should be a public care model.  We should also realise the amount of unrecognised childcare work that families do.  There is absolutely no recognition at Government level of the misalignment between opening up the economy and having no childcare provision.  In addition, there is no recognition of the extent of the problem or the solution to the problem.  It is very difficult for me, as a female Deputy, to look at this and, as I have said already, to cope with the kite that was flown that the Department would be abolished, just when it is learning what to do with regard to childcare and women.  I thank the Minister for her honesty and professionalism.  She has shown an honesty on these matters that was never there before.</p></speech>

We had near full employment and a still-declining live register.  We are now in a situation where the funds from the social protection Vote are acting as an income shock absorber to over 1 million people who have lost their jobs.  The outbreak of Covid-19 and the essential public health measures to contain the spread of the virus have given rise to the largest monthly increase in the unemployment rate in the history of the State.  This once-in-a-century challenge has necessitated responses that are impactful, speedy and innovative and I am pleased to have had the opportunity today to outline the role of Department is playing in this response to the pandemic.</p>  <p>  In March, we brought forward legislation to provide for the enhanced illness benefit for people who are diagnosed with Covid-19 or a probable source of infection from the virus.  Employees and the self-employed are eligible for this payment and it was designed as a measure that would compensate people at an enhanced rate in light of the unprecedented health crisis but also, significantly, provide an incentive for people to comply with the self-isolation measures where they were a probable source of infection.  The scheme has now been extended until 19 June and it remains important in the suite of measures that were designed to slow the spread of the virus.</p> <p>Very quickly we saw that this unprecedented health crisis would also lead to an immediate economic crisis and make dependent hundreds of thousands of people on the State to cushion the devastating blow of their widespread job losses temporarily.  Across Government, initiatives have been introduced to support people and businesses in the current emergency.  As part of that first piece of emergency legislation, and I genuinely thank all Members of this House and Seanad &Eacute;ireann for the constructive role that was played in the passing of that legislation, the waiting rules were relaxed for jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance for the duration of this emergency period.  Normally a person must wait for six days before making a jobseeker's claim, and this temporary waiving of the rule meant that people would get their income supports immediately.</p> <p> We introduced the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, on 16 March and since its introduction my Department has received more than 815,000 applications for the PUP or job seeker's payment.  This is the equivalent of a four-year caseload in less than two months.  Most of these applications, as Members are aware, were received in the first four weeks.</p> <p>It would be remiss of me not to put on the record of the House my genuine appreciation and sincere thanks to all the staff in my Department, and all the staff redeployed from other parts of the public service, who have work night and day to ensure the claims we receive are dealt with, to take the thousands of phone calls we receive daily from people about their entitlements, and to ensure our IT system continues to cope with the unprecedented volume of claims.  It is an enormous challenge but it is being done and people are receiving the payments they are due when they are due.  This is down to the staff and credit is deserved.  I want to acknowledge that.</p> <p> Our priority in all of this work was to assist the now 585,000 people who are currently in receipt of Covid-19 PUP.  We all know these people.  They are our neighbours, our friends and our relatives.  All of them were working at the beginning of March without any expectation of suddenly losing their income.  They were looking forward to the summer and were planning ahead for holidays, parties and festivals.  They may have been preparing for celebrations such as Holy Communions, confirmations and graduations until they suddenly suffered a severe economic and personal shock with the loss of their employment.  The income supports we introduced and enhanced are intended to alleviate the financial hardship they all faced, and in this way to minimise any financial worries or stress during what is already a time of great concern for all our families' health.  It is also hoped that some of this income will be spent in the local economy and keep businesses afloat.  This will help Ireland to recuperate from the economic turbulence caused during this period.</p> <p> I remind the Houses that employees and the self-employed, part-time and full-time workers who lost their employment as a result of Covid-19 are eligible for the &euro;350 payment.  It is money directly into their hand.  It is raising-up rather than trickle-down economics.  This week payments valued at &euro;205 million were paid to recipients of this scheme.</p> <p> As the economy was put into sleep mode we also introduced an employer-refunded scheme that has now become the temporary wage-subsidy scheme.  Experience has shown that in the middle of an economic shock where there are significant temporary lay-offs it is very important that the link between the employer and the employee is maintained to the greatest extent possible.  To date, some 54,000 employers have registered for the scheme and some 464,000 employees have received at least one payment.  We have made changes to the scheme to assist lower-income workers and will continue to keep the operation under review.  To date the State has provided more than &euro;900 million in support for this scheme.</p> <p> If the Government did not act fast we may have designed things differently.  If the need was not so urgent alternative conditionalities might have been chosen.  We were, and are, responding to a crisis.  What emerged in our supports may not be perfect but much of it is good.  The most important thing is that it is working.  A crucial factor is that without the relief provided by these payments it is very unlikely we would have had the really high level of public compliance with all of the health restrictions we introduced to tackle this virus.</p> <p> There are other measures the Department took to assist people who are staying in their homes to help slow the spread of the virus.  We extended the fuel allowance season by four weeks.  We moved benefits from a weekly to a fortnightly payment cycle.  We extended the period for which payments can be held at post offices to up to 90 days.  Arrangements were made with An Post to enable nominated agents to collect payments where necessary.  We completely simplified the application process for rent supplement.  We introduced procedures to help one-parent families where there were difficulties with maintenance payments.  We temporarily suspended part of the Redundancy Payments Act to prevent mass redundancies in businesses that we all hope will recover.</p></speech>

The history books will reflect that they have been effective in insulating people from the worst effects of a severe income and employment shock.  As the numbers receiving the payments begin to plateau and even decrease, we need to focus on getting people back to work.  I am planning for the reopening of our economy, which is why I reconvened the labour market advisory council and why my Department published a working paper on the initial impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on Ireland's labour market.  The paper will, I hope, provide a valuable input into the work of the advisory council and of my officials as we act to help people return to employment as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to work with other Departments to adapt to the ever-changing circumstances arising from this pandemic.  It has been hardworking, responsive, innovative, flexible and forward-looking, and I know it will continue to be so.</p>  <p>  We can never plan perfectly for the future and this unprecedented health emergency absolutely proves that.  However, we can choose to do what is right and effective to meet the challenges before our eyes, and I believe my Department has done that.  As a people we have shown again that this country can rise to significant challenges and that we can not only endure but also demonstrate the best qualities we possess, namely, resilience, innovation and a strong sense of community.  These values have helped us to phase 1 of the reopening of our society.  I hope they will lay the foundations for a really good recovery.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.344" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1492" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="17:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000056#LLL00200"><p>I am sharing time with Deputies Devlin, Brendan Smith and Niall Collins.  I want to be associated with the remarks the Minister made about the departmental officials.  They have worked very hard in difficult circumstances and have performed their duties very efficiently.  If the Minister does not have time to answer all of my question now, she might respond in writing.</p>  <p>  What is the Government's intention in respect of the &euro;350 per week Covid-19 payment?  Is it due to be extended beyond 15 June and, if so, for how long?  If and when the Government decides to terminate the payment, will it do so in a tapered manner or will it let people fall off the cliff, immediately back to their pre-existing rates of social protection?  Are there proposals to change the eligibility criteria for either the illness-related or the PUP?</p>  <p>  Another question that arises relates to arrears.  Quite a number of my constituents, as well as others from outside my constituency who have contacted me, have mentioned that they have not been paid from the beginning of the pandemic for one reason or another.  In many cases, it is because they made applications IN writing and were told to apply again online.  When will those arrears be paid?</p>  <p>  As the Minister will know, quite a number of people who receive means-tested payments work part time. They are entitled to receive the full Covid payment - &euro;350 per week - plus their pre-existing level of social protection.  The Department has signalled that in cases where a person's income from employment is less than the &euro;350 per week, there will be a clawback.  That sum, according to my calculations, could run to &euro;1,000 or more in many cases.  This will be presented to people who have suffered a dramatic reduction in income.  Take, for example, someone who is moved from &euro;350 to his or her pre-existing social welfare level, having lost his or her job at the same time.  Does the Government intend to proceed with this and, if so, in what manner?</p>  <p>  The Department has conceded that the increased level of unemployment will require renewed concentration and labour activation services.  Are there plans to extend the range of apprenticeships or to introduce some flexibility into the community employment scheme?  Despite some recent changes to the scheme, it remains notoriously inflexible, particularly in an era of what we project to be high unemployment.  Will the Minister give an assurance that local employment services will be at the front and centre of the labour activation effort that will take place?  What is the position regarding Turas Nua and Seetec?  Their contracts were supposed to end next December.  Will they be gone next December or is there a possibility that they will reappear in competition with the local State-funded labour activation services?</p> <p>I would like an answer to those questions.</p> <p> There are a number of other matters I want to raise but the time constraints do not allow me to go into them in detail.  For example, I understand that it is the policy on all sides of the House to encourage people to work, whether they are self-employed or employees, beyond the age of 66.  I look at those over 66 for whom, through no fault of their own, the businesses they work for have closed down due to the Covid-19 pandemic or their own businesses have closed down, and yet they are not entitled to the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment nor are they even entitled to a top-up of their pensions to reach the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment.  That sends a bad signal to people who we are trying to encourage to work beyond the age of 66.</p> <p> On pensions generally, the Minister was pursuing a number of initiatives before the election, such as auto-enrolment, which is badly needed.  Has the timetable slipped on that?  If so, by how much has it slipped?  Where are we on it?  Where are we with the total contributions approach?  It was expected that approach would be introduced by the middle of this year.</p> <p> Has any thought been given within the Government or the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to the idea of protecting the poorest in this society against increases in carbon tax?  The increases in the fuel allowance are an inadequate way to do that.</p> <p> Has any thought been given to the question of indexing social welfare, not to the headline rate of inflation but to something such as average wages?  The Minister will be aware that if the gap between people on social welfare, the poorest in the country, and people in other parts of the economy is allowed to widen, then poverty and inequality will be widened.</p> <p> Is the Minister aware of the implications for her Department of the recent actions by Debenhams, which employs 1,000 people in this country?  Debenhams Ireland made its staff redundant in the middle of the Covid-19 situation and Debenhams UK then removed all of the assets from the Irish company, leaving the Department, or rather the Irish taxpayer, with a huge bill for statutory redundancy.  Are we, as a State, going to stand aside in the face of this blatant daylight robbery?  Does the Government have any position on that?</p> <p> As I am on the matter of redundancy, the Minister will be aware that under the legislation we passed seven to eight weeks ago, people who become redundant during the Covid-19 period are precluded from applying for redundancy within the normal four-week period.  They are delayed from doing so until some unspecified time in the future which has yet to be decided.  Would it not be only right and fair in view of those circumstances that companies should not be allowed to make people redundant during the Covid-19 pandemic?  If they wish to or have to do so afterwards, then so be it.</p> <p> Those are some of the points I want to raise.  As I said, I do not have time to go into this in detail because I want to accommodate my colleagues, but I want to remind the House that this week, 584,000 people received the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment, 44,600 people received the illness-related Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment, and in addition to that, ordinary social welfare payments such as jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance were paid out to 215,000 people.  That is 850,000 people receiving unemployment support, so a lot of the population is affected by the measures taken by the Government and it is time we had detailed scrutiny of the matter, which is why I am delighted we are discussing it in some detail next week.  I hope the Minister can answer some of those questions in the interim.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.346" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1556" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000057#MMM00200"><p>I want to compliment the staff in the offices of the Department throughout Cavan and Monaghan and in the regional office in Dundalk on dealing so efficiently with a huge workload in challenging circumstances.  From the outset, officials showed their determination to process applications as quickly as possible and they were conscious of the sudden and changed circumstances for so many families.  I take this opportunity to compliment them on getting payments out rapidly and efficiently to so many people who needed them at those times.  It is important at a time when a substantial cohort of our population is receiving some or all of their income from the State.</p>  <p>  Weeks ago, I raised through representation to the Minister and through Covid-19 queries the need to include workers over the age of 66 in any Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment if they met the other conditions.  We have listened to different Governments encourage older persons, as Deputy O'Dea said, to stay on in the workforce past reaching the pension age if possible.</p>  <p>I have encountered people on reduced contributory pensions, perhaps working on a part-time basis or running small businesses, who are losing their income.  It is utterly wrong that, in the current circumstances, they do not receive a supplement to their existing reduced contributory pension.  Some have had small businesses with ongoing costs and no income from those businesses.  They find themselves in difficult circumstances.  Many are on reduced pensions because of the changes to the assessment of entitlement for a contributory pension introduced in 2012.  In many instances, these people were providing services through small shops that would otherwise not be available in many rural communities.  People on contributory pensions who lost their employment income should receive a supplementary payment to bring the benefit up to the value of the PUP.  In many instances with small businesses, the employees in question are critical to the ongoing running, efficiency and success of the business.  The Government quite rightly set out that it wanted to retain the link between employers and employees.  It is important at this time - I hope it is not for the long term - that reduced contributory payments be supplemented and brought up to the value of the PUP.</p> <p> I raised with the Minister previously the unjust administration of the scheme on the basis that cross-Border workers were not entitled to the pandemic unemployment payment here.  In the two counties I have the privilege of representing, we see a large number of people who travel to the North or come to the South to work.  Those people who come to the South to work, and who pay their taxes and PRSI here, feel very aggrieved that they were not entitled to any payments at this time.</p></speech>

If the Minister does not have time to respond, she might correspond with me.</p>  <p>  As we heard, Covid-19 has fundamentally changed Ireland's economic and social landscape.  At the end of 2019, 2.5 million people were at work by contrast with today, when there are over 1.25 million people in receipt of income supports.  The State is likely to run a deficit of around &euro;30 billion for 2020, and reigniting our economy will present significant challenges.  A business-as-usual, one-size-fits-all approach will not work.  Employers, employees and sectors that remain closed owing to the Government's health advice should have certainty that the income supports will be maintained for the period in question.  We need to see changes to the pandemic unemployment payment and the wage subsidy scheme to allow for more flexibility to support the workers.  For example, workers should be allowed to return to companies to work part time where possible.  The Government should support working schemes or incentives whereby staff are allowed to work from home.</p>  <p>  Long-term unemployment is a genuine prospect, especially for the 120,000 who are under 25.  That needs to be tackled, particularly for those in respect of the pandemic unemployment payment.  We need an ambitious plan to retrain and reskill those workers who unfortunately lost their jobs during this pandemic.  Any measures that are put in place must deliver an inclusive recovery.</p>  <p>  I previously raised in this House the discriminatory aspects of the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the PUP.  While the Minister referred to some changes in her speech, it is important that we see some changes.  The arrangements are deeply unfair on women returning to work from maternity leave in that they cannot access the temporary wage subsidy scheme.  The criteria are equally discriminatory against those over the age of 66.  Will the Minister commit to rectifying deficiencies in these schemes to ensure an inclusive recovery in which no one is left behind?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.349" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1493" speakername="Niall Collins" time="18:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000058#NNN00300"><p>I thank the staff in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in my constituency, Limerick County, particularly those in the Newcastle West and Kilmallock offices and the Dominick Street office in Limerick city.  Some 22,000 people in Limerick are in receipt of the PUP.  There needs were dealt with very efficiently and the staff were really good.  They got back to people and were great at interacting with my office and, I am sure, other offices but there are some anomalies.  There are some individuals with outstanding issues and arrears that need to be paid.  I ask the Minister to consider drafting in more staff to the relevant offices to deal with the outstanding arrears that are due.</p>  <p>  The maternity leave issue is a genuine and major one that has been raised with me by a number of women in my constituency.  The exclusion of women from the temporary wage subsidy scheme is really discriminatory and unfair.  Women on maternity leave are coping with new additions to their families and they face all the challenges that go with that.</p> <p>They cannot get out and about because of the lockdown restrictions, enrol their children in cr&egrave;ches or go to parent-and-toddler group meetings.  Many of them are dealing with medical issues.  As we know, some people give birth by caesarean section and have all the other complications that go with that.  We really have to move to amend the temporary wage subsidy scheme.  The Minister will know - I think everybody in this House knows - that the scheme discriminates against women who were not receiving payments from their employers during their maternity leave.  That has a disproportionate impact on people who were in lower-paid and more vulnerable jobs.  I would like to hear a commitment from the Minister that this will be addressed as soon as possible to achieve fairness for these people.</p> <p> I also wish to raise the issue of the over 66s.  It is a huge issue in my constituency, in Limerick.  Many people aged 66 and over have been in touch with me.  They feel this is ageist, which it is, and discriminatory.  The issue has to be addressed because if we are as a society to encourage people to remain in the workplace longer and to contribute to society, this sends out entirely the wrong message.  I think this question has been asked of the Minister and her Department.  Do we have any handle on the number of people in this cohort who have been locked out of the pandemic unemployment payment?  A response would go a long way towards informing the debate and the argument we are having about this.</p> <p> Finally, the restart grants were announced during the week.  I know this is not directly under the Minister's directorate, but it is linked to it because if we have no employers, there will be no jobs for people to go back to.  The fact that for a business to avail of the restart grant of up to &euro;10,000, it has to be paying commercial rates immediately excludes sole traders, microbusinesses and start-ups.  Any type of business that is not paying commercial rates is locked out of this scheme.  If a business is locked out, it may not be able to restart and will not re-engage and re-employ its staff who may have been laid off.  There is a real issue here that the Minister and the Government need to look at, and I would like if she would address that.</p></speech>

This is an important question to lead with.  I welcome the Minister.  Since the outbreak of Covid-19, we have introduced emergency legislation and had a number of sitting days dealing with social protection, and this is the first time we have had a senior Minister before the House with responsibility for social protection to answer questions and provide some accountability.</p>  <p>  As the Minister outlined in her contribution, more than 585,000 people are currently in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment and many of those will not be able to go back to work since the introduction of the restrictions the Government has brought in, which I fully support, to put the economy to sleep.  Many of those people will not get back to work until 10 August, for example, in phase 5 of the road map.  There has been a lot of speculation that there will be changes to the PUP on 15 June.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has said the issue is being looked at.  What people need is certainty.  They do not need to come to a cliff edge.  They need to be assured about the &euro;350 payment, which is a lifeline for so many people, a fact the Minister acknowledged, not just for the families but local economies as well, because it is putting critical money into those economies.  I will ask the Minister a direct question.  Will that payment be extended and, if so, for how long?</p></speech>

It was introduced to support people's incomes while their normal incomes were not available to them.  We are aware that based on the phases of the reopening of society, this will occur at different times for different people, so-----</p></speech>

I can confirm to him that it will be extended.  In which shape and form, however, the decision has not been made yet.  The matter is under active consideration and the decision will probably be made in the coming weeks.  As soon as it has been arrived at, I will be the first to tell everybody.  The most important thing to say is that it was introduced to support people's incomes.  I said it last week-----</p></speech>

I do not think his comment is fair.  It is not that I am not willing; we have not made the decision yet.

The Minister will be aware that last week the National Women's Council of Ireland referred the exclusion of women returning from maternity leave from accessing the wage subsidy scheme to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  The NWCI believes that the Government's exclusion of women from maternity leave is not in compliance with the Maternity Protection Act 1994, which provides that women on maternity leave are entitled to be treated as if they had been at work during their maternity leave.  I agree with that view.  It appears that Government is acting contrary to legislation.  I listened to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, today when he said he was examining it.  Government needs to move further than that and needs to implement an end to the discrimination these women are facing.  Will the Minister assure us that measures will be taken immediately to ensure the discrimination ends?  Perhaps the Minister can answer that towards the end because so many women are being discriminated against.</p>  <p>  Discrimination is rife throughout these payments.  We have the issue around those over 66 years of age, who have been precluded from the pandemic unemployment payment, as well as frontier workers and cross-border workers.  There seems to be some confusion.  The Department's website states that frontier workers can access the payment.  That is causing confusion.  I have raised this consistently, as has my party leader, Deputy McDonald.  It is discriminatory.  These people have paid their taxes in this State but they are excluded from the payment.  This serious issue needs to end and there needs to be clarity on the Department's website, which states that frontier workers can access this payment.  That needs to be clarified.</p>  <p>  I want to finish up by asking about Debenhams.  This is a serious concern.  We are dealing with 1,000 workers throughout the State.  Since the devastating news that the Irish business has been placed into liquidation, there have been several requests by Mandate Trade Union to have the 30-day consultation period extended to ascertain whether redundancies can be avoided.  Unfortunately, KPMG has refused the request to allow the period to be extended.  Given the distinct possibility that the State insolvency fund will be utilised in the event of 1,000 workers being made redundant, I believe the Minister must exercise the powers at her discretion and in accordance with section 15 of the Protection of Employment Act.  This provision is important and states, "For the purpose of seeking solutions to the problems caused by the proposed redundancies, the employer concerned shall, at the Minister's request, enter into consultations with him or an authorised officer."  Has the Minister invoked that section?  If not, why not?  Will the Minister invoke that legislation?  I believe it is important that she does.  A great deal of information has been highlighted about assets being stripped from the company etc.  Will the Minister act upon that?  The workers in Debenhams gave me a letter and asked me to hand it to the Minister.  Perhaps after the sitting I will pass it on to her.</p></speech>

I have had extensive engagement with them.  I know they have been working hard and effectively in difficult circumstances and I am keen to acknowledge that.</p>  <p>  An issue of concern to me arose early on Monday morning when a landlord arrived in with a crew of men and dismantled a small storage area of a coffee shop in Ranelagh.  The landlord threw all the products and stock out onto the footpath.  It is worth recording that the coffee shop has been really generous in offering those over 65 years and front-line workers free coffee.</p> <p>The shop in question, Nick's Coffee, is an integral part of the community.  We cannot let ourselves become a society where this sort of behaviour becomes acceptable.  One must ask how any human can carry out those sorts of actions in a health crisis when everybody is struggling.  It seems big landlords are being prioritised over the local economy, which is a real concern for people.</p> <p> Our economy will be a long time recovering if landlords are going to behave in this way.  It is in everybody's interest that we work together and the Government must intervene to stop landlords acting like this.  Something must be done to ensure landlords cannot do this.  In the George's Street Arcade, the landlord has a number of tenants but has given comfort to them.  Landlords can work with commercial tenants and be sensible about it.  It is a credit to landlords in the George's Street Arcade that this is being done.</p> <p> Does the Minister condemn the actions of the landlord in question, as it is important to state clearly that the Government will not accept this sort of behaviour?  Assuming the Minister will condemn the action, will she consider bringing forward measures to give protection to commercial tenants like that?  I ask her to bring forward legislation that will afford commercial tenants the same protection that residential tenants have.  Is that something she is considering?</p></speech>

There are large numbers of workers resident in Derry, west Tyrone and Fermanagh who work and pay taxes and social insurance in Donegal, making a major contribution to the county's economy.  They have been left blowing in the wind by the Minister and her Department, which is absolutely disgraceful.  They were told to go across the Border into the North, and unfortunately, as a result of partition and the actions of the British Government, they receive a third of the amount received by workers by their side who pay the same taxes and social insurance.  It is an absolute disgrace and repugnant to the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>We can speak about the pandemic unemployment payment.  It is a flexible scheme, which is very welcome, and it is for self-employed, full-time and part-time workers. The website is used as a source of advice by people working on both sides of the Border.  It indicates that where a person has been laid off temporarily - as the people I speak of have - that person is paid unemployment benefit in the State where his or her taxes or social insurance were paid.  That has been the practice.  I argue that the practice that the Minister and her Department have stood over for months now is in defiance of European Union guidance.  It is certainly repugnant to the Good Friday Agreement.  I ask the Minister to respond now on why she is standing over this disgraceful practice.</p></speech>

The Covid-19 unemployment payment is payable to people resident in Ireland who lose their employment as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.  European Union citizens have the right to live and work in any European Union country and cross-border workers, termed as frontier workers, arise where people work on one side of a border but live on the other and return home at least once per week.  The position regarding frontier workers is that the pandemic unemployment payment is consistent with the rules of jobseeker's benefit regarding the competent state.  Under the current European Union rules, the member state of the resident is competent for the payment of unemployment benefits in the case of wholly unemployed frontier workers.  This means the competent state for a person living in Northern Ireland and working in the Republic of Ireland who becomes wholly unemployed is Northern Ireland and that person is not eligible for the pandemic unemployment payment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.376" nospeaker="true" time="18:45:00" ><p>However, it is important to note that, recognising it was probably not going to be easy to bear for those people, we ensured that the wage subsidy scheme was introduced a week or ten days after the PUP, not only to maintain the links between employers and employees, but to take account of other people.  Deputies have referred to those who have been excluded because of the law relating to the payment.  The wage subsidy scheme was set up to try to compensate people and alleviate any concern caused by that situation.</p></speech>

As she well knows, a large number of employers in the hospitality sector and a range of other sectors had poor cash flows.  They laid off their workers, being aware that they could avail of the PUP.  One business person in Donegal told me a story.  A chef working for that business had paid taxes and social insurance for decades but was left with no support from this State, yet the young person who had been washing dishes for just weeks got &euro;350 per week.  How is that fair or defensible?  As the Minister is aware, many workers are benefiting from the PUP rather than the wage subsidy scheme.  There is a much higher uptake.  As such, it is not in any way reasonable to use it as a defence.  How can the Minister argue that she is in line with European rules by not paying workers who are resident in the North the PUP and instead paying them through the wage subsidy scheme?  How can it be done for one scheme but not the other?  She cannot stand over this.</p></speech>

In the first two weeks after the wage subsidy scheme was introduced and when there was some confusion as to the criteria, many people let their staff go, went onto the Covid payment and took their staff back knowing full well that the Revenue Commissioners were refunding the wages in real time.  If someone was paid on the Monday, he or she was getting a refund from the Revenue Commissioners on the Tuesday.</p>  <p>  I do not mean to be argumentative with the Deputy.  I am not standing over or justifying anything.  It is the current legislation and it is up to this House to change it if it wants to.

I thank the Minister and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection's staff across the country, particularly those in the Intreo office in Clondalkin, for everything they have done to make that happen.</p>  <p>  The temporary Covid wage subsidy scheme has kept 460,000 people in employment.  The PUP of &euro;350 has eased the anxiety of more than 500,000 who did not know from where their next month's rent or mortgage payment would come.  In the few short weeks since the payment was announced, we have learned much about the virus - unfortunately, that it will haunt us for longer.  Workers who have been laid off have no option but to rely on this payment for the immediate future.  The lack of clarity on its future is adding to their anxiety and stress and affecting their mental health.  We can provide them with some small level of relief by giving them clarity on the payment's future.  Will the Minister outline her plans to extend the payment until the country is back on its feet?</p>  <p>  I also ask that, as she considers the future of the wage subsidy scheme, she be mindful of businesses with traditionally high staff turnover rates.</p> <p>Small retailers in Clondalkin and Lucan, for example, may employ 20 people as standard, but the usual churn of staff could mean that not all of their workforce may qualify for the wage subsidy scheme currently.  This is the case where new employees are hired to replace employees who have left.  Would the Minister consider allowing companies in this situation to apply for the wage subsidy scheme based on the number of employees rather than the names of the employees who were on their books in February?</p></speech>

I now also thank the Minister, Regina Doherty, for the work she has done.  It is ironic that the two Ministers before us today were not successful in retaining their seats.  I thank the Minister, Regina Doherty, and all of her departmental staff for their work on behalf of hundreds of thousands of people.  It shows that the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is one of the better Departments, although all Departments are good.  The staff of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection are to be complimented on their outstanding work in regard to this issue.  I also thank the staff of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p>  <p>  There is one issue about which I am concerned, namely, the number of pensioners who feel hard done by.  They wish that the age limit would be waived.  Most of them are very angry and they feel let down, which was mentioned earlier by other speakers.  Is there a reason this issue cannot be resolved?  There are only a small percentage of people involved.  Is there a reason for this of which we are not aware?  Many people have contacted Deputies on this issue over recent weeks.</p>  <p>  On the pandemic unemployment payment, for how long will it remain in place such that people can plan for the future and what is the estimated cost of this scheme going forward?  I again pay tribute to the staff of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, in particular in its offices in my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, north Roscommon and south Donegal.  People often complain about the public sector.  On this occasion, they have no reason to complain as staff have gone beyond the call of duty.  I again thank them for their service.</p></speech>

There was controversy over pensions and when they come into effect, but there is no controversy around people who were in business prior to Covid-19 and were paying their taxes but can no longer work because they are sole traders and their business cannot function.  These people are not getting the payment while people living on the same street as them and working in the same shopping centre are getting it because they are under 66 years of age.  This is age discrimination, which is wrong.  If a person can prove he or she was working before the virus hit, he or she should be entitled to the difference between the current rate of pension and the &euro;350 payment.</p>  <p>  I, too, welcome the presence of the Minister, Regina Doherty, in the House.  I also welcome her determination and the gutsy way in which she has run the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and answered questions fairly and openly.  It is working against the Government that she is not allowed adequate and proper time to reply to some of the points raised, particularly those made in a rude and aggressive manner.</p>  <p>  I have been contacted by many people in regard to services for women and children who, because of the situation in their household are homeless or have domestic violence visited upon them in an appalling way.  These people are seeking immediate relocation.  Safe Ireland has been in contact with me and other Deputies.  It believes there is need for emergency rent supplement access such that these people can be provided with safe housing.  This assistance, if provided to them, will give them independence of choice and options that no longer exist because hotels and other areas of accommodation, such as bed and breakfasts, are not as available as heretofore.  There are serious problems for women and children that are not being addressed in that they cannot access rent supplement.</p> <p>Supporters and community organisations are very anxious that the Minister should step into the breach and do what she can to help them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.398" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000064#TTT00200"><p>I thank colleagues for their comments regarding the hard work of staff, which I will pass on to them.  The PUP scheme, as I said earlier, was introduced at speed and is due to finish its first round on 9 June.  I put it categorically on the record that the scheme will, of course, be extended.  It was introduced to support the income that was lost temporarily by people as we closed down the economy.  We obviously will have to support people until the economy reawakens, and that is going to happen in different phases.  The actual dimensions of that support are being considered by my Department and the Department of Finance.  As soon as the decisions have been made as to the guise it will continue in, we will make the relevant announcements.  We will continue to support people as we have done.</p>  <p>  The wage subsidy scheme is under the remit of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and I will pass on the request in regard to the names as opposed to the number of people to see if that can be tweaked.</p>  <p>  Several Members raised the matter of Safe Ireland's request and others may do so in due course.  A model was originally established a number of weeks ago when we knew this issue was going to come to light as we closed down the economy and difficulties in certain families would be accentuated.  The model that was established probably is not working 100% and Safe Ireland came to me just over two weeks ago, as did the National Women's Council of Ireland, to ask us to look at it again.  What we have been doing, in the absence of having a formal setting, is that anybody who has come to us has immediately been put in emergency accommodation, such as a bed and breakfast establishment, for two weeks.  After that, we have been looking after rent supplement, which they are absolutely entitled to make an application for in their own right.</p>  <p>  Deputies may be aware that we have really relaxed the criteria for rent supplement and changed what was a 28-page application form down to four pages in the past couple of weeks in recognition of the difficult situation people are in.  In recent days, my Department has formulated a new response on this issue in co-operation with the Departments of Justice and Equality and Children and Youth Affairs, and that was communicated to Safe Ireland and, hopefully, to the National Women's Council of Ireland this afternoon.  There is and will be no delay in accessing these supports.  There are now a number of parties who can make referrals, not least of which is the individual himself or herself, as well as the Garda and Tusla.</p>  <p>  We are trying to cover all bases.  There might be some difficulty in that certain parties would like another party to be the responsible person for referring.  From our perspective, one is either entitled to rent supplement or one is not.  We do not really mind who makes the referral.  We just need to make sure the referral gets turned around, first of all compassionately and sensitively and, second, in absolutely the fastest manner it can be.  I reassure Deputies that anybody who comes to us will immediately be put into emergency accommodation in a bed and breakfast until the application form is turned around and we will look after every family as holistically as we can.</p>  <p>  A number of speakers referred to the groups of people they feel, maybe rightly so, have been excluded from supports.  That certainly was not our choice.  Some speakers referred to front-line workers and others mentioned people aged over 66 and another group which is probably much smaller than the latter, namely, the under 18s.  We did not choose to exclude anybody.  Colleagues are well aware of how fast the legislation was put in place and, it is probably fair to say, how simple that legislation is, which was passed by this House unanimously, thankfully, to set up the PUP and the wage subsidy scheme.  The provisions are based on section 202 of the 2005 legislation and other legislation that currently stands either in this country or in the European Union which governs how we look after working age supports.</p>  <p>  More than any other Member, I have probably had more people come directly to me or to my office to tell me how they feel about being excluded.  There is not a single case that has not broken my heart because these are people who are working.  In fact, I have spent the past number of years trying to encourage people over the age of 66 to work.  However, the legislative code that governs employment benefit in this country allows payments to be made only to people aged between 18 and 66.  I do not mean to be smart but if we need to change that, then it is the House that needs to change it and we can do so collectively.  We are governing and being governed by the legislation that is the law of the land.  It was never intentional to exclude anybody, which is why I was adamant that the wage subsidy scheme should cover absolutely everybody we could cover, which included those aged over 66.  It is why we made supplementary welfare, which is governed by different legislation, available to any person over the age of 66 who was working and had extra expenses which were not covered by their current pension.  A number of people have made applications and been successful on that basis.</p>  <p>  Finally, one of the Deputies raised the case of a person who was only on a reduced contributory pension and has now lost their income.  That person is absolutely entitled to apply for a full non-contributory pension and they absolutely will get it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.400" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="19:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000065#UUU00200"><p>I will hopefully give the Minister plenty of time to respond to my questions.  I thank her for the response on the specific question on emergency rent supplement for those experiencing domestic violence.  In my maiden speech some weeks ago, when we were beginning our response to the coronavirus pandemic, I flagged the issue of domestic violence as one we cannot forget.  I give credit to the Department of Justice and Equality and State agencies, particularly the front-line providers.  They introduced the Still Here campaign to remind potential victims and victims that domestic violence services have been operating this whole time.</p>  <p>  A key concern of many service providers in this area was that there seemed to be a difficulty with accessing the emergency rent supplement.  I presume that was the case because much of the focus has shifted to the housing assistance payment, HAP, in recent years and the use of rent supplement has declined.  I am especially pleased to see that the Minister has addressed the other element of referral pathways as well, because the issue is not just the length of the form.  It is also the matter of who can flag these applications with officials in her Department and the various offices around the country to ensure they are prioritised.  On foot of that, will the Minister continue to engage with Safe Ireland and the other NGOs for the next two or three weeks to see if this process is working and if we are getting these applications processed more quickly?  That could give much confidence to people working in this sector as well as benefiting the people impacted.  </p>  <p>  New parents constitute one of the groups most deeply affected by the coronavirus restrictions.  Many are going without basic supports they have been used to, whether it is access to grandparents or to post-natal check-ups and mother-and-baby groups.  All those supports are absent and many women are being forced to extend their unpaid maternity leave because returning from that leave would make them ineligible for the temporary wage subsidy scheme.  Has the Minister considered how groups such as women returning from maternity leave and employees returning from sick leave are impacted by the current definition of "specified employee" under the temporary wage subsidy scheme?  </p>  <p>  Specifically in the context of women returning from maternity leave, has the Department given any consideration to potential European Union law implications arising from the exclusion of women returning from maternity leave?  Under EU law, women during pregnancy and returning from maternity leave are among the most protected classes of persons.  It strikes me as strange, therefore, that we are allowing this discrimination to take place here.  If any changes were being made to the temporary wage subsidy scheme, would they have to be made by way of primary or secondary legislation?  The Minister might clarify that issue.  Has the Minister considered extending the statutory period of maternity leave, and the period of payment of maternity benefit, to provide protection for women who otherwise would be returning to work during the Covid-19 crisis?  Would such extensions require primary or secondary legislation?</p>  <p>  As the Minister is well aware and as has been mentioned already, more than 1,000 people, including many in my constituency, have been made redundant with the closure of Debenhams.  Many of them had worked in the company for years or decades, and some had previously worked for Roches Stores.  They are now being left with only the statutory redundancy paid by the Minister's Department.  This is despite an agreement being in place that would have provided a redundancy payment of two weeks' pay per each year worked, alongside statutory redundancy.  In recent weeks, I have raised this issue with the Minister through parliamentary questions and in a number of letters.  My colleague from Waterford, Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh, has done the same.  I appreciate that the Minister has always responded to us very quickly on these points.</p>  <p>  We have a situation where all these workers and their families are facing being laid off without their previously agreed redundancy payments, while Debenhams UK, the parent company, is going to exit this soft administration with 120 stores trading, a much reduced cost base and a continuing and considerable income stream.  I have a question for the Minister but I first want to recognise the huge efforts the workers have made to highlight this issue.  I met them when they were demonstrating outside Leinster House and at their pickets at the Blanchardstown store.  Their commitment to fighting for what they are entitled to in these very difficult times is extremely impressive.  The Mandate trade union, which represents many of these workers, has expressed its frustration that the coronavirus restrictions are inhibiting consultation between the employer and the unions.</p> <p>I would like if the Minister could be a little more specific about the advice she has received about her ability to intervene in a liquidation process under section 15 of the Protection of Employment Act 1977.  In particular, she responded to Mandate Trade Union recently and she seemed to suggest that this legislation is outdated now in light of our current industrial relations climate.  Does she think that legislation needs to be changed to strengthen the power of a Minister to intervene?</p> <p> In light of the economic situation we have all spoken about, there is the potential that more companies are going to seek liquidation in the next number of weeks.  Is there anything we have learned from the situation with Debenhams that will allow the Minister to intervene more quickly, using the current legislation, with a view to protecting the rights of workers and as many of their entitlements as possible?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.402" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="" time="19:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000066#VVV00200"><p>The Deputy made a very good point.  I have been receiving literally a daily phone call from one of the ladies in Safe Ireland.  I have no doubt that that will not change.  If there are any tweaks that need to be made, we will definitely make them.  I thank the Deputy for writing to me on the matter, as he has done on several occasions.</p>  <p>  Several other Members raised the issue of those returning from maternity leave and the wage subsidy scheme.  I will address the matter even though it is not the responsibility of my Department and is that of the Department of Finance.  I do not think anybody, whether it was those who devised the scheme and the legislation that went through the Houses or whoever, ever intended to discriminate against anybody, least of all a woman coming back to the workforce after having a baby.  We all know it is wrong and we all know it has to be changed.  It will be fixed this week.  The difficulty arises in respect of the Deputy's second question, that is, how to change it.  The legislation passed by the Oireachtas, which refers to a specified worker, would have to be amended, and we all know where we are at regarding the two Houses at the moment.  We are trying to find a way we can do it that does not require legislation.  That is not as easy as it sounds.  It sounds like a really easy thing to fix - just fix it and allow them back in - but we will have a resolution to it at some point this week.</p>  <p>  The second question the Deputy asked me was on extending maternity leave for those already on it.  Again, not wishing to be smart to the Deputy, but it does not fall under my remit.  The policy is owned by the Department of Justice and Equality.  I am sure it is considering the requests that have been made.  I know that a very large petition is being circulated at the moment.  My Department just pays the benefit.  If I am told to extend the benefit, then obviously we will become part of the conversation.  We have not yet had a meeting on the matter, but I am sure the Department of Justice and Equality is considering the requests that have been made to it.</p>  <p>  I think the Debenhams workers have acted with such dignity and composure in recent weeks.  It has really bothered me, although I have not been able to do anything about it, that they continually find their names being taken at pickets when others are doing other things that seem to be flouting the law.  I very much feel for the workers.  They have acted in a wholly dignified manner to assert their rights.  Some of them have worked for the company for 40 years.  How they have been treated by their employer in recent months does not reflect what should be good employer relationships and certainly does not reflect the commitment, work value and ethic that the workers, many of whom are women, have given to the company through the years.  That is a real pity and shame.</p>  <p>  I have exchanged letters with Mandate in recent days and it has asked me to invoke the powers under the section.  My Department gave me a response that it did not think this legislation, which is very old - it is 1970s legislation - gave me the power to do what we were asked to do.  I decided yesterday to go to the Attorney General to be absolutely sure that advice is correct.  If I can do anything to help, even to get these people treated with the respect they deserve, not least by their employer and now by the liquidator, then I will do it, and have no doubt about that.  Unfortunately, the legislation does not allow me to intervene.  It allows me to engage with an employer, and unfortunately we are at the stage now where the High Court has appointed a liquidator and I cannot interfere in that legal process, much as I would love to stick my nose in.  I can reassure the workers that the State will always be here for them and it certainly will not let them down with regard to their statutory entitlements or the leave they have built up.  I absolutely wish there was some statement coming from the liquidators, not least to Mandate Trade Union, the representative body of the workers, but also to the workers themselves.  They deserve, at the very least, that respect.</p></speech>

We were not really given much notice.  We had an idea of what was going on for the past number of years but obviously it was accentuated by the pandemic and decisions were made by the employer very quickly.  The liquidator was appointed before we got to see that there had been no engagement for the 30 days.  One can learn from every case and whoever takes over after me will, I am sure, find himself or herself in this position in the coming months because this is probably not the last liquidation we are going to see, particularly in the retail sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.405" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="19:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000067#WWW00300"><p>First, I join colleagues in expressing gratitude to Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection staff across the country, particularly in my own region in Dundalk, who have worked in a Trojan-like fashion since reality of this crisis dawned on us.  They represent the very best of our civil and public servants and our civil and public service culture.  Unfortunately, when difficult decisions may have to be taken over the next few months, an attempt is being made to divide private and public sector workers.  We are all in this together and we need to remember that.  We need to respond in solidarity and understanding.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister, if it is appropriate, and express my gratitude to her for the way in which she has conducted herself over the past couple of years.  I particularly want to express my gratitude to her for the work she did to put the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act in place.  The work she did on that, on an impartial and cross-party basis, stands to her and is an enormous legacy for her.  The improvements that we all made together, in terms of providing more security for people in precarious work and more certainty around their hours and income will be an enormous legacy of which she can be proud.  I am sorry that she was not re-elected and I hope if she chooses to stand for election again that she is elected.  I know what it is like to lose a seat and then win it back.  It is a difficult business, a difficult profession but it is a human business and I want to pay tribute to the Minister on a personal and professional level and thank her for the work she has done.  We did not always agree but I think we worked well together to try to achieve a common objective.</p>  <p>  Potentially thousands of jobs could be lost over the next few weeks and months as some big companies plan to exploit the pandemic that we are now experiencing in order to restructure their businesses and cut jobs.  Assets will be moved out of the reach of creditors.  When I say creditors, I include employees and the State.  This is not an abstract issue.  Debenhams has been referenced.  I had the privilege of meeting a lot of Debenhams workers, with whom I have been working over the past few weeks, at the gates of Leinster House earlier.  The Minister will recall that almost five years ago the Clerys workers were put out on O'Connell Street on a Friday afternoon, with very few rights and entitlements, as part of a property play.  The operational part of the business was liquidated and the property that housed Clerys was essentially flipped and sold.  We said at the time that this State would not allow that to happen again but the reality is that these things continue to happen.  Indeed, they will continue to happen unless we take action.  What has not changed, regrettably, is that the Government in which the Minister has served has not taken the opportunity to improve the legislative protections for workers caught up in liquidations like those at Debenhams and Clerys.</p>  <p>  Four years ago, I published the recommendations from the Duffy Cahill report.  That document proposed some very important legislative changes that would go towards protecting the interests of workers caught up in a liquidation and the interests of creditors, the small businesses that supply services and goods to large companies that go into liquidation.  Will the Minister recommend that the legislation proposed in 2016 is finally delivered in order to protect the interests of workers who are caught up in liquidations?  Will she also, in the interests of taxpayers, citizens and her Department, do something that no Minister has done to date, namely, deploy the provisions of section 599 of the Companies Act, which would allow her to go after the related assets of companies to try to retrieve resources that the State will have to make available to the workers who are caught up in this liquidation over the next few weeks, in terms of statutory redundancy payments?</p> <p> Next week, the Minister will ask us to scrutinise the budget for her Department for the next few months and we know the Department is running through money at a rate of knots in responding to the crisis we are experiencing at the moment.  She has put on record her commitment to continuing the &euro;350 pandemic payment for a period, but I want her to go further than that, and it is important that she does.  She needs to elaborate precisely what she wishes to do with that payment over the next few months because she is asking this House to free up taxpayers' resources to her Department to enable it to provide the resources that people need over the next few months to be able to make ends meet.  It is imperative that the Minister makes it very clear what those resources are required for and how she intends to taper that payment, if that is what she wishes to do, as people start returning to work.  I ask if she will take up a suggestion I made a number of weeks ago, which appears to be getting traction, that is, the development of a form of improved and enhanced short-time work scheme, customised for various sectors, to allow people to go back to work, given the hospitality and retail sectors are starting to reopen gradually.</p> <p> The Covid-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc and economic carnage on those aged under 25.  We know, from looking at the figures and from our own experience in families and communities and among the people we represent, that the jobless rate for those under 25 surged to 50% in April, which is a catastrophe.  Is the Minister working with the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, and the Department of Finance to develop a new deal for a new generation and to give young people hope that the future will be better than the present?  An enormous amount of work has to be done to provide hope for the future for the young people of Ireland.</p> <p> I want to draw the attention of the Minister, as I did through a recent parliamentary question, to the recent National Economic and Social Council, NESC, report that developed an important trajectory that could be adopted by Government in terms of providing upskilling opportunities in the green economy around a just transition for younger workers, and developing a digital economy to make this country carbon neutral and to take the opportunities to move this country on, while enhancing economic opportunities for young people.  I would appreciate the Minister's views on that report and her sense of where we are at present with regard to developing that new deal for this generation to make sure this massive cohort of young people who find themselves jobless have hope for the future.  The Minister knows only too well they do not have the opportunity to get on a boat or an aeroplane to go to the UK, Australia, Canada or the US, as was the case in the previous recession.  We need to provide opportunities here for our younger people in a sustainable fashion.</p> <p> I thank the Minister for her clarity around the request from Safe Ireland.  We have all received correspondence in recent weeks from organisations represented by Safe Ireland, including from the Drogheda Women's and Children's Refuge in my own home town and from Women's Aid in Dundalk.  I thank the Minister for the update on that.</p> <p> I join colleagues in remarking about my own concerns that those aged over 66 and those aged under 18 are essentially being left behind by this system that was introduced, as the Minister has pointed out time and again, literally in the space of a few hours to try to deal with a very serious issue for this country.  I understand what the Minister is saying in regard to the working age payments.  I have a huge concern about those aged over 66 and a particular concern about those aged under 18.  I have received a lot of correspondence and many telephone calls from people in my constituency, such as early school leavers who left school at 15 and 16 and trained to work in the hospitality sector but who find themselves with nothing at all.</p> <p> There is a further big issue at the moment, and while I do not have the solution, it is important this is raised.  We have a significant cohort of people who would have expected to start seasonal work, some in my own area who would normally work in seasonal employment in the Minister's constituency, for example, at Tayto Park, which is a big employer of people from the Louth and Meath area, but who will not be taking up employment and will find themselves in difficulty as a result.  We expect to see a spike in jobseeker's payments over the next period because people who might ordinarily go on to seasonal work will now be going onto jobseeker's payments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.407" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="" time="19:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000069#YYY00100"><p>I will answer the question on the Duffy Cahill report and write to the Deputy on the other issues.  The Deputy is aware the Duffy Cahill report was sent to the Company Law Review Group in 2016 for its consideration, as that group was advising the Minister with responsibility for business.  All of the responsibilities associated with this particular issue were then with that Department.  They are in mine now.  The Company Law Review Group is a statutory body comprising regulatory, legal, business and employee interests.  As part of its deliberations, it considered the related amendments that were proposed by Deputy Nash in the Companies (Accounting) Bill published in April 2017.  Its report on the protection of employees and unsecured creditors was presented to the then Minister in 2017 and published on the group's website.  Unfortunately, it did not include the implementation of the Duffy Cahill report because the group said it gave rise to a host of complex issues and that any proposal to progress them would require further and careful consideration.  We need to have that further and careful consideration starting right now.  With respect, I can start that in the Department but I will leave it up to the Deputy to make sure it is continued by whomever takes over from me.  It really is pertinent.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentions the very obvious elephant in our room.  Many companies will not necessarily reopen or will not reopen in the same way as before 13 March.  We need to make sure that we protect the assets and employees of those companies and do right by them.  This is definitely a good start.  I will write to the Deputy on the other matters.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.408" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1560" speakername="Gary Gannon" time="19:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000069#YYY00200"><p>I will make a brief opening statement and then ask questions and I might get the answers one after another if possible.  There was much to admire in the Department's response to the Covid-19 crisis.  It was swift and I cannot imagine the amount of work the officials and staff throughout the country engaged in.  We really do owe them a debt of gratitude as we do to the Minister.  She is the only Minister who has picked up the phone to me and let me know what is happening.  I had to chase everyone else.  I thank her for that.</p>  <p>  The &euro;350 being given to people experiencing unemployment during the crisis has meant they can live with dignity.  It has afforded comfort to families.  If it was not available, we would certainly be in a much worse situation than we have been to date.</p>  <p>  The rapidity with which the measures were introduced has caused some very large omissions in terms of who is being left out of the scheme.  We have spoken about them substantially over the past hour.  I will raise some of them again and ask for further information.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to give me further clarity on some of these questions.</p>  <p>  The exclusion of women returning to work from the temporary wage subsidy scheme is not specifically related to the Minister's Department but she did mention the scheme in her opening address.  It is a very important issue.  I have asked parliamentary questions on this omission from the scheme of women returning to work.  One of the sentences included in each response has me a little worried.  The explanation of the conditions included in the legislation which have allowed the exclusion is that it was specifically designed with a view to preventing abuse of the scheme.  I am concerned that, so obsessed were we with the fear that some would choose to cheat the system, we locked in conditions that ultimately caused terrible discrimination to happen.  While this was not done purposely, it is an anomaly and a lacuna in the law.  Perhaps this has happened as a consequence of the fact we are fearful, as the Department often seems to be, that some would cheat and so we create conditions that are unfair.</p>  <p>  Another issue on which perhaps the Minister will be able to comment is the fact that the Minister for Finance has already acted and changed the scheme on a number of occasions.  He added the temporary weekly subsidy and increased it from 70% to 80%.  He made this change pending legislative amendment.  Why can we not do this now to bring women who were excluded into the scheme?</p></speech>

What I do know is that it was not done intentionally.  It is wrong, we need to fix it and we are going to fix it.  I do not know how we are going to fix it.  From the outside, we sometimes think these things are obvious and should be easy to fix but it turns out that they are not.  Regardless of how it is to be done, the problem has to be fixed and it will be this week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.410" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1560" speakername="Gary Gannon" time="19:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000069#YYY00400"><p>I will not ask the Minister to comment on this but we need to consider who is in the room when these decisions are made.  If trade union representatives were in the room, these gaps in the provisions, which exclude people, could be identified earlier.</p> <p>If we are going to be making further amendments, we probably need to widen the process of who is being included in the considerations.  There is the issue of the Debenhams workers.  When I think about this crisis, one of the images that will stick with me forever, which the Minister has already highlighted, is the Debenhams workers standing outside their employment trying to protest in a safe, socially distant manner, and being moved on.</p> <p> It was really unfortunate, but what has left a very bad taste in my mouth is the fact that we did make considerations when we altered the scheme.  We made consideration of the fact that employees would not be able to access the redundancy processes if they so needed.  That was enacted in the scheme in early March.  I read that in the scheme, it grabbed my attention but I did not expect that within a short couple of weeks a major employer would enter a liquidation process in 11 stores throughout the country, affecting people who have worked in Debenhams for 40 years.  I know some people worked in the store in Henry Street in my own constituency from when it was Roches Stores.  I never considered when we were passing that legislation that we were creating a law that protected the employer and the capital but made no consideration of the employee.  Is that something we can rectify very quickly in respect of these other large employers that are threatening liquidation?  Is it something we can amend to ensure that the next wave of workers who are at risk will not be impacted in much the same way as the callous manner in which Debenhams has behaved?  I particularly want to reference the fact that Debenhams has offset its assets over to Debenhams UK, meaning that the State, which is going to be liable for the redundancy payments, is going to be at a significant loss, although we rightly have to pay the workers.  Those assets include the leases to some of these premises, which are substantial assets.  What can we do in the immediate term?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.412" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="" time="20:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000070#ZZZ00200"><p>I do not think the two things are the same, even though they sound similar.  When this House passed the legislation that suspended the right of an employee to apply for redundancy once they had been furloughed for longer than four weeks, we knew that it was not a real furlough.  We knew everybody was going to be off work for longer than four weeks because we had closed down the country for the good of all of our public health.  It was not that we were taking away the right; we were just suspending it.  If people need to claim it and they cannot do so until August, it will be backdated to when they really should have been made redundant.  It was just to try to protect their jobs.  It was not to pick one side over the other.  However, the Deputy is right.  That was done and it might even need to be extended because it runs out in the next couple of weeks and we do not know how quickly we are going to get to phase 5.  We do need to start looking at making sure the State as well as employees are protected in any liquidation or insolvency.  Forewarned is forearmed and, based on what we have learned in the past couple of weeks, we can certainly make sure that it does not happen to the State or employees again.</p>  <p>  I will say again, as the Deputy has said, and this is not to be critical of anybody, it really bothered me that men and women were standing outside their shops in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Dublin and they were not allowed just to quietly protest their disgust at how they had been treated after years of service, just to establish their right to be treated with respect and dignity.  I think we did them a disservice by treating them a second time the way they were treated on their protest.</p></speech>

I am interested in the sort of data we are collecting and collating at the moment and how we are going to apply the data.  I have seen some statistics from the Office for National Statistics in the UK and they are really grim.  They concern the occupations with the highest death rates linked to Covid-19 and, as one would imagine, the lower income workers in low-skilled, elementary occupations such as care and leisure and other services, and process, plant and machine operatives, are most impacted by the Covid crisis.  When we are talking about extending the payments or even removing payments, do we have similar data on the type of employees who are being impacted by the Covid-19 epidemic?  Can we use this to target particular employees?  Once the Covid payment stops, maybe we can pick particular employment groups or employees to whom we can extend the payment.  I am thinking of retail workers.  When we are opening up our retail sector, for example, if we have clusters a couple of months from now and somebody loses their employment because they have to withdraw themselves, they should not have to go back onto the &euro;203 which we have already accepted is not enough to live on.  Are we collating data and can we better use it to target employees?</p></speech>

I hope to God we are not; I do not know whether we are.  From our perspective in my Department, we did a bit of research with the Central Bank a number of weeks ago which I published last Wednesday week.  I will send a copy of it to the Deputy this afternoon.  It looks at all of the people on the pandemic payment, the industries they have come from and the relative vulnerability of those industries that are due to go back in phases 2 to 5.</p> <p>We know that in many cases people will not go back to companies that are in the same shape or size.  Some people might not go back to work until long after phase 5.  I will get all of that data for Deputy Gannon.  The reason for having the data is to allow us to plan and prepare for a major programme of activation, training, education, reskilling and redeployment.  While many industries are losing jobs, in a number of industries thousands of jobs are available but we do not have the people to fill them.  We will try to encourage recruitment and training to move people from jobs that may no longer exist into the new economy, the new green economy and the new caring economy.  There will a new way of doing different things.  There will, for example, be a whole new economy developing around home working, which we may not have anticipated happening as fast as it has done.</p></speech>

Some 23,000 artists and freelance technicians who make their work in the arts will not be able to return to work any time soon because their jobs require crowds, which present a danger.  They will not be unemployed, however.  Is it possible to have a particular pandemic payment for artists or to extend the pandemic payment to our artistic community, upon whom we rely so much?  The arts will probably be the last sector to return to work.  Has the Minister considered that possibility?</p></speech>

Thankfully this House introduced jobseeker's benefit for the self-employed only last November.  It did not exist previously and it would have cut out a large cohort of people from the pandemic payment otherwise.  There is a jobseeker's payment for artists that allows them to continue to try to ply their trade and make money from it without having to be fully available to be employed in another sector.  The Minister, Deputy Madigan, and I are examining whether we can expand that.</p></speech>

I have seen the correspondence between the Minister and Mandate, as I am sure many Members have.  I will pick up on Mandate's last letter in which it notes that when the legislation was amended in 2007 no legislator sought to amend the particular aspects of the Act relating to the responsibility of the liquidator.  It also refers a European Court of Justice ruling that provided that the obligation to engage still applies even where a company has been wound up by a court.  That obligation, in this case, falls to the liquidator.</p>  <p>  In this case, the liquidator has even more responsibility and an even greater obligation.  The liquidator, KPMG, is in receipt of lucrative Government contracts.  It received more that &euro;25 million for advice on the broadband scheme, and look where that left us.  It consistently receives millions of euro from all Departments.  It is not acceptable for KPMG to walk away from its responsibility.  I would like the Minister to comment on that and to do her best, given the level of sympathy and admiration she has for the workers, to pursue this issue with vigour and urgency.  There will be more workers like the Debenhams workers coming after them.</p>  <p>  My second question is on maternity leave.  Rather than banging on about the shocking injustice and discrimination imposed on people who are on maternity leave through the denial of the wage subsidy scheme, I ask the Minister to consider extending the period of maternity leave and benefit for all of those who are currently on maternity leave, in the same way that we extended the time for planning applications and suspended aspects of legislation such as the Redundancy Payments Act.  We have made exceptions in lots of areas of legislation and in the application of the State's rules.  I ask this on behalf of the tens of thousands of women who have signed the online petition on this issue and are fearful of going back to work or being forced back to work and who do not have access to the wage subsidy scheme.  Must they leave their children behind when there is no childcare available?  I ask the Minister to extend maternity leave and benefit for the duration of the crisis in the same way the Government is extending the courtesy to other areas of society.</p>  <p>  My final question is on direct provision.  Will the Minister explain in detail, if she can, why the pandemic unemployment payment was denied to workers living in direct provision who lost their jobs in this crisis, as did many other hundreds of thousands of people, and have not been able to carry out any economic activity?  More than 1,200 residents of direct provision centres have work.  They include between 400 and 500 people who work in our health services to whom the issue of access to the pandemic unemployment payment obviously does not apply.  The Department's website states that the pandemic unemployment payment is available to all employees and self-employed who have lost their employment due to a downturn in economic activity caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.  The website does not state, however, that this does not apply to those in direct provision.  Why do we always make an exception for residents in the direct provision service?  Doing so shows that the State's history in this regard is one of abuse of those who live in that service.</p> <p>We saw much of that today with the Minister for Justice and Equality and his apologies, and the lack of same.  The statement says their accommodation and basic needs are covered but if somebody has a job, he or she may have invested in a car, sent his or her children to certain schools, taken out loans and so on.  Now these people are suffering a reduction of &euro;311 per week.  They get the direct provision payment but not the PUP.  Will the Minister please explain why?</p></speech>

The union cites European law that gives the Minister the power to do so, but even leaving legal powers aside, there is nothing to prevent her bringing to bear political and moral pressure for the extension of the period of consultation.  She should do so and not offer mealy-mouthed excuses in the House to those workers.  I have to hand a copy of the redundancy notice that issued to the workers today.  What a scandalous document.  It cites minimum payment, statutory redundancy and payment of two weeks' wages per year of service for workers who have given a lifetime of service.  Did the Minister know that in nine of the 11 stores, there are staff who go back to the Roches Stores days - 14 years and more?  There is a worker in one of the shops in Cork who is heading towards 50 years' service.  Contrast that with the treatment of the former chief executive officer of Debenhams UK, Mr. Sergio Bucher, who last year, when he left the company, was given a golden handshake of &pound;700,000 sterling.</p>  <p>  This is an injustice also to the taxpayer because Debenhams UK is asset-stripping the operation.  It is asset-stripping the online business, the valuable leases and the stock.  It is leaving behind nothing but debt.  This is Clerys mark 2.  It will cost the taxpayer and the Minister's Department &euro;25 million at a minimum.  All the while, there are 1.239 million items of stock in those 11 stores.  It is stock that is listed in the Irish accounts, never in the UK accounts, yet the UK parent company is trying to make a grab for it.  It is stock that, if it realised &euro;20 per item, a conservative estimate, would raise &euro;25 million, which could and should be used to save jobs in this country or, at the very least, to provide a decent redundancy package for the workers.  This is an asset-stripping scandal.</p>  <p>  The time has come for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to speak and to act on this issue.  Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies spoke on the issue earlier, as in previous weeks they have offered sympathy to the workers.  That sympathy has been welcomed by the workers but they know, as does Fianna F&aacute;il know, that the time has passed for words of sympathy.  The time has come to act and Fianna F&aacute;il is in a position to act.  It is involved in a negotiation for government at the moment.  It could bang the table and insist and demand that the State intervene.  That could and should be done by Fianna F&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  The workers have balloted and 97% have voted for industrial action.  They will picket to prevent stock being moved.  The Minister's Department should actively support the workers in that stance because that would defend the interest of the taxpayer, with that &euro;25 million at stake.</p>  <p>  I return to my original point and ask the Minister to respond.  Mandate Trade Union and almost 2,000 workers are asking the Minister to act.  </p> <p>They are citing European law as a justification for it.  Even leaving legal powers aside, I ask the Minister to outline anything that prevents her from applying political and moral pressure to state that this period of consultation must be extended to ensure the money that is there with that stock is used to save jobs.  If it is not used to save jobs, then it should at the very least be used to provide decent severance packages for these workers, who deserve it.  The Minister should get off the fence.  What is she prepared to do?</p></speech>

That is not to be inflammatory, I am simply outlining the law.  We have a maintain once principle in the State that we only look after people once and we do not look after them twice.

The Acting Chairman will know of my involvement with that issue.  He was the Aire St&aacute;it in the Department when I was first elected to the House.  I raised this issue, which affects thousands of women throughout the country, with nine different Ministers for social welfare and Regina Doherty was the first who took on and addressed it.  The issue mainly affected women but sometimes men were also impacted upon.  These people had minimal State pensions and they now have dramatically improved State pensions as a result of the Minister's efforts so I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge that.</p>  <p>  As the Minister knows, I have now taken up the issue of the denial of the Covid-19 PUP to people over the age of 66 who are either working full-time or part-time.  I want to restate that this is totally unacceptable.  Anybody who is working and has lost his or her job should, regardless of age, be entitled to this payment.  These were the very people who were leading by example in the Government policy of pushing up the retirement age and they are the first people who are sacrificed when it comes to welfare support.  Is this fair?  If one is over the age of 66 and not in receipt of a State pension, should one be eligible for the Covid-19 PUP?  Those in employment over the age of 66 have additional outlays based on their income to date, such as mortgages, loan repayments, etc., in a similar manner to other people under the age of 66 with families.  This cost is not being recognised, however.  Why is that the case?  Families with children where the only income earner is over 66 years of age are losing out as a result of this policy.  What specific provisions are being put in place in these instances to prevent children from suffering additional financial hardship?</p> <p>The only movement on this issue to date has been the assurance I was given that those over the age of 66 who, as a result of Covid-19, were experiencing financial hardship could look for the supplementary welfare allowance.  The community welfare officers were cognisant of this group of people.  I have referred a number of people with significant financial commitments and others with young families to the scheme and all have come back to say they do not meet the criteria for the supplementary welfare allowance.  Will the Minister comment on this group of workers, who have been denied the pandemic unemployment payment?  Will she provide me with the number in this category who have received some financial support from their local community welfare officer?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.435" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="" time="20:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000074#DDDD00200"><p>I believe I mentioned earlier that, under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, people who are entitled to receive employment or unemployment benefits are stipulated to be between the ages of 18 and 66, the pensionable age.  On becoming 66, a person becomes pensionable and receives his or her payment.  On the first question the Deputy asked me, if somebody is not in receipt of a pension, he or she should apply for one.  There were cases of people in receipt of payments less than the full contributory pension who have lost their income in recent weeks.  We have reviewed the cases and given them a full non-contributory pension.  There is only a &euro;5 difference between that and a full contributory pension.  Absolutely anybody else who has outgoings in excess of the income deemed necessary for him or her to live is being looked after by the supplementary welfare scheme.  We changed the means test conditions at the beginning of our issuing of the pandemic unemployment payment to take this matter into account.  Normally, it is a question of allowing people to leave alone means in the bank and allowing them, just based on their income, to be helped by the State regarding their outgoings.  The Deputy mentioned he has a number of constituents whom he believes have applied but who have not been helped.  If he wants to give the names to me, I can certainly examine the cases but our doors are open.  Our community welfare officers have all been instructed to help as many people as they can in as many ways as they can.  Many of our schemes, including the one-parent family scheme, have changed.  We have tried to be accommodating.  We have not quite thrown out all the rules but we have been as flexible as possible to ensure we leave nobody behind regarding income supports.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.436" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="20:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000074#DDDD00300"><p>Does the Government realise the HSE's contact tracing system is just not working?  While the HSE is trying to bamboozle us with its mean and median figures for positive and negative test results and figures for the performing of tests and contract tracing, giving eight different figures, the reality is that the disclosure of medical results to employers rather than employees was, I believe, to cover up the fact that the contact tracing system is just not working.  I made this point in the House to the Minister for Health last Thursday.  From my limited data, for about 2% of people tested, there are no test results.  It is taking the HSE three weeks to inform people of the fact that their samples have been either damaged or lost, or that it has not been possible to read them.  There are many instances in which people in receipt of the Covid-19 illness benefit for the maximum two weeks pending a Covid-19 test result have had to seek an extension of the payment because the results were not back or because they had to be retested.  Will the Minister indicate how many have sought that extension?</p>  <p>  Second, claimants who are asymptomatic Covid-19 positive, that is, those who are showing no sign of infection, are eligible to receive the Covid-19 illness benefit payment for up to 14 days.  How many of these specific claimants are in payment for less than two weeks?  The reason they are in payment for less than two weeks is that screening in the nursing homes and meat plants involved a wait of five to seven days, or 13 in one instance, before the communication of a result.  The Minister might wonder why I am asking her this specific question.  The reason is that, in the case of the person who had to wait 13 days for a positive result and who worked in a large nursing home in the east of the country, they had to self-isolate for one day before returning to work.  Amazingly, the HSE still has no plan to retest the residents or employees in the nursing home in question.</p> <p>How can we eradicate the Covid-19 illness benefit payments when such actions are being taken by the HSE?</p></speech>

I am very glad I have no responsibility for the public health response or the contract tracing.  The witnesses who were here yesterday are the people to whom the Deputy probably should have addressed those questions.</p>  <p>  Regarding the payments, there does not need to be an extension because the law allows people to self-isolate for two periods of two weeks, which is a total of four weeks.  They do not need to apply for extensions; they just need to keep giving us the certs.  As for people who are asymptomatic, for as long as they are isolating, as long as their GPs send in the certs with the category "unfit for work due to Covid" marked, we will continue to look after them.  There is no limit on the length of time somebody can be sick with Covid because, as we know, different people recover in different ways and the virus affects some people very mildly and some people, unfortunately, not so mildly.  There is therefore no cut-off time for keeping people on the payment.  What I will do, and what might be interesting, is to get the Deputy the data on the people and the numbers of people who have applied for illness benefit because of self-isolation and those who have applied because they are actually not well.</p></speech>

Covid-19 could have very serious health implications for them if they are infected by it.  The advice we were given at briefings in the Department of An Taoiseach a number of weeks ago was that these people would be considered for the Covid-19 illness benefit payment, but on the website and in written communication from her Department I have been told this is not the case.  Can I have clarity on that?</p></speech>

However, somebody who is vulnerable obviously does not stop being vulnerable after the two weeks, so then such people are entitled to apply for the Covid PUP as long as they make a declaration that their income has fallen away.  They can be maintained as employees, but as long as the company is no longer paying them they can apply for the Covid payment and stay on it for as long as it is in place.  Again, the Deputy sounds like he has somebody in mind.  If he does, I would be happy to take the details from him.</p></speech>

I know they have been touched on before, but on behalf of my constituents and people who have contacted me I wish to ask the Minister to strongly support the call for maternity leave to be extended.  I raised this earlier with another Minister.  Maternity leave should be extended for mothers at this time.  It is a matter that has been raised by many representatives.  There is a massive signature campaign going on, with more than 20,000 signatures collected so far.  The call of people who have had babies during this pandemic to have the length of leave extended is a very fair, reasonable and sensible suggestion to make.</p>  <p>  Another issue about which I and others have contacted the Minister is the extension of the Covid payment to seasonal workers.  She knows that in the county I come from we have a massive number of people working in the tourism industry.  If this crisis had struck a month or six weeks later, an awful lot of people who are debarred from qualifying would have qualified, and it is most unfortunate that they find themselves at home.  They do not have work but, because of the nature of their work in restaurants and bars and the hospitality sector, they had not worked on 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 March and they lost out.  That is most unfortunate.</p>  <p>  The other group I wish to talk about are people who are over 66 and who are on a pension.  They might have owned a small country bar or some other type of small business.</p> <p>These people were getting their pensions and supplementing their livelihoods with the little amount of money they earned from their small businesses.  Those businesses are now gone.  The people in question are not coming to me saying that they want &euro;350 per week on top of their pensions.  However, if they are on a pension of &euro;220 or &euro;240 or &euro;230 per week, they want to know whether the Minister could not look at giving them an increment to take them up to &euro;350 and put them on the same level as everyone else.  They would be grateful for that.  The number of people who have asked me about that is striking.  They have stated that they are not looking for &euro;350 on top of their pensions but they are looking to get to &euro;350 in total.  That would compensate them in some small way for losing their businesses.  I have one couple in particular in my mind.  They have been loyal servants behind the counter of a local bar in County Kerry for many years.  That bar is now shut.  They were offering a great service to their community.  The business is now gone and they are left with only their pensions.  They are finding it really difficult to manage.</p> <p> I have no wish to eat into the Minister's time - I want to allow here to respond - but the matter of the Debenhams workers has rightly been raised already.  I stood with those people this week in Tralee.  They really are being blackguarded and treated most unfairly.  I would like to see the Minister supporting them, as I know she would.  I am grateful to her in advance for saying that she supports them.</p></speech>

Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Uasal Doherty as an s&aacute;robair a rinne s&iacute;.  I also want to acknowledge the hardworking staff in the Department who have managed to process thousands of applications in a short period.  Their work needs to be acknowledged here as well.</p>  <p>  I recently raised the issue of carers who have sought access to the PUP.  I am glad to say that a family carer who works fewer than 18.5 hours per week but who loses her job is now entitled to receive the Covid-19 payment and keep the carer's allowance.</p>  <p>  I want to raise the issue of employment activation measures.  I raised it on several occasions in the lifetime of the previous D&aacute;il.  As we know, there has been serious disagreement in the House between the Government and Opposition about the effectiveness and value for money of the existing JobPath programmes and especially the role played by Turas Nua and Seetec.  We know from the latest data that 226,851 people have been referred to the JobPath service but that only 14,617 held down jobs for over a year.  The latest figures show that in the four years the scheme has been operational, the Government has spent over &euro;182 million on it.  The two private companies, Turas Nua and Seetec, have received &euro;75.7 million and &euro;73.3 million, respectively.  I recently tabled a parliamentary question on the matter.  The reply indicated that the Department is currently reviewing all contracted public employment services.  This review is being undertaken with the aim of designing and introducing a comprehensive model that is fit for purpose for the Irish labour market from 2021 onwards.  Are we to take it that referrals to Turas Nua will continue for the rest of this year?  It is my sincere hope that a different and more client-friendly approach is rolled out in future.  The number and character of the complaints around the nature of the service provided by Turas Nua are too consistent in the sense that those who have been made to attend regularly feel belittled or patronised by the service.  I have received a large volume of complaints at my offices in the recent past on this issue.</p>  <p>  Another issue arises with community employment, CE, schemes.  I want to ask about the report on the future of CE schemes.  It is my understanding that the report has been published.  When will it be made available?  Recently, I met a group of CE scheme supervisors.  That question was asked.  In addition, I am keen to ask about the pension scheme for CE supervisors as per the Labour Court ruling.  I imagine the Minister has heard this over and over but I will reiterate it because it is of serious concern to the supervisors and I am keen for some clarity on the matter as well.</p></speech>

I have said it is not within my remit but I will certainly bring people's concerns to the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p> <p> There was mention of seasonal workers and those who are over the age of 66.  With respect, the position with those over 66 arises because the current legislation in which the pandemic unemployment payment is enshrined relates to people within the social insurance system aged 18 to 66.  If any changes must be made, this House will make them.  Unfortunately, I was only guided by the current law of the land.  It is fair to say the Deputy knows how quickly the pandemic unemployment payment was established because of need but there was never an intention to exclude people.  This is why we have been adamant that those who are over 66 would be included in the wage subsidy scheme.  I feel for the two people mentioned by the Deputy but I have had hundreds of people in similar circumstances coming to me.  It was important to include them in the wage subsidy scheme but it was equally important to ensure anybody who was not able to go into that would have available the newly reduced means test criteria of the supplementary welfare scheme.  Some of the self-employed people could keep on their workers with the temporary wage subsidy scheme but not themselves, for example.</p> <p> I genuinely hope these efforts are working.  I have heard stories and some people over 66 have relatively young children in school or college and they must pay fees, for example.  It is not just as simple as thinking that a person gets to 66 and he or she has no outgoings any more and will be grand with a pension.  Anybody on a reduced pension should definitely apply for a non-contributory pension and if such people have no other income, they will get the full amount.  It is one of the issues that has pained me most in the past couple of weeks.  Much of what we have got right has been really good and it has had an impact.  If there was any way I could have included people over 66 in the employment legislation, I would have done so.  It was just not possible.</p> <p> I might give the Deputy a copy of the letters that have gone back and forth between me and the Mandate union with respect to the Debenhams workers.  They clearly explain the legal advice that the Attorney General gave me yesterday and which precludes me from interfering at this stage of the process.  I put on the record of the House that we have been engaged with workers.  We did a Zoom activation meeting with over 200 workers just over a week ago, which was probably the oddest experience for everybody involved.  Most of the people found it very helpful and we got some lovely emails afterwards.  We will work with those people to ensure they are retrained, re-energised and re-employed by somebody else.  We will ensure they get their entitlement and the State will step in if necessary.  Carers were always entitled to the pandemic unemployment payment and we ensured that anybody working those 18.5 hours or less was as entitled as anybody else to apply for it.</p> <p> There was mention of the activation job we will have over the next couple of months.  I probably will not be the person making the policy on how we activate people who will not go back to work.  I can only give some solace in saying that JobPath only looks after people who are on the live register longer than 12 months.  We hope that anybody who has lost a job or will lose a job in the next couple of weeks can be retrained and worked with in a period far shorter than 12 months.  Those decisions will be made during the formation of the next Government and included in the programme for Government.  That will not include me.</p> <p> The report referred to by Deputy Nolan has been published and I am surprised people have not got a copy of it.  I will make sure the Deputy gets a copy today.  It is just over a year since I first met community employment supervisors in an attempt to fix that matter.  Unfortunately, I was not successful in doing that but I very much hope that whoever is lucky enough to be in my position in the next Government will be successful in the matter and give them what they deserve.</p></speech>

The scheme was set up for income lost but not forgone income.  It would be incredibly difficult to figure out who was or was not going to get a job.  That is not to say the social welfare code does not look after those people.  They are all entitled to apply for jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance.</p></speech>

I wish the Minister the best of luck in whatever path she takes and I also pay tribute to the staff in the Department.  They have worked incredibly hard and it is important we place that on record.</p>  <p>  The Minister dealt with the maternity leave extension and it is something that also concerns me, along with the position of people over 66.  I will not repeat those points and the Minister has clearly set out where the difficulty lies.  I will zone in on something with which the Minister may be able to help, the plight of foreign language students.  There are approximately 1,000 of these students from a range of countries, with Brazil being the nationality of the highest number of these students.  Approximately 66% are from Brazil and a number are from Mexico.  They found themselves in a terrible position, as they have paid money for courses that will not go ahead and they have not got back that money.  There was also a question as to whether they were entitled to a social welfare allowance.</p> <p>They did not seem to be as a result of the habitual residence requirement.  As to those entitled to the special needs payment, it is a one-off payment and there is no appeal mechanism.  While it is good that community welfare officers are entitled to exercise their discretion, there is no consistency.  We asked for a task force to be established and I understand that a working group has been set up, with the Minister's Department a part of it.  Will the Minister clarify what has been learned, what the extent of the problem is and what numbers are getting what payments?</p></speech>

In the absence of a PPS number, we have been giving people the supplementary welfare allowance, a weekly payment equivalent to what they require to meet their needs.  The task force is working, but I am not aware of anyone who is not receiving a payment from us in some shape or form.  That is, unless people have not presented themselves to us yet.  If the Deputy knows of someone who is not getting the money, give me the details and I will look after him or her.</p>  <p>  Our aim was to leave no one behind.  If someone did not have a PPS number, we would get him or her one.  If someone did not want to get a PPS number, we would get him or her the supplementary welfare allowance, which did not require a PPS number.</p></speech>

I understood that there was no clarity regarding the supplementary welfare allowance.  There is clarity regarding the special needs payment, but that is a one-off payment and there is no appeals process.  If the Minister is telling me that the language students qualify for the supplementary welfare allowance, it is positive and welcome news.  Perhaps she could give me that in writing, as it was not clear when I raised the matter a few weeks ago in the D&aacute;il.  As the Minister might imagine, the students are quite desperate and facing language difficulties.  They formed a group, though, and have been telling us about the difficulties on the ground.  I would appreciate it if I could get what the Minister mentioned in writing.</p>  <p>  If there is spare time, I will leave it to my colleague.</p></speech>

I also thank her, her officials and all the relevant staff throughout the country for working unstintingly and showing great commitment to ensuring that people get their payments.  Nothing is perfect, but from what I have seen, this has been first class.</p>  <p>  I have not been in the Chamber because, in asking questions of a number of Ministers, I have been conscious of time.  However, I have been listening to everything and am aware of the Minister's responses.  When speaking about victims of domestic violence not being able to access the emergency rent supplement, she went on to state that she had formulated a new response in recent days.  Would it be possible to provide any detail on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.458" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="" time="21:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000078#HHHH01000"><p>The response that was formulated was driven by the Departments of Justice and Equality and Children and Youth Affairs, which are responsible for providing for the needs in question.  Safe Ireland and the National Women's Council approached us in recent weeks to say that the supplement had not been working exactly how they had envisaged.  They asked whether we could be the direct referral body and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could be an authorised referrer.  We have considered the matter for the past couple of days and looked at how we were dealing with people.  People are entitled to make applications for rent supplement for themselves.  They have been doing so.  In fact, we have been providing emergency accommodation in bed and breakfasts for people until we get them their rent supplement.</p>  <p>  I believe that the principal officer reverted to Safe Ireland today to indicate that the referrer could be the lady or gentlemen herself or himself.  The Garda can refer to us, as can Tusla.  We do not want to step on anyone's toes.  Tusla and the local authorities are the established agencies to provide the people in question long-term resources and security, but we are not going to turn anyone away.  Our rent supplement application form has been reduced from 28 pages to four.  We are dealing with those people sensitively, compassionately and more quickly than we would with someone else.  That is not to say that we are not dealing with everyone else quickly.  We are, but the Deputy knows what I mean.</p></speech>

However, a sole trader or the self employed can access neither payment.  The Minister did say that those people can access the supplementary welfare scheme.  My question is if they do that will that bring them up to the same level as the PUP?</p> <p> The issue of Debenhams has been raised here.  I agree with the Minister's remarks regarding the protests etc..  The Minister mentioned that the 1975 legislation is quite old.  I refer her to the 1998 European legislation which is, in the main, about consultation etc. but it does state that "nothing in the legislation prevents a member state from ensuring more favourable terms for workers" etc..  I know it cannot be retrospective but in the context that, probably, we will see more of this, I ask that the Department takes a look at that.  It appears that Debenhams has blind-sided the Department to some extent.  I do not attach any blame in that regard but we must ensure it does not happen again.</p> <p> In regard to Brexit, many UK firms will not consider themselves bound by EU legislation or, at best, it will be a contested reality.  Again, I think we need to keep this in mind when considering updating our legislation.</p> <p> I have met a number of people who have no concept of the fact that the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and all social welfare payments and income is taxable and that come the end of the year many people will be pursued by Revenue for tax that is owed.  So many people have no concept of this.  A public awareness campaign is needed immediately because we are going to be hearing terrible stories at the end of the year about this.  This is not the fault of the Minister, Regina Doherty, but so many people are unaware of this.</p></speech>

Rather, it looks at individual outgoings.  For example, the Deputy's household might be different to my household if we were both over 66.  We are looking at people as individuals, taking account of their outgoings and whether they are necessary.  For example, we might pay for somebody's mortgage or rent but not for a large car.  We are looking at people as individuals.</p>  <p>  I will provide copies of the letters to and from Mandate, which clearly show the legal advice I got from the Attorney General.  The Deputy is correct - I said this earlier on - that we need to convene to examine what we should have learned and can learn from the interactions and the swiftness of Debenham's such that we are prepared if and when it does happen again.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy is also correct that all income is taxable.  This will require people to do a self declaration at the end of the year.  The reason I have not done an advertising campaign is that we have done a great deal over the last couple of weeks, not least our efforts to try to keep the radios and newspapers with a little revenue coming into them.  I do not know how the Revenue Commissions are going to deal with this.  It depends on whether they deal with it on a week one, month one basis.  That will determine how we let people their entitlements or obligations.  As soon as the Revenue Commissions make up their minds the Department will do an advertising campaign.</p></speech>

I am happy to be in the House again to provide a further update on our work programme.  I want to focus on three particular areas, namely, the leaving certificate and preparations for the calculated grades system, the planning under way for reopening the education and training sector, particularly schools, and the delivery of educational provision to students with special educational needs during the summer period.</p>  <p>  I announced on 8 May that all students are to be offered the option of receiving calculated grades for the subjects they are studying and the alternative of sitting the 2020 leaving certificate examinations at a date in the future when it is considered safe to hold them.  I updated the House last week on developments in that regard.  There has been significant work undertaken within my Department, working in close collaboration with education partners, and the executive office approved by the Government to operate the calculated grades system has been established.  A number of staff from the State Examinations Commission with relevant expertise have already been seconded to my Department and further secondments are expected as the calculated grades system becomes operational.</p>  <p>  I am delighted to announce in the Chamber that Dr. &Aacute;ine Lawlor, former director of the Teaching Council, has agreed to chair the independent steering committee on calculated grades.  The committee will oversee the process of implementation of calculated grades from the perspective of quality assurance and integrity.  We are continuing to work with stakeholders on the key issues, including through the advisory group on State examinations.  That group met last week and will meet again this Friday, and its members have continued to engage with my Department between meetings.  This collaboration and intense work, including by my officials, has meant that the detailed guidance material will issue to schools tomorrow.  I am very conscious of the importance of this guide for schools, teachers, principals, parents and students to provide certainty and clarity.  Over the past number of days, through engagement and discussions with all involved, we have made significant progress on finalising this guidance material and issuing it as a priority.</p>  <p>  I again acknowledge the contribution the members of the advisory group and all the educational stakeholders have made to the process so far.  The group remains in place and will continue to meet as we bring forward the school component of the calculated grades model.  I have today answered a range of written parliamentary questions about how different aspects of the calculated grades system will operate.  The detailed guidance to teachers and principals addresses many of the detailed aspects of how a teacher will determine an estimated mark in a particular subject.</p>  <p>  There is one issue, which has come up in a lot of the questions, on which it is important to be clear.  The guidance makes it clear that the estimated mark is not based on a student's performance in any mock examination undertaken in his or her school or on his or her junior cycle results.  The estimated mark is informed by a teacher's professional judgment and available evidence can be used to support the estimation of a mark.  Once a teacher has completed the stage of establishing an estimated mark for each student, those marks will then be considered as part of a school alignment process.  It is vitally important that teachers' professional judgment, the in-school process and the application of a national standard all work together to provide each student with a result that is fair and equitable.</p>  <p>  Since I last addressed the House, we have moved into phase 1 of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business.  In the education sector, this means that schools and other educational buildings can open for access by teachers for the organisation and distribution of remote learning.  These are welcome developments and reflect the progress we have been making as a society in suppressing the virus.  The Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business envisages commencement of a reopening of schools and educational institutions from the beginning of the next academic year in September.  Planning in this regard is now under way in consultation with stakeholders and having regard to the experience of other countries.</p>  <p>  Managing the reopening of our education system is a massive logistical operation that needs to be carefully planned and managed.  Given the diversity in school and education settings, one size fits all will not apply.</p> <p>We are talking about a system with more than 1 million learners and facilities ranging from small schools to multi-campus higher education institutions.  Schools and other education institutions are also workplaces for more than 110,000 people, and the national return to work safely protocol has to be a factor in our future planning.  The key to a safe and continued return to work requires strong communication and a shared collaborative approach between employers and workers.  Schools will require clear guidance and early clarity on key issues so they can start planning at a local level.</p> <p> In planning for the reopening of schools, the Department's approach to managing the public health aspects of the reopening and operation of schools will be based on ongoing health advice, and we will continue to engage with expert groups to strive to ensure our plans for the reopening of schools reflect the most up-to-date advice available.  There may be different scenarios for reopening schools depending on the prevailing health advice, ranging from the attendance of a small number of students at any given time to a full return.  There may be a need for phasing of different approaches.  All issues need to be considered in looking at these scenarios, including implications for the curriculum, for teaching and learning and for those at risk of educational disadvantage and those with special educational needs.  Our most vulnerable students must and will be a focus for our priorities as we plan for the future.</p> <p> The Department is engaging with all stakeholders to develop a plan to reopen schools.  All primary and post-primary stakeholders have been invited to make submissions to the Department on the issues to be considered from their perspectives.  In addition, a meeting of the primary education forum took place last week and a meeting with post-primary stakeholders took place today.  Ongoing meetings with stakeholders will be arranged as the Roadmap for Reopening Schools is developed.  In addition to the education stakeholders, wider consultation is needed with other parties, including Bus &Eacute;ireann, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the National Transport Authority, NTA, the HSE and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Similar processes are happening in the tertiary sector, and my Department is engaging with stakeholders in that regard.</p> <p> We have also been looking closely at the experience of other countries.  I attended a virtual meeting of EU ministers of education on Monday to hear the experience of my colleagues on the steps they are taking.  Yesterday, I also spoke with my counterpart in London, Gavin Williamson, on the common challenges we face.  Schools continue to be best placed to make decisions on how to support and educate all their learners during this period.  Consideration of the types of experiences that schools will be able to offer in the new school year and how remote or online learning can support and complement the teaching and learning that takes place in the classroom will be required.  In addition, continued support will be required where students cannot attend school. </p> <p> I am particularly concerned about the impact of school closures on students with special educational needs and disadvantaged students.  I want to see some summer provision for these students.  Public health advice will be key to achieving this, and I am looking at what potential there might be for the running of existing programmes supporting children at the greatest risk of educational disadvantage.  My Department is working closely with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla on this issue, and I will be meeting the Minister for Health in the coming days.</p> <p> I am very aware that this closure of schools has impacted hardest on families who have children with complex needs and whose well-being and engagement with learning depend very much on the routine of school and relationships with other students, teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs.  They have also lost out on specialist support during this closure period.  I am conscious of the real risk of regression in learning among these children.  I know their families place a high value on the traditional July provision programme.  Unfortunately, due to the Covid-19 health crisis, it is not possible to deliver the normal July provision programme in the same way and at the same time as in other years.</p> <p> We are, however, exploring all options for a programme to run over the summer for children with the most complex needs.  First, I need to be satisfied that the public health advice will support the running of such a provision.  It must be safe to do it.  Second, we need teachers, SNAs and schools to be in a position to do this.  We have to be sure that teachers and SNAs are going to be able to provide a summer programme and that the necessary precautions to safeguard them properly can be put in place.  Finally, while many parents will welcome the possibility of a summer programme, they too will have a real and genuine concern for the welfare of their children.  We will need to engage closely with parents to ensure they will want to avail of such a programme.</p> <p> The primary aim of any programme will be to limit potential regression and learning, thereby ensuring, in so far as possible, that these children can reintegrate and transition into their planned education setting for next year with their peers.</p> <p>It is hoped to deliver this programme in July or August, public health advice permitting.  The participation of schools, teachers and SNAs is critically necessary and it is for them to decide whether they wish to participate.  I have already commenced consultations with stakeholders on the nature and scope of the proposed programme and these will continue for the next few weeks.  Earlier today, I met AsIAm, Down Syndrome Ireland and the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education.  We had a very fruitful conversation and the importance of trying to do something while recognising the challenges involved made a big impression on me.  Due to a communication difficulty, Inclusion Ireland did not participate but I will speak directly to it tomorrow. </p> <p> Conversations such as that and our debate this evening are very beneficial in informing thinking in this area.  It is important that stakeholders contribute such that any programme developed is relevant and meets the needs of children.  As I stated at the outset, a significant amount of work is continuing in the education sector, with my Department leading and facilitating stakeholder engagement in the planning of our responses in various areas.  We will continue to listen to proposals and concerns from stakeholders and to work collaboratively for all students.</p></speech>

I am not happy with everything that is happening but I detect in his speech a much greater openness from the Department in how it is dealing with educational issues.  We are still seeking clarity and certainty on many issues, but I have always accepted that certainty is not always possible in this pandemic and that things will change.  What I wanted the Department to do at all times was to consult and engage as widely as possible.  It was not evident whether that was happening but it is evident from what the Minister has said tonight that significant engagement is taking place.</p>  <p>  Schools in particular will look forward to getting the system of calculated grades and how that will work.  I very much welcome that an independent person, Dr. &Aacute;ine Lawlor, has been asked to chair the independent steering committee on this issue.  That is an absolutely critical step.  I also welcome that members of the State Examinations Commission are to be seconded to the Department.  That is a very sensible thing to do, given that we cannot currently change the legislation.  In regard to the reopening of schools, it is welcome that the Minister is, of course, consulting and engaging with the education partners.  The Minister has outlined to us a list of other partners directly outside of education which he and the Department are also consulting.  That needs to continue.</p>  <p>  There are changing opinions on the public health side and they must be considered at all times.  They swing all the time from one side to the other- from hope to despair - in terms of what would be possible.  It is important that the Minister keeps up to date with everything that is happening in that regard, as I am sure he is doing.  It is to the benefit of the Department and the students that the widest possible engagement is ongoing.</p>  <p>  There are many issues relating to the leaving certificate which I am sure the Minister will continue to address as they arise, particularly students outside school and the certainty they need, if possible.  In addition, there is my call to provide greater numbers of college places for the class of 2020.  I sincerely hope the Minister will work on this issue.  It is critical for that to happen to recognise the difficulties experienced by the leaving certificate class this year.  We hope there will be extra places.  There may not be a large number of them, but there will be some.  I refer to the pressure young people have been under in recent months.</p>  <p>  I welcome the detail provided by the Minister on the reopening of schools.  I accept that he cannot give a reopening date tonight in the House and I am not asking him to provide one.  It is critical that once robust public health advice allows the reopening of schools, there be no other blockages in the system to prevent or delay it.  The way to unblock such blockages is to consult as widely as possible.  That will involve a significant number of students.  There are certain classes which have significant concerns.  Some fifth year students have raised issues that affect them.  I very much welcome fifth year and sixth year students having their voice in the political sphere.</p> <p>They are very effectively represented by the Irish Second-level Students' Union, ISSU, but they have also had their individual voices heard by politicians in this Chamber and throughout the country.  I really welcome the fact that they have engaged on this issue, whatever their particular viewpoint.  Indeed, there has been a range of different viewpoints.  The issue of sixth class students has been discussed previously.</p> <p> There are lessons to be learned and the Department seems to be adopting a different approach now.  Too much of the discourse around the leaving certificate focused on maintaining the integrity of the process, which is obviously important, with not enough focus on the welfare of the child.  It is true that second level students are well represented by their representative organisation, but it is also crucially important that primary school students have their voice represented.  The Ombudsman for Children would be well placed to engage with the Minister, and I am sure the Minister will engage with him.  The Ombudsman for Children should be involved every step of the way.  I note that the ombudsman for children in England is commenting publicly with regularity on this issue.</p> <p> The issue of the secrecy and confidentiality that surrounded the leaving certificate engagement was detrimental to the process because things leaked out anyway.  It is better to have a fully open and transparent process because that will give the greatest level of confidence to people.  It is important that sufficient time is allowed to implement any guidance that is provided.  That is critical so that schools and teachers know what is going to happen.</p> <p> Some of my party colleagues will be speaking about children with special needs.  I am glad that the Minister has expanded on what he said previously about July provision.  The statement he made last week engendered hope, and while I accept that people know that miracles are not possible, the Minister has set out what is there at the moment.  We need to keep engaging with all of the partners on this because the situation is very difficult for these children.  They do not have their regular school which is really important to them.  I  want to pay tribute to teachers, SNAs, the management bodies of schools, parents who are teaching at home, and the kids themselves.  Everybody is doing tremendous work in the best way that they can.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.472" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1545" speakername="Christopher O'Sullivan" time="22:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000083#RRRR00200"><p>I echo Deputy Byrne's comments on children in special classes and ASD units.  These children have had to go without speech and occupational therapy, movement breaks and psychological supports since 12 March.  I know of a child who gets up every morning, puts on her coat and schoolbag and goes to the front door to wait for a taxi that will never arrive.  That is heartbreaking.  I cannot even begin to imagine the distress that girl and her family go through every day.  These children, their parents, guardians and families deserve better than this.  I appreciate the Minister's comments on July provision and trying to facilitate that.  I also appreciate that the Minister believes that there are possible solutions here, provided that social distancing is adhered to, but given that the Minister can see that chink of light or that possibility, I ask him to go a step further.  Given that there are no more than six children in any classroom at any time, subject to all public health guidelines, can the Minister see a way to allow children who are enrolled in ASD units and special classes to return to school as soon as possible, if not immediately?</p>  <p>  The other issue that I would like to raise has been aired frequently in this Chamber in the past, namely, school transport.  Last year in my own constituency of Cork South-West in the areas of Ballineen and Enniskeane, 18 students were left without a place on school buses.  That is an entire classroom's worth of students who were left without seats because of the rigid and ridiculous rules governing the current school transport scheme.  I have heard from constituents who are considering moving their entrance so that they can avail of the scheme.  I have heard of children being left at the side of the road, crying, while their classmates are driven away on the bus.  This is absolutely infuriating for the students and their parents.  Neither the Department of Education and Skills nor Bus &Eacute;ireann should be dictating where a child goes to school.  We need a proper, functioning school transport scheme that resolves the problems I have just talked about.</p>  <p>  We also need a scheme that improves sustainability and traffic flow.  I know of a scenario in west Cork where a child is availing of the school bus while their neighbour is driven to school in their parent's car and follows directly behind the bus.  This type of scenario has led to significant congestion and traffic problems in towns like Bandon in my own constituency.  We really need to move away from this system as soon as possible.  I ask the Minister to begin a complete overhaul of the current school transport scheme.</p> <p>Will he do away with the rigid rules of the transport scheme and allow for some type of discretion, which is what families are looking for?  Will he also begin planning for social distancing?  For example, if a 52-seat bus is serving a route, we do not know if it will be allowed to have full occupancy, with 52 students, or if it will be cut to 50%.  Will there be enough buses to provide school transport for each and every one of the children who deserve it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.474" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1597" speakername="Joe Flaherty" time="22:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000084#SSSS00200"><p>I am conscious and thankful that the Minister has given a commitment to try to have the July provision in place for special needs children.  However, I want to emphasise it will be essential for these children as, otherwise, they will have been six months outside the school system and when they get back into a classroom environment, they will flounder.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the challenges it has presented, Covid-19 has given many organisations an opportunity to reflect on how they operate and, more importantly, on how they could do better.  One would certainly hope that, at present, there is a team within the Department of Education and Skills reviewing special education, identifying the issues and earmarking what additional supports need to be in place when our children return to education.  The House is aware of the challenges in special needs education but I fear these challenges are much more pronounced in my county of Longford after nearly a decade of neglect.  In many instances, the problems in Longford are, unfortunately, masked by the fact its figures are included with County Westmeath, which has much better performing metrics.  On the one hand, schools in County Longford simply do not have the most basic of resources even though exceptional staff and management are providing an outstanding service.  On the other hand, parents are frustrated and fearful of speaking out as they fear they will lose out on the most minuscule of supports.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, there has been a dismantling of services for children in Longford, specifically in the area of health and education.  For example, all eye and ear services in the county have been withdrawn and, at present, children have to go to Athlone for testing.  Invariably, this means they miss out on a day in school, assuming their families can afford to get there in the first place.  Several principals in the county to whom I have spoken in recent months, as well as teachers appointed from other counties, have highlighted that special needs services are significantly better in adjoining counties.  For example, the autism unit in Ballymahon national school will have pupils travel from County Roscommon and staff and management of the school will regularly see services and support brought over from Roscommon to work with these pupils.  While a number of local schools have dedicated autism units, there is, unfortunately, huge pressure on the adjoining smaller schools, which have to take the overflow of students who are unable to access the units. </p>  <p>  Our party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, has been on record throughout and since the election campaign regarding his commitment to special needs education.  How it ultimately features in this programme for Government and, specifically, how the incoming Minister for Education and Skills addresses the deficits in special needs education in counties like Longford and elsewhere might well be the acid test for his or her tenure. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.475" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1519" speakername="Cathal Crowe" time="22:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000084#SSSS00300"><p>As my speaking time is limited, I would be grateful if my questions could be responded to in writing.  A few short weeks ago, before I was elected to this House, I was a primary school teacher teaching a class of 33 fourth class pupils in Parteen national school, County Clare - I am still in the habit of using the old red pen.  When these pupils return to school in September, social distancing as we know it - that is, two metres apart - will be very difficult or virtually impossible to implement.  Two metres of separation does not work in an environment where pupils sit elbow to elbow, pencil case to pencil case.  I would like to know what measures the Department is taking to ensure that best health and safety practices will be in place in primary school classrooms and school playgrounds in time for a September re-opening.  Will additional accommodation be required in some instances?  As is the case in other EU countries, will the Department give consideration to laying down some stone or hard-core to extend play areas so children can stay a little apart while getting back closer together as friends and classmates?</p>  <p>  My second question relates to the much anticipated re-opening of schools in September.  Principals and boards of management throughout my county, including at Realt na Mara in Kilkee, have been asking me when the Department will furnish them with guideline documents outlining how pupils and staff can safely return.  I believe this guidance documentation would have to make it very clear how many children could be in a classroom at the same time and how this would work in classrooms of varying square meterage.</p> <p>In Ireland we have a pupil-teacher ratio of 26:1.  Maybe now is the time to consider reducing this ratio and making it more favourable and more in line with the EU average of 20:1.  An analysis of data recently published by the Department indicated that just under 20% of Irish primary school children are in classrooms that could be considered to be overcrowded.  In my home county of Clare, 32 schools have more than 30 children in a class at any given time.  I implore the Minister on an emergency basis to hire additional temporary staff to allow schools to do this so we can reduce the pupil-teacher ratio.</p> <p> The Minister mentioned July provision.  I will not dwell on it but I ask the Minister to extend it to August.  The children for whom July provision caters have been without mainstay education for a number of months and it would make sense to extend the programme.  We can call it July-August provision and give it a longer run in the summer so the children are supported.</p> <p> The next issue I wish to raise is third level accommodation.  Third level campuses such as the University of Limerick have yet to refund families, who are very financially pressed at this time.  I ask the Minister to intervene in this.  A scheme needs to be devised to enable people to retrieve their property from university campus accommodation.</p> <p> I pay tribute to some of those teachers who have been outstanding in reaching out through social media to their pupils.  Siobh&aacute;n Barry runs a Twitter page for Parteen national school, Darryl Eade and his colleagues at the Holy Family school in Ennis have set up a little TV station and Cratloe national school has taken to Zoom to do dancing and sing songs for those in the local nursing homes.  Their work is fabulous and it needs to be commended by the House and the Minister.</p></speech>

I say it in this way because schools are still working.  I know teachers have gone to extraordinary lengths and I give Deputy Cathal Crowe an A plus for managing to get in as many constituency schools into his contribution as he did.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.479" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1460" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="22:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000085#TTTT00400"><p>I am sure he does but he is not getting my time for them.</p>  <p>  Teachers have gone to extraordinary lengths and it is fair to recognise that others have also made a contribution, such as "C&uacute;la4 ar Scoil" on TG4 and "Home School Hub" on RT&Eacute;.  While they are not as good as the ordinary school experience, they have helped put shape on the day for parents and children, including my family.  Where else would we learn to put together a pyramid with spaghetti and jelly babies?</p>  <p>  It is undoubtedly the case, and this is disputed by no one, that children have lost out.  This is particularly the case for children living in emergency accommodation, children with special educational needs and children living in chaotic home environments.  There is no doubt but that educational disadvantage has been exacerbated.  All concerned want to see a return to school as soon as is possible because no one wants the current situation to last a minute longer than necessary.</p>  <p>  Reopening school buildings for education is not like turning on a tap.  There are many ways to do this with many elements but fundamentally there are two ways.  There is a proper way that involves schools opening up with the confidence and consent of parents, students and teachers and there is the way that involves making a hames of it through a lack of consultation or through haste.  The first will allow schools to reopen and stay open and gradually get education back to something resembling normal but the latter will entirely undermine that objective.  I have spoken to a number of schools and they have yet to be consulted or hear a single thing from the Department on reopening.  This is not good enough.  If there is to be a road map back to some shape of normality for the economy, the least schools deserve is a road map for education.</p>  <p>  Capacity will be an enormous issue.  Most of our school buildings are not fit to hold the numbers they hold generally, not to mind with social distancing.  We need guidance and consultation with schools and we need to use the time we have between now and when schools reopen to plan and give people confidence.  While it is the case that people are frustrated, they are also still nervous and need reassurance.  If there are to be pilots or if some schools are to open before others, it should be on the basis of the key priorities in terms of special education and disadvantage.  It also needs to be on a voluntary basis on the part of students and staff.</p>  <p>  I want to return to the issue of school profiling, which we have discussed on several occasions.  The safeguards the Minister believes exist are not adequate.  There is not an equal distribution of children across schools.  In fact, schools magnify the disadvantage felt by communities.  It is a fact that a school could have the results of its students, which are marked diligently and conscientiously by the teachers, revised downwards simply because of results in the past.</p> <p>A strong cohort which bucks the trend that existed in a school before now will not get the grades it deserves.  In Britain, research has found that more than one in five schools had expected to have large changes in the percentage of A* to C English GCSE results between 2014 and 2015 and this was only partially attributed to teaching quality.  Every cohort is different in every school.  In a single school it can be radically different.  These students deserve to be treated on their own merits.  The Minister has instanced junior certificate results three years prior and, in his speech, minimised the emphasis on them in the calculation generally, as a safeguard.  It is unclear now whether that is factored in before adjustments or after concerns are raised by a student at school.  I do not think it is justified to have it there at all.  If the Minister is confident in the calculated grades approach, and I wish the best of luck to Dr. Lawlor in her approach, he should trust the system of alignment and appeals along with a randomised checking system to ensure a standard.</p> <p> Some of these injustices can be if not resolved then, perhaps, minimised by opening up additional third level places.  Many of the 14,000 students who come here annually from abroad are not coming now, leaving many places vacant.  Universities alone are facing a shortfall of &euro;374 million.  It seems clear that Government will have to step in to solve this funding crisis.  However, the investment that is needed can also focus on delivering additional places for those who have done the leaving certificate by investing in Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, and access programmes such as Here and There.  Already SUSI is inadequate and people turn down offers made to them because they cannot afford to live in Dublin, Cork or Galway, even with the full grant.  That brings me on to a query regarding SUSI on which I wrote to the Minister and am still awaiting a response.  Tens of thousands of people have lost their jobs recently, many of them permanently.  Many do not know if or when their workplaces will reopen, especially in retail, hospitality, bar and restaurant work.  It is totally unclear whether those who are uncertain as to the future of closed businesses will be entitled to SUSI for their children.  This affects countless students who may not be able to afford college without the grant.  Can the Minister clarify that for me?</p> <p> I also want to flag my particular concern around students outside of traditional school settings, especially those without formal tuition.  Everyone in the leaving certificate of 2020 deserves the chance to get into third level and a solution needs to be found for those students.</p> <p> I know Deputy Wynne, and perhaps Deputy Tully, will also raise this issue.  We need clarity on July provision.  I welcome the commitment the Minister has made to it but an awful lot more detail is needed.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact that some clarification has been provided and I do not believe for one minute that any of this process is easy or straightforward.  However, schools need as much guidance and clarity as possible and as soon as possible.  Last week, teachers were reasonably confident that they had a good grasp of the process around calculating a grade but they were awaiting guidance.  I welcome the fact that this guidance will issue tomorrow.  They are hoping the situation will not have changed from what they believed it would be and that it will be reasonably straightforward.  Many teachers are exhausted at the moment.  They have been trying to teach online, which is not easy, and many also have their own children at home.  I think everybody has suddenly appreciated how difficult teaching is when we have our children at home with us and are trying to work at the same time.</p>  <p>  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire has just mentioned, the Minister also indicated that a mechanism would be found to assess home-schooled students or those who, for whatever reason, are taking a subject outside of school and without a recognised tutor.  Has a mechanism been found yet?  The students and parents with whom I have discussed this since last week felt a little bit forgotten or cast aside.  Can the Minister indicate how many students are in this situation?</p>  <p>  When I was a student doing my leaving certificate, I had an option to do the matriculation exam or "matric" should my leaving certificate results not be sufficient for entry into the course I desired.  I did not need to sit this exam but I know of people who did and it allowed them entry to certain third level institutions without having to repeat a whole school year in order to re-sit the leaving certificate.  I know the matric in the NUI has been abolished since 1990 but has the Department, in conjunction with third level colleges, examined the possibility of such a process being introduced, even just for this year?</p> <p>What consultations have taken place between universities and colleges outside the State to ensure this year's leaving certificate will be recognised and accepted?  I urge that places on the HEAR and DARE schemes should be expanded, considering recent events, to ensure the impact on students who suffer from disadvantage is minimised.</p> <p> I welcome that no school will receive a lower allocation of SNA support for September and that the new allocation model for SNAs has been deferred.  I have been told, however, that should a school require additional support it must go through an exceptional review of current allocation, which involves a fair amount of paperwork and bureaucracy.  Is this a mechanism of discouraging schools from applying for additional SNAs?  If students entering second level require SNA access it should be a straightforward process to apply for this without a threat of a review of current allocation.</p></speech>

This decision was welcomed but many people in Clare feel that the delay in formulating the decision caused unnecessary stress and anxiety for parents and students.  My colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, has suggested a need for a one-stop shop helpline to be set up to avoid the issue of lobbying when parents and students are merely seeking some clarity.  I reiterate that suggestion.</p>  <p>  In his announcement, the Minister for Education and Skills stated that students will be offered calculated grades generated using "a systematic statistical model."  There are areas, however, that need further consideration.  I have received many concerns from students in Clare about how this system of calculated grades will affect them individually.  One case that was highlighted to me was from a constituent who is a repeat leaving certificate student who had started in a new school with the hope of achieving higher grades to access the desired third level college or university.  The current system outlined by the Minister will prove problematic in this instance.  It will lead to disadvantages with regard to the teachers' estimated percentage grade where a student with no teacher-student relationship may be at a disadvantage.  This student and other repeat leaving certificate students do not want their past grades to be used as it will defeat the purpose of having repeated the year and it may negatively affect them.  These students feel hopeless about the leaving certificate 2020 and ultimately about their future.  Will the Minister provide clarification for students who are in this particular situation?</p>  <p>  I have also received queries from students in Clare who are applicants for scholarships such as the Naughton scholarship.  If awarded, this significant scholarship is worth up to &euro;20,000.  Students in Clare who have worked towards this scholarship are hugely concerned.  For most, receiving such a scholarship is their only means to access education and they have expressed confusion.  In normal circumstances the repeat exams are done in time to be considered.  The dates have not yet been disclosed for when the option to sit a leaving certificate examination will take place.  Will the Minister clarify when the exams will take place or indicate when the date will be disclosed?</p>  <p>  Parents in Clare are desperate to know where they stand on the July provision.  I welcome the Minister's statement but I believe that more information is needed. Some people have managed to source tutors and teachers and have looked at the Government's road map for reopening society whereby 29 June will see an easing of restrictions to phase 3.  This will involve the reopening of cr&egrave;ches, childminders and preschools for children of essential workers.  With that knowledge they feel that the July provision should be given the go-ahead.  The children who will avail of the July provision have been struggling immensely and will need this service, especially because of the Covid-19 lockdown.  Will the Minister provide clarification on the July provision or will he indicate when the full clarification can be given?</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire raised a specific individual case and I will ensure that is replied to.  The Deputy also has concerns around how the calculated grade process will work.</p> <p>The school-calculated grade is the primary process in determining the results of the individual students.  That pressure is not singularly on the teacher.  He or she will have to sit down with his or her teaching colleague within the school.  If it is an art teacher and there is no colleague, that teacher will sit down with the deputy principal and the next part of the alignment process will go to the principal.  There is a whole-school alignment process to ensure that the two years of the student's work will be measured and calculated in a way that is reflected in the professional judgment of the teacher.</p> <p> We have set up the new executive office because we have to have a process within the Department.  I am very encouraged by the intensity of work that has happened already and that has brought us to this stage.  Dr. &Aacute;ine Lawlor will be a key person to ensure, along with others in the new office, that there is a standard.  If the State is going to allow calculated grades to be used as a certified leaving certificate, which it will be doing, the likes of UCAS will demand a State certification, which is why there has to be a national standard.  Schools in Bandon have to be treated the same way as schools in Boyle.</p> <p> The importance of the national standard is that all schools will be in a system and a process to ensure that the results that come from a school will be sacrosanct.  Nevertheless, we have to have a standard because we cannot have some teachers marking leniently and others harshly.  It is not just a case of students being downgraded.  There is also a chance that they will be pulled up.</p></speech>

The Minister effectively answered my question.  I represent the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, which includes north Roscommon and south Donegal.  I was concerned that the students in Boyle, Ballymote, Ballinamore and Ballyshannon might not be treated equally to students in Blackrock.  I am glad the Minister outlined to the previous speaker that the process of national standardisation will introduce a fairness to the calculated grade system.  Parents and students are very concerned about it and I am happy the Minister answered the question.</p></speech>

It means an awful lot to parents and children to be able to plan, so we welcome the further detail on that.</p>  <p>  I wish to refer to another category of parents and children with vulnerabilities.  A particular case of which I am aware relates to a lady who has a baby with cystic fibrosis.  She is a teacher expecting to return from maternity leave to school in the autumn.  Clearly, she is now in a different position in light of her immunosuppressed child and how going into a classroom will impact on her.  I ask the Minister to give consideration to parents of immunosuppressed children who are coming back as teachers in the course of his deliberations about how schools will be reopened.</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned that he was speaking with Gavin Williamson.  I raise the issue of leaving certificate students who have UCAS offers for universities in the United Kingdom and how that matter will be handled.  In the context of higher education, the universities in general and the impact of the closure of hospitals on clinical research trials, we are losing some of our best postdoctoral research students to universities and hospitals elsewhere.  That to which I refer is a consequence of what is happening.  I flag this because it will be an ongoing issue for universities.</p></speech>

When students return to school, notwithstanding the mammoth efforts of teachers and parents to home-school them, their education will have to be accelerated in order to catch up on the many months of missed schooling.  Not all students will be able for this.  Children with special needs may struggle with a faster pace.  I am pleased to hear that the Minister engaged today with organisations including Down Syndrome Ireland, which has also been in contact with me.  I have received many queries from the parents of children with special needs, particularly those who live in Lucan.</p> <p>Some of them are considering whether repeating the year is the best thing for their children but this raises new challenges.  Will there be sufficient space in next year's class for them to repeat?  Will there be enough special needs assistants in the class to cope with additional students?  Could the Minister outline what plans are in place for children with special needs who wish to repeat the year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.491" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1598" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="22:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000089#XXXX00200"><p>The bread and butter of our local communities is that the national schools continue to provide the excellent education they have provided.  I refer to the school in Lordship, County Louth, Rampark National School, role number 18101F.  The difficulty is that last September it had 170 students and that effectively means it will lose two teachers.  That will have a very significant and adverse impact on the school.  It would have needed to have 171 pupils last September to hold onto one of those teachers and it would have needed to have 176 pupils to hold onto both of them.  The good news for the school is that it will be guaranteed to have somewhere around 173 pupils in September but because the school has to wait a year to get the additional teacher as a result of that, every single class apart from junior and senior infants will be split.  First and second class are together, as are second and third class, fourth and fifth class and fifth and sixth class.  That means there will be an average of 33 students in each class and the good news is there will also be an empty classroom because of the rules.  That does not make sense to the parents or the teachers.  The other problem is they are losing their administrative principal.  I ask the Minister to consider this case.  The school's appeal was turned down.  Could it be looked at again, particularly in the light of the vibrant community there?  They can show that this is not a dying rural community.  It is a growing community just north of Dundalk.  The demographics and the increase in planning applications in the area show this.  I appeal to the Minister and his officials to look at this again so that people can go to school and get the full curriculum they need at that age, particularly those in fifth and sixth class, now that they are losing so much school time with the Covid-19 situation.</p></speech>

Kildare has a moving and an increasing population and there is pressure on space.  When children return to school, adequate provision must be made to ensure they can access a school place and that children with special needs, such as autism, can access a school place as well, within reason.</p></speech>

A lot of technical work went into it over the last week.  Right up until today we have been working hard on it.  Clarification around that will be published tomorrow.</p>  <p>  Deputy Carroll MacNeill asked about the issue of safety.  That is at the heart of all of our deliberations.  She is correct in pointing out that there will be individual cases with complex needs, including complex medical needs.  One of the matters I encountered today when meeting the different stakeholders representing those with Down's syndrome and autism as well as the boards of management of special schools is that there is a big challenge to get this right.  However, safety will be at the heart of all of our deliberations and anything we will try to bring forward in terms of a summer programme will also be directed by the public health advice.</p>  <p>  Deputy Carroll MacNeill also raised the issue of students with UCAS offers from UK universities.  We are working towards a date for the results to come out that would be aligned to the traditional date of the leaving certificate.</p> <p>We cannot commit to a date yet because we have to start the process associated with the calculated grades.  Once tomorrow's publication becomes available to all teachers, the process can start and then we can start working towards a specific date.</p> <p> I know from my conversations with the UK Secretary of State for Education, Mr. Gavin Williamson, as recently as yesterday, that there is a lot of collaboration.  There will be flexibility within the whole third level sector, not just at home.  Mr. Williamson was very clear he wants to work with us.  There will be flexibility at an all-Europe level for our students who go to other EU countries.</p> <p> Deputy Higgins talked about the months of lost schooling, specifically regarding special educational needs.  One of the main pieces of work I have been doing over recent weeks has been identifying these gaps.  There is anecdotal evidence from parents that they are seeing a regression in their sons or daughters in some instances.  Therefore, we will continue to try to have a summer programme that could help in combating those challenges.</p> <p> I will not get into the question of repeating examinations.  What we want to do is ensure a transition, a steppingstone.  A very clear message from the stakeholders today was that they want a transition.  The summer program could help in that regard.  September will see a new approach.  It may be different.  Depending on the public health criteria, we do not want the vacuum from 12 March until September to be negative in any way for children with special needs.</p> <p> I will be happy to take details of the school mentioned by Deputy O'Dowd.  The teacher-allocation process is independent but I will certainly get one of the inspectors to look specifically at the case.</p> <p> Deputy Durkan mentioned the 2020 class.  I agree with him wholeheartedly in that the class should not be labelled in any way differently.  That is why the leaving certificate the students will receive will be a State-recognised certificate, the same as last year and the year before.  I note the Deputy&rsquo;s point on planning for special educational needs.  We have a planning department.  It tries to take in as much information as it can, including from local authorities, in terms of houses being built and where it is projected there will be increases in population.  The department has an almighty task but it tries to work with the best information possible.</p></speech>

As such, the topic of education is of special interest to me.  I welcome the chance to address the challenges posed in the sector by the current health crisis.  In the first instance, I commend the efforts being made by teachers and other educators throughout the country to help parents structure the work they can do at home with their own children.  In my home, the padlets sent out by Ms Power and Ms Walsh from Gl&oacute;r na Mara are a great resource.  My household faces the same challenges as those faced by the households of every other parent in the country in getting our boys to sit down and do some work.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the ongoing work of our special educational needs teachers and special needs assistants, who are keeping in contact with some of the most vulnerable cohorts in the education system.  Their role in maintaining a link with the school will be so important come September, when we hope to reopen the school gates safely and have a return to the classroom.  I very much welcome the announcements on the summer provision in that regard.  It is intensely important, particularly for the cohort affected.</p>  <p>  In many cases, school principals have been busier than ever before in the past few months, even if they have been walking up and down empty corridors.  Front-line workers have been praised consistently during this crisis and rightly so, but it is right too to acknowledge the many people in our public sector who are working quietly behind the scenes to make sure that when the country does recover from this Covid crisis, the State schools and structures will stand ready to resume their important work.</p>  <p>  I would like to begin my questions at third level and then work backwards.  Our third level system already looks quite different from what it looked like even in January of this year.  We are all acutely aware of the funding challenges to be faced at third level in the short term as well as the long term.  The sector has shown its flexibility in how it has adapted to the challenges and to the possibilities of remote working, in particular, and there may well be work practices that will never revert to those that existed before the pandemic.</p> <p>While significant changes such as we are seeing can be difficult, I am hopeful the system will be open to making permanent some of the positive changes it has made in response to the health emergency.</p> <p> This question pertains to students who may find themselves in financial difficulty in the year ahead.  As Teachta &Oacute; Laoghaire said, we know that many households have experienced a sharp drop in income due to Covid-19, but I wish to refer specifically to students' own income.  As we know well, many of the summer jobs students traditionally have had and worked at over the summer in order to save for the academic year ahead will not be available this year.  These jobs are traditionally in hospitality and tourism, which are the obvious examples.  Has the Minister made any provision to alter SUSI grants or the supports available to third level students that might be available to take account of this loss of summer income?</p> <p> Returning to the issue of the leaving certificate, I know that the Minister has answered a number of specific queries from the Green Party on this before.  Like Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, we in the Green Party have ongoing concerns in particular about school profiling and the lobbying of teachers regarding calculated grades.  These issues are already on the Department's radar but I ask that they are again given every due consideration.  I would like the Minister to address the suggestion I have seen in the media that this year's leaving certificate cohort may be in some way treated kindly when it comes to grades awarded.  I absolutely understand that on a human level, and the leaving certificate class of 2020 has had a year like no other and marked by uncertainty and unexpected anxiety.  I am also, however, acutely aware of others who may have taken a year out from their education after their leaving certificate, for example, people who did the health professions admission test, HPAT.  They might find that grade inflation has eroded the value of their results from previous years.  Can the Minister give those students assurances that this will not be the case and that they will not find themselves excluded from courses for which they would have qualified under normal circumstances?</p> <p> On a different note, I wish to ask the Minister the situation pertaining to students studying a subject outside of school, often another language, or students being homeschooled.  I understand that these present a particular difficulty when using calculated grades.  Has the Department worked out yet how these students are to be awarded their leaving certificate grades?  Could the Minister provide some details on this?</p> <p> B'fh&eacute;idir nach lu&iacute;onn s&eacute; seo faoi ch&uacute;ram na Roinne, ach maidir le col&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh sa Ghaeltacht, is l&eacute;ir go mbeidh droch-thionchar orthu an samhradh at&aacute; romhainn de r&eacute;ir Covid-19.  Chun sampla a thabhairt &oacute; mo dh&aacute;ilcheantar f&eacute;in, me&aacute;nscoil San Niocl&aacute;s, Gaeltacht na Rinne, t&aacute; a fhios agam go mbreathann siad go m&oacute;r ar an ioncam a dh&eacute;anann na col&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh d&oacute;ibh.  Is amhlaidh go mbeidh taca&iacute;ocht de dh&iacute;th ar gheilleagar na Gaeltachta go ginear&aacute;lta, ach an mbeidh aon taca&iacute;ocht speisialta ar f&aacute;il do na col&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh sin?</p> <p> The primary school classrooms, the space I know best in the education sector having spent 15 happy years there, is the space in which I find it most difficult to imagine social distancing working in a real sense.  I do not know how I would correct a homework copy, tie a shoelace or put a plaster on somebody's skinned knee from a distance of 2 m.  The Minister is well aware that we have some of the most crowded classrooms in Europe and the built fabric of our schools is often dated.  I accept that he has laid out some of the steps to be taken to reopen our schools, but I know that school principals are crying out for more details so they can begin to formulate their plans ahead of time.  In particular, I wonder whether staggered class times have been taken in as part of that consideration and the work ongoing.</p> <p> On a specific issue of staffing levels and teacher retention in school, I have been contacted by a number of principals who are concerned about the number of children who may not return in September, owing either to underlying health conditions, perhaps of a fourth or fifth class child, or parents who might decide to defer their child's entry to junior infants for an additional year.  As the Minister well knows, primary online database, POD, returns on 30 September each year determine staffing levels for the following year.  There are up to 400 schools in the country that may be on the borderline for recruitment and retention of staff and may find themselves adversely affected if even a small number of parents make legitimate health-based decisions to keep their children at home for the course of September or into October.  Is this issue on the Department's radar at all?  Are there any plans either to have a moratorium or to adjust the student-teacher ratio, as suggested by Deputy Crowe, to take account of this concern and allow schools to keep the number of staff that their pupil numbers deserve?</p> <p> Finally, I wish to comment on the subject of the junior infant intake in September 2020.  It is important to acknowledge the positive effect that early childhood education and the early childhood care and education scheme in particular have had over recent years on children's school-readiness when they arrive in the junior infant classroom.  Next September will look markedly different with many of the children having spent nearly all their time at home since March.  I believe there is a good case to be made for extra supports to be made available to the junior infant classroom, even if it is only for the first term of the next school year.  They would help us to answer the concerns of social distancing, which is particularly difficult in an infant classroom, and help with what would be a turbulent settling after a long period of unusual circumstances at home.  Has the Minister or his Department made any such plans in this regard?</p></speech>

Obviously, it is not sustainable in the long run.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to how third level institutions have responded to this crisis.  It has been incredible to watch the processes to continue learning remotely and to do examinations remotely as well.  Within that there are gaps relating to technological inequity as well.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct that many students rely on hospitality and summer jobs.  Those jobs will not be available this summer.  Interestingly, however, there has been much debate in the House in recent years about how the money students generated was used against them when they were trying to apply for grants.  I acknowledge the Deputy is referring to the entire cohort.  There is a fear around the SUSI grant in that it was determined on 2019 income by parents.  The circumstances have changed and that will have to be taken into consideration.</p>  <p>  I take the Deputy's concerns about the grading calculation system on board as well.  From tomorrow the guidelines will be available and teachers will have a roadmap for the processes.  Hopefully, that will help.  I will ensure that, at the heart of all of the deliberations of the new executive office that has been set up, the principles of fairness and equity will remain central to all deliberations.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked questions regarding another language and leaving certificate grades outside of school and tutors.  We are going to look at those on a case-by-case basis and this will be determined by the information provided by the student in terms of learning support.</p>  <p>  Maidir leis na col&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh, t&aacute; an ceart ag an Teachta maidir leis an Aire at&aacute; freagrach as an gcinneadh sin, mo chomhghleaca&iacute; an tAire St&aacute;it, Teachta Kyne.

He will be aware of the Labour Party position on the issue of assessed grading and school profiling.  We are very much against school profiling.  I have written to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, to seek its viewpoint.  The equivalent body in the United Kingdom has issued guidelines to the UK education department relating to assessed grading.  The position of the UK body is that it potentially negatively affects minority children, children with additional needs, children from disadvantaged backgrounds and, specifically, high-achieving children in disadvantaged settings.  I expect or hope that IHREC will issue the Department with some recommendations.  I hope the school profiling element, which is so controversial and unnecessary, can be deleted from the Minister's assessment criteria, which he will publish tomorrow.</p>  <p>  I refer to the issue of schools that may lose teachers.  In September, schools get notification of appeals.  I am going to mention a school but I will not name it.  The Minister knows of the school because I sent the details to him yesterday.  The school is going to lose a teacher because it has 200 students on the roll but it needs 201.</p> <p>It is in a particular location that has suffered a huge incidence of violence in the past 18 months.  The Government admitted a necessity to have a Mulvey-style task force for this area  to identify reasons for the violence and to provide supports for the community, one of which would be educational supports.  There was even a shooting there today, which was the second in a week in that postcode.  This DEIS band 1 school is acutely disadvantaged and on the basis of one student, it is being told it will lose a teacher.<br/><br/>We would love the Minister to get to his feet today and tell us there will be pause or moratorium, and no school in the country will lose a teacher in September given the circumstances we are in.  I appreciate that he cannot make that commitment, as it would be expensive and not every situation is the same.  I ask him to look at it nonetheless or at least to have a sympathetic appeals process that would take into account schools like this going through such a position, meaning they will lose a teacher unnecessarily in September.  I have sent him the details and I hope he or the Department will look on the case sympathetically.  I know he has said the process is independent but he can start a new process so a school like this would not lose a teacher in September.<br/><br/>The Minister mentioned July provision and I appreciate a large element of his statement was about it.  It will give much comfort to people who have asked me to raise the matter with him.  I congratulate him and thank him but we need to know when dates will be known along with further details.  Please get those to us as soon as possible.<br/><br/>On the matter of schools returning, there is much disquiet because the Government's messaging is so tight when it comes to matters of commerce, business or retail but with education, the messaging is sloppy.  The Minister for Health can say in an interview in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>that schools might go back in June, for example.  In this very Chamber last Wednesday we had a questions and answers session but the Taoiseach was wondering whether schools or childcare facilities could come back more quickly because these might not be as high a risk as other areas.  The Minister might have a different position.  It is as if education is not important so people can talk off the top of their heads.  We all know the difference between hardware and homeware stores, however, because the messaging is so tight.<br/><br/>Why is the messaging around education so loose?  This is so damaging and causes much upset.  We are getting representations from teachers and parents who are wondering what on Earth is going on.  Are schools going back in June?  Will they be held over until September?  There are different views on that and nobody in the Chamber will demand that the Minister should bring schools back in June.  Nobody would want to stand over a demand that may be regretted in a number of months.  Will the Minister nonetheless give some certainty to the process, how the decision will be made, who will make it and what advice will be sought or taken on board if and when the decision is made?  If a decision is made, will schools return on a phased basis?<br/><br/>I refer to the Teaching Council.  I understand trainee teachers are having difficulty with the council, as are those who are currently registering.  Those who have made approaches to the council as of 7 April have yet to get responses and those going through Hibernia College have been told they must plough on with their online teacher training course, including going to the Gaeltacht.  Students feel that is completely unrealistic in current circumstances.  The Teaching Council oversees the process so will the Minister speak to that?<br/><br/>Others have spoken about third level students.  This pandemic has ripped open many issues that are live in society but now we have the opportunity to talk about them and perhaps do something.  Students might partake in low-paid work over the course of the summer to survive their years in third level education.</p> <p> A more robust and sympathetic SUSI system for one year would recognise those students who are trying to break out of disadvantage and, in many cases, become the first person from their households to attend third level or further education and prevent it from becoming a case of them telling themselves that they cannot do it now because they cannot get the jobs they would have got otherwise to be able to afford it and that they must drop out and think about doing something else.</p> <p> If the Minister could speak to these issues, I would appreciate it.</p></speech>

We got the relevant information in the office today and I have asked for an inspector to make contact with the school.  As the Deputy correctly pointed out, though, it is an independent process.  One of the rigid features of the teacher allocation model is that it is based on numbers.  There has to be a threshold.  The Deputy's wider proposal of departing from that system and retaining everyone who is in place currently raises financial considerations.</p>  <p>  A number of Deputies including Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in have raised the issue of SUSI and the difficulties that families will have.  These are indicative of the broader, wider and deeper questions that we as legislators in this House will be asked in the time to come.  Everything will be different and parents are under pressure.  The summer jobs that students used to have access to will not all be there.  That is a major difficulty.</p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in referenced July provision.  We are not able to implement it in the traditional way that parents are used to, but we are focused on trying to widen it if possible in a way that they are satisfied with and that stays within public health guidance.</p>  <p>  Regarding schools returning, people are seeing what is happening in Britain and elsewhere in Europe.  Speaking as a parent, never mind as the Minister for Education and Skills, no one wants schools back more quickly than me.  People want it to happen and their children to be in class, but at the heart of everything we do must be the question of whether it is safe.  Advice changes as we move along, but the NPHET advice that we have currently is that schools should return in September.  We want to put a proposal to NPHET in respect of special education and disadvantage, though.  If possible, we would like to see some schools opening to provide the relevant school programmes.  We are accepting and working towards the current advice that schools should not return until September, but the Taoiseach is anxious to have a full school programme for these students because he knows from the advice he is getting that there is a regression.</p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in also referenced the Teaching Council.</p></speech>

Obviously, some questions will require more substantial answers than others.</p><p>It was not my intention to return to the issue of calculated grades, but it is difficult to remove ourselves from it.  I was struck by the Minister's opening remarks when he stated:</p> <blockquote> 	The estimated mark [that a student will receive] is informed by a teacher's professional judgment and available evidence can be used to support the estimation of a mark.  Once a teacher has completed the stage of establishing an estimated mark for each student, those marks will then be considered as part of a school alignment process. </blockquote>  <p>I trust teachers completely.  I have spent a great deal of time in DEIS schools.  Anyone who enters that profession deserves far more than we could ever pay or assign value to.  However, there are major issues with the school alignment process.  Let me cite some of the evidence that may be used.  I apologise for being parochial, but I will use schools from my constituency in this discussion.  Last week, the Minister referenced Larkin community college, which is a wonderful school.</p> <p>Its progression rates to university in the last couple of years were as follows: in 2019, it was 59%; in 2018, it was 35% and in 2017, it was 25%.  There is a very significant upper trajectory, which is reflected across many DEIS schools.  The Minister will be aware of the various innovations over the last couple of years that progress upwards.  Looking at the private school in my area, since 2010 there have been only two years when progression rates were not 100% and in those two years the rates were 96% and 89%.  I ask the Minister to comment on the school alignment process with those factors being considered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.508" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1548" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="23:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000095#DDDDD00200"><p>I am glad the Deputy raised that school again.  I raised it last week as well.  I have great memories of my visits there.  It was involved in the P-TECH project.  It was during an aside conversation with one of the teachers that I was told about that progression.  The teacher spoke about the progression not just to university but to further education and training and apprenticeships.  They are doing this year-on-year.  I have made clear to my officials that all of the investment we are putting into disadvantage schools and DEIS schools is to work on that progression.  If there is a year-to-year progression in terms of those schools moving to stronger classes than they had the previous year, this goes back to the school alignment.  A school, be that a geography teacher in Larkin community college or a maths teacher in my old school in Milford, will sit down with colleagues to work through the guidelines and procedures that they have to follow through as from tomorrow.  There will then be an alignment with the principal and there will be an engagement looking at the progression of those individual students.</p>  <p>  The Deputy raised the good point, which I am glad he raised publicly tonight, that if schools are making year-to-year progress they should not be disadvantaged in any way.  There are other examples in other schools.  For example, a school that has introduced honours maths this year for the first time will have no comparable evidence.  It is the year that is relevant in the school alignment process and it is the school results that are key here.</p></speech>

One of the big inequalities in education is overcrowding in classrooms.  On average, there are 26 students per classroom, which is one of the higher averages in the EU.  One in five students are in classrooms of 30 students or more.  The Minister's constituency has some of the highest pupil-teacher-ratios in the country.  At any time, this is unfair.  At a time of public health crisis, it is dangerous.  How can we confront overcrowded classrooms where the pupil-teacher ratio is 30:1 plus a SNA?  This is dangerous and it cannot be allowed to happen.  What does the Department propose to do about this in regard to this September?</p></speech>

The post-primary stakeholders have been asked to make submissions.  The majority of them have already done so.  Those submissions raise queries in regard to what schools will look like in September under current health guidelines.  The current NPHET distance requirement of 2 m. does not allow for 30 students per classroom.  We are also looking at how we make the classroom work for the students, how we make it work from a learning point of view, how we make it work for students with special educational needs, how we make it work for the SNAs in classrooms and how we address the issue of hand sanitisation and ensuring that schools are cleaned in advance and potentially on a daily basis.  All of this means extra cost and potentially extra resources.  We are working through all of this and we hope to have a road map at the earliest opportunity.</p></speech>

Arguably, the class of 2021 will have an even more unfair experience than any other.  This year's fifth year cohort has lost a substantial amount of its fifth year schooling and they will be entering sixth year in an entirely new world.  We do not yet know what that will look like.  What is the plan for the fifth year cohort moving into sixth year and can it be implemented quickly to ensure that the anxiety and stress experienced by this year's sixth year cohort is not passed on to this year's fifth year cohort?</p> <p>What is the plan for fifth years and when will we see it in detail?</p></speech>

We have had individual contact from some of those students.  We need to ensure we give whatever support we can to the class of 2021 because of their lost class time and their return in September with all the challenges ahead of us.  We will prioritise them and put support systems in place to ensure that whatever time or parts of the curriculum they have lost, we work with them to make up what was lost.  The detail of that is not a finished piece because we have to decide what schools will look like collectively.  We are not yet in a position to do that, but I know from my contact and communication with the stakeholders that it is a piece of work we will continue to focus on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.514" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1560" speakername="Gary Gannon" time="23:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000096#EEEEE00300"><p>I would argue that it is a vital piece of work which we really need to see, probably before the break for the summer.</p>  <p>  Career guidance counselling, which really works as emotional support in most schools, is an absolutely vital function.  For the longest period of time, it has been completely underfunded and, I would argue, underappreciated.  When there was talk of proceeding with the leaving certificate examinations and bringing students back for two weeks beforehand, anybody who has been in an education setting recognised that the majority of those two weeks would be spent providing emotional support to students.  Is there a plan to increase guidance counselling hours next year?  Under the free education scheme, there are only 48 hours per week for schools with more than 1,000 students and a mere eight hours for schools with 200 or fewer students.  Not to be hyperbolic about it, but that works out at approximately 2.24 minutes of career guidance per student each week.  As I said, this guidance is mostly emotional support.  I cannot place too much emphasis on the importance of that support for students next year.</p></speech>

A lot of the suggestions made here tonight, be they in relation to pupil teacher ratios, extra support for guidance counsellors or similar, are budgetary considerations.  If there are changes to be made in regard to budgetary decisions for any individual Department, those decisions will have to be made by a Government with the proper governmental powers, including in terms of financial decisions, to make that happen.  One of the things on which the Department has been very clear with me is in terms of the financial projections going forward.  There is going to be a lot of extra money needed in a variety of areas to ensure we have a sustainable educational model into the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.516" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1560" speakername="Gary Gannon" time="23:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000096#EEEEE00500"><p>One of those extra allocations of money will have to be for a school book scheme.  A lot of conversation is happening around the digital divide and the quest to get iPads and laptops into students' hands.  What has happened over the past couple of months is that schools have given out books to students and a lot of those books will not be coming back.  We need to look at how we can get some of those books back into schools, which will require investment.</p>  <p>  My final point is one I mentioned last week.  I want to be constructive in my engagement with the Department.  There is a real opportunity for everyone in this Chamber to work towards a common goal in terms of education.  A Government probably will not be formed, if it is formed, until closer to July.  A lot is happening quickly and I suggest that we should have some form of an education committee where we can get people around a table, probably on a weekly basis, to discuss these issues and help each other out.  There is a space for that and a rare opportunity to work on a shared goal across the divide.  It is something on which we can do a little bit better, although the Minister and his staff have been very accommodating when we ring them up and ask questions.</p></speech>

This is obviously a vital service for students with an intellectual disability.  Can he give us a bit more meat on the bones in relation to that provision?  Could it be extended into August, if possible, because a lot of students have been out of school for a considerable amount of time and the service is vital for them at this time?  I ask the Minister to respond before I move on to my second question.</p></speech>

We are going to come up with a summer programme and present it to health officials in terms of how it will look.</p> <p>One of the determining features of this process is to have the voices around the table.  It was important to have Down's syndrome and autism represented today, as well as the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education, NABMSE, the management body for special schools.  Those organisations came back with many concerns regarding public health.  We have many students with complex medical needs and we have to get this right from a health and safety perspective as well.  Until we determine what it is going to look like, we will be presenting this proposal to public health officials and asking if we can do it.  At the moment, however, we are looking at July or August, or it could be something that might involve some remote learning.  We are also going to focus on trying to have some of the programme in centres or schools, but we are still working on that so that it will have not only the confidence of the teaching community but also of the parents.</p></speech>

This age group includes those aged between 13 and 16 and, like their peers, they have been out of school since March.  That has taken a heavy toll on that age group and these students are at disproportionate risk of leaving school early.  Has the Department made provision regarding class sizes and extra resources for those students in DEIS schools?</p>  <p>  My educational background was in DEIS schools in Neilstown, although I do not think it was the DEIS scheme back then.  It was a completely different experience.  I am probably showing my age, but it has been about 30 years since I did my leaving certificate and that was a completely different educational experience from what it is in Clondalkin now.  When I was doing my leaving certificate, only a small number of people went on to third level education.  Now, I think it is more than 35% of people in Collinstown.  That is brilliant because education can set us free from the disadvantage of economics.  However, are resources available for school leavers?  I refer to these students in particular because they are at the age where they can fall through the cracks for all sorts of reasons.  Can the Department provide extra resources for that age group in particular?  </p></speech>

He should not be hard on himself about it being 30 years since he did his leaving certificate.  I am much older than he is; my leaving certificate was 31 years ago.</p>  <p>  This is an important issue.  I know the school completion programme is something many young people would have availed of during the summer.  When I say, therefore, that we are going to look at July provision and special educational needs, we are also going to look at the whole area of disadvantage.  We are going to build support during the summer for vulnerable groups that could potentially leave school as a result of this gap.  We are going to continue to work on disadvantage as well as special education needs.</p></speech>

This is a group of approximately 60,000 young people whose leaving certificate studies have been seriously disrupted by the pandemic and who feel that neither the Minister nor the Government are paying real attention to their concerns.  Precisely because these young people feel they are being ignored, not listened to and are unheard, I am going to start by reading some of their words into the record.  I am going to start with the words of a young woman named Caoimhe who messaged me.  Among other things, she states:</p> <blockquote> 	Teaching myself at home has been so hard trying not to get distracted and to stay motivated.  It is easier when she was in school as you have separate environments for learning and then home life.  Trying to do both in a home environment is very hard, while also trying to stay positive and not get bogged down in the global pandemic affecting everything around us.  </blockquote>  <p>My second quote is from Rachel.  As well as being a fifth year student, she is working on the front line in this pandemic.  She states:</p> <blockquote> 	I have and still do work five days a week in a nursing home, a nursing home that battling this pandemic.  Wearing full PPE and completing my job in work is draining enough without having to come home at  4 o'clock to try and complete online courses ... Online courses, classes or exercises can't begin to compare with the real thing. </blockquote>  <p>She states that she wants a response from the Department about the situation in which fifth year students find themselves.  </p> <p>As the Minister might expect, there is a wide variety of views among the students as to what should happen next.  However, having carefully read their correspondence, it seems to me that they are united in the view that, at the very minimum, changes need to be made to make allowances and concessions for the students to fully take account of the fact that they have been seriously disadvantaged.  They are seeking significantly more than catch-up time next year.</p> <p> I support the points raised by them, but I would go a step further.  I have long believed that the leaving certificate is an out-of-date system, which places too much strain on the mental health of young people.  I have long favoured increased State investment in third level to open it up for all who want it and to remove the pressures associated with accessing it.  Given the cancellation or postponement of the leaving certificate this year, the crisis facing the leaving certificate next year and the increased number of voices within the education system questioning the exam itself on the grounds of fairness and stress pressures, I ask the Minister to set up a review of the leaving certificate exam system to deliberate and make recommendations on whether it should be maintained or replaced with something better.</p> <p> When I questioned him on this issue last week, he stated it was a subject to which he intended to return.  I invite him to do so this evening.  If he is not in a position to give a detailed response, I invite him to answer three questions.  First, does he accept that the leaving certificate course has been seriously disrupted for fifth years and that significant action must be taken to counter the disadvantage under which they now labour?  Second, when he will have a detailed response for fifth years?  Surely it is unfair that they be asked to wait for an entire summer before receiving clarity on this issue.  Finally, I ask him to comment on my proposal that there be a review of the leaving certificate that will consider options, including its abolition and replacement with something better.</p></speech>

It is the subject of focus within the Department because many fifth years have lost out on curriculum time.  No fifth year student had completed the curriculum for any subject in year one of what is a two-year programme.  We are very conscious of that.  I agree with the Deputy that it has been a massive disruption for them and the entire school cohort.</p>  <p>  On the issue of a review of the leaving certificate, as the Deputy will be aware, such a review is ongoing.  What I would suggest to the likes of Caoimhe, Rachel and the Deputy is to join the many others who have made their commentary heard through the ongoing review of the leaving certificate.

This is the first time I have engaged with him in this forum or spoken on this important topic.  I wish to put on the record the respect and high regard I have for education.  Were it not for the education that Deputies have all been so fortunate and privileged to receive, none of us would have a seat in this Chamber.  If any teachers are watching these proceedings from afar, I hope they feel justifiable pride in the professional and personal development they have provided through the years.</p>  <p>  I had ten questions lined up to fire at the Minister.</p> <p>Thankfully, approximately eight of them have already been answered.  There are only two remaining but they are of such importance that it would be best to deal with them individually.  The first question relates to the post-primary schools building programme.  Most of the Deputies in the Chamber will appreciate and recognise that the recession that is currently under way is unlike any of its predecessors.  It is neither financial nor economic in origin; rather it is biological.  Second, the escape valve that we have used in the past, that of emigration, is no longer available because international travel restrictions are still in play and will probably remain so for the foreseeable future.  Furthermore, almost every country is experiencing this simultaneous and synchronised recession.  The schools building programme is almost as important from an employment perspective as it is from and education perspective.</p> <p> I very rarely discuss constituency issues in this forum but it is useful to do so now because they illustrate a wider national issue.  There are three schools of particular importance in my constituency, the first of which is Col&aacute;iste &Iacute;osag&aacute;in in Portarlington.  It is an excellent school which is literally creaking at the seams, with twice as many students enrolled as there should be.  The situation is exactly the same in St. Paul's in Monasterevin and there is a requirement for a third school, a brand new build in the Newbridge, Curragh, Athgarvan areas.  Can the Minister provide reassurance that the schools building projects that have already been approved are likely to continue over the coming years?  Will the commitments that have been given in this regard be honoured in full?</p></speech>

A few schools that both the Ceann Comhairle and I would be familiar with were referenced in that last contribution, including Col&aacute;iste &Iacute;osag&aacute;in and the schools in Monasterevin and in Newbridge and the Curragh.  Deputy Berry will enjoy great levels of co-operation from the Ceann Comhairle and Deputy Heydon, both of whom have been very strong on this.  I want to reassure all three Deputies, who have been working very closely on this matter, that the building programme in place for this year will continue.  In fact, the building unit in Tullamore put in an enormous effort to ensure that builders were back on site on Monday.  They are in a number of the Western Building Systems schools as well.  There is an opportunity over this period to deal with a lot of outstanding works that are required too.  Any school projects that are in the pre-tender, tendering or tender award stage and any commitments that were made prior to the Covid-19 crisis are still in place.  I also agree with the Deputy's point about trying to work our way out of this pandemic.  It will be through work that we do so and we need to make sure that capital investment remains a firm priority.</p></speech>

This is a hugely important issue.  Most of the Deputies in the Chamber would have been battled hardened by their experiences in January and February on the canvas trail.  We heard tales of woe and suffering from the full spectrum of society.  It is very difficult for us to determine the most deserving sectors for our finite resources, perhaps with the notable exception of special education.</p>  <p>  I had the great pleasure of visiting St. Anne's special school on the Curragh plains during the general election campaign.  While it is a wonderful school, it has significant issues.  Many of those issues are repeated in schools nationwide.  There are five big issues about which I am constantly told.  The first relates to injuries sustained by staff at the hands of students while the second relates to the lack of clinical support for the school.  The third issue is the fact that the school has to fund-raise for basic costs like utilities and insurance.  The fourth major issue is the pressure the school is under to accept significantly more students than it is capable of accommodating.  This arises from the section 29 appeals system.  Many extra students are being forced into the school and it must accept them.  The fifth issue is the most important and relates to the student-staff ratio.  It is constantly being raised with me.</p> <p>In 1993, some 27 years ago, the special education review committee, SERC, was established and it set the staff-student ratio for special education.  There have been big improvements in the past 27 years in mainstream education, including improvements in the student-staff ratio but it has stayed pretty much static in special education and has not improved.  In light of the Covid-19 crisis, does the Minister think it is now timely and appropriate that we should reconvene or re-establish SERC with a view to re-examining what is the appropriate student-staff ratio for special education in line with international best practice?  I would be grateful to hear the Minister's thoughts. </p></speech>

Certainly, from the conversations I had on Monday with my European counterparts, I know every single country in the European Union is grappling with the same issues.</p>  <p>  With regard to special education, we are very lucky to have 125 special schools and an extra one - Danu Community Special School - came on stream last year.  I accept there are challenges within those schools and we have to ensure that whatever support we bring in is line with the demands of the sector.  The leaders within special education are very keen to have a holistic approach.  One of the pilots I have set up operates in 75 schools and is something that special schools are very interested in monitoring.  We cannot just have education working in a silo with regard to health because there are many medical complexities within these special schools.  Many are fighting for nurses to be on campus but it has to be wider than that, and it has to include nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists.  There has to be a holistic approach to education that ensures we are compliant with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in that, irrespective of a person's intellectual or physical challenge or disability, each and every student should have the same opportunity as any other student in mainstream education.  That is something we are working towards, although it is a complex piece of work.</p>  <p>  I know there was a debate during the election and reference was made to Canada, where a particular state closed all special schools.  I do not believe in that philosophy and I think our 126 special schools play a pivotal role.  In order for them to grow and get stronger, all the issues around staff-student ratios will be on the table in the future. </p></speech>

He might do his best to answer in the time allowed or, alternatively, to give me the replies in writing.</p>  <p>  Can the Minister offer further clarity around the delivery of the July provision for this year?  Can he let us know when it is intended for third level colleges to return?  As he can imagine, there is a lot of stress attached to third level, along with the financial pressures.  Can he offer clarity on this very important issue?  Will funding be provided to primary, secondary and third level institutions to help them adapt the physical layout of their buildings to comply with whatever measures will be in place for their reopening, in particular as it is envisaged that primary and secondary schools will reopen in September?</p>  <p>  I asked in the past about leaving certificate students who take subjects outside of school.  I am getting feedback from parents about an unwillingness from some schools regarding seeking feedback from outside teachers, such as, for example, outside music instructors, or where, for example, a student may originally be from Spain and is taking Spanish for the leaving certificate, but not taking it within the school.  What happens in these types of cases and what onus will be put on schools to give accurate grades to these students? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-20a.532" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1548" speakername="Joe McHugh" time="00:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052000100#JJJJJ00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions and for his contribution last week.</p> <p>We have been deliberating on a number of areas that he raised then and he has returned to the issue of students doing leaving certificate subjects outside of school.  It will be guided by the direction in the guidelines that will be published tomorrow.  Schools and teachers will be given these guidelines and instructions.  This is after a process of engagement where high-level discussions were going on since the end of last week and all weekend, right up to last night, with regard to the education stakeholders being happy with the guidelines for calculated grades.</p> <p> With regard to the Deputy's example of a subject being done outside of school, whether by a Spanish tutor, a music school or a music teacher where a student decides to take music outside of school, the detail on this to be published tomorrow will be that assessment can be made by tutors outside of the school but we will have specific cases that will be difficult, where students have been working and studying for the leaving certificate with no tuition and doing it from home.  What we will do in this instance is look at every individual case and see whether there is any evidence to determine what the assessed result will be.  The Deputy is correct to identify it again because it is a difficult area and it will be difficult to assess where there has been a complete absence of tutors or teachers.</p> <p> With regard to the physical buildings, if we are looking at a September reopening under the current medical and public health guidelines, potentially we are looking at a staggered return initially.  We are looking at a lot of added costs in terms of hygiene and cleaning schools on a daily basis and ensuring provision of personal protective equipment or other resources.  This is an area that we are working through.  The submissions coming from the post-primary and primary stakeholders will form part of how we develop this.  From the point of view of parents and students, we have to ensure this information is available at as early an opportunity as possible.  I will ensure the communication channels are kept open through this House.  If people want to contact me directly I am always open to this.</p> <p> The Deputy also asked about July provision.  I want to look at a programme of events this summer that will cover disadvantage and special educational needs.  The engagement and consultation has started with the stakeholders.  I am very keen to ensure parents of children with special educational needs have confidence in a summer programme.  It will be optional, obviously.  We will not put out a summer programme that is compulsory or that requires all students to be part of it.  It will be optional and parents will have to have confidence.</p></speech>

Bheinn l&aacute;n-s&aacute;sta le freagra&iacute; scr&iacute;ofa mura bhfuil go leor ama againn.  The first issue concerns the impact of Covid-19 on rural schools.  I have been very concerned about this issue for some time and as a former principal of a rural school, I believe the current system is neither working nor fit for purpose in terms of staffing schedules and the bands.  I know of many schools throughout the constituency of Laois-Offaly that have lost much-needed and valued teachers simply because they were a couple of pupils short of the number required to retain the teacher.  This will become more of a problem with the social distancing measures that will come into our schools.  I appeal to the Minister because there is huge concern among teachers and parents and it is unfair to the children themselves.  I appeal to the Minister to impose a moratorium in respect of schools losing teachers in the short term.  In the long term, if he is still the Minister with responsibility for education, I would appreciate any effort to carry out a review.  It is long overdue.</p> <p>Rural schools have been disadvantaged for too long now and I appeal to the Minister on that.  Pupil-teacher ratios in Ireland are higher than the European average, which is another reason we should review the staffing schedules in rural schools.</p> <p> The next issue I want to raise concerns the accommodation fees of third-level students.  I have been contacted by many parents in the constituency and I believe the current situation is completely unfair.  Could there be a statutory obligation put on landlords to refund the accommodation fees of these students?  It could make the difference between students returning to college or not, particularly if they come from disadvantaged backgrounds.  We have seen that the leaving certificate examination fees are being refunded, which is only right.  I would like to see the same thing happening in respect of accommodation for our third-level students.</p> <p> I want to raise an issue concerning Gaelscoil na Laochra, Birr.  I received a response last week on that school.  It badly needs to move to permanent accommodation because its current accommodation is hindering its progress and development.  It cannot reach its full potential or enrol the number of students it would like to because of the inadequate space in the current premises.  I would like a timeline to be provided as I got the answer but there is no timeline.  My fear is this will be kicked further and further down the road.  It is an urgent and pressing issue.  Can the Minister provide some sort of timeline to give the school a sense of progress and allow it to plan for the move to a permanent premises, which is long overdue?</p> <p> On the teacher training colleges, has there been engagement on the students' school placements?  These placements play a vital role in assisting schools in their work and in developing a student's future career in teaching.  They will be needed now more than ever in a pragmatic sense, given that we will be socially distancing and have children of different ability levels within our schools.  They could play a crucial role in our schools in assisting teachers in the autumn.  I have engaged with one institute of education on this issue but I would like to hear the Minister's view.  It is a very pragmatic approach and would benefit both the student teacher and the school.</p></speech>

Fine Gael also committed to reducing the PTR in future budgets.</p>  <p>  Maidir le Gaelscoil na Laochra i mBiorra, chas m&eacute; leis an gceannaireacht uilig an bhliain at&aacute; imithe thart agus t&aacute; s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir sa scoil agus sa cheantar seo go mbeidh an scoil seo iontach t&aacute;bhachtach.

If the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister might indulge me for 30 seconds, I would like to mention that today is World Bee Day.  The connection to education is that many primary schools have excellent projects on the importance of bees to our ecosystem.  In that context, I want to mention the late Philip McCabe.  He was a neighbouring county man of the Minister's and died a year and a half ago.  Philip was president of Apimondia, the International Federation of Beekeepers Associations.  More than that, he educated and informed many of us on the importance of bees to our entire ecosystem.</p>  <p> My question is on the progress of the technological university, TU, for the north west.  There are three institutes of technology: Sligo IT, Letterkenny IT and Galway-Mayo IT.  They are awaiting their technological university research network, TURN, funding.  I know it normally comes later in the year but with Covid and so on their incomes have collapsed.  Can the Minister guarantee that the funding is still coming?  Is there any possibility it might come earlier to allow the necessary work to be done?</p> <p>On the Government priorities, the three institutes are working together to get a submission by the end of the year.  The Minister will be aware that Letterkenny Institute of Technology, LYIT, has also received funding to strengthen its cross-Border links with Ulster University Magee.  I support any cross-Border co-operation and it has potential for the entire north west.  The setting up of a technological university, TU, is a huge body of work and takes real commitment. <i></i>I am concerned that the cross-Border project might in some way delay the setting up of the TU.  We are aware that even when we are on the list in the north west we tend to come at the bottom of it.  I will not go into the detail.  The Minister knows that already.  In that context, will the Minister guarantee that the setting up of the TU in the north west will not be negatively affected in any way by cross-Border work between LYIT and Magee?  I am not asking the Minister to prioritise institutes, I am asking him to prioritise projects.</p></speech>

It made considerable progress in the back end of last year and they will continue that work.  It will be an important project.</p>  <p>  There has always been an historical link between Letterkenny Institute of Technology and Ulster University Magee.  There has also been much collaboration with the higher level institutes in the north west.  There is an historical relationship there.  We have a memorandum of understanding, which we lodged within the Department.  There is absolutely no reason why one cannot have a dual process happening there with regard to collaboration on a cross-Border basis on one level and then building towards a technological university at another level.</p>  <p>  If we continue with those relationships on a cross-Border basis, it will benefit Sligo, Mayo and Galway as well as Letterkenny.</p></speech>

I do not want anything to interfere with its progress.  The Minister has answered me.</p>  <p>  As I have 30 seconds remaining I have a question on the calculated grades, to which the Minister can respond in writing.  I am aware the Minister is setting the criteria.  I have listened to every word the Minister has said in this debate from my office so I will not ask that question again.  I have, however, been asked by individual teachers if there is any clarity around indemnifying individual teachers in their work on the calculated grades for the leaving certificate?</p></speech>

It is vitally important that the organisations are happy with what is proposed.  I hope the Department will go towards meeting that.  There must also be a move to expand the July provision.  Children who have special needs have been out of the school setting for so long.  I hope the Minister will take that on board when dealing with the issue.</p>  <p>  Deputy Harkin referred to the north-west technological university and I will be really parochial now with regard to the Killybegs location.  The Killybegs campus of LYIT appears to be getting left behind by Letterkenny.  I want to make sure the Minister is aware of this and that it does not happen.  The Killybegs campus is in a vital location for a north-west university and it needs to be protected.  Unfortunately, I believe it needs to be protected from its own masters first.  We need some outside help in that regard.</p>  <p> I want to address SUSI grants and the process that will happen this year for applications and so on.  Applications are now open.  In order to streamline the process, there will be many changes in income circumstances from last year that people will have to apply on.  Rather than having to apply with all of one's income details for last year and then having this year's income considered in another process, it would make more sense to go direct and to assess people on their income this year.  It would shortcircuit the process and reduce the level of administration and so forth.  High numbers of people will impacted, given the change of circumstances this year, but the normal procedure does not allow this year to be taken into consideration until last year's income has been considered first.  That should be looked at.</p> <p> Will the Minister give consideration to basing the SUSI grant income assessment for PAYE workers on net income?  PAYE workers do not have any way to manipulate their income.  We know from experience that workers who are income-assessed can manipulate their income to facilitate their qualifying for the payment.  I ask that that be considered for PAYE workers.</p> <p> In the case of the top-up grant, I ask that an income level of &euro;24,000 be used rather than one's social welfare entitlement.  I know of people working in jobs who earn less than social welfare recipients but who cannot get a top-up because they are working.  That should be addressed on an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

My commitment in my time as Minister for Education and Skills has been to ensure that Killybegs will remain at the heart of the future technological university.  To reassure people in Killybegs and those working there, where sometimes they might have felt on the periphery of Letterkenny, they will now be between Sligo and Letterkenny in terms of the new technology.</p></speech>

Killybegs has made a great contribution to date as part of the institution, not only given its historical track record of bringing through tourism, catering and all the other courses that have been worked on over the years, and it has a strong future.  It certainly has my support.</p>  <p>  On the issues with SUSI grants, I will take all those suggestions on board.  There has been a transformative change in education in recent weeks and months.  Almost on a daily basis now, we deal with a new issue.  If we think that an issue presented to us in the morning is the priority issue, the one in the afternoon will eclipse it and in turn will be eclipsed by another in the evening.  There is no shortage of issues.</p>  <p>  I appreciate the interventions in the House.  As I say to my officials, whether Deputies are in opposition, on another side of the House, in another party or an Independent, they have a role to play in trying to figure a way out of this.  We will figure a way out of it but doing it on a collective basis is the most important thing.</p></speech>
