The first report, which was published on 9 May 2017, primarily focused on the unwinding of the financial emergency measures legislation.  The Government asked the commission, in making its findings, to take account of evidence on recruitment and retention issues arising in the public service.  The commission found that "evidence suggests that there are not significant recruitment difficulties to the various large scale public service vocational streams".  It advised that "consideration could be given to commissioning a more comprehensive examination of underlying difficulties in recruitment and retention in those sectors and employment streams where difficulties are evident".  Under the terms of the public service stability agreement, PSSA, the commission was commissioned to undertake a more comprehensive examination of the limited recruitment and retention issues in the public service.  The commission's work is constrained by its terms of reference and by the PSSA and does not amount to a review of the pay a particular group or groups of workers.  As Deputies will be aware, the commission's second report focused on recruitment and retention in our health services.  It concluded that "current pay rates do not appear to be unduly affecting the number of nurses, midwives and doctors applying to work abroad".  It considered that "national levels of nursing and midwifery turnover rates do not indicate a generalised retention crisis".  It found that "the available evidence suggests that none of the turnover rates reported are significantly out of line with those experienced in private sector employment".  The commission made a number of recommendations, which I accept.  I want to use this opportunity to thank it and to acknowledge the work it has done to date.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-24a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102400003#A00800"><p>The Minister has spoken about the challenges and difficulties that exist in the health area, for example with regard to staff turnover.  Any Deputy who engages with his or her constituents, particularly in a constituency where there is a large cohort of health professionals working in the local hospital, will be aware that there are major problems with hiring and retaining staff.  The overwhelming rejection of the deal by 94% of members of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, confirms what I am saying about the feeling within the health service.  What is the Minister's view?  Given that the INMO has overwhelmingly rejected the proposal, how does he intend to advance?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-24a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102400003#A00900"><p>As I indicated in my Budget Statement earlier this month, I will be accepting the Public Service Pay Commission's recommendations on recruitment and retention in the health sector.  Of course we are willing to engage with representatives of the health service, while making it very clear that our pay bill and our pay policy are determined through the PSSA.  Our public pay figures for next year, and under the remainder of this agreement, are very clearly set out.  I want to take this opportunity to ask Deputy Troy to confirm what Fianna F&aacute;il's policy in this area is.  At an Oireachtas committee meeting earlier this year, Fianna F&aacute;il's health spokesperson acknowledged:</p><blockquote>Starting with doctors, numerous sources say our doctors are still some of the best paid in the world .... we are in the top ten [countries] .... the reality is that our doctors are not badly paid, but well paid .... it appears that our nurses are pretty well paid.  Our doctors also appear to be well paid.</blockquote><p>What is Fianna F&aacute;il's policy in this area?  Its health spokesperson acknowledged earlier this year that pay levels are good and reflect the quality of work that is going on in our health services, but he argued for more pay on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; last Friday.  Does Deputy Troy accept the Public Service Pay Commission's recommendations in respect of recruitment and retention?</p></speech>

He is in government and is responsible for making decisions.  It is the Minister, and not any Deputy on this side of the House, who has the executive functions.  Does he believe that if the Public Service Pay Commission's report is fully implemented, it will resolve the recruitment and retention issues in the health service?  He seems to think there are no recruitment and retention issues in the health service, but it is clear that such issues exist.  What are the plans for recruiting and retaining staff within the health service?  Does he think the system will cope with the new demands associated with our increasing population and the roll-out and implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare?  I am speaking quite parochially as a representative of Longford-Westmeath who engages with the health professionals working at Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar.</p><p>They are at breaking point in their ability to recruit and retain key staff.  That is a fact.</p></speech>

I accept the recommendations and analysis put forward by the Public Service Pay Commission.  It stated we have challenges in particular areas.  I accept the recommendations it has put forward on what needs to be done from a targeted allowance point of view.  My answer is very clear.  On that basis I and the Department of Health will engage with representatives from nursing.  In acknowledging where I stand on the issue, it is important for everyone, and particularly for Fianna F&aacute;il as the main Opposition party that has made great efforts under Deputy Michael McGrath, to be clear on where they stand on key issues of economic responsibility.</p>  <p>  Who speaks for Deputy Troy's party on this matter?  Is it Deputy Michael McGrath, Deputy Cowen, Deputy Troy himself or is it Deputy Donnelly?  If it is Deputy Donnelly, then he is saying different things depending on the audience.  My understanding is that Deputy Troy's party is committed to the implementation of the public service stability agreement.  If that is the case, I want to understand from Deputy Troy if his party accepts the recommendations of the Public Service Pay Commission and is it willing to be clear in outlining that in order to manage new service demands and new resourcing needs we need to be careful about how we manage our public sector wage bill?</p></speech>

What are the plans of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, for pay equalisation as announced in the budget?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-24a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102400004#B00900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 to 59, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>After the passage of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017 in the Oireachtas, I accepted an amendment to section 11 of that Bill that required the preparation of a report on new entrant pay.  The report was furnished to the Oireachtas in March this year and provided the context within which negotiations on this issue were recently completed.  The measure announced provides for a pathway to address the remaining salary scale issues in a way that is both balanced and sustainable.  It provides the fairest and the most affordable path to managing the &euro;200 million cost I have identified as being associated with this issue.</p>  <p>  The agreement we have reached provides for two interventions in the pay scale of these public servants.  One will take place on point 4 of the pay scale and the second will take place on point 8.  If accepted, this measure will apply from 1 March 2019 and will be applied to each eligible new entrant as he or she reaches the relevant scale points, points 4 and 8, on his or her current increment scale.  This will have the effect of bypassing the relevant points on the scale and thereby reducing the time spent on the pay scale for progression to the maximum point.  This measure will benefit over 61,500 public servants who have been recruited since 2011 and underscores the value of being part of the Public Service Stability Agreement, PSSA, 2018-2020.  This will include, for example, 16,000 teachers, 5,000 special needs assistants, SNAs, and almost 10,000 nurses.  It is estimated that some 58% of new entrants will benefit from this measure in 2019, rising to 78% or 47,750 people by 2020.  All new entrants will have received the two point jump by 2024 with carryover costs falling in 2025.</p>  <p>  This is a measured agreement that allows for progress in this area but does not compromise our ability to make progress on other societal priorities such as health and the provision of social and affordable housing.  As such, it is both fair to public servants and fair to all those who depend on our public services.  The cost of this measure in 2019 will be &euro;27 million and this was provided for in budget 2019.  The benefits under this measure will be effective from 1 March 2019 and will be restricted to parties adhering to the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-24a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1280" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102400004#B01000"><p>I am sure the fact that four of the five Priority Questions today are on this issue indicates its importance, not just to the Opposition but to the Minister as well and, more importantly, to the public sector workers who will be affected by this.  I appreciate the extra time being given because the questions are grouped.</p>  <p>  I am sure the Minister is aware of the ballot last week by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO.  Of those who cast their vote, 94% rejected the proposals that are going to be brought forward by the Government.  The executive council of the INMO confirmed it would consider industrial action at its next meeting.  The organisation's president also gave a stark warning to the Minister and his Government by stating that they were "sleepwalking into a serious industrial dispute".  The teachers' unions have also criticised the Minister's proposals for failing to deliver pay equality and, as a consequence, failing to tackle the recruitment and retention crisis of which Deputy Troy spoke.</p>  <p>  The reality is there is not going to be pay equalisation until 2024, 2026 with the carryover cost, but 2024 as the Minister indicated in his reply.  This is completely unacceptable to many public sector workers, as indicated by the INMO ballot.  This was a political decision.  There is nothing stopping the Minister from implementing pay equalisation over one, two, three or four years.  He has chosen to stretch it out to 2024 for political reasons.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-24a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102400004#B01200"><p>On the two points Deputy Jonathan O'Brien has made, first this does represent a genuine and comprehensive effort from the Government, and myself, to respond to the issue of new entrant pay.  I am honouring the commitment I gave in the public service stability agreement.  To give an example of what this means, we can look at the teaching profession.  The move I am proposing to make with the adjustment of two points will mean that the first point of the teaching scale at which recruitment occurs - as Deputy O'Brien knows it is currently &euro;36,318 - will move to &euro;37,692.  That is a significant change in pay level at that point on the pay scale.  It seeks to deal with the issues raised by unions in respect of new entrant pay and to recognise the value all public servants contribute, and our front-line public servants in particular.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's second point about the decision made that these changes be spread over a number of years, this is a political decision.  It is a political decision I made as Minister to try to ensure I have the ability to meet this need while also meeting all of the other service needs in coming years.  Deputy Jonathan O'Brien is aware of those needs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-24a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102400004#B01300"><p>I listened to the reply from the Minister.  There is a process underway within the unions.  It is not fully complete and I do not want to pre-empt it.  Pay inequality in the public service, however, between our teachers, special needs assistants and nurses is causing friction within staff rooms and hospital wards.  It is harming the morale of workers.  From what the Minister has said, his intention is that this is not going to be resolved until 2026.  If we are to wait until then for this to be resolved, it is going to lead to problems over the next eight years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-24a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1292" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102400004#B01400"><p>To respond to Deputy Troy, I understand the issues pay inequality has caused.  I have engaged with the matter through my representatives and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform over the last year.</p><p>We believe this is a comprehensive proposal that looks to address the issue, and it has been acknowledged as such by some unions.  There is a process under way and, as it is under way, it is incumbent on me to point out the benefits of this approach and also to make the point that it offers the ability to meet other needs that arise, for example, in regard to education and our health services.  That is why we have put such effort into this proposal.</p> <p>  The Deputy said it will take a number of years for this matter to be dealt with but it is worth making the point that a large number of those affected by this issue will see a change in their circumstances beyond the public service stability agreement during 2019.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-24a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1433" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="10:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102400005#C00200"><p>I think it shameful that the Government has decided to institutionalise two-tier pay and pay discrimination against new entrants until 2024, and that Fianna F&aacute;il, let us be clear, has agreed to that continuation.  I salute the members of the INMO for their resounding rejection of the proposal, with 94% voting against.  It is solidarity in action, understanding that an injury to one is an injury to all and refusing to be divided.  Ms Phil N&iacute; Sheaghdha made the point that her members are telling us they cannot go on with this number of unfilled vacancies; it is not safe for patients and it is not safe for staff.  This is not just about those who are affected but about the ability to recruit to and fulfil our public service positions.  Teacher unions are currently balloting and I hope the teachers will follow the action of the nurses in rejecting this institutionalisation of two-tier pay.  The Government could then be faced with joint action by teachers and nurses to finally reject this entrenched pay inequality.</p></speech>

Let us look at the facts.  In 2019, if this agreement is accepted, 58% of those who entered during the new entrant period will benefit from this agreement, and this will increase to 78% by 2020.  Underneath those percentage figures is the reality that this is an agreement which will offer benefits to 47,750 of our public servants who do such valuable work in our hospitals, classrooms and all across the public service and Civil Service.</p></speech>

Effectively, the Minister said this will take at least 16 years for 300,000 public servants so that rather than having one decade of austerity, they are heading for two decades.  Were there not other options for moving to immediate pay equalisation under section 11 of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017?  The Minister and other Deputies will know that, any time we visit a school, we find the whole issue of pay equality comes to the forefront.  The 16,000 new teachers hired since 2011 consistently raise this with us as a grave injustice.  The Minister explained the jump in the two increments but we are not returning to pay equality.</p>  <p>  I met several delegations of hospital doctors and consultants just last week.  Yesterday, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, said the two-tier system is clearly a factor which is profoundly affecting recruitment and retention.  He said it is estimated it would cost &euro;45 million to bring the pay of new entrant consultants into line with their colleagues.  Week in, week out, we hear of children waiting for mental health assessments and other assessments but we simply do not have the staff to do that and we cannot retain the staff we have.  It is a grave injustice.  The Minister needs to unwind FEMPI once and for all.</p></speech>

I do not know if the Deputy has missed what we have been doing and what I have been looking to do in successive budgets.  The last item of FEMPI legislation I brought in front of the House about a year ago lays out a path whereby the majority of our public servants on low and middle incomes will see the FEMPI measures that were applied to them gradually unwound, and they will see their wages increased back to levels that are affordable for the State and allow us to meet all the other service needs we have.  I am in classrooms in primary schools every week and I have heard the issues the Deputy is raising in regard to the concerns teachers have about their careers and where their wage levels stand.</p></speech>

What the Deputy is not recognising in what he said is that austerity tends to be defined by reducing public expenditure and reducing pay.  We are doing the opposite.  We are increasing public expenditure and we are affordably increasing pay.  Regarding what the Deputy said about retention and staffing difficulties, he is not acknowledging that, in the past number of years, we have increased the number of public servants we have working for the State and in our front-line services.</p></speech>

The full cost of pay equalisation is &euro;190 million.  The Minister has set aside &euro;75 million out to 2020 and he will then spread the rest out up to 2026.  We are not talking billions of euro.  It will cost &euro;190 million for industrial harmony and to try to bring people back to levels of equality post-2011.  It is not a huge ask.  People look at the recovery and the amount pumped into banks, to which, by the way, the Minister is still giving tax breaks.  He could have addressed that in the budget by way of a bank levy and he would have had more than enough to fund &euro;190 million.  I do not say it should have been done over one year but to do it out to 2026 is unacceptable.</p></speech>

In the event that the majority of the unions reject the proposals that are in place, what is his plan and how is he going to deal with this issue?  As I said, there is an uneasiness within our public services, for example, in the classrooms, to which the Minister alluded.  How will he ensure this issue is addressed in advance of 2026?</p></speech>

It is deeply ironic because, on this issue, it is the Government which, continuing the actions of previous Governments, is precisely dividing people and trying to divide between new entrants and older entrants, with the result that teachers and lecturers starting at the bottom of their scales get paid more than &euro;4,000 less than if they had started in 2010.  The INMO, in voting against those proposals, stands for unity and for people to say they stand together and reject the division that the Government is trying to impose on them.  It would be excellent if the teachers took the same stand in the ballots that are currently taking place.  It is the best way to reject the Government's continued approach of divide and rule.  If teachers and nurses were to stand together to reject these agreements and to threaten industrial action, the Government could be brought to heel and forced to cough up to pay for pay equalisation and to end pay discrimination now.</p></speech>

The report we got from the Parliamentary Budget Office in regard to the &euro;190 million showed that the adjustments would be something like &euro;80 million for health, similar for education, &euro;12 million for the justice area and &euro;4 million for the local authorities.</p><p>Thus, for a relatively small measure in the context of the total budget we could begin to address this problem.<br/><br/>I will return to a point made by the last delegation I met.  They were representing the hospital consultants.  They made a powerful case by saying the people recruited after 2011 had a 57% cut in salary.  Moreover, there was a 25% difference over nine years, even with some of the more recent changes.  The example I was given compared Ireland with countries like Sweden and Norway.  On the basis of the level of consultants <i>per capita</i>Ireland compares in an adverse way.  For example, there was no mention from the Minister about the acute beds in the budget speech or the type of staffing led by consultant doctors that we need.  We have only nine paediatric emergency consultants in the country, while the profession and the health sector estimate that we need something like 30 consultants.  We are spending approximately &euro;114 million per year on agency doctors when it would only cost &euro;20 million to introduce pay equality.  The Minister seems to have his priorities wrong in this area.  If we want to have a vibrant well-led health sector, then we need to expedite this process in the coming year or so.</p></speech>

We have a health service that, despite many of the difficulties it faces every day in the accident and emergency units, through its front-line workers, by and large delivers better health outcomes for our citizens.  Due to the efforts of our staff and the resourcing and support they get, when our citizens get into the system they get the care and focus they need and deserve.  We have a system that is capable of responding to the health needs of our citizens.</p>  <p>  I will go through each of the points that have been put to me in turn.  I will begin with what Deputy Troy said.  A process is under way.  The process involves votes being cast and then counted.  I am clear about the proposition that we have negotiated with the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I believe the proposition can make a difference to a large number of public servants quickly while also meeting all the other service needs that have been raised with me, even those raised during this session.</p>  <p>  I stand by what I said to Deputy Paul Murphy.  It is noticeable that he used the language of threats to Government.  I am interested in trying to constructively engage with other stakeholders and reach agreements with our citizens that deliver outcomes for them, including outcomes relating to their wages and relating to meeting all the other priorities that we expect Government to be able to respond to.</p>  <p>  From what Deputy O'Brien said one moment ago, it appears he wants this issue dealt with within a single year.</p></speech>

In fairness, Sinn F&eacute;in has outlined ways in which tax could be raised to do that.  However, my contention is that the tax measures Sinn F&eacute;in has outlined involve multiple tax increases and dealing with those sectors of employment that create jobs.  At a time of such potential uncertainly due to Brexit we need to ensure that policies are being implemented by Government that can retain and create further jobs as opposed to affecting them through the kind of tax raises Sinn F&eacute;in is looking to bring forward.</p></speech>

There are consequences with regard to what Sinn F&eacute;in is looking for in terms of our banking system.  I realise we will be dealing with this matter during the Finance Bill.  I have published a paper that deals with the consequences of treating our banking sector differently.  There are consequences, including consequences for consumers of those banks.  There are consequences for those in our economy who need credit from those banks.  Finally, there are consequences for our State, which still owns a large chunk of those banks.</p>  <p>  I will address what Deputy Broughan said as well.  I have acknowledged the issues that have arisen and my determination to make progress in this area.  Will Deputy Broughan acknowledge that since 2011 over 61,500 new entrants have joined our public services?  That amounts to almost 19% of the total workforce.  In our efforts to treat them in the way I have described, we put forward a proposition that, I hope, will be favourably considered.</p></speech>

One focus of this contingency planning has been the adequacy of the current port and airport infrastructure and facilities post-Brexit.  Physical infrastructure at Rosslare Europort, Dublin Port and Dublin Airport have been assessed to identify the requirements necessary to ensure customs controls and sanitary and phytosanitary checks can be carried out while ensuring the free flow of goods is maintained in these locations.  These checks would come into force once the United Kingdom has left the European Union.  They will include checks on consignments of live animals, plants, plant and animal products, foods of non-animal origin, cosmetic products and tobacco-related products.</p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works has been working with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Health and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport as well as the relevant port and airport authorities to assist in identifying any specific infrastructural requirements in the context of Brexit.  As part of this assessment the requirements in Rosslare Europort have been taken into consideration.  Discussions are ongoing with the chief executive of Rosslare Europort with a view to formulating a detailed action plan.</p></speech>

It is our primary roll-on, roll-off port.  It is the only port or airport that has a train station.  A total of 80% of the volume of goods produced here currently goes to the Continent using the UK land-bridge.  If there is a hard Brexit then there will be tailbacks in the port.  It needs to be developed to meet these demands.  Time and again, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has failed to set out plans for the port to become a driver of the economy of Wexford and the south-eastern region.  Rosslare Europort makes a profit of &euro;2.5 million annually but it looks like a ghost town.  If the profit was reinvested in the port instead of being returned to its owner, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, it would leverage approximately &euro;15 million on the international market.</p>  <p>  In March this year the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Moran, told my colleague, Deputy Browne, that Revenue Commissioners staff needed additional accommodation and that a suitable site had been identified.

Our port infrastructure will be even more important to how we maintain access to the Single Market.  My assessment differs a little from that of Deputy Troy in the idea of Rosslare as a ghost town but I accept more needs to be done in terms of the potential for the town in future.</p>  <p>  Deputy Troy asked about the position at the moment and the engagement of the Office of Public Works with the port.

There are real concerns in both Rosslare Europort and in other ports that we are not going to have the necessary infrastructural improvements made in time.

The targets are never met, the human misery continues and the plan is fundamentally flawed in its reliance on the private sector.  Aside from all of that, has the Minister actually looked at the insane cost if the Rebuilding Ireland policy were actually to work?  Some 137,000 units that the Government hopes to deliver under that plan are going to be sourced from a private sector in which rents are going through the roof.

There are a variety of objectives behind this mix including the appropriateness of support, flexibility and speed of delivery, as well as value for money for the Exchequer.  The paper from my Department to which the Deputy has referred on other occasions sets out the relative cost of these delivery mechanisms based on data across six local authorities.  The report is careful to acknowledge that there are factors which may vary by local authority area, for example prices within the wider housing market, the availability and cost of land and the level of demand for social housing.</p><p>There are two current expenditure-funded schemes analysed in the report, which utilise private rented tenancies to deliver speedy responses to social housing requirements.  The housing assistance payment, HAP, and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, are important components of the accelerated delivery of social housing envisaged under Rebuilding Ireland.  It was noted in my Department's report that it may be more cost effective for the State to provide private tenancies in the short term to meet social housing needs where limited public land is available, where the cost of constructing social housing units is prohibitive or, more broadly, where timing is the key issue.<b></b></p><p>Following the review of Rebuilding Ireland at the end of 2017, there has been a renewed emphasis on increasing the number of social housing units through build programmes.  In addition to this, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has agreed delivery targets that are appropriate for particular areas, with due regard to timing, capacity, flexibility and the cost implications highlighted in the paper from my Department.</p></speech>

Only 33,000 units will be directly built.  The Department's paper actually states that in cities such as Dublin, that is going to blow a black hole in the public finances.  The cost of property and rents are ratcheting up at a dramatic rate.  We are going to be paying the landlords month after month, year after year, reaching up to a target of 97,000 different units that we will be leasing and renting.  In Dublin, rents are now between &euro;1,500 and &euro;2,500 per month.  One estimate suggests this could cost us &euro;23 billion over 20 years.</p></speech>

For 2019, the capital funding the State is making available is &euro;1.1 billion to provide new social housing solutions and directly build homes, and providing &euro;150 million of current funding to do it.  The total amount of funding next year going into delivering additional units is &euro;1.25 billion, with most of that in capital funding.  In terms of social housing support, the Deputy is correct that it is a high figure for next year of &euro;557 million, the majority of which is going into housing assistance payments.</p>  <p>  What is the Deputy proposing that we do as an alternative for 2019?  There is a great level of social housing need, of which I have as much experience as Deputy Boyd Barrett given the constituency I represent.  While we are building the homes, as we are doing in O'Devaney Gardens and will be doing in Dominick Street, do we not have a responsibility to ensure that accommodation is provided by other means to our citizens who need support in getting homes?  That is what we are doing and even for next year, as the Deputy can see on the basis of the figures I have shared with him, we are investing more in building new homes than we are in making use of homes that are already built for our citizens who deserve support.</p></speech>

It costs a fortune.  People who get HAP end up back in homeless hubs.  From the point of view of people, it is not good.  From the point of view of the public finances and a sustainable plan, it is going to be a disaster.  In 2019, the Minister is proposing 16,000 new HAP tenancies as against only 6,000 council house builds.  In 2020, he is planning 13,000 new HAP tenancies and only 7,000 actual builds.  In 2021, 10,000 HAP tenancies are planned and only 8,000 builds.  All along the way, even if there is something of an increase in direct builds, HAP tenancies dwarf what is going to be built by a factor of three or four.  It is about 100,000 of the 137,000 units.  It is not going to work and is going to cost us a fortune.  From every point of view, financial and social, would it not be better now to ramp up the direct construction of council housing?</p></speech>

Managing the delivery of public services within allocations forms a key part of the responsibilities of every Minister and Department.  My Department is in regular contact with all other Departments and offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall budgetary parameters.  The drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is reported on each month against expenditure profiles in the fiscal monitor published by the Department of Finance.  However, given the scale of Government expenditure, which is &euro;61.8 billion, and the cash basis of Government accounting, the need for Supplementary Estimates can arise for a number of reasons, including policy decisions, timing issues and overspends.  They are a budgetary tool that allows for the proper alignment of funding allocations within planned expenditure.  They can only be allowed where they can be accommodated within the overall budgetary parameters.  As set out in the most recent budgetary monitor, total gross voted expenditure at the end of September was &euro;44.8 billion, which was broadly on profile.  Net voted expenditure of &euro;36.04 billion was &euro;45 million below profile with net voted spending in 14 out of 17 Vote groups being below profile.  As outlined in the fiscal monitor, current spending is 0.6% ahead of profile, with the main driver of this variance being health expenditure.</p>  <p>  As outlined in Expenditure Report 2019, as a result of policy decisions, including in relation to the provision of a 100% Christmas bonus to social welfare recipients, additional capital for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, and expenditure pressures in the Department of Health, the gross voted expenditure outturn for the year is now estimated at &euro;62.8 billion.  This is a change of &euro;1 billion with the key element being the change in the Department of Health.</p></speech>

I see two issues.  One is the degree to which budgeting projections are accurate.  If they are not accurate, are there not contingencies?  If not, why not?  I would not regard it as good policy to find that individual Departments or their subordinate bodies were running shy of what was anticipated at the beginning of the year in one way or another, either short or ahead of expenditure.  I ask the Minister if any specific action is being taken to ensure that all Departments either project accurately or remain within budget.</p></speech>

A huge amount of engagement happens with all Departments about this.  With a small number of exceptions, the Estimates put forward to the Oireachtas for Departments tend to be either exactly met or, at times, come under profile.  I know this is the subject of engagement within the Joint Committee on Health and I acknowledge that for the Department of Health this year, the difference between projected and actual expenditure is very different to what it was last year.  This is not a matter that we can normalise moving into next year and that is why we have made such efforts to put in place such a large increase in health expenditure for 2019.  As the Deputy is aware, the projected Estimate for health for next year takes much of the expenditure for this year, puts it into the base and builds on that again to deal with all the service needs and overhead costs.</p></speech>

Having been a member of a health board, quite a long time ago, I have been conscious of the overruns in the health area for many areas.  The difficulty is that it has to be possible, at some stage, to identify precisely what the budget should be and then to be able to identify precisely the areas in which an overrun occurs, not only in the Department of Health but in all Departments.  I appreciate that capital projects may unexpectedly impact on budgets.  If a Department becomes accustomed to an overrun cushion in any given year, is there not a tendency to use that as a means of extending expenditure, notwithstanding that it already had a budget and was supposed to work within it?</p></speech>

With regard to the health budget, the Minister said he has increased expenditure for next year to ensure that does not happen again.  That is welcome.  He is plugging the hole.  How much of that was recurring spending?  I am concerned that we have &euro;1 billion of an increase in the health budget for next year and much of that was based on the windfall that we got from corporation receipts.  If that is not the case, maybe the Minister can clarify that.  I am concerned that we may not have those windfalls next year.  It is not prudent to use once-off windfalls to plug a hole in recurring spending every year.  Will the Minister confirm levels of recurring spending?</p></speech>

Deputy Durkan has acknowledged the pressures that can develop within a number of Departments, including the Department of Health, for budget overruns.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, and I have worked very hard to put in place an Estimate for next year which reflects the learning we have had about challenges that have occurred during 2018.  The way we have done this relates to a point that Deputy O'Brien has just put to me.  We have looked at levels of expenditure for this year, particularly with regard to recruitment, which we believe will continue into 2019.  We have tried to fund that in a new way.  It has meant that the current expenditure settlements that other Departments have received have had to take account of that because we have to make choices.  With regard to what Deputy O'Brien said, additional tax take for 2018 has contributed to dealing with the difficulty for this year but I am mindful of the point he has made about reliance on corporation tax next year.  This is the reason why I have not assumed that nearly &euro;700 million of the corporation tax collection that we received in 2018 will be available in 2019.  I have taken that out of my figures.  That &euro;700 million is roughly equivalent to the additional revenue raised by, for example, changing VAT in the hospitality sector and other tax measures that I put in place to try to avoid the overreliance that the Deputy is warning against.</p></speech>

In order to advance the necessary funding an exercise has to be completed by the Garda estate management, the Office of Public Works and the Department of Justice and Equality.  Regarding the current accommodation shortage issues, there are two options to be explored further.  One involves alternative accommodation to be sourced in a suitable property in the area of the existing station for consideration by all parties involved.  The availability and suitability of properties will be explored by the Garda estate management and the Office of Public Works management service.  A new extension to the back of the existing station is to be considered to determine how much extra space could be made available by building on the site.  Following further exploration of the options, we will be able to determine whether the accommodation issues of the station can be resolved in one location.</p></speech>

In January of this year the station lost its conference room.  It was redesignated as a regional cybercomputer examination room.  Even though the redesignation happened in January of last year, the posts have yet to be advertised.  I  accept that is not the Minister of State's responsibility but is a justice issue.  The loss of that conference room means that training is now taking place in hired hotel rooms in the town.  IT training is taking place in the Army barracks in Athlone, which means subsistence and travel payments are made to the garda&iacute; who must travel to the location.  We have a community policing unit which comprises of one sergeant, six garda&iacute; and a clerical officer who are working out of a prisoner interview room.  We expect our sergeant with responsibility for community policing and six garda&iacute; to work from the room where prisoners are interviewed.  A child protection unit is due to be established but it cannot be because no office is available for it.  Proposals have been submitted as to how this could be addressed.  The only issue to be dealt with is for those proposals to receive approval from the OPW to advance, and that will address the serious capacity issues in Mullingar Garda station.</p></speech>

As I outlined, the lack of space is impeding the members of the Garda in doing their work.  They are protecting the people day in, day out and deserve a work environment that is fit for purpose.  I appreciate the Minister of State stating the process involved will be accelerated and that he will have good news in the not-too-distant future.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-24a.99.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102400009#G02300"><p>This question relates to the provision of insurance cover in areas that were prone to flooding but where flood defences have now been put in place.  There are areas which have flood defence mechanisms in place that are still finding it extremely difficult to get insurance cover.  What is the Department doing to ensure this will no longer be the case?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-24a.100" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1363" speakername="Kevin  Moran" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102400009#G02400"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this question.  The Government&rsquo;s strategy is that as the return on its investment on flood defence schemes in the most at-risk communities, households and businesses should be able to access flood insurance.  The provision of insurance cover, the level of premiums charged and the policy terms applied are a matter for individual insurers.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will acknowledge that the Office of Public Works has no responsibility for oversight or regulation of the insurance industry in relation to flood risk insurance, or to insurance matters generally.  The Office of Public Works has a very specific role in the exchange of information with the insurance industry on completed flood defence schemes to an agreed standard of protection desired by the industry. </p>  <p>  A memorandum of understanding agreed on 24 March 2014 between the Office of Public Works with Insurance Ireland, the representative body for the insurance companies in Ireland, has a specific focus on agreeing a basis on which information can be provided to the insurance industry on flood relief schemes completed by the OPW.  It is important to note that the memorandum requires that while insurers take full account of information provided by the OPW on completed flood defence schemes, it does not guarantee the availability of flood risk cover in the locations for which information has been provided by the OPW.  Since that time, the level of flood insurance cover for homes and small businesses for areas protected by OPW flood defence schemes has on average increased from 77% to 82%.   </p></speech>

I certainly could take lectures from him as opposed to giving him any advice in that regard.  When people go through the trauma of having to move out of their house, having availed of cashing in their insurance policy, they will not get insurance cover again for as long as that house or business remains in an area that is on a flood plain or liable to flooding.  We would agree on that.  However, where good work has been done by the Minister of State's Department or local county councils and flood defences have been put in place which alleviate the risk of any future flooding, it is simply not good enough that people in houses in areas where that work has been undertaken, at a large expense to the State, continue to be refused house insurance.  They are living in their homes and the very minimum they can expect is to have the protection of a house insurance policy.  When can we expect the Government to ensure that in every area where flood defence mechanisms have been put in place, people will be able to avail of a house insurance policy?</p></speech>

Earlier this year thanks to my colleague on my right, the Minister for Finance, I secured &euro;1 billion for the protection of the people's property, 95% of whom will have their property protected as a result of putting in place of flood defences over the next ten years.</p><p>Where we have installed defences, we have passed on that information to the insurance companies.  Coverage has increased from 77% to 82%, which is a major improvement on where we were.  Insurers are now acknowledging work that has been done by insuring people.</p> <p> I was down the country yesterday.  Everywhere I go, people ask me to let their schemes start so that they can be protected and that they will worry about insurance afterwards.  That is not the answer that some want to hear, but protecting these people is my priority.  I have worked with Insurance Ireland and provided it with information to try to make sure that it picks up on the work we are doing and insure the people in question.</p></speech>

For the most part, the family home is people's pride and joy and the largest cash outlay they will ever make.  If anything were to happen to it, they would not have the capacity to replace it.</p>  <p>  Must legislation be introduced to address what insurance companies are doing?  I acknowledge the increase in coverage to 82%, but that leaves 18% without insurance.  Are there figures for the number of houses and people who cannot avail of insurance?  We are here to ensure that everyone can benefit from the improvements, not just a select few.  While I acknowledge the work that has been done, how can we ensure the households that are unable to avail of home insurance can do so in future, given the works that have been done?</p></speech>

Everyone wants to beat insurers with a stick, but after working with them and giving them the information they require, they are now stepping up to the mark.  I would like to see it happen faster, but I must also acknowledge that, by working with them, we are getting through the problem the Deputy outlined.  Where we have built defences and people have gone back to insurance companies through their local authorities and the OPW, they are getting insurance.</p></speech>

As I said in reply to Deputy Durkan, the key responsibility sits with each Minister and Department.</p><p>Regarding the health budget, spending on our health services is at a record level.  In 2017, OECD data placed Ireland fifth in terms of spend <i>per capita</i>among the EU 28.  As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I have made the resourcing of healthcare a key priority.  This year, I will be allocating an additional &euro;700 million by way of a Supplementary Estimate, bringing the total increase in investment in 2018 to &euro;1.2 billion.  In addition, I have announced a further increase of &euro;1.05 billion in health funding for 2019, bringing the total allocation for 2019 to &euro;17 billion.  This brings the increased investment in health over the past two years to a total of &euro;2.25 billion, or 15%.</p><p>The Government will continue to support the Minister for Health in managing one of the most important and complex sectors of our society and economy.  As the Deputy will be aware, there are always key challenges to be addressed in the health sector.  The D&aacute;il has provided Supplementary Estimates in many years, with this year being no different, albeit of a high level.</p><p>We want to provide as much as possible for people who are sick and vulnerable, in particular elderly citizens.  As our economic and budgetary circumstances allow, I will continue to invest more in our health services because it is the right thing to do.  As the Taoiseach stated yesterday, we need to tie this higher level of investment to a higher level of return.</p></speech>

Reverting to our discussion about consultants, many of them have told me that they would be prepared to pay a higher personal tax rate if it was hypothecated to health spending.  While we need more resources, the nub of the issue is that the Minister is not accounting to the House, as per his remit, for the difference between the national service plan and Vote 38.  There has been serious criticism from our two key watchdogs.  For example, Mr. Seamus Coffey of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has stated that the difference between the plan and the health Vote's spending drift is cumulative and long lasting.  As the Minister stated, we are heading towards a figure of more than &euro;2 billion in unplanned expenditure in respect of recent years.  Even more damning is the report of our outstanding PBO entitled "The HSE National Service Plan and its Relationship with the Health Vote".  While it acknowledges that the relationship is complex and there is a certain level of regular reporting, there seems to be a lack of seriousness in the Minister's Department about managing the health Vote.</p></speech>

Several Deputies noted that spending was under profile, particularly the Votes for housing and environment.  That was certainly evident in the last report the Minister gave us.  It seems incongruous that capital expenditure is running under profile in areas like housing and health.  I welcome the size of the capital budget and that we are beginning at long last to address deficient infrastructure.</p></reply>

In addition, Vote 39 for the Office of Government Procurement, which is a division of my Department, has a capital allocation of almost &euro;1 million in 2018.</p>  <p>  The purpose of capital investment undertaken by my Department, including the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, is to deliver greater effectiveness and efficiency across the Civil Service and public service.  The main areas of spend in my Department are the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO, the Civil Service learning management system and ICT projects in the OGP.  The OGCIO is the largest area of capital spend and this supports investment in ICT as part of the implementation of the public service ICT strategy, including the roll-out of the build to share programme and the eGovernment strategy.</p>  <p>  While some of the relevant subheads in Vote 11 were under profile at the end of the third quarter of 2018, all are expected to consume their full capital allocations by the end of the year.  There have been some delays on capital projects within the OGP and the indications are that there will be some savings on that Vote&rsquo;s capital allocation of just under &euro;1 million in 2018.  </p>  <p>  This information sets out the detailed position in respect of my own Department&rsquo;s capital expenditure.  The position in respect of other Department&rsquo;s capital profiles will be available to the Deputy from other Ministers.</p></speech>

I thought a key part of Deputy Donohoe's remit as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform was to keep track of what is happening in those areas.  My constituents are amazed that there is capital funding in different Departments which is not utilised, whether it relates to housing, communications or whatever.  I thank the Minister for the information on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform itself, the IT structures and other matters, but there is concern that the House votes this expenditure and it simply does not happen.  A key role of the Minister is to ensure that we get on with our infrastructure investment urgently, particularly the provision of social housing.</p></speech>

I take the Deputy's broader point.  As I said earlier in response to other Deputies, I have responsibility for the Government's overall capital expenditure.  Something different about capital expenditure this year is the fact that the capital profiles for all Departments were announced earlier in the year as part of Project Ireland 2040.  That means that all Departments had clarity before they normally would on what their capital spending profiles for this year and next year will be.  I believe we will see a change from the capital underspends that have characterised other years in many Departments.  In particular the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government is demonstrating that this year.</p></speech>

The OPW is liaising with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to source a property solution to accommodate these units based on the brief of requirements received from the Garda, including both a review of existing State-owned properties in the area and a review of the wider local property market.</p>  <p>  Representatives of the Office of Public Works and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have visited those sites under active consideration.

They have been very keen to get that centre of excellence up and running for west Cork and to provide the best possible service for people in the region.  There have been different inquiries into different sites, but it has been dragging on for quite some time.  There are also questions about whether it will remain in Bandon or move to Macroom, where a new Garda station is being planned.  I ask the Minister to clarify that.  The timeline is very important because it has been going on for so long.  We would like to see it advanced as quickly as possible so that the best service possible is available in the west Cork region, a huge region going from the coast around to north Cork, working closely with Tusla.  Is it envisaged that they would both be in the same facility?  How quickly can a decision be made on that?</p></speech>

I have been informed that this work began in November of last year and a full search of local property in Bandon took place to ensure that the various needs he has described are met.  It appears at the moment that no such property is available.  The district office staff members of the OPW were requested to commence an occupancy survey of the State-owned Garda station site itself, to see if it would be possible to extend those premises or make use of land there.  This work is currently under way and a feasibility study is due to be carried out.</p>  <p>  It was found that no other State-owned properties were available.  A review of that is under way and local landlords and agents have been contacted.  The OPW district office is now carrying out an architectural inspection of six different properties to see if it is possible to make use of them.  There appears to be a lot of work under way in this regard.  I acknowledge it is a matter that the Deputy wants to see resolved.  It is now at the stage of visits to sites by fire officers.  I hope one of these properties will yield a site suitable for the work to which the Deputy refers.</p></speech>

There is a great need to have it and I recognise considerable background work is being done on that.  The Minister has indicated that there are a number of sites being considered.  Are all of these sites Bandon based?  Is the Minister also looking at the possibility of having it in Macroom, where it is proposed to build a new station?

Ardgillan community college in Balbriggan had to close 18 classrooms and send its transition year students home for this week.  St. Luke's national school in Tyrrelstown in west Dublin, which is in the Taoiseach's constituency, has been closed due to safety concerns.  Again, students have been told to stay at home and enjoy an extended break.  The safety concerns are understandable and that is the proper way to proceed but the difficulty for parents, students and teachers is that the information is being fed to them on a drip feed basis.  They are not getting the information they need to be able to plan their lives and the lives of the students.</p>  <p>  I understand the assessments will involve up to 30 schools and while these schools seem to have passed fire and safety checks issues are now arising with regard to the quality of the work done.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, provided information to various people this morning and I understand a group was meeting in the Department on addressing a number of the issues.</p>  <p>  We want to be absolutely clear that we support the highest possible standards for health and safety within these schools.  While causing huge disruption, this work is absolutely necessary.  As we are midway through this week and as next week is the mid-term, what will parents face on Monday week when the students are due to return to the schools?  The schools we know about are Ardgillan community college in Balbriggan and St. Luke's in Tyrrelstown.  How many other schools will not be in a position to open their doors, or to open their doors fully, on Monday week after the mid-term?  Are sufficient alternative accommodations being put in place for these students and when will this information be notified to parents and to the school communities?  At what stage can we get a full assessment as to the health and safety status and the quality of the 30 or so school builds around Dublin - perhaps the Taoiseach could clarify the number - that are currently being assessed by the Department of Education and Skills?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, up to 40 schools around the country, and not just in Dublin, could be affected.  The safety of students and staff has to be our paramount consideration and I know that everyone in this House will agree.  We are also deeply conscious of the disruption and inconvenience that is being caused to staff, children and parents as a result of some of these school closures.  We very much appreciate people's understanding in that regard.  I thank the school principals and the boards of management of the three schools affected at the moment.  They are being regularly updated as inspection schedules are confirmed and as issues are identified.  We appreciate their patience and understanding also.  A dedicated contact person has been appointed within the Department who is the contact person for the school principals and the boards of management.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that there is an information deficit.  Deputy Calleary is right to bring that to our attention.  There is an information deficit for a reason.  The reason is we do not have all the information.  The situation is still evolving and will evolve over the next two to three weeks.</p>  <p>  Significant structural issues were discovered at Ardgillan community college by a structural engineer on 19 October.  The issues relate to phase 1 of the school building that was built in 2009 by Western Building Systems under a design and build contract on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  Phase 2, which was built at a later date in 2015, is unaffected.  Having considered the engineer's advice, and in the interest of health and safety of the students and staff at the school, the Dublin-D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board made the decision to close phase 1 of the school immediately.  Structural assessments were also carried out yesterday on 23 October at Tyrrelstown Educate Together and the adjoining St. Luke's national school, which were built by the same company.  Similar structural issues to those identified at Ardgillan were also identified in those schools.  While no imminent danger was identified, both schools are being closed as a precautionary measure to allow for further detailed investigations.  The target is to have interim accommodation in place for when pupils return to school after the mid-term break next week.  We intend to use the next couple of days and the opportunity of the mid-term break to check the various schools involved.  We will not know the scale of the problem, probably until the end of next week or the week after.  We need to assess if this only affects schools built in that 2008-2014 period, or if it also affects schools built in more recent years.  An examination of a school in Firhouse is happening at the moment to see if the structural flaws may also affect schools built in the last couple of years.  The schools that have been closed are all three storey schools.  We do not know yet if these structural flaws apply to single storey or second storey schools.  It will take all of next week, and perhaps the week after, for us to establish the extent of this problem.</p></speech>

The first reports were published in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, and audits have been ongoing in a number of schools since then.  We seem to be struggling to catch up with the issue this week.

A separate issue has been going on for quite some time in respect of fire safety.  This relates to structural issues.  Obviously everything will be done to find alternative accommodation for schools but it is going to be difficult.  It is not easy to find 25 classrooms.  I know people have talked about sports clubs and so on but I do not know of any sports club that has 25 classrooms, so it is going to be difficult.  Everything will be done to find interim and alternative accommodation nearby.  In respect of Tyrrelstown Educate Together and St. Luke's national school, the secondary school has some vacant classrooms which it will make available.  This is going to be difficult but the first thing we need to do is to put safety first and to make sure that children and staff are not put at risk.  The second thing we need to do is to carry out the necessary structural investigations so that we can get a full idea or full understanding of the scale of the problem.  Of course we also need to put together alternative accommodation if it is needed so that children's education is not adversely affected.</p></speech>

From what we know, the bodies buried there are those of children and babies aged up to the three years old who were unceremoniously buried without anything to identify them or their last resting place.  It is a cause of national shame.</p>  <p>  Yesterday the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, announced that a forensic excavation of the site will now take place.  I commend the Minister and the Government on that decision because it is significant and to be welcomed.  I acknowledge today the tireless work of Catherine Corless, of the survivors, of their families and loved ones, of all of those who care for those who were buried on the site, and of the campaigners who have supported them in their long pursuit of justice.  Without them yesterday's decision would not have been taken.</p>  <p>  I have a number of questions relating to what was announced yesterday which I wish to put to the Taoiseach.  The Minister, Deputy Zappone, has said that specific legislation will be required before the excavation can commence but, as of yet, she has not given any timeframe for when that legislation might be considered.  Will the Taoiseach clarify for the D&aacute;il when that legislation will come before us?  We also require clarity in respect of costs.  The cost of the forensic excavation has been estimated at between &euro;6 million and &euro;13 million.  Catherine Corless said this morning that it is in fact likely to cost significantly more than that.  From where did the announced estimate come?  How will the excavation be funded?</p>  <p>  It was announced yesterday that the religious order which ran the mother and baby home in Tuam, the Bon Secours Sisters, will contribute &euro;2.5 million to the cost of the excavation.  I put it to the Taoiseach that the order bears at least an equal responsibility to that of the State in respect of this scandal and should pay significantly more on that basis.  </p>  <p>  I commend the Minister for taking the right decision but there are significant issues relating to the announcement that need clarification and explanation.  It is important that time is provided in the D&aacute;il for the Minister to make a statement and to take questions from Members.  As the Taoiseach knows, the home at Tuam was just one of a network of institutions which systematically violated the rights of women and children.  I hope that yesterday's decision is the beginning of a process that will see similar steps taken to investigate, locate and recover remains from other such sites in a timely manner.  What is being considered in respect of other former mother and baby homes, other sites that are out there and known to us all?</p></speech>

I also recognise the various campaigners involved.  I thank the Deputy for commending the Minister, Deputy Zappone, and the Government on the decision we made yesterday.  The Government decision is to implement the multidisciplinary framework known as humanitarian forensic action.  That is the appropriate response to the discovery of remains interred at the Tuam site.  The actions being taken are as follows: a phased approach to the forensic excavation and recovery of the juvenile human remains insofar as is possible; the use of systemic on-site ground truthing and test excavations around the playground and the green areas to see if there are other potential burial sites; the forensic analysis of any recovered remains and, where possible, their individualisation and identification using DNA; thereafter, arrangements for respectful reburial and memorialisation of those remains.  The Government's decision was informed by detailed technical advice on international best practice and, most importantly, by compassion and respect for the right to dignity of the children interred at the former mother and baby home.</p>  <p>  The commission of investigation is separately continuing its work on investigating the mother and baby homes and a number of county homes.  That work is continuing and we expect to receive the commission's report in the first quarter of next year.  The facts which it establishes will further assist us in making decisions as to what we do into the future.  I have had a chance to visit the site and to meet with Catherine Corless and some of the survivors.  We made this decision yesterday.  I am not entirely sure if anyone fully knows what we are getting into, but I am absolutely sure that we have made the right decision.  If we stumbled upon a mass grave tomorrow, we would carry out an investigation and excavation.  That is what we are doing but we are going to do it on a phased basis because we honestly do not know for sure what we are getting into, although we do know it is right thing to do.</p>  <p>  It does require legislation.  The advice of the Attorney General is that in order for us to excavate a mass grave in this way, which has never been done before in Ireland, we require new bespoke primary legislation.  We expect to have that in the first quarter of next year.  The estimate comes from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  It is estimated that this will cost between &euro;6 million and &euro;12 million but again, as this has not been done before, we do not know for sure if that will be the cost.  The Bon Secours Sisters, following an approach from the Minister, Deputy Zappone, has agreed to make a contribution of &euro;2.5 million toward the cost.  This is a contribution, not a settlement.  The order has not been given an indemnity.  </p>  <p>  Many people whom I spoke to about this issue know and understand that Ireland has had a very dark past.  At one stage up to 10% of our entire population was living in institutions of some sort.  That was quite common across northern Europe.  Whether in convents, seminaries, county homes, psychiatric institutions, mother and baby homes, or laundries, at one stage about 10% of our population lived in institutions.</p></speech>

I know that some people may take the view that we should treat this as something in the past and not dredge up old issues.  Some people have told me to let sleeping dogs lie.  We have decided that is not the right approach.  We need to understand our past, to know what happened, to come to terms with it, and to try to put things right.  This is a step in that direction.</p></speech>

There is also no doubt that it is of immense importance to the survivors and their families, in the first instance, that the right thing is done but more broadly it is of immense importance for us as a society to consciously do the right thing in respect of these women and the children who were born into these institutions, those who spent time in them, those who survived them and, most particularly, those who perished.  I will repeat that, as the Taoiseach knows, the home at Tuam is not unique by any stretch.  There are many other mother and baby homes.  There are many sites where families will stand - and I have stood with them - and speculate as to whether a child, a brother or a sister who was lost is buried there and precisely where.  This is uncharted territory for us, but we need to get it right.  I urge the Taoiseach to ensure that the legislation comes forward in a timely fashion.  I will return to, and ask the Taoiseach about, the issue of costs.</p><p>It seems to me that &euro;2.5 million from the Bon Secours is an entirely inadequate contribution to the excavation.  I ask that the Government goes and seeks a higher contribution from the Bon Secours.  It strikes me that at least 50% of the costs incurred would rightfully fall to them.  Is there any sign that there will also be a contribution from the Vatican because that issue was also raised?</p></speech>

The Deputy will know the Bon Secours Sisters are not under any obligation to make a contribution but they are making a contribution of &euro;2.5 million.  We are treating it as a contribution.  I want to make it very clear to everyone in the House that this is not a settlement, this is not an indemnity; this is an initial contribution to the cost of carrying out these works.  The first &euro;2.5 million will come from the Bon Secours and the rest from the taxpayer.  It will be a very difficult operation.  One needs to see the photos to understand what will be attempted.  It is a very old mass grave.  There are the remains of children in there.  Some were stillborn and some were older.  There may also be adult remains because it was a workhouse prior to that.  It was used during the famine period as well.  There are also potentially adult remains and remains from a very long time ago.  When one looks at the photographs, one can see that the remains are intermingled - "commingled" is the term they use - and a lot of them are decomposed.  It will be slow and painstaking and, unfortunately, it will not be possible to identify all of the remains.  It will not be possible to individualise them all but we will do our best.  What we learn along the way will inform what we do with regard to other sites.  I think we are doing the right thing but I also want to contain expectations.  This will take time.  We have not done this before in Ireland.  We will have to build up the capacity to do it.  As well as that, while we will do our utmost to carry out a forensic examination, individualisation and identification, in many and perhaps most cases, it will not yield a result or answers.</p></speech>

We should remove blasphemy from the Constitution.  We should also strengthen the legislation to prohibit religious hatred.  The Labour Party introduced the original equality legislation that outlawed discrimination on the basis of religion.  We have seen a new wave of anti-Semitism in Europe and also the rise of Islamophobia.  We should outlaw the spreading of hatred, including through social media, where toxic messages undermine social cohesion.  Removing blasphemy from the Constitution is an important symbolic act.  My main concern is not that scores of people will be accused of blasphemy in the near future but that, as a tolerant and diverse society, one thing we cannot tolerate is intolerance.  Blasphemy is an offence that allows a group of people to be intolerant of simple difference.  Blasphemy is not an offence against a person but an offence against a set of ideas.  If Ireland wants to be taken seriously in the United Nations, it is timely to remove this anachronism.  We should send a clear signal of personal freedom to those countries where blasphemy is still a very serious matter, in some cases a capital offence.  All too often the offence of blasphemy is used as cover for persecution of religious minorities or non-believers.</p>  <p>  Let us consider the case of Asia Bibi.  According to the European Centre of Law and Justice, she is a Christian mother of five who was convicted of blasphemy for offering her co-workers a cup of water.  Her co-workers said she had made the cup ceremoniously unclean by drinking from it and ordered her to convert to Islam.  Asia refused and expressed her faith as a Christian.  She was charged with blasphemy, convicted and sentenced to death.  She has been in prison for the past nine years waiting for the Supreme Court of Pakistan to hear her appeal.  Asia Bibi should be freed but the Pakistani authorities are in no hurry to do anything, as we understand it.  There are security concerns as radicals have issued death threats not only against Asia and her family but against the judges who heard the case.  She needs to be offered asylum.  Has the Government had any recent contacts on her behalf with the authorities in Pakistan?  Can the Government put pressure on the new Pakistani Prime Minister, Imran Khan, including at EU level, to secure her release?  Will Ireland offer Asia Bibi asylum?</p></speech>

The blasphemy referendum will happen on Friday at the same time as the presidential election.  The Government is asking people to vote "Yes" in that referendum.  We see it as part of an ongoing drive to modernise our Constitution to make it a 21st century Constitution for a 21st century republic following on from the decision to remove the constitutional ban on divorce, the decision to enshrine the marriage equality provision in our Constitution and the more recent decision to ensure that women have the right to choose when it comes to their reproductive health.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy said, it can be seen as a signal to other countries that Ireland stands for freedom of speech, freedom of religion and for the freedom not to have a religion.  On occasion, blasphemy rules are used against people who have no religion or who express agnostic or atheist views.  That is the case, unfortunately, in some parts of the world.  I also want to recognise the Deputy for raising the issue of the persecution of Christians which is a serious problem across the Arab and Muslim world and in some countries in Africa and Asia.  It is important that we stand in solidarity with Christians who are being persecuted around the world.  I am not aware of any contacts with the Pakistani authorities on that particular case.  I have written to Prime Minister Imran Khan to congratulate him on his recent election but I am not aware of any particular contacts on that particular case.  I will have to raise it with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and see if we can let our views be known on it.</p></speech>

Everybody in the House recognises the importance of religious freedom.  Everybody should have freedom of conscience to believe what they want and to express views on it as long as it does not incite hatred.  We have laws about incitement to hatred, which can be strengthened, but we need to take the dated concept of blasphemy out of our fundamental law in the Constitution.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the Taoiseach's comment that he will raise the specific case of Asia Bibi.  It would be a sign of our non-acceptance of intolerance that we would reach out to somebody like Asia.  It would be an important sign to say we will provide asylum because she will not be able to live in Pakistan with the death threats she and her family have endured.  Even if the authorities there release her, she should be offered asylum somewhere and why not offer her asylum here?  Will the Taoiseach give some consideration to that proposal?</p></speech>

I know the Deputy would want that too.  In bringing in laws that restrict what people can say, we must ensure they do not go so far as to trammel free speech and that is a balance we always need to get right.</p>  <p>  I am at a slight disadvantage.  I have read a little bit about the case the Deputy has referred to in the newspapers but I have not been briefed on it and I do not know all the facts.  I am not sure if we are in a position to offer asylum to somebody who has not sought it in Ireland.  I will undertake to get a briefing on the case and discuss it with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p></speech>

Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na - rest in peace - was one of those women who campaigned tirelessly until her death on 7 October.  Her death is a result of both human error and lack of accountability by the laboratory, the HSE and the Department of Health, under the watchful eye of numerous Governments.</p><p>No one in the country will ever forget the interview Ms Mhic Mhat&uacute;na did last May on the "Morning Ireland" radio programme where she said she was dying when she did not need to die.  This has now come to pass and along with other women, she has lost her life at 37 years of age due to human error.  This is unforgivable and there is no accountability.  </p> <p> A number of questions remain unanswered in the midst of other distractions which need to be answered in detail.  Earlier in the year it was reported that approximately 3,000 smear tests were to be rechecked.  This was a matter of urgency but it has not been mentioned since the summer recess.  What is the status of those approximately 3,000 smear tests, and will the Taoiseach make a statement on the matter?  What are the details of these results, and have these women been contacted about same?</p> <p> Over the past couple of weeks, news filtered through which suggested that a new contract was entered into with a US laboratory at the centre of the smear scandal, and clarification must be sought publicly as this is of huge importance for the health of the daughters of Ireland.  Is it the case that a new contract was recently signed with the US laboratory, Quest Diagnostics?  Who drew up this contract?  Who advised on it?  What involvement or role did the Taoiseach or Minister for Health have in this given the seriousness of this matter for the health of the women in Ireland?  Is there any truth that the laboratory wanted an indemnity clause in the contract for fear of future cases, and will the Taoiseach give a clear, detailed statement on this?  How could a contract be entered into with this laboratory given there are still cases pending in the courts and possibly more that have not yet come to light?  Why are the Irish citizens being kept in the dark on this important matter?  Will the Taoiseach make a statement taking into consideration the importance and seriousness of this issue?</p></speech>

I assure everyone in this House that Government is deeply committed to ensuring cervical screening continues and provides Irish women with a high-quality service in which they can have confidence.</p>  <p>  As I have said before, I am determined that some good should come from all of this.  We must make cervical cancer a rare disease in Ireland and we must build a more open and honest health service.  We can do those things by continuing with cervical screening, improving the screening programme with new testing, bringing in the HPV vaccine for boys and encouraging parents to ensure their children have that vaccine, reforming our health service, changing our laws about open disclosure and, more important, bringing about a culture in our health service of honesty, openness and disclosure.</p>  <p>  The issues the Deputy raised emerged at the outset of the CervicalCheck controversy.  Many women were concerned and it is essential we give them the facts, which is why a scoping inquiry led by Dr. Scally and his expert team was established by the Government with the support of the Oireachtas.  Dr. Scally provided the final report of his inquiry in September and he gave us a welcome reassurance of the quality and standards of the laboratories being used by CervicalCheck, which he and his team visited.  He was satisfied with the quality management process in these laboratories.  It is important to say he confirmed he found no reason that the existing contracts for the laboratories should not continue until our new HPV-testing system is in place.</p>  <p>  Dr. Scally also said the continuation of screening in the coming months is of crucial importance, an assessment with which the Government fully agrees.  Screening does not detect all cancers and pre-cancers but it detects most of them, which saves lives.  As Dr. Scally points out in his report, if 1,000 women are screened for cervical cancer, approximately 20 will have pre-cancerous cells or cancer.  Screening will pick up 15 of those 20 but it will miss five.  It is a misunderstanding to say that missing five of those 20 is negligent.  In some cases it may be but in the vast majority it is not.  Those are the limitations of screening, unfortunately.  CervicalCheck has been successful in reducing cervical cancer rates in Ireland.  As stated in the Scally report, the lifetime risk of women developing cancer was one in 135 in 2015, whereas it had been one in 96, which is a substantial improvement, falling by approximately 7% a year.</p>  <p>  I am happy to say that heads of an agreement have been signed with the contracted laboratories to extend their contracts pending introduction of the new HPV-testing programme, which allows for the continuation of the existing service without interruption.  This follows on from detailed negotiations undertaken by the HSE.  Agreement on the extension of these contracts was reached on 13 October but this is subject to formal conclusion of the contract, which has not yet taken place.  In these negotiations, discussions focused on extending the capacity of the laboratories to deal with the backlog of smears, which arose as a result of significantly increased demand for repeat smear tests that was seen in recent months for understandable reasons.  We must catch up on that backlog, notwithstanding the shortage of cytologists.</p></speech>

More than 20 women under the age of 25 have been diagnosed with cervical cancer since the screening programme began a decade ago.  Are the Department of Health, the Taoiseach and his Government satisfied that the screening programme should be extended to ladies under the age of 25, in the interests of their health and safety?  Do they see a benefit to that and would lives be saved in the future?  Will the Taoiseach make a statement on that matter?</p></speech>

In regard to screening, one must always bear in mind the whole problem of false negatives, with which people are now familiar and which can cause false reassurance.  False positives can also be a big problem, where abnormalities are picked up which look like cancer but are not cancer, leading women to have unnecessary further tests, unnecessary procedures and, in some cases, unnecessary operations.  When it comes to making a decision about screening, which is not diagnostic, one must weigh up the pros and cons, which there always are, and the best scientific evidence, as I understand it, is that by screening women under 25 the cons would outweigh the pros, which is why it is not being done.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also asked about the review of the 3,000 women in his previous question.  It is a review of 3,000 women who have been diagnosed with cervical cancer in the past ten years but only 1,850 of those attended CervicalCheck.  Others did not participate in screening.  Some 1,600 of the 1,850 women have been contacted with letters asking for their consent to look into their cases.  It is important we get consent before we look into people's health issues, files and previous tests.  Of the 813 consent forms that have been returned, some 97% of the women who have responded agreed to take part in the review.</p></speech>

The stress these families and their children are under is intolerable, knowing that this drug has huge potential for their lives.  At this stage, given that we signed up to this deal with the Benelux countries, surely there is a better way of making decisions like this.  I plead with the Taoiseach to try to make a personal intervention and to try to get a decision as soon as possible in order that we can alleviate this dreadful stress on these 25 families.</p></speech>

It is important to reiterate that the Oireachtas decided that decisions on which drugs are reimbursed should not be made by politicians.  The European Medicines Agency and the Health Products Regulatory Authority decide which medicines are licensed, and the HSE and the national drugs committee decide which ones should be reimbursed.  When the cost and effectiveness of this particular medicine were examined, the best scientific advice was that the cost outweighed the benefits by ten to one, or even 20 to one in the case of older patients.  "No" never means "No", however, and it is always open to the company to return with more data demonstrating that the medicine is more effective than had been thought, or to return with a new pricing offer, which would change that gap between cost and benefit.</p><p>Unfortunately, even in a wealthy country that is spending a record amount on healthcare the budget will always be limited.

Following the collapse of Carillion and Sammon there remains a myriad of outstanding issues relating to school building projects including in my constituency.  As we discussed earlier, we now learn that there are significant structural and safety concerns relating to 40 schools built by Western Building Systems over the last ten years.  Three schools have already faced closure and there is no clear plan from the Department on alternative accommodation.</p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach agree that this latest debacle reflects a significant and unprecedented failure in Government procurement and regulatory frameworks?  Will he clarify what specific actions the Minister for Education and Skills has taken or will take to ensure appropriate alternative accommodation is provided for the pupils and teachers affected by this?</p></speech>

When we spoke of Carillion and Sammon previously, the Deputy was very critical of PPPs and zeroed in on that as the reason why there was a problem with buildings, however these were not PPPs, they were design build, which indicates that problems can arise in the structure of buildings through all sorts of models.  Things have changed since then, since building regulations were changed in 2014-2015, and more recently, in the last couple of years, the Department of Education and Skills now has a clerk of works on site every day.  That does not mean that there will not be problems but we will have to check on the schools built after 2014 and 2015, to get a real sense of the extent of this problem.</p></speech>

Those 22 cases are only the ones that have made it to the WRC.  In one case, the adjudicating officer of the WRC expressed frustration at not being able to award a substantial sum to the woman who was sacked after management simply found out she was pregnant.

They were acts, not designed to win a war that was already effectively won, but to send a chilling message around the world and to the Soviet Union in particular.  She was here as part of a delegation from the Peace Boat, supported by Irish anti-war organisations, campaigning for the ratification of the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons.

Some 5,000 people marched in Tipperary town on Saturday.  They are a wonderful crowd of people and some wonderful community activists.  The N24 bypass on the road from Limerick to Waterford was planned but following considerations from the Government is now to go from Limerick to Cork under the next capital investment plan.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach mentioned that &euro;1 billion was available to small towns like this.  Can any of that be used for a short bypass to be built to motorway standards around Tipperary town in order to alleviate the problems caused by chronic traffic, particularly lorries, and allow the people some space to redevelop their town?  There is no point in saying that all this money is there if it cannot be used for projects such as this.  We badly need a bypass or ring road for the town but we are put on the hind tit, even though it is saving &euro;400 million by going from Limerick to Cahir and then going to Cork or Waterford, however, because of political influence, the Government chose to go down the other corridor to Cork city.</p></speech>

However, as we all know, waiting lists are not declining although there may be small progress in some areas, mainly because of this side of the House's insistence on the national treatment purchase fund being allocated extra money.  I will give another example today of what is happening, in relation to a lady for whom I am trying to make representations.  She is ten years suffering from gall stones.  She has tried to progress the matter over the last three years, and recently was given an appointment for Portiuncula hospital, but this week was subsequently issued an appointment for an ultrasound for April 2019.  This is totally unacceptable and it beggars belief that three years on she is still being told that she must wait a further six months for a simple ultrasound.  This woman is in chronic pain and desperately needs to have the matter progressed.  This is happening over and over again.  There is a total failure in the health system.  In a budget of &euro;15 billion why is this type of thing happening?  This woman is in desperate pain and what is happening is totally unacceptable.</p></speech>

It is not possible for me to comment on individual cases, I do not have access to individual patient information, nor should I, however more generally we are making a lot of progress in reducing waiting times for people waiting for operations and procedures in our hospitals.  They have been falling consistently for about a year and the number of people waiting more than three months for an operation or procedure is now slightly lower than when this Government came to office.  I will give some small examples.  The number of people waiting more than three months for a cataract operation last July was nearly 8,000 and is now down to 4,000.</p></speech>

Given all the debate about energy over the past number of weeks, the advancement of this Bill should be addressed.</p>  <p>  I live in a town in which mining is one of the largest employers.  More than 600 people are employed in Tara Mines, which is the largest zinc mine in Europe.  The former Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Mr. Pat Rabbitte, had discussed plans for a multi-million euro geothermal energy project for Navan backed by Tara Mines.  We have heard no more about that project.  Zinc is a finite resource and will run out over the next decade or two.  Suddenly hundreds of families will be left without employment, including 600 families connected to that mine.  I am sure the Taoiseach would agree with me that starting a conversation now about having alternatives in place before we reach the cliff edge is more favourable than standing outside the gates of a closed mine when the inevitable happens, and that advancing those alternative energy generators and employment options deserves to be spoken about in this Chamber.  We should have that conversation now.</p></speech>

The immediate priority includes fully transposing EU environmental impact assessment legislation into existing minerals legislation to ensure the compliance of national legislation with EU requirements.  The other priority is the full commencement of the Minerals (Development) Act 2017, which provides for a modern legislative and regulatory framework for the exploration and production of minerals in Ireland.  The commencement of the Act requires the preparation of several statutory instruments and guidance documents to enable proper implementation of the new Act and its operation by the mining industry, which will take approximately 18 months.  In that context, the work on the geothermal legislation will include reviewing the proposed geothermal regulatory framework to ensure it is compatible with the Minerals (Development) Act 2017 and the underlying policy in the context of the White Paper on Energy from 2015, which included a geothermal Bill in the programme and which may have led to some confusion as to when the Bill will be published.  It is another item that will appear on the agendas of the new Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Canney.</p></speech>

Indeed, they have reduced by 30%, and it is expected they will drop by 30% this year.  At the same time, there has been a 60% increase in the number of farmers who have failed inspections.  We are asking for a change in the inspection regime under the new common agricultural policy, CAP, where the farmer would be given the chance to rectify any problem identified in each year.  We are asking that Ireland, if it participates in the new CAP, would be given discretion in this regard to allow farmers to rectify any problems identified rather than penalising them.</p></speech>

I want to address the lengthy delays children and their parents are facing on the waiting list for assessments of need, AON.  In Cavan-Monaghan, 177 chlidren are waiting for an AON.  The rule is that once the application is made for an assessment, the services should be put in place within six months.  One little boy who is only seven years of age but who is in school, is waiting for his assessment and has been told that the estimated timeframe for this is four years and eight months.  Another little boy is waiting to hear from his occupational therapist.  I have a letter from the child development team in Cavan-Monaghan, which states in black and white that this child will wait four years and five months for occupational therapy services.  The children are not going to get their physiotherapy or speech and language therapy, and this particular child will not get a special needs assistant, SNA, which he badly needs.  Those waiting lists are outrageous for any children in any year.</p></speech>

Will we need to amend legislation or will new legislation be drafted?  Does the Taoiseach imagine that it will be fast-tracked in the first quarter of next year in order that it can be run in tandem with outsourcing the work that has to be done?  The legislation should run parallel to this so that the people at the centre of this matter, who are aging, do not have to wait much longer for results.</p></speech>

Yesterday, the Care Alliance noted that 6,000 people are now waiting for help at home.  To compound the issue, this number has increased by 30% in the past three years.  We have an aging population, and it is essential that funding is ring-fenced in the service plan as a matter of priority for home help hours.

I said at the outset that it would probably take up to three years to bring this about.  We are approximately halfway through that process at this stage.  It should be borne in mind that the fair deal scheme took seven years to be finalised.  I hope to do this within three years.  We are making steady progress on that, and I am happy to keep the House and concerned Deputies updated.</p></speech>

Garda management has indicated that it believes the current building has a short future, and as such it is essential that a new build is put in place to ensure that Carndonagh can remain the anchor for policing in north Inishowen.  Will the Minister ensure that it will be funded if the request comes forward from the management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?</p></speech>

Young people have been treated like road hogs over the past three years, given how the costs of insurance have increased.  They are not road hogs, but good citizens of this country, and they need their cars to get to work, particularly those living in rural areas.</p><p>They have now targeted new victims, namely the elderly.  I have had many contacts from elderly people, pensioners and people aged over 70, who are supporting young families by bringing children to school and to sports, where their car insurance has doubled.  This is wrong and should not be allowed to happen.  It is time we had more competition in the insurance market because people are being ripped off.  It is unfair to do this to elderly people.  They have never had an insurance claim in their lives and have been driving safely for 50 years, yet their premiums have doubled.</p></speech>

The cost of motor insurance is one of great concern to his constituents and mine.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy D&rsquo;Arcy, is leading the Government's action on this and has done much work on it.  Motor insurance premiums rose all the way up until the middle of 2016.  According to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, they have fallen about 20% since then.  I know that is not the case with every individual&rsquo;s premium but in the round they have fallen 20% since the middle of 2016.  We want them to fall further, however.  Accordingly, the Minister of State is implementing the recommendations from his action plan with 58 of the 71 completed.  That will continue.</p>  <p>  I agree more competition would be welcome in the market.</p></speech>

In fitting with this, there are plans to improve the No. 220 bus service in Ballincollig, County Cork, and increase it to five times per hour.  This was expected earlier this year.  While the National Transport Authority, NTA, and various authorities are in agreement about it, people are still waiting for the service to improve and still waiting for up to an hour for a bus.</p>  <p>  I know the Taoiseach will not have an instant answer on this.  However, can he determine what is the roadblock and why this fix has not been brought forward?  How soon will the improvement to the service be brought into effect?</p></speech>

However, as it happens, my sister&rsquo;s childminder, who is attending UCC, uses it regularly.  I am advised that it is slow and, as a consequence of traffic, often gets stuck.  It will be significantly improved and made more frequent in the next several weeks.  I will pass on the reply to the Deputy because it was a favourable one.</p></speech>

We have thousands of children and homeless families living in hotel rooms every night.  At the same time, tourists, visitors and corporate business are accommodated through short-term letting platforms in homes which are suitable for homeless families.  We raised this at an Oireachtas committee more than two and a half years ago, which then did a detailed report on the regulation required in respect of these platforms.  A month ago, my colleague, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, asked the Minister a direct question on this.  The Minister replied:</p><blockquote>I am about to finalise proposals on this.  Had this question come this day next week, I think we would be talking about the changes that [we] would have already been made.</blockquote><p>That week is well gone.  The month is gone and we still have no regulation of short-term letting platforms.</p></speech>

However, somebody with a buy-to-let property, for example, would need permission to do that.

Two weeks ago, we learned there was an objection to this from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which it has, thankfully, dropped.  We need to move this as quickly as possible.

I know there have been considerable improvements and considerable investments in UHL in recent years, such as the new emergency department and the Leben building which will provide additional bed capacity.  Unfortunately, this has not led to significant improvements in overcrowding in the hospital and we need the modular build.  I will ask the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to provide the Deputy with more information on that.  Perhaps it demonstrates once again that relieving overcrowding in our emergency departments is as much about clinical leadership and efficiency in management as it is about bed capacity.</p></speech>

The summit, which was chaired by the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, was one of a series of such meetings relating to the future of Europe.  On this occasion, our focus was on migration and internal security.  We also took the opportunity to discuss progress in the negotiations on Brexit.</p>  <p>  On migration, we had a useful exchange on how best to progress the comprehensive approach we agreed at the June European Council.  This involves working to secure our external borders, to strengthen co-operation with countries of origin and transit and to deal with the management of migrants in the EU.</p>  <p>  On internal security, we discussed the increasing cyberthreats we face, including to the integrity of our electoral systems.  No formal conclusions were adopted but the outcome of our discussions fed into the October meeting of the European Council, which took place in Brussels last week.</p>  <p>  Our discussions on Brexit, which took place in Article 50 format, provided an opportunity to review progress in the negotiations.  We discussed this again at the European Council last week and agreed that, despite the intensified negotiations since Salzburg, the decisive progress we so urgently need has not been achieved.</p>  <p>  We reaffirmed our full confidence in Mr. Barnier and urged him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement.  On both occasions, I reiterated the need for a legally operable version of the backstop in the withdrawal agreement, and thanked EU partners for their ongoing solidarity on this issue.  I had a bilateral meeting with the UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, in the margins of the Salzburg summit on Thursday, 20 September, in which we discussed the state of play in the Brexit negotiations, as well as developments in Northern Ireland.  I had a further meeting with the Prime Minister in the margins of the European Council last week.</p>  <p>  On both occasions, I emphasised my aspiration that the future relationship between the EU and the UK will be as close and comprehensive as possible.  I reiterated that the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, with a robust and legally watertight backstop, must be agreed first.</p>  <p>  I did not have a formal bilateral meeting with the Polish Prime Minister, Mr. Morawiecki, in Salzburg, although I did of course meet and engage informally with him and with my other EU counterparts in the margins of the summit and again last week in Brussels.</p></reply>

The expected breakthrough in the Brexit negotiations simply did not happen.  There was a heightened expectation in the days running up to the summit that progress would be made.</p><p>Since then no further progress has been made on the legal framework being put into place at the October summit.  In effect, two critically important moments have come and gone and the available moments to find a settlement agreeable to everybody on what was the watertight agreement of last December are diminishing.  I am fearful, and I have been fearful for months, about the narrowing agenda at the end of this.  Ultimately, it seems that Britain is trying to shift the balance of risk to Ireland.  The risk that there might need to be a backstop invoked is not acceptable to the British and they want us instead to accept the risk that no close relationship will ultimately be negotiated between the EU and the UK that would obviate the need for any hard border.  My fear is there will be a point at the end of these negotiations, which at a matter of weeks is not that far away, when the option open to the Taoiseach will be very stark indeed.  It will be either to either stop the negotiations without a withdrawal agreement or accept there will be no backstop.  It is very important that we are crystal clear now on where the Taoiseach stands if that option is reached around the Council table.</p></speech>

My party leader has said to the Taoiseach that we strongly object to the attempt to claim that immigration should be placed at the top of the EU agenda as Chancellor Kurz has done.  Many countries have sincere issues that must be discussed but we cannot allow Europe's agenda to be set by Governments that are appeasing the far right.  In the case of Austria, the Taoiseach will, no doubt, have been informed that Chancellor Kurz has left in place his interior Minister, even after he was caught instructing regional police forces to find and publicise incidents involving immigrants, with a special effort to be made to publicise anything that might involve sexual assaults.  This is grotesque and sinister and is straight out of the playbook of a former time.  Has the Taoiseach spoken up on the effort to keep immigration at the top of the agenda even though the numbers involved have fallen dramatically in the past three years?</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach assure us that he stood by Ireland's support for the action being taken against Poland on the rule of law?  Will he also tell us whether he formally objected to attacks on a judge of our High Court made by members of the Polish Prime Minister's party?</p></speech>

In defending the British Government's stance in the Brexit negotiations she stated that, supposedly, 60% of unionists in the North had voted to leave the European Union.  She went on to state that what the EU has put forward in negotiations is not acceptable to some unionists.  In doing so, she has admitted what many of us already suspected and knew, which is that her Government is prioritising the views of a section of unionism over the wishes of a majority of citizens in the North.  By saying what she said, she has done a disservice to everyone by attempting to make Brexit an orange and green issue, which it is not.  The majority of citizens in the North voted against Brexit and the majority of parties and political representatives in the North are opposed to Brexit.  Karen Bradley, by virtue of her office, is to be coequal guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process, legally and duty bound to act with strict impartiality, but here she is publicly stating that it is only the views of a section of the population in the North that really count.  That is a disgraceful position to articulate.  Her comments are unacceptable and they must be challenged.  Will the Taoiseach raise this with the British Prime Minister?</p></speech>

The issue of Brexit and our concerns are extremely important to us but there is a bigger picture going on in Europe and around the world at present, as Deputy Haughey alluded to.  This is the very dangerous rise of the far right, xenophobia and racism that finds its scapegoat in desperate migrants seeking to flee awful situations in the Middle East, north Africa and sub-Saharan Africa.  I want to know that the Taoiseach is out there batting against this filthy xenophobic racism and arguing against the Kurzs and Orb&aacute;ns of this world in trying to scapegoat immigrants, thousands of whom are dying in the Mediterranean.  Recently the Moroccan authorities were shooting at them, there are horrendous stories of human rights abuses in Libya and thousands of men, women and children are dying in the Mediterranean because of this filthy xenophobic racism.  We need absolutely to take up the cudgels against it and state that immigrants are good.  They are not a burden and they enhance the societies to which they come, as did Irish migrants from this country everywhere they went.  It is important that the Taoiseach is publicly seen to articulate this message.  Is that what the Taoiseach is doing?  How are we engaging in this debate on migration given the very dangerous subtext?  In fact, it is not even a subtext, it is an explicit fanning of the flames of racism in a worrying echo of the 1930s.</p></speech>

I never expected it.  It was an informal summit that was not about Brexit.  I think what happened is that somebody hyped the British press into believing there would be a major breakthrough and when it did not happen it became a diplomatic disaster.  I assure the House that the Irish Government had no role in those events unfolding in the way they did.  It is very difficult to answer hypothetical questions about the negotiations.  It is a very valid question but there are so many things that could happen between now and then and I would prefer not to wax lyrical on hypothetical scenarios-----</p></speech>

What I can say is that our objectives are as they always have been, which are to ensure that Brexit is orderly, that there is a withdrawal agreement, that there is a transition period during which business and citizens can adapt, that there is agreement on citizens' rights being protected, that the UK pays what it owes to the European Union, that there is a joint political declaration on a future partnership, which is the one we will negotiate during the transition period, and that there is a legally binding backstop as a protocol to the withdrawal agreement that gives us the assurance we need that should something go wrong during the transition period and should we be unable to negotiate or ratify a new relationship between the EU and UK that negates the need for a hard border that we will have a legally operable backstop relating to Ireland and Northern Ireland that will then click in.  These have been objectives from day one.  No one in any European capital doubts the solidity of our position in this regard.</p>  <p>  With regard to immigration, it is important to make a distinction.  It is not a black and white distinction but there is a distinction between illegal immigration on the one hand and legal immigration on the other hand.  Nobody around the EU Council table objects to freedom of movement other than Britain.  Everyone else from every other country has no difficulty with freedom of movement within the European Union by EU citizens.  With a few exceptions the vast majority of prime ministers and presidents sitting around the table support legal immigration from outside the European Union, that is people with working visas and work permits arriving as refugees.</p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked whether I ever make the case that immigration is a good thing.  I make it all the time, in Brussels and in this Chamber, and sometimes I get into trouble for it.  I always make the point that I believe immigration enriches our society and strengthens our economy.  We only need to see the extent to which our health service relies on migrant people making sure that our public services function.  We only need to visit some of the multinational companies that employ so many people in Ireland and bring in so much investment and increasingly pay us a lot of taxes.</p><p>Companies such as Google, Facebook, Intel and IBM greatly rely on a diverse international workforce.  I am convinced that immigration is a good thing culturally, economically and socially and I make that point here and in Brussels.  However, that is not the same as saying there should be uncontrolled immigration.  Immigration must be controlled.  It cannot be the case that everyone who wishes to live in Ireland or Europe can do so.  We must, therefore, have controls.  We must have the freedom of movement within the European Union which we desire, as well as mechanisms to facilitate immigration from outside the EU.  However, I do not agree with the position held by Deputy Boyd Barrett and his party, namely, that we should have uncontrolled immigration, no borders and that anyone who wishes to come and live here should be allowed to do so.  That is not a good policy for our country or more generally.</p> <p> On our approach, we recognise that this is a matter of major concern to other European countries.  It is not top of the political agenda here for the people or the Government but it is in countries such as Italy, Germany, Austria and some other countries in central Europe and we must be aware of that.  When we want our issues put at the top of the agenda that is respected, so we must respect the issues which other countries want to put on the agenda.  Our approach generally has been to support a three-pronged approach to strengthen our borders.  The Irish Naval Service is participating in that through Operation Sophia, rescuing migrants from the Mediterranean, training the Libyan coastguard and disrupting the activities of human traffickers and smugglers.  We are part of the principle of strengthening the frontiers of the EU.  The second principle is greater co-operation with countries of origin and countries of transit, ensuring that countries offer more economic opportunities, democracy and political freedoms to the people who live in those countries in order that fewer of them choose to risk their lives by travelling to Europe in the way that many have.  We demonstrated that commitment in budget 2019 with the very considerable increase in our commitment to international development assistance, far more than was called for by other parties who spend a significant amount of time speaking about these issues.  The third prong is solidarity.  Our efforts in that regard are evidenced by the fact that we respond favourably to requests from Malta, Italy and other countries for Ireland take people from the boats, which we do.</p></speech>

The Committee last met on 1 February to help us finalise Project Ireland 2040 and its next meeting is scheduled for 15 November.  It works to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the delivery and development of policy in infrastructure investment, housing, and climate action.  There is significant work under way in each of these areas across Departments and Government agencies, including through regular discussion of these matters at meetings of the Cabinet</p>  <p>  In particular, Project Ireland 2040, comprising the national planning framework and the national development plan, is now being implemented, providing &euro;116 billion of investment in our public infrastructure.  The Land Development Agency, another cornerstone initiative of Project Ireland 2040, has also been established and is working to ensure the optimum management of State land through development and regeneration, with an immediate focus on delivering homes, including social and affordable housing and cost rental.</p>  <p>  We are seeing an increase in the number of new and refurbished houses available year on year.  New housing output is projected to be up to 20,000 new houses and apartments this year, not including student accommodation or vacant properties brought back into use.  However, we are aware of the huge challenge we are facing in meeting demand in the housing market.  We will need to deliver approximately 35,000 units a year before supply meets demand.  We are continuing to focus on increasing housing supply, tackling homelessness and increasing the availability of affordable and social housing.  In addition to the work under way through Project Ireland 2040 and Rebuilding Ireland, budget 2019 provides for an increase of 25% in the housing budget for next year, to &euro;2.3 billion.</p>  <p>  Climate action is also at the heart of Project Ireland 2040, which provides for investment of &euro;22 billion by the Government and semi-State bodies to ensure a step change in climate action performance.  In that context, I and my ministerial colleagues met the Climate Change Advisory Council on 28 September to discuss its policy priorities.  In budget 2019 allowances were introduced to help lower carbon emissions through a commitment under the rural development plan for agri-environmental allocations amounting to over &euro;200 million, over &euro;100 million for improvements in grant and premium rates for planting forests, a new accelerated capital allowances scheme for gas-propelled vehicles and refuelling equipment, the green public transport fund to improve the uptake of low-carbon energy-efficient technologies within the public transport sector and over &euro;164 million to achieve Ireland&rsquo;s energy efficiency and renewable energy objectives.  The Government will continue to deliver Project Ireland 2040 and related housing and climate action commitments in the period ahead.</p></reply>

It is extremely worrying that this involves major contracts and that up to 40 schools could be affected and we do not know whether the same designs and construction techniques were used in other public works.  We must reflect on how public works and public building contracts are awarded.  After such issues are exposed, people often approach Members to say that the companies involved had a bad reputation.  If asked, the contracting authorities would state that they cannot exclude such companies from tendering.  We must look at building quality, the track record of such companies and the way they treat and treated subcontractors.  Such considerations are taken into account to some degree but insufficiently so.  In the light of the various issues that have arisen in public works contracts in recent times, is the Government giving consideration to ensuring that tenderers are robust and capable of delivering in addition to simply considering value for money?</p>  <p>  There were no tenderers for certain recent public contracts from local authorities, which is of interest and concern.  We need to have a deeper and more profound debate on how we will deliver the very extensive public works that are envisaged in the capital programme over the next decade.</p></speech>

How many meetings, presentations and reviews has he had on the issue since that announcement?  I acknowledge that he had a lot of other business to deal with last week, but he elevated the issue to being a crusade and was, therefore, clearly operating to a high level of urgency.  He will certainly have time to discuss when the process of awarding the contract might progress and what are the likely costs.  Does he remain confident of delivering it quickly and on budget?  How quickly will the process review be completed?  Such reviews are traditionally very quick as they do not involve the legal dimensions required in inquiries.</p></speech>

This is incredible.  I raised all of these issues last September.  We were told that a review would be carried out by January of this year.  I stated that Western Building System should be excluded from getting public contracts.  It has taken until now for us to get to that discussion because nothing was done and we were ignored and told these are the rules and that is the way it is.  It is a disaster.  It would be helpful people on the Government side of the House listened to us sometimes.</p>  <p>  I wish to ask about D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour, which is of national, cultural and economic importance as well as vital for transport and many other matters.</p><p>I am very glad to see that after years of campaigning by the local community, including myself, the harbour company is to be dissolved and transferred to D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown.  However, we now discover, as I said to the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014, that there were massive governance and financial problems in the harbour company.  I told him about massive salaries, bonuses being handed out and crazy money being spent on consultants and projects.  Now we discover that after all the delay on the part of the Taoiseach and successive Ministers for Transport, Tourism and Sport, although we get the victory of the harbour being handed over, there is a major financial mess involving debts and maintenance work that was not done.  Meanwhile, the individual who was chief executive officer, CEO, during the years when the Taoiseach was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is suing the company of which he was CEO for a performance-related bonus of &euro;410,000.  Last year, the harbour company did not even put in the accounts for 2017.  It is an absolute mess and the Government allowed it to happen.  Will the Taoiseach intervene and help D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to sort out the financial mess that successive Ministers, including the Taoiseach, created in D&uacute;n Laoghaire harbour?  </p></speech>

The report found that wastewater treatment is completely insufficient in many areas and highlighted the fact that despite some improvements, 38 towns and villages across the State still discharge raw sewage into the environment.  The report also stated that wastewater treatment in 28 of the State's 179 large towns fails to meet standards set to prevent pollution and protect public health.  This list includes Passage West, Monkstown and Carrigaline in my own constituency.  As a result of the failure to treat wastewater adequately, the European Commission is taking the State to the European Court of Justice.  Because of decades of under investment in vital infrastructure and specifically because of cuts made in 2013, 2014 and 2015, the State could be liable for huge fines as a result of that process.  This is quite shocking.  When the EPA appeared before the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government last May, it outlined serious problems with our wastewater infrastructure.  It told the committee that only &euro;620 million would be made available between 2017 and 2021 to fix problems.  However, what is actually required is closer to &euro;1 billion.  Given that Irish Water has received additional funding for this work and some works are being carried, which I acknowledge, although I would ask that Irish Water improve its communications with local communities, can the Taoiseach give an assurance that this work will be expedited and that Irish Water will ensure that no area experiences untreated wastewater discharge by 2021?</p></speech>

The point was made regarding barring companies from tendering for such things as shoddy building in the past or failing to pay subcontractors.  It is under examination but I understand that under EU public procurement directives, the bar for excluding somebody from tendering is actually very high and requires a burden of proof rather than a degree of suspicion.  That is the law as it stands under an EU public procurement directive but perhaps it needs to be changed.</p>  <p>  Another thing we should bear in mind is the issue of rapid build.  I often hear people call for rapid build housing and I certainly do not rule it out as part of the solution but Ardgillan was a rapid build school.  It was built in 24 or 25 weeks.  We need to bear that in mind.  Things that are done quickly are not always done well.  </p>  <p>  I am not sure how many meetings I have had with regard to broadband.  I have had a couple anyway but I do not think crusades require many meetings.  I am not sure the crusaders spent much time around the conference table.  Peter Smith, who is the independent procurement and process adviser, is doing his work.  The terms of reference were agreed by Government last week and published.  We will anticipate that he will have completed that part of his work in three weeks.  Deputy Haughey is right to point out that because of the nature of what he is doing, it can be done quite quickly.  Deputy Bruton is the new Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  I have asked him to take a few weeks to examine the national broadband plan and see how we can bring it to fruition.  We commit to bringing it to fruition and extending high-speed broadband to the 540,000 premises in Ireland that will not get it by commercial means.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased that D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour has at long last been transferred to the local authority</p></speech>

Yes, there are financial implications regardless of whichever port or harbour is transferred to a local authority.  These implications mainly relate to works that may need to be done in the future.  However, it is also an asset.  When a company or a piece of infrastructure is transferred to a local authority, we should not just look at the liabilities and costs.  We should also weigh up the assets.  It is a considerable asset as well and has assets.</p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett is correct that the former CEO is suing the company for not paying him a bonus.  I presume Deputy Boyd Barrett agrees that the company was right not to pay the bonus. </p></speech>

The latest report is based on an assessment of effluent monitoring results from over 1,000 wastewater treatment plants reported to the EPA by Irish Water and on enforcement carried out during 2017.  Of these, the number of priority urban areas where wastewater treatment needs to improve is down from 148 to 132 so we are making progress.  Of the 44 towns and villages where raw sewage was being discharged in 2016, six are now connected to treatment plants and the remainder will be connected by 2021.  Out of the 179 large urban areas in Ireland, 28 failed to comply with the EU's legally binding standards for the treatment of urban wastewater.  From 2016 to 2024, capital upgrades and operational improvement works will have been undertaken and completed at all of these urban wastewater treatment plants to ensure that treatment levels and capacity comply with requirements of the urban wastewater treatment directive.  Improvements were completed to protect the two bathing waters that were in poor quality.  </p>  <p>  Water was not handled well by local authorities when it was under their control.  It is certainly the case that investment was cut back during the period of austerity because there was no money to invest.  It is also certainly the case that Irish Water is working.  Establishing a single national utility was the right decision and it is making real progress since its establishment.  I hope those who opposed the establishment of Irish Water will reflect on the error of their position.  </p></speech>

We were in contact by phone in the interim.  At our meeting in Salzburg, I reiterated my hope that the future relationship between the EU and the UK will be as close, deep, comprehensive and ambitious as possible but that it is essential that the withdrawal agreement, including the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, is agreed first.  I stressed that there is not much time left if we are to conclude a withdrawal agreement and have it operational by the time the UK leaves the EU in March.  At that time, the Prime Minister said that the UK would be bringing forward proposals for a backstop or at least alternative text for it.  </p>  <p>  I also raised the current political situation in Northern Ireland and emphasised the need to get the devolved institutions up and running again.  When we met last week in Brussels, we once again discussed Brexit.  I told Prime Minister May that it was disappointing that the recent round of intensive negotiations - mainly at official level - had not yet resolved the issue of the border satisfactorily.  </p>  <p>  While I recognise the political challenges faced by Prime Minister May at home, I was reassured that she did not in any way seek to row back from the commitments the UK made in writing back in March and again in June.  These concerned the backstop, which must be legally operative and apply unless and until there is a new agreement between the EU and the UK that would supersede it.  </p><p>It is important to say again that this was agreed in principle and in writing in a document jointly published by the task force and the UK in June.<br/><br/>Following the European Council meeting, I expect negotiations between the UK and the EU task force will resume and intensify over the coming weeks.  Time is now running out and the risk of a no-deal outcome, which would be bad for everyone, increases with every day that passes.<br/><br/>I welcome the robust and solid support for Ireland once again by all of our EU partners and EU institutions last week and I expect that all sides will now use their best efforts to reach a deal that is acceptable.</p></reply>

Throughout this period, it seems clear that Ms May is seeking to transfer the risks associated with Brexit to Ireland and has contorted the position we thought was fixed and clear last December.  She is doing complex manoeuvres that seem designed to disguise the fact that she is walking away, or distancing herself a little, from the December agreement.  The Taoiseach says she is not seeking to row back but all her comments, including the comment she made to the British House of Commons and elsewhere, are evidence that she is now unwilling or unable to deliver on that commitment.</p>  <p>  Prime Minister May is talking about the extension of the period of transition as an alternative to the backstop.  It is not an alternative, as the Taoiseach has made clear, and that needs to be made clear in this House.  Has the Taoiseach discussed this directly with the British Prime Minister in one-to-one discussions?  Does she understand that, as a country, we want the closest possible relationship between the UK and the EU, but we are part of the EU team?  Regardless of the outcome of those discussions, which will take some years to complete, there must be a legal backstop to ensure the integrity of the island of Ireland and no hard Border here regardless of what may ensue from any discussions.  Does she fundamentally accept that point?</p></speech>

Does Prime Minister May understand the Taoiseach's and the country's seriousness about this issue, and, more important, does she understand the seriousness of the backstop for this island?  Does the Taoiseach get a sense from her that she is trying for time, political time or otherwise, to try and achieve a deal with her backbenchers?</p><p>The Taoiseach referred to robust and solid support from our EU partners, which is welcome.  What are his comments on Chancellor Merkel's unofficial briefings to newspapers such as <i>Financial Times</i>after the summit in which she seemed to unofficially indicate that support might not be as robust or solid?  I acknowledge she officially clarified that afterwards, but straws in the wind like that are not helpful.  In fairness to Mr. Barnier, he has been squarely behind this country but that kind of leaking is unhelpful to the Irish cause.</p><p>The Taoiseach referred to the drift in Northern Ireland, which is the other big issue.  That is affecting people's daily lives.  Expenditure decisions about key issues such as housing, education and health are being taken by unelected officials with no consequences for wrong decisions.  Has the Taoiseach any plans to take an initiative to try to address that drift?</p></speech>

The Taoiseach, and others, assume that Europe can be trusted absolutely.  It needs to be made absolutely clear that preventing a North-South border is more important than Europe's concern with protecting the so-called market.  The problem is Europe is obsessed with protecting this market.  Britain is obsessed with a jingoistic, nationalistic notion of its own importance and sovereignty.  We know what the DUP are into; we know the problem with it.  We know the political problems and madness inside the Tory Party.  We need to be aware that there are people in Europe who would consider sacrificing the Border issue to protect the Single Market.  They need to be told that preventing conflict and the installation of a North-South border, which is divisive and has had disastrous consequences historically, is what is acceptable to us.  They need to be told it will not happen and we will veto any attempt to impose it.</p></speech>

The four parties are due to meet Taoiseach in the coming weeks and have met Mr. Michel Barnier together, yet Theresa May has refused a request for a joint meeting.  This is another example of the contempt being shown by her Government for the majority of citizens in the North.  To preserve her toxic alliance with the DUP, she is trampling over the rights of citizens by acquiescing to the DUP's refusal to share power on the basis of equality.  By refusing to meet political representatives of the four parties, she is ignoring the democratic will of citizens in the North who voted to reject Brexit.</p>  <p>  The British Government is incapable of acting responsibly or with any semblance of impartiality while it remains wedded to the DUP.  It is an appalling failure of Theresa May's responsibilities as a co-equal guarantor of the peace process and the political process.  The onus is on the Taoiseach and his Government and the EU 27 to defend the North's interests during this critical stage of Brexit negotiations.  </p>  <p>  I am not sure the Taoiseach answered the first question I asked.  Does he intend to raise with Theresa May the comments made by Ms Karen Bradley which also clearly favoured a section of unionism over the political views and political representation of the rest of the North?</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP, Alliance Party and Green Party combined represent the majority of people in the Northern Ireland Assembly, or close to it.  That meeting should happen.  I will have that meeting, having also met the leader of the DUP recently.</p>  <p>  I did not hear Secretary of State Bradley's comments in full or in context and I always like to hear things in full and in context before commenting on them.  It is a statement of fact that the majority of people in Northern Ireland voted against Brexit and neither the Northern Ireland Assembly or Northern Ireland Executive has given consent for Brexit.  We all know that and I make sure that every Prime Minister and President in Europe knows that as well and they do.  It is essential that the secretary of state is impartial in dealing with the various parties in Northern Ireland and that is what the Good Friday Agreement requires of the sovereign UK Government.</p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to an obsession about protecting the integrity of the Single Market.  It is important not to forget that is our Single Market too and we benefit from it enormously.  Huge numbers of jobs in Ireland exist because we are part of a European Single Market.  I would not like a situation where Britain is given unfettered access to this market, including Ireland, if it is going to reduce labour, environmental and health standards or use state aids and competition manipulations to undercut Ireland's businesses and take our jobs.  That is what protecting the integrity of the Single Market is about.  It is not an obsession; it is about protecting jobs, workers' rights, health and safety and the environment, and ensuring fair competition and no state aid.  That is something Deputy Boyd Barrett would be in favour of, if not obsessed about.</p>  <p>  Deputy Howlin asked a number of questions about the pace of negotiations.</p><p>In March and in June, we agreed that there would have to be a legally operative backstop as part of the withdrawal agreement in the form of a protocol and that that would have to apply unless and until a new agreement supersedes it.  We need to bear in mind that this is language the UK Government signed up to.  It is in the letter the UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, sent to President Tusk.  It is in the joint document produced by the UK and the EU back in June.  This is, therefore, something that the UK has signed up to in principle and in writing.  It is not just a matter of substance at this stage; it is also a matter of trust.</p> <p> Ireland has no difficulty in hearing proposals for a transition extension.  However, it is strange that I heard some suggestion from, I believe, the UK Secretary of State, Mr. Rabb, that we could have an extension of the transition period instead of a legally binding backstop.  An extension of the transition period would be a concession to the UK because it would be asking for it, asking for more time to prepare to put Brexit into real effect.  It would be asking for more time to negotiate a new relationship.  It would be asking for more time to get that new relationship treaty ratified.  This would be a concession to the UK.  We certainly would not be exchanging anything in return for it.  I thought that was a somewhat unusual trade-off to propose.</p> <p> There is much excellent reporting on Brexit in the media.  The long reports by RT&Eacute;'s Tony Connelly are really good and are a very good briefing for anyone who is following this topic.  An awful lot of nonsense is also being written and I will not waste any time commenting on all the individual speculative stories that appear in the media on Brexit, particularly in the UK press.</p> <p> Undoubtedly the prospects of an agreement are adversely affected by the current political situation in the UK.  The UK is a very divided country.  It is still roughly divided 50:50 between people who want to leave and people who want to remain.  Even several years later, those who want to leave still do not know what leave means, which makes coming to an agreement very difficult.  However, we are working towards that and I am confident we will do it.</p></speech>

On Wednesday evening, we met in Article 50 format to discuss the Brexit negotiations.  The meeting of the European Council proper on Thursday morning focused on migration, internal security and external relations.  This was followed by a European summit, where we exchanged views on deepening economic and monetary union ahead of the December European Council.  I also had bilateral meetings with the UK Prime Minister, Mrs. May, and with the President of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani.</p>  <p>  I will focus my remarks today on Brexit, and will also outline the discussions on migration and economic issues.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will speak about internal security in her statement, as well as the external relations issues that arose.</p>  <p>  From Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, the priority was, of course, the Article 50 meeting on Brexit.  In advance of the meeting, the UK Prime Minister outlined the UK perspective to the other EU leaders.  Michel Barnier, the chief EU negotiator, then gave us a detailed and candid update on the state of play with regard to those negotiations with the UK.  He confirmed that, despite intensified negotiations over the past few weeks, the decisive progress we so urgently need has not yet been made.  This is a matter of serious concern to us all.</p>  <p>  Collectively, we reaffirmed our full confidence in Mr. Barnier and urged him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement in accordance with the guidelines previously agreed by the European Council, which we decided not to change.</p>  <p>  President Tusk said that, for now, he would not convene a special summit in November but he would do so if and when Mr. Barnier reports that decisive progress has been achieved, thereby warranting a special summit.</p>  <p>  As Deputies will be aware, a focus of the negotiations has been on the backstop or protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.  I reminded colleagues of how much is at stake and how important it is that we get this right.  We have always said that we want the negotiations to succeed.  This will only be possible with agreement on a legally robust backstop, which must apply in the circumstances set out in the withdrawal agreement.  The UK specifically committed to this in the joint EU-UK report last December.  The UK Prime Minister reiterated these commitments in March and again in September. </p>  <p>  The EU presented its detailed proposal for the backstop when it published a draft version of the withdrawal agreement in March.  The UK has brought other ideas to the table in the course of the negotiations, although it has not published a formal, written alternative text. </p>  <p>  In considering any proposals, we will continue to apply the tests outlined by Michel Barnier earlier this year as follows.  Is it a workable solution to avoid a hard border?  Does it respect the integrity of the Single Market and the customs union?  Is it an all-weather backstop that applies unless and until an alternative solution supersedes it?</p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s proposal sets out practical and technical solutions to protect the gains of the peace process, and to keep the border open and invisible as it is today.  It does not in any way represent a threat to the constitutional integrity of the UK, nor have we any interest in doing so.  I support Mr. Barnier&rsquo;s efforts to de-dramatise the protocol and to focus on agreeing the workable solution that it offers at its core.  Colleagues agreed that this is not just an Irish issue; it is a matter of European solidarity.  We have been consistent in saying that the UK must honour these commitments and that the legally operable backstop must be included in the withdrawal agreement, or there will be no agreement and no period of transition.</p>  <p>  I very much hope and expect that the future relationship will be close, comprehensive and ambitious.  However, that cannot be guaranteed until it is negotiated in detail and in due course ratified by the UK Parliament and the parliaments of all 27 member states.  There are plenty of points along the way where this could go wrong which is why we need the certainty of the backstop. </p>  <p>  As I said in Brussels, although we all recognise that the backstop cannot have an expiry date, it will enter into force only if there is no agreement to supersede it; I hope it will never need to be invoked.  It would cease to be in force only when there is an agreement to supersede it and, therefore, I expect it would be temporary.  While it is intended to be temporary, it cannot be time-limited in the sense of having an expiry date.  I explained this to Mrs. May at our bilateral meeting on Wednesday and she acknowledged this.</p>  <p>  Our unique concerns are fully understood and I am pleased that EU solidarity has been unwavering.  I took the opportunity on Wednesday evening to thank partners for this, and also to thank Mr. Barnier and his team for their dedication and perseverance in the negotiations.</p>  <p>  In my meeting with President Tajani, we discussed the role of the European Parliament in ratifying the withdrawal agreement.  He emphasised the parliament&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that the backstop is included in the withdrawal agreement and he offered to visit Ireland to confirm the parliament&rsquo;s support.</p>  <p>  While we will continue to insist that a legally operative backstop is an indispensable part of a withdrawal agreement, it should be seen as an insurance policy; it is not our preferred solution.  I believe that a positive outcome to the negotiations is still possible and that it can deliver a close and deep future relationship between the EU and the UK.  However, if we are to have the withdrawal agreement secured, approved and operational by the time the UK leaves, we need to make decisive progress now.  In the meantime, we are all stepping up our preparedness arrangements, including our contingency planning for a no-deal scenario.  President Juncker updated us on the Commission's work in this regard at the meeting on Wednesday.  It is important to realise, however, that irrespective of the outcome of the negotiations, things will be different. </p>  <p>  The 2019 budget includes a package for Brexit readiness to insulate Ireland from the negative economic impact of Brexit.  Various programmes to help businesses are in place, including a &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme for business and substantial investment in the agrifood sector.  The Government has also launched a new "Getting Ireland Brexit Ready" public awareness campaign, which provides information on what help is available.  Outreach events have taken place in Cork, Galway and Monaghan at which attendances exceeded expectations.  I will participate in an event in Dublin tomorrow. </p>  <p>  On other issues, migration continues to be a concern for the EU.  Having had extensive discussions on this at the June European Council and again in Salzburg last month, our meeting on Thursday focused on the external aspects, particularly strengthening our co-operation with source and transit countries in Africa and the Middle East.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">We welcomed the decision to convene a summit with our African partners in December.  It will be helpful in developing a closer partnership with the continent.  We also agreed to hold a summit with the Arab League early next year.  Any long-term and sustainable solution needs to deal with the reasons people decide to migrate.  We need to ensure they have better prospects at home when it comes to peace, democracy, security and economic opportunity.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> On Thursday, we also discussed the Commission proposals on enhancing the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, as well as our ongoing efforts to reform the common European asylum system and the Dublin convention.  The discussions on this issue are difficult, and member states have not yet agreed on the best way forward.  </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> As Deputies will be aware, Ireland is less directly affected by large migration inflows and illegal immigration than many other countries due to our geographic position, our position under Protocol No. 21, and our non-participation in certain aspects of the Schengen Agreement.  I believe, however, that the challenges need a collective response.  We need to respond to migration in a comprehensive, fair and pragmatic way.  This includes opting in, as we have done, to the EU relocation and resettlement measures; taking in additional migrants over the summer months from ships in the Mediterranean, which we did; contributing naval vessels to help with humanitarian efforts in the Mediterranean; helping to train the Libyan coastguard and disrupt the activities of human traffickers and people smugglers; and increasing our financial assistance.  As I told my EU counterparts last week, Ireland intends to continue to play an active and constructive role. </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> A euro summit meeting took place in inclusive format &ndash; that is, with 27 member states, including members of the eurozone and those that may join &ndash; along with the Eurogroup President, Mr. M&aacute;rio Centeno, and the ECB President, Mr. Mario Draghi.  Discussions were focused on the further reform and deepening of the eurozone and the need to complete economic and monetary union, including a banking union and capital markets union.  Mr. Centeno provided an update on the progress on implementing decisions reached at the previous euro summit in June, in particular on the further development of the European Stability Mechanism, ESM.  Work continues on this at the level of finance Ministers.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> I spoke about Ireland's commitment to the further development of European economic and monetary union, including completion of the banking union as soon as practicable, and the use of the ESM as the backstop to the Single Resolution Fund.  I also took the opportunity to inform the Council that Ireland has now collected in full the alleged state aid from Apple.  This will be held in an escrow fund pending the outcome of the appeal process before the European courts.  </font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> I also gave an overview of Ireland's 2019 budget, which will effectively see us having no deficit for the first time in ten years.  It will allow us to continue to reduce our national debt as a proportion of GDP.  I underlined our commitment to continuing to tackle the issue of aggressive tax planning and tax avoidance by some multinational companies, including through the introduction of an exit tax in budget 2019.  All of these actions were very warmly welcomed by other Prime Ministers and Presidents.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F"> We can work together as 27 member states, building close relationships with third countries, to manage the challenges we face, including Brexit, migration and security.  From Ireland's perspective, we are building new strategic alliances and strengthening existing ones.  Our active participation in the debate about the future of Europe, and the citizens' dialogue that the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy McEntee, has been leading at home, have been really valuable here.  I fully intend to have Ireland continue to play a constructive role and a leadership role in shaping the future of the European Union which we help to build.</font></p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-24a.287" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1360" speakername="Se&aacute;n Haughey" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102400024#W00200"><p>I am sharing time with Deputy Lisa Chambers.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  It</font>is disappointing, but not surprising, that there was no white smoke, so to speak, at last week's EU Council meeting.  It is remarkable, however, that the main message coming out of the meeting, unlike after Salzburg, was that work is ongoing and that it is still possible to reach a deal.  This at least gives some hope as we all agree in this House that a no-deal scenario would be a disaster for Ireland, the UK and EU.  Given the coverage in the UK papers since the Council meeting, more doubt has been cast on what Prime Minister May can deliver given her internal challenges in Westminster and her own party.  No doubt EU members are very conscious of this challenge, and every effort is being made to enable the UK to realise the challenges ahead if there is a no-deal Brexit.</p><p>Today's headlines in the <i>Financial Times</i>, for example, outline how the United Kingdom is planning to bring in emergency supplies, such as food and medicine, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  When this was discussed at Cabinet, it was reported that one Minister said &quot;an almighty row&quot; developed.  Obviously, the root cause of all the problems is to be found in the small group of Brexiteers in the Tory party who continue to campaign against the EU with almighty ferocity.  They seem determined to cause chaos even if it destroys the economy of their own country.  Added to this, there is the complicated scenario in which the DUP is adamant that Northern Ireland cannot be treated any way differently from the rest of the UK even when businesses and farmers depend on a seamless border to do their daily business and when the majority of citizens in the North voted to remain in the EU.  It is exceptionally difficult to take the demand and criticisms from the DUP when there seems to be no effort to allow and enable the Northern Executive to get back up and functioning.  It is now nearly two years since the Executive and Assembly met.  It is no wonder that people in the North are so disillusioned with their politicians across the parties.  Not having an Executive during such a critical phase of Brexit negotiations makes no logical sense.  Party political ideologies are getting in the way of pragmatic politics and this is harmful and works against the interests of the people of the North.</p><p>My party leader has said on numerous occasions that a deal is possible, and Fianna F&aacute;il remains committed to being generally supportive of what the Government and its diplomats are trying to achieve as we believe this is in the best interest of the island of Ireland and, of course, the rest of the EU and the UK.  We must, however, prepare for every eventuality.  While the budget allocated funding to recruit 400 additional east-west customs staff and to increase the allocation to IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland so that they will increase access to the overall European markets, Ireland must do more in case there is a no-deal scenario.</p><p>It was interesting to read the independent review by the PBO.  It found that the Government prepared for an &quot;orderly Brexit&quot; and that there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the future relationship between the UK and the EU and the negotiations of this future relationship.  For this reason, it is believed it may not be prudent to plan on the basis of an orderly Brexit.  The office also cautioned on conventional economic models as they &quot;may not capture the unprecedented shock that a disorderly Brexit represents&quot;.  For Ireland, the economic damage, according to the only independent forecast commissioned by the Government is a hit equal to 7% of national income, which is the same as would be felt by the UK. </p><p>As our party leader said last week, the first priority must be to keep pushing for a form of special status for Northern Ireland that would guarantee it full access to both the EU and the UK markets.  Northern Ireland would have a unique economic status where it would not be obliged to pay for membership of the Single Market but would derive all of the benefits.  The special or &quot;unique&quot; economic zone status that my party has advocated provides a definite guarantee that no constitutional sleight of hand is being implemented.  It utilises principles well respected in international trade law and which, by definition, involve one part of a state being given separate and preferential status by comparison with the rest.  In this regard, we should note an area that we are all familiar with on the border of Germany and Switzerland, namely Busingen.  Busingen is not technically part of the EU customs territory.  As a treaty was signed in 1948 between Switzerland and Germany, it is part of the Swiss customs territory.  An exception has been made for geopolitical reasons.</p><p>Other issues were raised at the European summit.  Our European challenge is not just about minimising the damage of Brexit because we have also to renew our approach to the future of Europe.  Last year, the French President, Mr. Macron, began a debate on the reform and development of Europe that cut to the heart of the issues involved.  We cannot meet the challenges of a changing Europe and changing world if we continue with an approach to the Union that denies its ability to be more effective and ambitious.</p><p>For many years Ireland has been a supporter of incrementalism within the Union principally because we saw the need to stop the UK from opting out of everything.  That reason will be gone following Brexit.  We must look again at supporting a Union that has the resources and means to do more to help all of us meet challenges such as energy security, building a more robust financial sector and helping regions and countries in need.</p> <p> I am glad immigration and cybersecurity were also discussed at last week's meeting.  The call for increased co-operation should be adhered to as it is in every member state's interest and all states must work towards eradicating illegal smuggling both online and at sea.  The asylum process was also discussed and proposals by the Austrian Presidency are to be worked on before the December Council meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-24a.289" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1336" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102400025#X00200"><p>It was disappointing that no progress was made in the Brexit negotiations at this month's Council meeting.  The lack of progress meant that no date was set for a special summit in November, as had been expected.  We are in the final stages of Brexit and it is a crucial time for both the UK and the EU.  It was positive to read reports in recent days of a potential new solution to the deadlock, with the EU offering the UK a UK-wide customs arrangement that would potentially be negotiated as a separate international treaty.  This would be very welcome from an Irish perspective and go some way towards solving the remaining Irish issue of the Border.  However, it does not, as was suggested by the UK Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, Dominic Raab, dispense with the necessity for a legally binding Northern Ireland-specific backstop, which is our insurance policy and still a requirement for a withdrawal treaty.  We must stand firm in our rejection of such a notion.</p>  <p>  It remains unclear whether Mrs. Theresa May can get any of this through the House of Commons, but we rely on there being a majority in the UK Parliament to prevent a no-deal Brexit scenario.  There could still be a situation where the UK negotiating team strikes a deal in Brussels, including a backstop for Northern Ireland, but the Prime Minister, Mrs. May, is unable to get it through the House of Commons.  The potential for a hard Brexit is still ever present and we must prepare for it, although we hope that outcome is very unlikely.  We regularly hear from the UK that the future trading arrangement to be negotiated will solve all our problems and that a backstop will never be needed.  However, if the UK continues to pursue its own trade deals and adopts a different customs regime and potentially different standards and regulations from those of the EU, in the absence of a Northern Ireland-specific backstop our current problems with the Border will persist.  We must remain vigilant in these final stages of the negotiation and not get sucked into looking to the further trading relationship between the UK and the EU to resolve the issues pertaining to Ireland because it is quite likely it will not.</p>  <p>  There is an unprecedented deal on the table for Northern Ireland, the best of both worlds.  With a special economic zone for the North, for which I and my party have advocated for at least two years, Northern Ireland could have access to the EU market and all the benefits associated with membership while still being constitutionally part of the UK and having full access to the UK on that basis.  For some reason, however, the DUP cannot or does not wish to see this and is rejecting it.  It is extraordinary that it would prefer Northern Ireland to fall off a cliff next March rather than explore this genuine opportunity which would provide real benefits for both communities, farmers, businesses and citizens.  Of course, Sinn F&eacute;in is nowhere to be seen in the North at a time when it should be advocating strongly for this special deal.</p>  <p>  Finally, with regard to our domestic preparedness for whatever type of Brexit occurs, it is accepted that even a soft, orderly Brexit will still be a negative shock for our economy, particularly for the agriculture and agrifood sectors.  I am concerned that the take-up of Brexit supports, and the Taoiseach referred to the Brexit loan scheme, has been very low.  In fact, as of this month only &euro;8.5 million of the &euro;300 million available has been drawn down.  Over 80% of jobs in the agrifood sector are outside Dublin and are sustaining rural communities across the country.  There are some 250,000 jobs in that sector.  This would be the most strongly affected sector by Brexit and the Government must up its game and ensure it protects this industry.  We cannot wait until next March to prepare for Brexit.  The Government must do more in terms of getting the farming and business communities ready.</p></speech>

Last December we were told that the so-called backstop arrangement was a guarantee or insurance policy that there would be no hard border on the island of Ireland and that the interests of citizens in the North, the majority of whom voted against Brexit, would be protected.  We were told at that time that this arrangement would be enshrined in a legal text by March of this year.  When that deadline came and went, we were then told the British Government would produce firm proposals by June.  After that, the deadline became the October European Council meeting.  The Taoiseach said at the time that he would prefer to have the right deal in October than any deal in June.  That was a fair position, given the scale of what is involved, but it is now nearly November and there is no deal in sight.</p>  <p>  I am not blaming the Taoiseach for that.  I believe he was led up the garden path by the British Government which, frankly, has engaged in bad faith.  It signed up to the backstop last year and has spent every moment since then trying to renege on it.  It has stalled and prevaricated.  This is due to the fighting and division within the Tory party and Mrs. Theresa May's toxic pact with the DUP.  That is the reality.  The DUP has aligned itself with the most right-wing element of the Conservative party, UKIP and extremist Brexiteers, and moved from a position of seeking to avert or avoid a hard border to actively seeking one.  In the months that followed Brexit even Jeffrey Donaldson, difficult as it might be to imagine it now, was making the case for a special deal for the island of Ireland.  Now, due to pure politics, the language of the DUP has shifted to "not an inch" and "no surrender", and it is ready and willing to sacrifice the progress of the past 20 years just to be seen to be particularly staunch or hard-line.  That is a reckless and irresponsible position, in spite of the considerable goodwill that exists across Europe for the North and a willingness to make arrangements that would be favourable to the North, perhaps more favourable than other areas enjoy.</p>  <p>  The DUP does not represent the majority of people in the North and it does not represent the majority opinion in the North, which voted to remain.  That point cannot be made often enough.  The North voted to remain and that vote must be respected.  The special circumstances pertaining to the North and the island of Ireland must be recognised.  On Monday, Mrs. Theresa May addressed the House of Commons in Westminster in what was billed in advance as a significant statement on Brexit.  Unfortunately, it was anything but.  There was nothing new, only rhetoric.  There were no new proposals on the backstop or the border and nothing new in respect of Ireland.  Her proposal for a time limited backstop, which in reality means no backstop at all, is a non-runner.  The backstop cannot and will not be temporary.  She must grasp that reality and do it quickly.  It is incredible that with five months to go, she still has not got the message.  The fact is that she signed up and agreed to the backstop in December.  It remains the bottom line in order to prevent a hard border and safeguard our political and economic stability, now and for the future.  It cannot be negotiated downwards or watered down.  The integrity of the peace process is at stake here and there is an onus on the Taoiseach and the EU 27 to ensure there is no resiling from that position and no return to a hard border on our island.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, time is running out.  The Taoiseach said he is not interested in deadlines, and I accept that.  A deal late in the day is clearly better than no deal.  However, there will have to be ratification of any agreement and that will not be a straightforward process.  Last week the European Parliament made it clear that it will not support a withdrawal agreement without a workable and legally operational backstop.  I welcome that.  It is recognition of the unique circumstances of our island.   The European Parliament gets it.  Mrs. Theresa May must do the same.  There is an onus on political leaders to defend our country's political and economic interests.  We can have our disagreements on a plethora of issues but this is far too important for everyone on the island.  That has guided Sinn F&eacute;in's approach to this issue.  We have supported the Government and the European negotiating team in their endeavours to get the best deal possible for Ireland.</p><p>We want that as the final outcome, and that should be the position of everybody and every party on the island.  We will continue to defend the position of citizens in the North and across the island.  People want a frictionless Border and the full protection of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Brexit backstop must be the bottom line and the absolute minimum.  There is an onus on the British Government to step up to the plate.  The onus on the Irish Government is to defend and promote an all-island view.  The Government must stand firm in defending the interests of the entire island and the rights of citizens.  The Taoiseach and the Government must remain resolute in the face of British intransigence, and the EU must remain true to its word that without an agreed, legally enforceable Brexit backstop there will be no withdrawal agreement.</p></speech>

If we had hoped for any new proposals on Brexit, or any breakthrough in the negotiations, I believe we were all disappointed.  This is a classic negotiation tactic.  If one does not want to give more ground, or is unable to give more ground, one plays for time.</p>  <p>  What we saw at the October summit was incredible.  The British Prime Minister again offered nothing new.  The British Prime Minister again demanded that the EU rather than the British should make new concessions.  Previously Mrs. May has been accused of having spent two years negotiating with her own party to come up with her politically acceptable set of proposals for the Tory Party - the Chequers proposals - as if she did not subsequently have to negotiate with the EU 27 at all.</p>  <p>  When Mrs. May proposes changes, as she has recently done in her speech to the UK Parliament, it is as likely to be one step forward and two steps back.  Theresa May has contorted her position from last December.  I have already said this to the Taoiseach during earlier questions.  Last December there was a clear commitment to a Northern Ireland backstop agreement.  However many times we repeat this, Mrs. May is certainly now moving her ground on this and doing complex manoeuvres that seem designed to disguise the fact that she is walking away from the solemn agreement that was clear and unambiguous last December.</p>  <p>  Crucially for Ireland&rsquo;s concerns, the British Prime Minister is seeking to transfer the risks associated with Brexit to Ireland.  I made this point to the Taoiseach earlier.  It is a fundamental point.  Mrs. May has proposed a UK-wide Brexit backstop so that there is no need for the Northern Ireland-only version.  The EU has agreed to this option, but rightly requires a Northern Ireland-only version in the legal text.  This is what was expected from last December and it is still the position.  The UK Secretary of State, Dominic Raab, has suggested that extending the implementation period is an alternative to the backstop.  Clearly it is not.  A longer transition, however, should be acceptable as the alternative to actually triggering the backstop, as long as the legal backstop exists.  Prime Minister May has argued that the UK must not be kept in either a backstop arrangement or in a transition period "indefinitely".  That is unacceptable, and if there is to be a backstop at all, it must have permanent effect.  Again we see a significant shift from the December commitment.</p>  <p>  The risk for Ireland now is that we will be asked to accept some diluted form of the backstop.  Only last week I was rounded on by one or two spokespersons from the Taoiseach's side of the House for daring to suggest that such options were even being discussed in Europe.  Now those comments are out in the open.  The Labour Party warned that we must not allow the Irish Border to be part of the final horse trading at the end of these negotiations between the EU and UK.  Just two weeks ago, Prime Minister May spoke very important words in Parliament about her "profound responsibility" to the Good Friday Agreement and how life on both sides of the Border in Ireland must be allowed to continue as it does now.</p>  <p>  If the British were truly committed to the Good Friday Agreement, we would have seen a separate legal agreement on the table by now.  For a while now I have told the Taoiseach that I am sceptical about seeing a legal version coming from Britain in relation to the December agreement.  The Taoiseach had said that it was coming and that it was promised.  By mixing it in with the other Brexit issues, Ireland&rsquo;s concerns are always at risk of being part of a basket of negotiating positions in the final talks.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach's approach has failed to resolve the Border issue in advance of this final end game discussion.  Last year the Taoiseach had promised that the commitment to a backstop was "bulletproof", "rock-solid" and "cast-iron".  Quite obviously that is not the case because the backstop is the single major issue left to be resolved in the negotiations.  While there are other issues to be discussed, when it comes to the crunch, this is the single blockage issue now.  Deadlines for agreed legal texts on this matter have repeatedly been missed.</p>  <p>  I have no doubt about the firm commitment of Mr. Michel Barnier&rsquo;s negotiation team to Ireland&rsquo;s demands.  I have never doubted that.  I believe there is solidarity in the other EU 26 for Ireland's insistence on no hard border.  This is what I hear again and again.  This, however, is not the point.  We now see the British Government trying to wrangle a deal where it does not agree a legally binding and potentially permanent backstop.  At the end of this period, the Taoiseach may well be asked by our European partners to choose between no deal or no backstop.  The core issue in the backstop negotiations is that the risk associated with the backstop is not transferable and we need to be crystal clear about this.  Either Ireland takes the risk of no backstop agreement, in the hope that the future relationship negotiated between the EU and the UK will be so close that border controls will be meaningless, or else the UK agrees a permanent backstop arrangement and takes the risk that this would never be invoked because the negotiations would arrive at a point where the relationship between the EU and UK is such that a border is unnecessary.  This is the binary nature of the choices.  The binary nature of this risk reduces the scope for us to produce any innovative solution to the dilemma facing Prime Minister Theresa May.</p>  <p>  We need the Government to reaffirm that Ireland will, at this point, insist on no deal rather than allow any dilution of the legal certainty and permanency of the Northern Ireland backstop.  If there is no deal, I believe a successor Labour Party government in London will make the agreement that we are seeking.  The British Labour Party is committed to remaining so close to the Single Market and customs union that we would not have to trigger any legally stated backstop.</p>  <p>  Is the Government now fully prepared for end game negotiations?  After March, is it fully prepared for potentially months of a no-trade deal with the UK and a hard border, temporarily?  If this happens, are we really prepared for what might happen at midnight on 29 March 2019?  There is no doubt that the Government will come under immense pressure from business to avoid a no deal scenario.  We will then be faced with a real dilemma, and it will be a real dilemma for the Taoiseach.</p><p>Will we fudge the backstop and sacrifice our political commitments to Northern Ireland?  All of us in this House need to be alert to the level of risk that will arise in these critical final months.  We will all come under pressure because Brexit will harm jobs and livelihoods.  A temporary no deal scenario, even if it only lasts for a few months, will destroy businesses and end jobs.  It will be a major shock to Ireland&rsquo;s economy, but we have to be prepared to weather that storm because the alternative is genuinely worse.  If we do not - all of us - hold firm on our demand for a potentially permanent, legally operational backstop, we take the risk of reinforcing and copper-fastening partition on this island.  Twenty years after the Good Friday Agreement, with the flourishing of all-island economic activity and the great improvement in relations between the people, North and South, east and west, even if the risk of a hard border is low we should not take that risk at all.</p></speech>

The Commission is refusing to accept a budget decided by an elected Italian Government.  Although it is an Italian Government with which I disagree and which contains some horrifically right-wing forces in the form of the Northern League it is nonetheless an elected Italian Government.  Here we have an illustration of precisely what we warned against at the time of the so-called fiscal treaty, which was in reality an austerity treaty.  We warned that the crisis would be used to embed a system of authoritarian neoliberalism within the European Union.  At the time, the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, who has just left, called on the Socialist Party not to "lie" about the treaty and what it was about.  He told us that if we did not accept the austerity treaty there was a risk that austerity might have to be faster, quicker and deeper.  The then T&aacute;naiste, Eamon Gilmore, informed us that this was an opportunity to vote for "economic stability and economic recovery", but what we have seen in the last week or so in terms of the relations between the Commission and the Italian Government on the question of the budget has been an absolute confirmation that what took place with the fiscal treaty was an enshrining and hardening of that system of authoritarian neoliberalism.</p>  <p>  Explicit use was made of the Commission's power to say no to a budget put forward by an elected government, to refuse to accept it and to say, in this case, that the Government had three weeks to come back and present a different budget in line with the kind of mechanisms the Commission wants.  If the Government does not do so, the Commission has the ability to fine it.  Those fines will escalate.  In the case of Italy they could reach up to &euro;3.5 billion.  The Commission has the right to take the Government's votes at the European Council away from it.  Up until this point the European Commission has not used those powers.  Instead it has relied on the softer powers of the European semester, putting pressure on governments to toe the line and so on.  Now, however, authoritarian neoliberalism has bared its teeth within the European Union in a very blatant way to which everybody should pay attention because today it affects the Italian Government and some of the horrific characters involved in it, but tomorrow it could well affect a left-wing government trying to implement left-wing policies.</p>  <p>  To be clear, I hold no candle for the Italian Government whatsoever.  It is a fundamentally right-wing government.  The Northern League and Matteo Salvini are guilty of horrifically racist rhetoric, but also of implementing anti-immigrant and racist policies since the party came to power.  It is also fundamentally committed to a neoliberal model of capitalism and the maintenance of its rule.  That is reflected in the fact that in the past clash with the European Commission it conceded on the question of the finance minister and ended up appointing a right-wing technocratic finance minister in order to attempt to please the European Commission.</p>  <p>  This is a question of fundamental democratic rights.  The Italian Government, under pressure from below, has delivered a budget which contains measures for which ordinary people have pressed, for example a minimum income for the unemployed, a reduction of the retirement age and a refusal to increase VAT from 22% to 25%, as requested by the European Commission.  Under pressure from below on some level, it has not implemented the kind of harsh budget involving austerity across the board which the European Commission would request.</p>  <p>  The response of the European Commission to that has been absolutely vicious.  It has refused to accept the budget.  Pierre Moscovici, the European Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, has said the "budget represents a clear and intentional deviation from the commitments made by Italy last July" and that Italy's compliance with the debt reduction benchmark agreed by all member states is in question.  This requires, as outlined in the fiscal treaty, a steady reduction of the debt level towards the 60% threshold referred to in the EU treaties.  This is about locking Italy into literally decades of austerity to pay down this debt.  Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said "The Italian Government is openly and consciously going against the commitments made" and that it is tempting to cure debt with more debt but that at some point debt weights too heavily.  The Commission's recipe is to attempt to cure conditions that are partly the effects of the crisis of austerity by heaping on yet more austerity.  It is a recipe for a downward spiral.</p>  <p>  I saw someone mentioning that bond yields are being checked in Italy like it was 2011.  We are back again to that point at which markets are being used as a threat against the Italian Government and any government that would threaten to vary outside the extremely limited strictures of the kind of neoliberal and austerity policies promoted by the European Commission.  Sebastian Kurz, the Chancellor of Austria, which currently holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, said that Austria is not prepared to stand behind the debts of other states while those states are actively contributing to market uncertainty.  That is the same sort of rhetoric we saw six or seven years ago in attempts to make governments comply with the diktats of the market, as represented by the demands of the European Commission.</p>  <p>  This is a right-wing Italian Government which has no redeeming features whatsoever.  The left in Italy is absolutely correct to oppose this Government and to attempt to bring it down through struggle.  These fiscal rules, however, are an impediment to resolving the crises that face ordinary working-class people.  That is a fact.  It is also a fact in this country when it comes to the question of housing.  The rules function in such a way as not to allow us to use the massive resources that exist in this country in NAMA or the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund to invest in resolving the housing crisis because doing so would mean investing at a rate higher than our growth rates.  The fiscal rules are a barrier to resolving crises that affect ordinary people.  The effect of the fiscal treaty was to hammer those fiscal rules, which started their life in the Maastricht treaty, absolutely into law and to give significant power to the unelected European Commission to ensure that governments do not come under pressure from below and that austerity policies are implemented.</p>  <p>  It is a very unfortunate reality that it is a right-wing Italian Government which is coming into a clash with the European Commission on this question.  The betrayal of Syriza was very unfortunate.  It did not carry through a confrontation with the European Commission which now unfortunately allows the right to be painted as those who are willing to stand up the European Commission when, in reality, it has already bowed down in terms of the finance minister and is likely to seek some sort of compromise on this issue.  It is important for the left to be absolutely clear here.  These fiscal rules are an absolute disaster from the point of view of ordinary people.  The model of the European Union, which has become increasingly authoritarian and which has neoliberalism at its core, is no model for any social progress or any democratic vision of Europe.  It has nothing to do with any idea of internationalism whatsoever.  Left-wing governments which do not bend the knee to austerity policies and the European Commission, as happened with Syriza, will be elected again and those left governments are going to face these rules.</p><p>A choice will have to be made to say clearly that we refuse to accept the fiscal straitjacket and refuse to be bound by the fiscal rules.  It is a choice between abiding by its rules and not facing its sanctions and not implementing austerity and policies that are disastrous for ordinary people.  If we break with austerity and neoliberal policies, we will clash with the European Commission, safe in the knowledge that in doing so we will be standing up for the interests of millions of people across Europe who similarly reject those sort of policies and the very authoritarian model of the European Union that we have now.  It will be part of a struggle for a very different type of Europe, a Europe that is built democratically from below and which has social and socialist policies at its core, including pro-worker and pro-environmental policies.  It will have policies of global solidarity and social justice as opposed to the imperialistic austerity driven capitalist policies which are at the core of the European Union.</p></speech>

The first is the situation in Myanmar and the role the EU could play there.  We know what is happening to minority groups in Rakhine State, Kachin State and Shan State and the EU has a role.  In a reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, said Ireland is working with the UNHCR and the EU to put measures in place for investigating human rights violations and holding those responsible to account.  When was this last discussed at the EU?  When will it be discussed again?  The peace process, which is funded by the EU, is just not working.</p>  <p>  I will also raise the question of Yemen and the role of the EU.  In a Topical Issue debate last week, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, acknowledged the devastating consequences for civilians.  The UN humanitarian co-ordinator in Yemen, Lise Grande, estimated between 12 million and 13 million people in Yemen will be at acute risk of famine in the coming months if the conflict continues.  We can take it as a given that the conflict will continue because there seems to be little, if any, effort being made to bring the warring parties around the table.  I know the difficulties.  There are a number of warring factions in the south who are fighting each other but they will come together to fight the Houthi.  </p>  <p>  In three years, the EU has given &euro;438 million in aid to Yemen.  The aid is vital.  We can imagine what that aid could have done in Yemen if it was not needed to address the needs of those who have been affected by war.  We are told the public health system has broken down.  People, including children, are dying from illnesses that would be very treatable if it was not a war zone.</p>  <p>  Germany has suspended arms exports to Saudi Arabia and the UAE.  So too has Norway, while not being in the EU.  Other European countries and the US continue to fuel the fighting.  Where is the EU with one voice in confronting this?  The naval blockade on the ports of Hodeidah and Saleef is violating international humanitarian law because the impact on civilians is disproportionate to the military benefit.  That blockade is enforced by Saudi Arabia.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, said he raised these issues with the Saudi, Iranian and UAE embassies in Ireland but he did not tell us what their responses were.  Ireland was part of a group driving a resolution by consensus to establish a group of eminent experts on Yemen.  In the meantime the humanitarian situation worsens.  It is very alarming to hear of NGOs working in the humanitarian field being under attack and shot at.  The spotlight is on Saudi Arabia because of the very regrettable murder of Mr. Khashoggi but we cannot lose sight of the other aspects of Saudi Arabian involvement.  It is time for the EU to call for its member countries to stop selling arms which are facilitating the war.  </p>  <p>  The EU has to speak with one voice at the UN on the arms trade.  The EU being a voice against the arms trade is looking more and more unlikely because we hear about a comprehensive agreement between EU members that Britain and the US will have access to PESCO on a case-by-case basis after Brexit.  Last May, a group of countries presented a document pushing for PESCO to be open to outsiders but others, including France, were concerned that opening that door to American and British companies would deny lucrative contracts to arms industries in the EU member states.  That leads to the point about the EU Council spending a lot of time on migration and internal security.  Part of it is stepping up action against the smugglers.  I am totally in agreement with that because we have seen what their activities have led to.  We know the cost that people are paying economically through overcrowding and fatalities.  The Council says it will do this through co-operation with the countries of origin and transit, particularly north Africa.  How does that fit in with EU values?  Those values are under threat.  They talk about the need to protect the democratic systems but we are not seeing that with the rise of so many right-wing groups and individuals in Europe.  </p>  <p>  There are concerns about this work being directed through the European external investment plan and the EU trust fund because there have been questions about the trust fund.  While the EU says it is committed to democracy, I do not know that the policies on migration and defence are examples of democracy.  The supreme irony is that all these problems and the conflicts in many African countries can be traced back to the colonial and imperial powers of countries that are members of the EU.  While the EU continues to be a major funder of aid it is important that it confronts members in the arms trade that are creating the need for aid.  </p></speech>

D&uacute;irt s&eacute; nach f&eacute;idir an dubh a chur ina gheal ach seal agus chomh maith leis sin d&uacute;irt s&eacute; &aacute;it &eacute;igin eile sa tuarasc&aacute;il gur ionann an ceist ceart a chur agus a bheith leathbhealaigh tr&iacute;d an pr&oacute;is&eacute;as chun freagra a fh&aacute;il.  Mr. Justice Peter Charleton, in his recent report, which I will be looking at tomorrow and which I will not go into now, used two phrases I will make use of here.  He said one can only deceive for so long and that to ask the right question is to go far in answering it.  We see a Europe developing where we are not allowed to ask questions.  We see foreign policy discussed in terms of who is and who is not our friend.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, we have received a letter from the Ceann Comhairle.  I understand he might have been in a difficult position but he has written to all Deputies and said clearly he is not telling us what to say or how to act but he is reminding us that the one China policy has long been in place.  It is the Government policy.  He tells us it is up to us but it is important to remind us that China is our friend and Taiwan is not.  We have similar use of language on Saudi Arabia and a failure to condemn it.  There is a similar use of language on Turkey.  Despite all the complexity and education, we are now reducing foreign policy to who is our friend and who is not.  </p>  <p>  I proudly canvassed against the Lisbon treaty because, leaving out the references to the market and the free market, it primarily set down in black and white the militarisation of Europe.  There was one good little paragraph in the Lisbon treaty that said all decisions should be made as near as possible to the citizen.  That has been absolutely ignored and we have decision after decision made by unelected people.  Twice in this D&aacute;il session we have been subjected to two unelected people from Europe talking to us in the D&aacute;il.  I think it is unprecedented but I am subject to correction.  I watch with dismay and take every opportunity to highlight the continued use of Shannon, as do my colleagues Deputies Wallace, Clare Daly and Maureen O'Sullivan.  The continued use of Shannon is tolerated with no questions asked and when questions are asked no answers are given.  I have watched PESCO be signed in my name, which I never gave permission for, and we have committed to regularly increasing defence budgets in real terms in order to reach agreed objectives.  At present it is 2% of GDP which equates to an eventual increase in military spending to &euro;2 billion per year.  We had the EU's High Representative for foreign affairs, Federica Mogherini, calling it an historic day for European defence.  Imagine an unelected woman telling us that this is an historic day for defence.  It is more and more money going into the militarisation of Europe.  I do not have the time to go into all the details but at a time of pressing social need, particularly in housing and health, how we can commit to increasing the money going into defence - I put that word in inverted commas - in Europe?  It is simply dochreidte i nd&aacute;ir&iacute;re agus bheadh m&eacute; ag s&uacute;il le athr&uacute; &oacute; na mn&aacute; at&aacute; istigh sa Rialtas, go mbeidh siad frithchogadh agus ag taispe&aacute;int an bealach chun s&iacute;och&aacute;in a bheith againn sa saol, seachas a bheith taobh le na fir at&aacute; i mbun cogaidh.  </p>  <p>  Another aspect that is of great concern to me is the European Border and Coast Guard Agency which was there but which has been accelerated.</p><p>The creeping militarisation of Europe has become an accelerated process, with a plan to strengthen the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, which was established in 2016 with a force of 1,500 members, by increasing it to 10,000 members in order that we can protect "fortress Europe".  </p> <p> There are pre-European Council statements and post-European Council statements, which utterly fail to deal with the challenges.  While Brexit is a challenge, compared with climate change it pales into insignificance.  Compared with the militarisation of Europe and the consequences thereof, Brexit pales in significance, as it does when compared with the democratic deficit that led to the Brexit vote in the first place, which this Government and other Governments refuse to look at.  It is clear to me that a huge part of what led people to vote for Brexit was the democratic deficit that Europe and the Council in various meetings refuse to look at.  </p> <p> The first anniversary of the death of a Maltese journalist, fell this month, while another journalist was murdered recently in Bulgaria because she dared to talk about corruption in that country.  We have seen how our own High Court judge was treated by the newspapers in Poland.  There are serious democratic problems in all countries in Europe, yet we dare to lecture or tell other people how to live.  </p> <p> I am a proud Irishwoman and a proud European, but we joined up for a market and a trade deal.  We never joined up to lose our sovereignty or neutrality.  It is time for this country to grasp the nettle, stand up and speak for peace in this country rather than determine our foreign relations by who our friends are.  That is akin to what children might do in a playground.  We have learned nothing from the group mentality that led to the disaster in this country.</p></speech>

As Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, I follow the proceedings of the European Council with great interest.  Before the European Council summit last week, we all made statements in this House hoping there would be much-needed progress on the Brexit negotiations.  Unfortunately, there was no great progress to report, which is disappointing.  It is unfortunate we are still at the same stage as we were in June after the last European Council meeting.</p>  <p>  I reiterate the urgency of this whole matter.  "Brexit Day" is less than six months away.  If the UK crashes out of the EU next March with no deal, there is no doubt it will be an unmitigated disaster.  We are simply running out of time to resolve this matter and we need to find solutions.  I understand political solutions to the backstop impasse are being discussed and I hope an agreement can be struck soon.  The next European Council summit on 13 December will be of paramount importance.  It is nearly two months away and, therefore, it is vital we have agreed everything before then in order that the final agreement can be approved on time and people can make the necessary plans.</p>  <p>  I commend the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the Ministers, as well as the Minister for State, Deputy McEntee, and our officials who work hard to ensure Ireland's interests are heard in Europe.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle served as an MEP for many years with distinction, and I compliment our MEPs, from all political party persuasions and none, who have all succeeded in making Ireland's case in Europe, the benefit of which we now see in our neighbours' solidarity on the Border issue.  It was extremely important for people such as Mr. Guy Verhofstadt and Mr. Michel Barnier to appear before this House and before committees to meet people like the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Ceann Comhairle, the Taoiseach and various Ministers and stand shoulder to shoulder with us in saying that if the deal was not good for Ireland, it was not good for Europe while if it was not good for Europe, it was not good for Ireland.  That type of solidarity is important.</p>  <p>  While for us the headline issue of the European Council summit was Brexit, it is also important to note that the European Council drew other conclusions regarding migration, internal security and external relations.  These are important decisions about big issues that affect all of us, such as preventing further illegal immigration, increasing cybersecurity, combatting disinformation and fighting climate change.  The committee I chair attends interparliamentary meetings with members of other national parliaments from across the European Union and MEPs.  We know from attending these meetings and taking part in the debates that migration, in particular, is a huge issue for our European neighbours.  It is a much bigger issue than Brexit for many member states.  Our neighbours have shown us solidarity on Brexit and, therefore, it is important we support our neighbours on their priority issues.  I hope we will continue to work together to find constructive solutions to issues which affect us all and help our neighbours where we can.</p>  <p>  I mentioned the battle over climate change.  It would be neglectful of me not to put on record that today is a black day in Ireland because of the news of a great organisation, Bord na M&oacute;na, winding down the great jobs which it created and which contributed greatly over many years.  Many young apprentices came from all parts of Ireland, went to the midlands, trained, became mechanics, got qualifications and benefitted greatly from the knowledge and expertise of Bord na M&oacute;na.  Many people from County Kerry went to the upper floors of Bord na M&oacute;na in management and so on, while many other people worked for them in various capacities over many years and were grateful for the work.  It is sad beyond belief that the whole issue of climate change has made it normal and acceptable for us to think those jobs will be lost, with no clear pathway for Bord na M&oacute;na in the future.  What will create the jobs that will be left void after the next number of years?  The whole cessation of peat production is a retrograde step with which I do not agree.  More harmful emissions come from busy places such as China or Japan in one hour than what we will produce in the midlands over the next 50 years.  We are going along with it, however, and we are agreeing with it, which is wrong.  The whole peat industry should have been protected by allowing it continue rather than being ceased.  The production of peat briquettes, for example, was nothing in the world to be worried about or regretful about.  We should have kept producing the way we did for decades and there would have been nothing wrong with that. </p></speech>

It creates so many problems for farmers and businesspeople, and virtually everyone in the country will be affected if we have a hard border.  The British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, has many different movements and positions, and I am not just alluding to her ability to dance, for which she would not win any medals either.  The problem is that when the English people voted in that referendum to get out of Europe it was basically to sort out the immigration problem that they have and that they still think they have.</p><p>It is hard to understand how some sort of backstop would ever be accommodated by them.  The MPs are clear there definitely will not be another referendum.  That was what we had all hoped for, and I think I was the first person in this House to ask them to do that.  It was the immigration problem that led a majority of people to vote to leave the European Union.  If immigrants come here and want to use Ireland to get to England, if there is no Border or some sort of checkpoint and they get into the North of Ireland, it is easy for them to access England.  It is hard to visualise how we are not going to have a hard border when that is what the English people looked for and voted for.</p> <p> It will definitely effect business and jobs and even our fishermen who were badly served by the agreement reached in 1973 because it certainly did not favour them.  Our fishermen will find themselves in a far worse situation after this.  There is also the movement of cattle and of vehicles.  Are we really prepared?  Is this country really prepared?  Is our Government making the necessary preparations for a no deal scenario?  That is where we could suddenly find ourselves.  I hope the Government is successful with a backstop for Northern Ireland because the United Kingdom will not help us.  If the Government is successful it has to be a permanent backstop for Northern Ireland.</p> <p> As my brother, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, just said there is so much hullabaloo about climate change.  We are only a small country.  If we were to be totally emissions-free we would only make 0.13% of a difference in the world wide context.  Consider Japan and places where one cannot see one's nose with smog and smoke, and yet we are closing down Bord na M&oacute;na and are considering stopping cutting our own turf.  I spoke of this last week.  We are trying to stop people cutting turf to heat themselves.  What grander sight was there than to see the people out this summer out cutting turf, saving it, turning it and bringing it home.  Now they are able to have their own fuel but think of that in the context of the people who have to buy fuel for heating, whether gas or oil, the cost of which has gone up.  Home heating oil has gone up by 30%.  Look at the cost of that on people.  What was ever wrong-----</p></speech>

The meeting was not a key moment in the whole Brexit process and the work really needs to be done away from Councils prior to a final decision, hopefully at a special European Council meeting in November, December, or, as some people are now suggesting, in January.  However, it provides a staging post where we can consider where we are.  I happen to have been in London yesterday and the day before speaking at various events on Brexit and these have informed my thinking here.</p>  <p>  It seems that we have ended up in a very unsatisfactory position in the sense that we are now the last item on the table to be resolved.  It seems as though what the Prime Minister, Theresa May, says is true, namely, that 95% or 96% is done, and much of that is good work.  There has been a satisfactory level of progress around arrangements regarding the free movement of people and so on.  However, it is very unfortunate that this is the last unresolved issue.  All along, I recall the Taoiseach and others saying that the key was to get it resolved early - last December, then in the spring, in March, before the return - but we missed every deadline.  This is the last issue between a deal and no deal.  In any negotiation, that is not the position in which one wants to be.  I do not blame the Irish Government for that, but merely recognise that things have not worked out as we would have wished.</p>  <p>  We should stick to our principles, the primary principle being that when the people signed up to and voted for the Good Friday Agreement, and amended our Constitution by revising Articles 2 and 3, that was a hugely significant constitutional moment for this country.  It was a very positive one, in recognising that a return to a united Ireland would only be delivered in the context of a majority of the people in Northern Ireland desiring such an outcome and a willingness to work and co-operate with the North through the various structures which were established, recognising the Unionist position and tradition and their rights to their constitutional position.  It was a very progressive step and one which probably took 12 years to negotiate with the UK Government.  It is one that we have been trying to implement for 20 years, for good and ill, but it is an agreement that it is right to hold to.  It is not only that we hold to the Border, it is holding to that constitutional decision that we made as a people, in amending Articles 2 and 3 which was no small or insignificant thing.  It is right for us to stand by that and it is right that this House has been unified in that central position that we bring to the negotiations.  It is good that we have had almost universal support for this position from our European neighbours and I do not believe that we should cede it at this late stage.  That should not mean that we do not seek a deal, because that would be better.  When one considers that we have had difficulty negotiating a withdrawal agreement, imagine what it will be like negotiating a permanent agreement when a whole range of commercial and other vested national interests are at play.  It will be even more difficult.</p>  <p>  It is very hard to understand what the precise nature of the final deal will be, although it seems clear that the officials on both sides seem to have it in place and all that is left to happen is the final political management.  From what I hear, the resolution to the backstop deal will be some sort of two-phase process where we agree something along the lines of what was agreed in December or March, namely, that we have a backstop guarantee that is not time dated within the withdrawal agreement and that protects us from any introduction of a hard border.  However, I imagine that within the political declaration, which accompanies the withdrawal agreement, there will be some sort of commitment towards engaging during the transitional period in more detailed negotiations on what regulatory alignment and customs arrangement approach might apply on an all-UK basis - not only Northern Ireland - and that we would signal that we would be willing to engage in that process.  That would be with a view to having a slightly revised, or different, agreement.  That might not be necessary if we had a full agreement, but there might be two phases with the prospect of a second backstop which would recognise the outcome of that negotiated process over a period, perhaps two or three years, depending on the length of the transition.</p>  <p>  It is very hard to read between the lines and one reads so many views.</p><p>I read <i>The Times</i>the other day, which featured comments such as &quot;Theresa May puts it up to Europe&quot;.  Denis Staunton from <i>The Irish Times</i>covered the same speech from Westminster, and he read the situation much more accurately, to my mind.  It interpreted the speech as being indicative that there is a real mechanism in place now for resolving the backstop issue.  If that is the approach to be taken we should be willing to be flexible and engage with it in a creative way.  We should hold the line on our constitutional position, but that does not require us to have something today which will be engraved in stone for the next 20 or 30 years.  We should be willing to engage in that two-stage process if it will help to break the deadlock.  Other parties on this side of the House have said the same, which perhaps should give the Government flexibility and room for manoeuvre because it knows it would maintain support here.  It is important that we maintain that united position. <br/><br/>What I heard in London was scary, because it seems that the prospect of a no-deal crash-out is something the UK is increasingly willing to countenance.  In some ways it exposes some of the underlying objectives of those seeking a hard Brexit.  The UK Government produced a paper on 12 October showing the likely consequences for the areas of climate and energy in a no-deal, crash-out Brexit.  It seems to be considering leaving the European Union emission trading scheme, ETS, and taking the deregulated route, thinking that would cushion the hardships that would come from the breach that would occur in faith, relations and trade with their European Union partners.  It exposes the underlying philosophy behind the Brexit deal.  I mention that because there was another event in these Houses today which informed my thinking.  In the audiovisual room today, a series of Northern Ireland environmental campaigning groups presented an analysis of what is actually happening.  The reality is that our Border is becoming a dirty border in a dirty Brexit, and that there is unregulated illegal dumping, development of pig and poultry farming where there is a disregard for the polluting effects of ammonia and slurry used, and uncertainty as to where the materials used in such activity are going, and mining licences are being considered in the absence of any political administration to assess the strategic direction being taken.  We have debates in this House and are concerned when we hear that a Minister has met a developer without a civil servant being present.  We are hearing that in the North, civil servants are meeting developers with no politicians present, which is just as worrying.  Legislation is being passed in London today.  It is a very black day for Northern Irish politics; politics are being written out as administrative civil servants are being given ultimate power.  It is a very bad day for Ireland and for Europe, and one we cannot ignore.<br/><br/>I do not know if this was raised in the European Council but perhaps we have been blinded by Brexit to everything else going on in Europe.  The Italian Government seems to be in direct conflict with the European Commission about its budget.  There are concerns about what may happen to the Italian economy, and we are not going to be immune from any fallout of that.  I do not know whether the Irish Government has taken a public position on that, but it should.  We cannot just fixate on Brexit.  We have to return to thinking about where Europe is going and where we are going within Europe.  Brexit is blinding us to that, and that is another problem it has brought.  We cannot ignore that.</p></speech>

At the September meeting, the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, called for a constructive approach to solve the migration crisis.  He also called for a broader vision of partnership with third, non-EU countries, which would go beyond co-operation on migration issues.  I believe he is correct with this approach.  I noted the welcome afforded to the new Africa-Europe Alliance for Sustainable Investment and Jobs at the October summit.  I presume that Ireland fully supports that particular approach.  If we are to deal with the migration issue we have to look at the broader picture and deal with the problems in these African and Middle Eastern countries as best we can.  I believe the EU has obligations in that regard.</p>  <p>  I note that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report was looked at by the leaders of the European Council, as well as the need to implement the Paris Agreement.  Ireland has much to do in that regard.  It is significant that it came after budget 2019, which did not introduce carbon taxes.  That is a warning sign for us on climate change, particularly given how it has been pursued at European Council level.</p>  <p>  Deputy Connolly mentioned the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, Frontex, and the proposal to increase it by 10,000 guards by 2020.  I would like to hear the views of the Minister of State on that matter.  Conclusions were postponed over issues of sovereignty, and I would be interested to know what the Irish approach is to that particular proposal.  </p>  <p>  I note that the European Commission is going to examine measures to combat the spread of disinformation in election campaigns.  The European Council considered that matter.  I believe it is a big issue, and is something that this House will have to return to, considering how election campaigns are now being conducted globally.  </p></speech>

My first question concerns the inevitable delays that will be experienced by trucks coming from Ireland and heading towards the Port of Dover.  Even in the event of an orderly soft Brexit, which we are hoping for, there will still be delays because there will have to be some checks on UK trucks.  We will be caught up in the middle of that.  What is the Government doing to prepare for that to protect our supply chains and our haulage industry and to ensure that those delays do not result in empty shelves in supermarkets in Ireland?</p>  <p>  My second question concerns EU funding to support Ireland in a post-Brexit world.  Funding was made available to the member states most affected by the migration crisis because it was an extraordinary event.  Some member states shouldered more of the crisis than others.  Brexit is quite similar in that not every member state is affected equally.  We are clearly the most affected.  Have requests been made by the Government at EU level for the establishment of a Brexit fund we could draw down from and use to try to protect ourselves and offset the worst effects of Brexit, even if it is soft?</p>  <p>  My final question concerns the structures for dialogue between the Irish Government and the UK Government in a post-Brexit world.  What does the Minister of State envisage will be in place to replace the regular meetings at EU Council level to ensure that Dublin and London are in regular contact?  I refer to discussions between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister, as well as discussions between Ministers on both sides.</p></speech>

There are many serious human rights issues and violations going on in the world today and while the EU is a strong voice and provides aid, how much discussion, debate and concern is there at EU level about the two situations I mentioned today, namely, the problems in Yemen and Myanmar?  As the EU is talking about co-operation with Africa, I also mentioned the appalling current situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo where we are told there are 2 million malnourished children.  It is a conflict zone where there has also been an outbreak of the Ebola virus, which the authorities fear will spread to surrounding countries.</p><p>Is there anyone at EU level who is even slightly conscious of the irony of giving aid with one hand and taking with the other through lucrative arms deals?  It just does not make sense but that irony seems to escape the EU.</p></speech>

Can we have clarity on that?</p>  <p>  What steps are being taken concerning the numerous deaths of journalists in the EU?  Within one year, there have been three deaths.  It is a year almost to the month since the murder of the Maltese journalist.  Recently, there was the murder of a journalist in Bulgaria and, prior to that, one in Slovakia.  What steps have been taken on what this represents?</p>  <p>  Monopoly game type figures are being used for the climate change fines Ireland will face, varying from millions to billions of euro.  As we are not going to meet in the first instance our 2020 climate change targets, what is the figure now?</p></speech>

Africa has come under the heading of external relations as well as migration.  We need to acknowledge that our relationship with Africa should not be solely placed in the migration box.  We must continue to develop our relationships and to provide for the EU-Africa fund, as well as addressing the economic, human rights and conflict issues.  By building that relationship, we can address politically the challenges they are facing.  On 18 December, a meeting will be held between the African Heads of State and the EU, which will be led by the Austrian Chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, as EU Presidency holders.  This will give us an opportunity to have further political dialogue and to engage on the proposals put before the European Council for disembarkation platforms and the proposals to address the root causes not just in Europe and Africa but in the Middle Eastern region.</p>  <p>  The recently published report on climate change highlighted the fact a rise in global warming of 1.5&deg; Celsius would clearly highlight the negative impacts of climate change and very much illustrate the unprecedented urgency to step up our global efforts to reduce the impacts of climate change.  The report makes it clear that parties to the Paris Agreement need to strengthen significantly their future commitments.  This includes Ireland.  I know there were concerns we did not raise the carbon tax.  It is important to note that the Minister for Finance has committed in this year's budget to put in place a long-term trajectory for carbon tax increases to 2030.  This is in line with recommendations from the Climate Change Advisory Council and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action.  We have a national policy position on climate action and low carbon development, underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.  We have a national mitigation plan, the purpose of which is to specify the policy measures required to manage Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions.  This year, we published the national development plan which reaffirms the Government&rsquo;s commitment to transitioning Ireland to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy and society.  Most importantly, funding of almost &euro;22 billion, coming from Exchequer and non-Exchequer resources, will be provided to address the transition to the low-carbon and climate-resilient society.  That means one in five euro of public funding will be spent specifically looking at climate change and to mitigate its challenges.  The report refocuses all of our minds to the challenge that lies ahead.  The Government is aware of these challenges and is trying to address them.  The increase to the overall budget for climate change this year is a factor.</p>  <p>  I am not quite sure of the exact figure for the climate change target fines.  I will revert to Deputy Connolly with the exact figures.</p>  <p>  Regarding the spread of disinformation, our external borders and internal security were key issues addressed at the Council.  Ireland in particular focused on the spread of disinformation.  We have started to look at how cybersecurity could impact on elections in Ireland with reference to other countries.  Questions are still being raised about the most recent US presidential election.  The Irish view is that we need to strengthen wider co-operation across all levels of society, not just political but civil society.  This was reaffirmed by all 27 member states at last week's Council meeting.</p>  <p>  No consensus was reached by the 27 member states concerning increasing Frontex staff by 10,000.  There are still questions as to who they would report to and what competences they would have.  This is why no consensus was reached and why discussions are still ongoing.  As Ireland is not part of the Schengen area, this does not impact directly on us.  Our position is to support those member states most impacted.  It is to be as proactive and supportive in the negotiations because there are differing views depending on the member state and its location in the EU in terms of closeness to borders.  We need to show solidarity to those member states which are most impacted.  We know, particularly in terms of the Brexit negotiations, the member states that are least impacted have shown solidarity towards Ireland.</p>  <p>  The negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, have been under way for well over a year.  In the past two discussions, Ireland and Belgium have raised concerns around the requirements of member states which are more impacted than others when a crisis emerges or some form of economic impact is felt.  Without specifically mentioning Brexit, the budget is seven years ahead and we do not know what other challenges may lay ahead.  However, we need to ensure flexibility within the budget, whether it is Brexit or some other form of economic challenge.  It should allow the flexibility for impacted member states to receive financial support.</p>  <p>  Every Department and Minister is identifying the challenges and possible threats from Brexit, ranging from the worst-case to the best-case scenario.  There also competences in the European Parliament and European Commission which are working to address those issues, particularly the transit, land bridge and aviation issues to ensure free movement.  The Commission published a report recently looking at ports in Europe and highlighting the challenges they may face, particularly given the fact that if there is any kind of a border between the UK and the rest of the European Union, there will be delays and checks.</p><p>Of course, from an Irish point of view, we cannot be held up as part of these delays and checks.  We are engaging with our European colleagues, particularly Belgium and France, to try to address the concerns that have been raised.</p> <p> Deputy O'Sullivan raised a number of human rights issues and the particular situation in Myanmar, which is of great concern.  The report of the independent fact-finding mission showed evidence of human rights violations, which absolutely amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes, by members of the Burmese military but also by other security forces.  In close co-operation with the UN Human Rights Council and our European colleagues, we strongly support ensuring those who are perpetrators of crime are held to account and we are monitoring the situation.  We are trying to work with our international partners to pursue a resolution to this crisis.  In the meantime, we can continue to support the organisations providing humanitarian assistance.</p> <p> With regard to Yemen and the significant challenges that arise, the T&aacute;naiste has outlined that he met the Saudi ambassador on 18 October.  He raised very serious concerns not just with regard to the Khashoggi case but also the ongoing conflict in Yemen.  I was also horrified by the recent reports of the UN's humanitarian co-ordinator that between 12 million and 13 million people may possibly be at risk of famine in the coming months.  More than 22 million people require some form of humanitarian assistance and this must be of concern to each and every one of us.  We are providing support and humanitarian assistance.  We have committed to &euro;16.5 million in bilateral humanitarian assistance.  Of this, &euro;4 million was contributed in March to the UN Yemen humanitarian fund.  As I stated, when the T&aacute;naiste met the Saudi ambassador he stressed Ireland's concerns about this issue.  At the same time, we need to stress that even if military victory is achievable it will not address the root causes of the conflicts so negotiations in this regard need to be reinvigorated.  Ireland and the EU fully support the work of the UN special envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, and his team in the negotiations.  We support that they are reinvigorated so we can try to address again the root causes of this conflict.  We will continue to provide financial support and to raise these issues.  The Deputy is right to continue to raise it on the floor of the D&aacute;il.</p> <p> Conflicts and the arms embargo have been mentioned.  This is an issue we have raised but at present there is no consensus at EU level and there are various views on this.  It is something we need to continue to discuss, engage on and raise at EU level.  There was no consensus on imposing an arms embargo but we need to continue to raise the issue and to work with the UN to promote the vital work of Martin Griffiths, which is essential for reinstating peace talks and providing a permanent solution to the overall crisis.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-24a.318" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1337" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102400033#FF00300"><p>This issue has been raised on a number of occasions in the European Council and at the General Affairs Council, specifically after the death of the Maltese journalist.  It has been raised in a number of formats with regard to freedom of speech and the right to freedom of dissemination of information and in terms of human rights violations and regulations.  In any of these cases we encourage that those who ordered or carried out these killings are held accountable, that each member state where they take place has a transparent investigation into all these killings, and that it is not acceptable that a journalist, no matter what country he or she lives in, could be subject to violence or murdered for their views or the work they do to try to ensure people's rights and their freedom of speech and expression are upheld.  This is something about which we have spoken very strongly.  I have spoken very strongly on it at meetings of the committee of which I am a member and a number of other members have also spoken very strongly about it.  It is something we will continue to raise in light of the recent death of Mr. Khashoggi.  We all understand he was subject the most horrendous and gruesome death.  I absolutely believe the perpetrators need to be held accountable and those who ordered his death absolutely need to be held accountable.  From an Irish point of view and, as a member of the European Union, we will continue to raise these concerns and to stress the significance and importance of the freedom of the press and the right to free speech.</p><p>I thank those who have contributed to this debate on what was a very important meeting of the European Council.  In addition to reporting in detail on Article 50 and Brexit, the Taoiseach has outlined the discussions on the euro summit.  As he indicated, I will focus my remarks on internal security and external relations issues that arose on Thursday.  In recent years, there has been good focus at EU level on supporting member states to ensure internal security and to fight terrorism.  We now need to further reinforce Europe's long-term response to new and emerging threats.</p><p>The European Council discussions on internal security took into account the outcome of the informal summit in Salzburg, where leaders had an open-ended exchange on the proposals outlined in President Juncker's state of the union address.  These include measures to complete the security union, to fight money laundering, to remove online terrorist content and to protect elections from malign foreign influence, as well as to reopen the Schengen borders and to use the civil protection mechanism . Their objective is to add value to existing and planned national measures and to further strengthen our collective security in a rapidly changing security environment.</p><p>While Ireland's participation in this area is limited due to our position under Protocol 21 and our non-participation in the Schengen border <i>acquis</i>, we are generally supportive of EU measures to protect the internal security of the Union and its citizens.  Leaders focused in particular on cybersecurity, which has become increasingly challenging in recent years, with new and innovative forms of cybercrimes, including with regard to the integrity of our electoral systems, continuing to emerge.  Here in Ireland last December we established an interdepartmental group to consider the risks to our electoral process, including a thorough examination of recent experiences in other democratic countries with respect to the use of social media by third parties.</p><p>The abuse of the online space by people promoting terrorism, whether by encouraging or directing atrocities, is also of great concern to us.  The global nature of the Internet means individual countries cannot respond effectively alone.  From Ireland's perspective, we support the concept of a collective response mechanism.  We need to co-operate in combatting such illegal activities effectively while continuing to promote an open, global, free, peaceful and secure cyberspace where fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular the right to freedom of expression, access to information, data protection and privacy and security, as well as our core EU values and principles, are fully applied and respected in the EU and globally.  In light of the attacks in Salisbury and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in The Hague, leaders are welcoming a new regime of restrictive measures to address these threats.</p><p>The external relations discussed included climate change as well as developments in Venezuela and our relations with our partners in Africa and the Arab League.  There were exchanges on the recent elections in Bosnia where nationalist and ethnic tensions were once again highlighted and on climate change, acknowledging the latest report mentioned by Deputies that unequivocally confirms the negative impact of climate change.  Leaders agreed on the need for ambition in advance of the COP24 in Poland in December.</p><p>There was also an exchange on relations with Saudi Arabia on regional developments and the shocking death of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.  In addition to the need to fully respect human rights, Ireland is committed to promoting and protecting freedom of expression and freedom of the media and civil space, and we join our EU partners in stressing the need for continued thorough, credible and transparent investigation into his killing to shed proper clarity on the circumstances surrounding it, which will ensure the full accountability of all of those responsible.</p><p>I thank the Deputies for their attention and remarks in the course of the debate.  As the Taoiseach has made very clear, Brexit remains our priority.  It is important that we continue to play an active and constructive role in the EU agenda and that we contribute to the ongoing debate about the future of Europe with a view to shaping its direction.  I was honoured to lead the citizens' dialogue on the future of Europe over the past year.  I look forward to continuing my involvement in this key area during the vital period ahead.</p></speech>

What steps are being taken to alleviate the hardship being endured by many such members?  The families and spouses of Defence Forces personnel recently marched to these Houses in a very dignified way and handed letters to the Government to seek to ensure that their dignity is maintained and that we recognise the service they give to this country.</p>  <p>  What steps are being taken to ensure that there is the required core of military personnel across the Air Corps, Naval Service and Army?  As the Minister of State will be aware, members of the Naval Service reserve were recently asked to fill full-time places within the Naval Service.  Today of all days, the 60th United Nations Day, it is unedifying for the country to have a shortage of competent military personnel.  I hope to hear something positive from the Minister of State regarding his intentions for concrete actions to ensure that the conditions under which people work within the services are addressed such that they, at least, receive the living wage and are paid a fair day's salary for a fair day's work.  We must ensure that there is a core crew of competent personnel across the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps.</p></speech>

I, as Minister of State, and the Government value each member of the Defence Forces and the roles they carry out, whether as peacekeepers or supporting the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other State agencies in Ireland.  For this reason, we have taken measures to improve the pay and conditions of serving members as well as addressing the challenges facing the Defence Forces.</p>  <p>  Defence Forces pay is continuing to increase in line with public sector pay agreements.  The increases are weighted in favour of those on lower pay.  Members of the Defence Forces received increases in pay in 2017 under the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  In a separate deal agreed with the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, the pay of general service recruits and privates who joined the Permanent Defence Forces after 1 January 2013 was increased further.  The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 provides for further increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the agreement.  The increases under the agreement due from 1 January 2018 and 1 October 2018 have been applied to the annualised salaries of Permanent Defence Force personnel.  Further increases under the agreement are scheduled for payment in 2019 and 2020.  By the end of the current public service pay agreement the pay of all public servants, including members of the Defence Forces, earning under &euro;70,000 per annum will be restored to the levels in place prior to the FEMPI legislation, as the Deputy will be aware.  Defence Forces personnel who joined after January 2011 will also benefit from the recently announced amendments to the pay scales for new entrant public servants.  The restoration of cuts to allowances will also be considered in the context of the public service pay agreement.</p>  <p>  The average annual salary inclusive of military service allowance for a 3 star private, which is the starting rank for enlisted personnel, is currently &euro;35,000 gross, while the average salary for an able seaman, which is the equivalent rank in the Naval Service, is &euro;37,000 gross.  Members of the Defence Forces also benefit from additional pay rates and allowances.  These include technical pay which ranges from &euro;420 to &euro;7,000 extra each year depending on the job of the individual member.  Approximately 47% of enlisted personnel are currently in receipt of technical pay.  In the past two years, we have increased the opportunities for personnel to serve overseas.  The average tax-free overseas payment received by general service personnel in 2017 was a little more than &euro;8,000 and the average paid to officers was almost &euro;10,300.</p>  <p>  On retention, given the unique and demanding nature of military life, there is understandably a higher level of turnover among Defence Forces personnel than in other areas of the public service.  This is not new.  Recruitment and retention issues in respect of certain specialist grades in the Defence Forces were highlighted in the report of the Public Service Pay Commission in May 2017.  The Government subsequently tasked the commission with examining these challenges.  That work has commenced and a detailed joint civil and military submission has been forwarded to the commission. </p>  <p>  A range of factors influence an individual&rsquo;s decision to stay in the Defence Forces.  Some progress has been made on non-pay initiatives, including more than 600 promotions to date in 2018 resulting in the promotion of one in 14 serving members.  Members receive pay increases on promotion.  For the first time in a decade, a potential officers course was commenced this year, giving 24 enlisted personnel a route to becoming commissioned officers.  Additionally, four enlisted personnel were commissioned as officers earlier this year to fill vacancies in air traffic control.</p></speech>

It presents a very rosy picture.  The Minister of State stands up here and says on the record of the House that pay for a 3 star private, which is the starting rank for enlisted personnel, is &euro;35,000 gross while pay for the average able seaman, which is the equivalent rank in the Naval Service, is &euro;37,000 gross.  I do not know if that is the experience based on an average working week of 39 hours because if we examine those figures more closely, we will find that most people who are within the services are working far in excess of 39 hours per week.  When we annualise the hours and the average hours per week worked for the salaries that are being articulated here, the picture is far more stark than the one presented to us by the Minister of State.  I have an example involving a soldier with 20 years service who got an affordable house with a mortgage ten years ago.  He has a monthly mortgage payment of &euro;700 and two daughters and receives &euro;500 per week on average from the Defence Forces.  He is applying for family income supplement.  No soldier or member of the Naval Service or Air Corps should have to apply for family income supplement.  That is the point I am making.  There is a gap somewhere between what the Minister of State is telling us and the reality for soldiers on the ground.  I do not want to be too rhetorical about this.  I want to give the Minister of State a chance to deal with this issue and I think we have given the Government a fair wind to deal with it.  I know of soldiers who are taking home &euro;300 per week.  The military allowance of &euro;120 is being used to make up core pay when it should be additional pay.  There are all sorts of issues there.  Every Member of the House could come before us with individual examples of soldiers in their constituencies or members of the Defence Forces but I still believe there is a lot of work to be done by Government to make soldiering and working in the Naval Service or Air Corps something to be proud of.  The rates of attrition are due to the fact that basic rates of pay are too poor.</p></speech>

There is no doubt about that and I have recognised and stated that on numerous occasions.  We are competing in a very strong economy that is almost at full employment.  A significant amount of work is happening in the background.  The Deputy understands public sector pay.  He understands that we cannot take one organisation out of the public sector and say that we will pay it more because the Deputy, his party and every other Member of this House, including those on my side of the House, would be jumping up and down asking why, if the Defence Forces were getting more pay, everybody else, including teachers, doctors and garda&iacute;, did not get more pay.  I hope the Deputy recognises and understands that.  They are members of the public service who have received increases under the public service stability agreement out to 2020.  Anyone in receipt of &euro;70,000 pre-FEMPI cuts will have their pay restored.  Military management and senior civil servants in my Department have worked over many months to produce a joint submission that was presented to the Public Service Pay Commission.  The commission looked for a data-based submission with which we have presented it.  I have asked that the commission meet face to face with military management and departmental management to go through the challenges relating to recruitment and retention within the Defence Forces.  I commend members of the Defence Forces for the work they do.  If it was as simple as just giving a pay rise, we would all do it but the Deputy understands that we just cannot take one organisation out of the public service and say there you go, that we are not looking after anybody else.  We are going through the public service stability agreement programme.  There have been increases this year since 1 January and 1 October and there will be further increases going to 2020.  We are working in parallel with the Public Service Pay Commission.</p></speech>

I welcome members of the Irish Glass Bottle Housing Action Group to the Public Gallery.  I note that although I am pleased to see the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Phelan, here, I am disappointed the Minister is not here.</p>  <p>  This was one of the biggest social and affordable housing projects advanced by the Government.  Unfortunately, it has become bogged down in bureaucracy.  In May 2017, an agreement was reached between the Government, Dublin City Council and NAMA that the Government would provide funding for the purpose of purchasing 900 social and affordable houses.  A strategic development zone, SDZ, was subsequently approved by Dublin City Council on the basis of representations to the council by the then Minister that the receiver was on board and that there was agreement that there could be 25% social and affordable housing on the site.  I think a total of 3,500 units were to be constructed.</p>  <p>  There was then great surprise when the receiver lodged an appeal earlier this year that was heard by An Bord Plean&aacute;la in April 2018.  It has now become even more delayed because An Bord Plean&aacute;la recently contacted Dublin City Council to say that it required further information.  It has given the council until January 2019 to provide that information.</p>  <p>  The Government needs to tell us when an agreement between Dublin City Council, the Government and the receiver will be reached.  Members of Dublin City Council entered into and approved this SDZ because they believed an agreement existed between the receiver and the Government so the responsibility rests with the Government.  It has become bogged down in bureaucracy.  The people of Irishtown and Ringsend are waiting for these houses to be constructed.  It is an essential part of the Government's housing policy, particularly with regard to social and affordable housing, but we have seen no development with regard to it yet.  It has become a mess and I want answers from the Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-24a.330" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="15:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102400035#OO00500"><p>Deputy O'Callaghan laid out the details very well.  We need to know when this agreement regarding the provision of social and affordable housing on the site in Poolbeg will be agreed but we also need to ensure that it is the right form of agreement.  On 25 May 2017, I asked the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, to set out what he envisaged the affordable housing provided within this agreement between the council, the developer and the State would be.  He said that it would be predominantly affordable rental with the balance being social housing with a targeted provision for elderly people.  This would be very welcome.  There is a huge problem in the area involving local people not being able to afford housing and a need for affordable rental housing, which I presume will be delivered by a cost rental model.  It maintains the units within public ownership and helps lower the rental costs for everyone.  It is a win-win arrangement but we need to make sure that this is the case and that the Government is not going down the affordable purchase route.  In this case, such an arrangement would be likely to result in very expensive properties as it is an ideal location close to the centre of Dublin.  That would rule it out for the vast majority of local people even at the kind of discounts that would apply.  Fundamentally, it would not be right.  What the Government might call affordable housing that involves just shovelling money in from HAP and other payments to the private rental sector is not affordable housing.  That is not where we need to go.  Yes, we need to know when an agreement will be reached but we also need to know the details of the agreement along with confirmation that, as the former Minister, Deputy Coveney said, that it will be affordable rental with social housing for elderly people.  That is what those additional 550 units above the standard social housing that will be provided must be.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-24a.331" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="15:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102400035#OO00600"><p>I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue concerning the ongoing situation at the former Irish Glass Bottle site in Ringsend, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, who cannot be here.  I do not want to get into too much of a row with Deputy O'Callaghan but I am a Minister of State in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  I can understand when Deputies wish to hear from a Minister from a Department but it is unreasonable to expect that Deputies get to pick which Minister will speak.</p><p> In May 2016, the Government, not Dublin City Council, designated Poolbeg west as a strategic development zone, SDZ, because of its potential to deliver a large proportion of the extra homes needed in the centre of Dublin.  The Government&rsquo;s designation of the area as an SDZ cleared the way for Dublin City Council, as the designated development agency, to take the next step in drawing up a detailed planning scheme or master plan to guide the development of the area.  The city council duly prepared a draft planning scheme which was considered by its elected members in May 2017 and approved in October 2017, after the scheme was amended to take account of inputs from public consultation.</p> <p> As a statutory consultee for that process, the Department highlighted the importance of the planning scheme, addressing a variety of housing needs and relevant matters.  For clarity, it is important to note that there is currently an appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la regarding the scheme.  The progress of development on the site will be dependent significantly on the nature and timing of the decision of the board.  It is my understanding that An Bord Plean&aacute;la sought additional information about the proposed planning scheme from Dublin City Council on 20 September last and must revert to the board with that information before 17 January 2019, after which the board will make a final decision on the matter.</p> <p> Securing an approved planning scheme for this site is a key step in enabling its development to progress.  This is a matter for the city council and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Murphy, has no role in such matters.  Under the provisions of section 30 of the Planning and Development Act, the Minister can play no role in a case before either a planning authority or An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p> <p> Pending the finalisation of the appeal process, and without prejudice to its outcome, I nevertheless wish to put on the record that the Minister is committed to working with the city council, any relevant approved housing bodies and all stakeholders relevant to the SDZ to see the site's development potential, particularly in terms of housing, fully realised. </p> <p> If the planning scheme is approved, implementation of the SDZ must include delivery of additional social and affordable housing from this site over and above Part V obligations and of the order and magnitude laid out in the adopted planning scheme, but subject to agreement on all the normal and relevant terms, including value-for-money aspects.  </p> <p> The Department also understands that the receiver is engaging with Dublin City Council with a view to advancing an approach that would better enable the orderly development of this strategic but complex city location and assist in delivering much needed additional social and affordable housing.  The Minister is ready to support such initiatives, subject to observance of all the normal value-for-money, procurement and wider legal aspects.</p> <p> Deputies O'Callaghan and Ryan share the Minister's wish that this site be developed as expeditiously as possible.  There are subtle differences between what each of the Deputies expressed.  Deputy O'Callaghan's emphasis was exclusively on timelines whereas Deputy Ryan was expressing concerns that the right balance and mix should be delivered.  Those are the issues that Dublin City Council and An Bord Plean&aacute;la will consider with the draft plan, subject to its approval.</p> <p> Members should not mislead the public in Ringsend, or anywhere else, to the effect that the Minister can get directly involved in a decision that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has to make.  The law is strict and there have been many planning inquiries and tribunals in the past, the results of which have led to planning law being in the shape it is in this country.  The Minister has no role in influencing the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but he is adamant that, once that decision is made, this vital city centre location will be suitably developed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-24a.333" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102400036#PP00200"><p>Can I explain why, in this situation, there is a role for the Minister?  The SDZ was unusual because it provided for 25% social and affordable housing.  The law only provides for 10%.  The reason that was permitted, and Dublin City Council went along with that 25% requirement, was because the council was led to believe an arrangement had been reached between the Department and the receiver and that the receiver was on board for the unusual 25% social and affordable housing.  That is why this is different from the standard mechanism and why it was such a surprise when it emerged there was going to be an appeal by the receiver to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p>  <p>  Another distinction regarding this site is that it is an enormous proposed development of social and affordable housing.  There will be 3,500 units, with 900 social and affordable units.  That it supposedly a flagship project for the Government and the Government should be on top of it and ensuring it is delivered.  This part of the city is crying out for social and affordable houses.  Young people from local communities cannot afford even to rent units in the vicinity.  It is unique that this part of the city requires proper consideration and requires development of this site promptly.</p></speech>

The State's role is to decide the nature of the affordable housing.  I reiterate that, on Thursday 25 May 2017, then Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, said that 550 units in this development would be affordable rental with an additional, smaller number of social housing units targeted at the elderly.  I welcome that.  It is the right thing to do.  There is still much work to be done on the exact mechanism of rental.  I want reassurance that units will be for affordable rental, not affordable for sale, in this development.  It is important, as Deputy O'Callaghan said, because local people are being priced out of the area, both in purchasing and renting.  We need affordable rental to give them a home to live in.</p></speech>

I am limited in what I can say because it is currently before An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but I will directly answer some of the questions that have been put.</p>  <p>  Affordable housing will be delivered under three areas of activity on the site, the first of which is to enable affordable housing for purchase.  Relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 have been commenced.  The Government will support the local authority to get sites ready for the delivery of affordable housing.  The Government has committed, in the budget, additional money that we are all familiar with.  According to the notes I have been given, the cost-based rental housing remains the primary delivery of social housing on the site in question and the Government position on that has not changed.</p>  <p>  I am sure, without having spoken directly to the Minister, that he shares Deputy O'Callaghan's frustration about the delays in the process.  The Deputy will know that planning laws allow anybody to lodge an objection or appeal at any stage and there is no way for the Government, any local authority, or anyone else binding a receiver or anyone else from lodging an objection.</p>  <p>  This is a flagship project and the Government is on top of it.  Dublin City Council is required to provide the additional information and An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which has received an increase in its staff complement recently to deal with a backlog of cases, can then deal expeditiously with the information and this site can be developed.</p></speech>

Phase 1 of the project has been completed from Heuston Station to Hazelhatch.  Phase 2 is to upgrade the track to four lanes as far as Kildare town, covering Sallins, Newbridge and Kildare town.  Capacity is key.  The ongoing road reconstruction and widening of the N7 is welcome but is causing carnage on the road because of the volume of traffic shoehorned into the two lanes.  There will be plenty of cars to fill all three lanes on the Naas bypass when it is widened.</p>  <p>  In the light of climate change, we need to continue moving to a more sustainable transport model.  Many students in my constituency cannot afford rental accommodation in Dublin and must travel back and forth everyday.  The quality of life for commuters is key.  Demand from residents in Newbridge, Kildare, Monasterevin and Portarlington will continue to increase.</p><p>We want to ensure we have ease of access and frequency of service.  In my supplementary question I will raise the cost for Newbridge residents compared with those living in Sallins because the short-hop zone only extends as far as Sallins, which needs to be revisited.</p></speech>

My query also relates to rail services in Kildare but I think it is of a slightly different nature.  As the Minister knows, I have been raising the plight of Kildare commuters since I entered this House and since the Minister became a Minister.  At the stations in Sallins, Naas, Kilcock, Maynooth, Celbridge and elsewhere we have a problem with success.  The service has improved.  I would claim some responsibility for that improvement.  I have been advocating for it for many years to the point that it is now a good service most of the time but is seriously overloaded.  The carriages are bursting at the seams and it is difficult to physically board the trains.  The car parks are bursting at the seams.  Passengers can forget about getting a space after 7.30 a.m.  Many passengers who get off at Heuston Station find they cannot get on the Luas either.</p>  <p>  I regularly commute.  I did so this morning and will run out of the Chamber shortly after this debate to catch a train back for a meeting tonight in the constituency.  I see this every day.  It has got to the stage that some people trying to board at Sallins and Hazelhatch cannot get on the train.  They have to stand back or fight their way on and off and have further difficulties getting on the Luas.  I give credit to the staff of Transdev, the Luas operating company.  This morning, as one might see in a Japanese city or another city with high passenger volumes, they were physically managing people on and off the trams because they were so overcrowded.</p>  <p>  I have tabled a number of parliamentary questions over the past two years since the Minister became Minister.  I have repeatedly made the point that we needed extra capacity with additional rolling stock and carriages.  I was very disappointed to receive a reply about a week ago stating that the National Transport Authority, NTA, had considered investment in refurbishment of carriages, spent two years investigating it and has now decided it could not do it because the costs were too great and there were risks relating to the supplier, Brexit issues, etc.</p>  <p>  Two years on, the trains and trams are fuller than they ever were, not to mention the car park, and we have made no progress in reality.  Had carriages been ordered two years ago - I believe there is a three-year lead-time - we might have been one year from getting them.  Now we are still three years from getting them unless the Minister has news to the contrary.  I look forward to his response.</p></speech>

The NTA has statutory responsibility for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services in the greater Dublin area, including Kildare.  The NTA&rsquo;s Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-2035 provides the overarching framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services in the greater Dublin area over the next two decades.</p>  <p>  At a national level, this year also saw the publication of the national development plan as part of Government&rsquo;s Project Ireland 2040.  The NDP provides a national level framework for the delivery of transport infrastructure over the next ten years.  Both the NTA&rsquo;s statutory transport strategy and the NDP provide for the DART expansion programme as one of the key investment priorities in the coming years.  Importantly the NDP also commits Exchequer funding to the project and an indicative allocation of &euro;2 billion is provided in the NDP.  That is a significant investment by the taxpayer in our transport network.</p>  <p>  The proposed enhancements to the heavy rail system will create an integrated rail network which will deliver a very substantial increase in peak-hour capacity on all commuter lines in the greater Dublin area, including the Kildare line.</p>  <p>  The electrification of the line to Hazelhatch-Celbridge and remaining infrastructure needed to complete the link of the Kildare commuter route to the city centre will be delivered as part of the DART expansion programme.  In the meantime, the upgrade to the Phoenix Park tunnel in 2016 has seen commuters on the Kildare line have the option of direct trains to Connolly, Tara Street, Pearse and Grand Canal Dock Stations.  It is proposed to further improve Kildare line services through additional off-peak and weekend services through the tunnel next year.</p>  <p>  In addition, the NTA and Irish Rail continue to examine short-term, medium-term and long-term options for meeting increased commuter services demand.  With regard to the adequacy of existing rail services, the existing rail fleet is fully deployed at peak times.  However, the NTA, in conjunction with Irish Rail, is examining options for additional train capacity.</p>  <p>  One option under current consideration is the lease or purchase of second-hand rolling stock and the NTA and Irish Rail will determine the viability of such an approach later this year.  In the longer term, and as part of the DART expansion, a comprehensive fleet purchase programme will take place adding significantly to the rail fleet.  The formal procurement notice seeking interested train manufacturers is expected to issue before year-end and a formal contract for the new fleet is expected to be signed next year.</p>  <p>  I am confident that the improvements planned in the short, medium and long terms will enhance services along this important commuter line.</p></speech>

Doubling the number of train tracks from two to four through Newbridge and onto Kildare town on the Dublin-Cork line on the makes eminent sense.  Planning for that accordingly and ensuring it is a priority makes eminent sense as we prepare for future demand.  Reopening the Phoenix Park tunnel has resulted in considerable benefits for commuters on the Kildare suburban line and has provided a very significant financial benefit for Irish Rail as it becomes a very user-intensive route because of its location.</p>  <p>  However, the cost for commuters in my constituency is considerable.  As I said earlier, the extension of the short-hop zone to Sallins, while welcome for residents in that area, has caused considerable issues.  There is an astronomical disparity in the prices for travelling from Sallins versus travelling from Newbridge, which is only seven minutes down the track.  The adult single fare from Sallins to Heuston is &euro;4.75 but from Newbridge it is &euro;14.30.  An adult monthly ticket from Sallins to Heuston is &euro;154 and it is &euro;264 from Newbridge.  This disparity is wrong.  Money is being spent on extending a car park in Sallins which is full of commuters coming from Kildare South because they are driving to that station for the cheaper fares.  The short-hop zone needs to be extended to Newbridge Station.</p></speech>

They are strong on rhetoric but they lack timelines or details.  I am quite familiar with the issues because I have worked on the issue for a decade, long before I became a Deputy.  I have tabled many parliamentary questions and some of the responses I received actually contradict the information in the Minister's speech.  I hope that is a mistake or something that can be clarified.</p>  <p>  For example, the Minister spoke about the long-term investment in the DART expansion.  He spoke about the enhancement of the heavy rail system and, of course, he spoke about the electrification of the lines.  These are all great things, but my understanding from replies to parliamentary questions issued from the Minister's office is that it takes a minimum of three years to buy an extra carriage.  Are all these great things at least three years away or will they come somewhat sooner?</p>  <p>  We have a crisis on the trains at the moment.  I am also concerned that despite climate change and everything, people might turn away from the trains if something is not done soon, which would not be good.</p>  <p>  I previously proposed to the Minister some practical changes that could be done more quickly.  The carriages on the Kildare line are geared for day trips down the country and not for peak commuting, unlike DART and Luas carriages, which have standing room, hooks and handles.  The trains on the Kildare line are more akin to the trains on which someone might spend a day journeying along the coast.  They have seating, but not much room to stand.</p>  <p>  A Luas shuttle from Heuston into town and back again would be very useful.  It would allay some of the massive overcrowding we see as trains come into the station every morning.</p></speech>

Owing to his family contacts, he is very familiar with the constituency of Laois-Offaly and perhaps Kolbe Special School, Portlaoise.  I hope he will take a special interest in the school.</p>  <p>  The reason I am raising the issue of this school, in particular, is that it is extraordinary.  There are very few schools like it.  When we talk about a special school, we all have ideas about what they entail.  There are many special schools throughout the country.  This particular school has 40 students under the age of 18 who have severe and profound intellectual disabilities.  Each child has a severe learning difficulty.  This makes the school an outlier by comparison with normal schools in terms of the difficulties the students encounter.  People, even locals in County Laois, do not understand that each student has a profound intellectual disability and a severe learning difficulty and that all the children are non-verbal.  Practically the majority are in wheelchairs and are completely wheelchair bound.  All have to be brought to the school in special adapted minibuses suited to wheelchairs.  The Minister is getting the picture.  There are only 40 students.</p>  <p>  The school has been pleading for a new school building for the past 15 years.  I want the Minister to give approval to appoint a design team.  That is precisely where we need to be.  The school is on a building list.  The construction might happen sometime but unless there is a design team, nothing will happen.  This is the critical next step that needs to be taken.  The site has been identified.  It is in HSE ownership and is adjacent to the current school but we need the design team.  The accommodation schedule was discussed among the departmental officials in Tullamore and the board of management some time ago, in March 2017.  There has not been a dicky bird since.  Therefore, we need to move on to the appointment of a design team so further progress can be made.</p>  <p>  Let me put Portlaoise in context and talk about the other schools.  There are 5,000 people in primary and secondary schools in Portlaoise.  In Kolbe school, there are 40, which is fewer than 1% of the total.  The students in question are the most disadvantaged in the entire region.  Kolbe school is the only school in the town that has not had a new school building in the past ten or 15 years.  Every other school in the town has benefited.  By comparison with any other town, Portlaoise has the most modern suite of primary and secondary schools.  Despite this, the Department is neglecting the children who are most vulnerable and most in need.  Therefore, we need a design team to be appointed.</p>  <p>  I visited the school last week.  I met the chairman of the board of management and the principal.  I met every staff member and every child.  No child could speak to me.  None was able to utter a word.  Many of them had severe difficulties.  Some of them had to sleep.  Owing to their profound difficulties, they are not even capable of sitting up in a wheelchair for the few hours they spend in the school building every day.  These are very special cases.  I cannot understand how their parents cope with the difficulties they face when they take the children home.  Of course, it is a life-changing experience for all the families.  Since the children are coming from a wide catchment area and are not just from the town, the parents can never meet for a parents' meeting.  They cannot leave their children at home with somebody else to mind them for two or three hours.  They can hardly ever get together because they are all isolated by their own work.  They have not had the parent power one would have in other schools.  I ask the Minister to appoint a design team for Kolbe school in Portlaoise.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for raising them.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  </font>Kolbe Special School, which is under the patronage of the Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary Services, caters for students with severe to profound general learning disabilities.  The school provides education for children aged between four years and 18 years.  The school's most recent enrolment data indicate that there are 39 pupils enrolled for the 2017-2018 school year.  The staffing allocation for the current school year includes a principal, seven teaching posts and 16 special needs assistants.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, a building project, which involves the construction of a replacement school building for Kolbe Special School, is included in my Department's six-year construction programme.  This school building project, which will comprise a single-storey building of 2,265 sq. m will provide a schedule of accommodation to include eight classrooms, a general purpose room, a library and resource area, a woodwork and art room, an exercise-therapy room and various ancillary spaces.</p><p>The schedule of accommodation for the new school was developed in consultation with the National Council for Special Education.  The schedule has been issued to the school authorities and has been favourably received.  To facilitate the development of the proposed new school, my Department has acquired a 1.433 ha site from the Health Service Executive at St. Fintan's, Portlaoise, County Laois, for the project.  My Department is currently finalising the development of the project brief with a view to progressing the project into architectural planning at an early stage.  As an interim arrangement, my Department gave approval to Kolbe Special School in late February 2018 for the provision of a temporary classroom to meet the growing current needs at the school.</p></speech>

I hope he is at the cusp of making some progress.  He said he hopes to progress the project to architectural planning at an early stage.  I have given a commitment to the parents and the teachers.  I will be back to the Minister every month about this issue.  I ask him to get the work started.  Even when it is started, it will have to go through the planning and tendering processes.  Therefore, it is still a long way off.  I ask the Minister to allow the school to proceed to architectural planning as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  As the Minister just mentioned, he has sanctioned approval for another prefab.  Five of the seven classrooms in the school are now prefabs.  They are for children with the most profound intellectual disabilities in the country.</p><p>The school site is extraordinary in that the HSE owns the site, the Muiriosa Foundation owns the school buildings and the Department owns the five prefabs on the site, so it is a complete mixum-gatherum.  Nevertheless, the Department must take ownership of this project.</p> <p> I visited the school with the chairman of the board of management and the principal.  Since September the school has lost its sensory room to facilitate a class.  The pupils with autism cannot use the physical education hall because of over-stimulation due to people going through it.  If one understands the nature of the profound disabilities involved one can understand why that is the case.  The pupils need absolute quiet.  We had to tiptoe in and out of many of the rooms last week lest we upset the children.  The corridor to the nurse's room is cluttered with equipment, making access to the room difficult.  In fact, there are two nurses on the staff, paid by the Muiriosa Foundation.  That indicates the type of school we are discussing.  There are 40 pupils in the school and the full complement of teachers and SNAs, but when it is necessary to have two nurses on the staff it shows what a special case it is.</p> <p> As I said, there are 5,000 children in great new schools in Portlaoise, aside from the couple that are being examined due to the difficulty that has arisen in recent days with school buildings.  The St. Francis Special School will have a site for building soon and another secondary school is getting a new site.  However, these 40 children are being left in limbo in the meantime and I urge the Minister to move on this.  I am not here to fight but to plead on behalf of those children, their parents and the staff.</p></speech>

He has been to the school and met the students and the teachers individually.  The most vulnerable people one will meet are people who cannot communicate or speak so I understand the seriousness of this issue.  The project is at architectural planning stage and is in the six year bundle for 2016 to 2021.  Obviously there are many pressures coming down the track with regard to which schools fit into the ten year capital plan, but the school is in the six year bundle and there is a commitment to it.  However, I accept that there is anxiety on the part of parents and teachers to provide the infrastructure and a proper learning environment.  Having read about the different elements of the new school it is clear they are looking forward to it.</p>  <p>  I will take the Deputy's comments on board and speak to my officials about the current position and the next stage.  It is at the design stage at present but given that the Deputy has highlighted the vulnerability of this group I will convey that to my officials.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-24a.364" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1332" speakername="Declan Breathnach" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102400039#SS00400"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>I am delighted to introduce the Sale of Illicit Goods Bill on Second Stage.  In doing so, I wish to acknowledge the input of RAS, the Retailers Against Smuggling organisation, and the report compiled by Grant Thornton on illicit trade in Ireland.  I also wish to thank my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues for allocating the time for this debate.</p>  <p>  The smuggling trade in Ireland was previously thought of as a form of cute hoorism, a fairly innocuous activity whereby people, mainly in the Border region, found ways of earning a little extra income.  Being from a Border region, I see at first hand the damage that current illicit trade activity does to the livelihood of retailers.  This is a no longer just a Border problem, but a nationwide problem with illegal cigarettes, alcohol and fuel ending up for sale on every street of every village, town and city in our country.  Unfortunately, smuggling has become a massive illegal criminal activity, causing huge losses in revenue to the State and retailers.  In 2009, for example, &euro;50 million worth of contraband cigarettes were confiscated at Greenore Port.  That 120 million illegal cigarette haul was the largest ever seized anywhere in Europe.</p>  <p>  Currently, there is no deterrent to purchasing smuggled goods as it is not a crime.  The aim of the Bill is to deter people from buying illicit alcohol, solid fuel and tobacco by introducing on-the-spot fines for purchasing goods where taxes have not been paid.  This is a necessary measure to protect small and not so small Irish retailers.  The primary benefit of the legislation is not that it will create a punishable crime, but that a clear message is being sent that one should not purchase these products because one is facilitating criminal gangs by doing so.  The level of criminality could be curtailed if purchasers were more aware of how they aid and abet the criminal underworld.</p>  <p>  Illicit trade continues to be a huge burden on the Exchequer and on small businesses.  In addition to the 20% to 30% of direct turnover retailers are losing, they also miss out on add-on purchases of other products in the store.  Some 13% of all packs of cigarettes held in Ireland are illegal, representing a loss to the Exchequer of &euro;229 million in 2017 alone and &euro;1.7 billion between 2010 and 2017.  As RAS has said, this is enough to build 8,400 social housing units.  Instead, the money goes directly into the hands of criminal gangs.  In the case of alcohol, during 2017 the Revenue Commissioners seized 95,021 litres of illicit alcohol with an estimated value of &euro;0.91 million.  Total seizures of alcohol in Ireland have increased by 100% and continue to increase yearly.  The loss to the economy from 2010 to 2014 alone was &euro;655 million, money that could be spent on our ailing health service rather than lining the pockets of criminal gangs.</p>  <p>  On a personal note, I know festival organisers who were approached and offered a lucrative amount of money to sell the empty big brand vodka bottles.  Presumably, it was intended to fill them with cheap hooch.  We should be mindful that there is also a health issue with illegal alcohol and cigarettes in that we do not have a clue what is in these products.  Similarly, the solid fuels are beyond smoky and pollute our environment.  With the recent increase in carbon tax in the budget and the smoky coal ban due to be implemented next year, the likelihood of an increase in fuel smuggling over the Border is extremely high.</p>  <p>  There have been very few convictions compared with the amounts that have been confiscated.  In March 2017 an illegal cigarette factory was discovered in my home county of Louth that was capable of producing 250,000 illicit cigarettes per hour.  Two fuel laundering plants were also discovered in Louth.  A counterfeit vodka production plant was discovered as well.  These discoveries, and the year on year growth in the number of illicit products in the country highlight the importance of the Bill.  Brexit has created a political atmosphere that will likely make cross-Border smuggling more lucrative due to a fluctuating sterling and potential tariffs.  Extra resources and protections are needed for small legitimate retailers who operate along the Border to ensure there is no increase in smuggled goods entering Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Bill ensures that a major gap in the legislation surrounding illicit trade is closed.  The next steps are to ensure that retailers and the Revenue Commissioners do not lose yet more money to criminals.</p><p>It is alarming news that only one third of the required extra 600 customs officials will be operational next year.  Smuggling takes huge volumes of business away from legitimate retailers every year.  This problem will only be exacerbated by Brexit.</p> <p> A 2018 survey conducted by Retailers Against Smuggling found that Border retailers are 63% more concerned about the likely impact Brexit will have on their communities with regard to smuggling than they were this time last year.  Year on year, excise increases directly affect retailers' profits by encouraging the purchase of smuggled and illicit goods.  At present, the price of a pack of cigarettes is &euro;12.70 when purchased in a responsible retailer&rsquo;s store.  Retailers simply cannot keep up with the &euro;5 packs that are sold by criminal gangs on the streets.  We must remember also that this illegal activity is feeding into more serious crime.  We can be sure that the criminal gangs involved in the illicit trade of tobacco, alcohol and fuel are also the same gangs involved in drug trafficking.  We must stamp out these sources of income into these gangs.</p> <p> Many people who struggle will look to buy the cheap product, be it cigarettes, fuel or alcohol.  They may call me or others the killjoys.  They may say that they need to purchase the cheaper product.  They must remember, however, a number of issues.  Studies have shown that the quality of the product is suspect and is often dangerous and detrimental to health.  They need to know they are lining the pockets of criminal gangs.  They also need to know that small businesses, which are the lifeblood of communities - ours and theirs - are closing down every day because they cannot compete with this illicit trade.</p></speech>

It is bizarre to think that so many years after the Good Friday Agreement, we are still talking about the illicit sale of alcohol, tobacco and fuel.  While there are many crossing points on the Border, which have been much talked about this past year in the context of Brexit, this is still a small island.  It really ought not to be beyond the capability of the State to somehow manage, or at least intervene, to reduce the scale of this smuggling.  Deputy Breathnach made reference to the amount of tax and excise lost to the State over a period of time, and even in any one year.  There is systematic organisation of these operations and when we consider the number of people who are involved in these mini-industries - which is far too generous a term - we see they are communities of industries that have been established to undermine the existing legitimate industries, jobs, trades and retail endeavours of those who act in good faith.</p>  <p>  Deputy Breathnach mentioned some statistics and while I do not want to blind people with figures, I note the seizures of 34 million cigarettes valued at almost &euro;20 million; some 2,000 kg of tobacco valued at almost &euro;1 million; 95,000 l of illicit alcohol with a value of almost &euro;1 million; and a staggering 125,000 l of illicit fuel.  These are just the known figures as opposed to the unknown quantities.</p>  <p>  I do not believe that anybody could disagree with the purpose of the Bill and I do not understand why the Government has set its face against it.  The purpose of the Bill is to make it an offence for a person to buy illicit goods, including alcohol, tobacco or solid fuel.  As Deputy Breathnach has said, one of the key aspects of the Bill is to develop and raise an awareness of the damage people do by purchasing these goods.  They undermine existing retailers and by purchasing these illicit goods, they encourage the illegal trade in all of the three products that have been outlined.</p>  <p>  I am happy to support the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-24a.367" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1220" speakername="Mary Butler" time="16:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102400040#TT00300"><p>Fianna F&aacute;il, through Deputy Breathnach, is bringing forward this legislation to tackle the sale of illicit goods such as tobacco, alcohol and solid fuel.  The Bill seeks to make it an offence to purchase such illicit goods, particularly from an unregistered or unlicensed retailer.</p>  <p>  Illicit trade is continuing to develop in Ireland and is becoming a real threat to the Irish economy.  According to some estimates the black economy costs the overall economy over &euro;2.3 billion a year and costs the Exchequer more than &euro;800 million a year.  We do not know the true figure as by its very nature this activity remains unseen so the costs could be far higher.</p>  <p>  Tobacco sales are a large part of the business of many small shops.  Government excise duties have increased the cost of a 20-pack of cigarettes to an all-time high.  This in turn has turned customers towards illegal traders who are selling illegal, and sometimes unsafe, products at a much lower price.</p>  <p>  As an incentive for the supply and demand of illicit products price remains the main driver of illicit trade.  There is also another issue, however, which is health.  Illicit cigarettes are often illegally manufactured and imported from foreign countries such as China or Paraguay, with a lack of quality control or regulation.  Some illicit cigarettes have been found to contain dangerous chemicals, dust, excessively high tar levels and even asbestos.  While the non-financial impacts include health, smuggling also undermines the legal and regulatory system, grows organised crime and causes reputational damage to brands.  There is growing anecdotal evidence to suggest that the solid fuel trade on this side of the Border has been affected by a combination of cheaper prices for similar products in the North and by fuel smuggling.</p>  <p>  Small and medium-sized businesses simply cannot compete with the low prices being offered for these illegal and frequently fraudulent products.  Small businesses are the lifeblood of local communities in towns and villages and we need to do more to help protect them from the impact of smuggling.</p>  <p>  Online sales are already a huge competing factor for the retailer located on the high street who is dealing with all the costs of rent, rates, VAT, insurance and staff costs.  I am the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation, which recently conducted a detailed study into the cost of doing business in Ireland.  There were very many common denominators going through for the retailer as against the online retailer.  The report referred also to how smuggling is having a huge effect.  The ongoing sale of illicit goods may well be the tipping point for many legitimate businesses.</p></speech>

Like Deputy Breathnach, I represent a Border region, the two counties of Cavan and Monaghan, which have a very long land Border with the neighbouring jurisdiction.  We know that due to historical reasons, the area north of the Border is lightly policed, to put it mildly.  Criminality has, unfortunately, flourished north of the Border in some areas in particular over the years.  Our own areas south of the Border have not been short of criminality either.</p>  <p>  In the last D&aacute;il I brought forward legislation advocating strongly for the establishment of a cross-Border crime agency and for an intensification of co-operation between Government departments North and South and between the statutory agencies.  The Government at that time did not accept my proposals but I was glad that some elements of my party's proposals were incorporated into some legislation around the Stormont House Agreement.  There have been some welcome moves in that direction with more intensified co-operation between the relevant Departments and statutory agencies North and South.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy should be aware that over the years, small and medium enterprises, as well as larger-scale operators, survived through very difficult times.  We saw the trade going to the North.  We still see the illicit products coming in and tempting to the consumer.  I could walk into some housing estates and people will tell me that Joe or Josephine Soap were around selling their illicit tobacco products again, which, as Deputy Butler observed, come from God knows where.  These goods, however, come through Northern Ireland in particular, as well as from Britain.</p>  <p>  We need intensified co-operation between the Revenue Commissioners and their counterparts north of the Border and between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI.  We also need increased co-operation between the Environmental Protection Agency and its counterpart in Northern Ireland because we should always remember that too often in this illicit trade, sludge is dumped in drains and on the banks of rivers.</p><p>That is a real threat to the provenance and the good name of our agrifood industry.  That Border area in particular is heavily dependent on the agrifood industry.  It has a great reputation, which is well deserved and hard earned, for producing top-class food that is exported throughout the world.  If there is any question mark regarding the quality or provenance of the raw material, the primary product that goes into the manufacture and processing of food, we are in real danger and real trouble with regard to continuing to retain the more than 161 markets we have throughout the world.  I again compliment my colleague, Deputy Breathnach, on bringing forward this legislation.  We must ensure that every effort is made to protect the small and medium enterprises in the particular sectors referenced in this legislation.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Breathnach for bringing it forward.  He has demonstrated his perseverance in bringing this Bill here tonight because, since he first came into the House, he has spoken consistently about the illicit trade taking place between North and South, as have his other Border colleagues, who have highlighted it continuously.  It is fitting that this Bill should be before us.  In recent months, I also have met Lorraine Higgins, the chief executive officer of Retail Excellence.  She has spoken repeatedly on this issue and on what her retailers are experiencing on the ground.</p>  <p>  Tonight, however, I intend to look at this from a totally different angle.  I will not be looking at it just in respect of the illicit goods but in respect of those who participate in the trade.  In respect of many of these issues, it can be seen that children are participating.  In many cases, they are the mules for the sale of the illicit drugs, that is, the cigarettes and the alcohol.  Earlier this year, my colleagues and I brought forward a "Fagin's law" to try to protect the children at the centre of the issue.  Only recently, I visited Ballymun with Councillor Paul McAuliffe, who spoke about young people who are still at the centre of the sale of these illicit drugs, be they alcohol or tobacco.  </p>  <p>  What is really important about the legislation being brought forward tonight - it is regrettable that the Minister of State does not see it through these eyes - is that from a child protection point of view, we are putting the onus on the adult who purchases the goods.  There is a fine and a sentence.  There is reference to the first, second and third offence.  What we are trying to do is to put the onus back on the adult.  The adult should have the responsibility to ask where is the regulation or the governance regarding the goods he or she is buying.  That is what we are trying to do and is what this legislation is about.  It is far too easy for adults to use children as pawns in the centre.  This legislation tries to protect children, give them back their childhoods and, sometimes, protect their lives.  Children are being used right across this country in the sale of illicit drugs and that is wrong.  It is incumbent on all of us here to be very serious about the child protection rules.  This is one opportunity to protect children.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-24a.371" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="16:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102400041#UU00300"><p>I welcome that this Bill has been brought to the House.  It is only appropriate that I should acknowledge the sentiments behind it because I support the objectives as set out by the proposers, as does the Government.  However, while agreeing with the objective of the Bill, which is to address the illicit trade in excisable goods, I cannot support the means being proposed to meet this objective.  It is accepted by all interested parties that smuggling, and shadow economy activities in general, pose a threat to legitimate and compliant businesses and to consumers, as well as depriving the Government of tax revenues.  Tackling these illegal activities is, therefore, a key priority and Revenue has implemented wide-ranging programmes of action to combat them.</p><p>This Bill seeks to introduce legislation which would make it an offence to purchase or attempt to purchase alcohol, tobacco products or solid fuel on which excise duties or VAT had not been paid, where the purchaser knew, ought to have known, or was reckless as to whether these taxes and duties had been paid.  The Bill also seeks to make it an offence to purchase alcohol, tobacco products or solid fuel from a supplier that is not included in the list of valid liquor licences, the national tobacco retailers register or the list of solid fuel suppliers, respectively.</p><p>Up to this point, the focus of the measures taken to deal with the trade in illicit goods and fuel fraud has been firmly on tackling the supply chain to limit illicit goods getting on the market.  This approach, which has been implemented through Finance Acts and other supporting measures in recent years, has been working.  For example, the measures which have been introduced to combat fuel fraud in various Finance Acts and Revenue initiatives have had a major impact on the illicit trade.  In addition, there has been continued progress in containing the extent of the illicit tobacco trade, notwithstanding the high rate of tobacco excise and the incentives such a policy creates for the illicit trade.  The approach outlined in this Bill, which aims to address the illicit trade by tackling purchasers of illicit goods rather than the suppliers, raises a number of serious issues.</p><p>In order for the offence to be detected, the Bill gives significant powers to authorised persons - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Revenue Commissioners - to require any person who they know or reasonably suspect of purchasing illicit goods to, among other things, produce evidence of identity and allow for the inspection of the suspect goods, as well as any vehicle of which he or she may be in control.  The Bill also provides that the authorised person can arrest without warrant any person who refuses to do so.  The Bill also proposes the introduction of a fixed penalty system to be imposed on persons where there are reasonable grounds to believe the person has purchased illicit goods.  The Bill also allows for substantive amendments to be made to its content by means of regulations.</p><p>I will now deal with the main aspects of the Bill.  First of all, I am advised that in practice it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to establish the evidence that would support conviction of a person for knowingly buying illicit goods.  Even leaving aside the issue of trying to prove that the purchaser had the intention of purchasing illicit goods, it would be hard to support a conviction on the basis that it can be extremely difficult to distinguish genuine goods from illicit goods.  The Bill assumes that consumers can readily establish whether certain goods are illicit or not.  It places an onus on the purchaser to actively check current registers for tobacco, alcohol and solid fuel traders in advance of making a purchase.  However, as an example, the list of current valid liquor licences runs to almost 3,000 pages and is only available on the Revenue website.  Similar issues would arise with the registers of tobacco retailers and for solid fuel products.  In the case of the latter, a person only needs to be on the EPA register for solid fuels if bituminous coal amounts to more than 50% of turnover and there is no requirement to register for peat sales.  I also note that not all EU member states require a tax stamp for tobacco products.  In such circumstances, putting a responsibility on consumers to prove that goods are not illicit is likely to raise serious issues of legality in terms of how the provision could be enforced in practice and prosecuted via the courts.  By way of previous example, section 102(1)(<i>c</i>) of the Finance Act 1999 previously contained an offence of purchasing fuel from a person who did not hold a mineral oil trader&rsquo;s licence.  This provision was repealed in 2013 as it was not possible to prove any unlawful intent on the part of the person who purchases fuel at an unlicensed filling station.</p><p>The Bill provides for more onerous powers of arrest and search against purchasers of illicit products.  Currently Revenue may only search receptacles for tobacco products and does not have the power of search of person for tobacco products.  The introduction of the power of search of person would commit Revenue to a policy of increased physical confrontation with persons for which its officers are not equipped or trained.  There always will be a likelihood of physical resistance and assault, and this is best left to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>Apart from the fact that such powers inevitably will be challenged in the courts on the basis of proportionality to the alleged offences involved, I am advised Revenue does not have the capacity to arrest, hold or search persons under this proposal.  Even if this power of arrest was assigned to Revenue, it would imply significant costs to put the facilities and infrastructure in place to protect the rights of the arrested persons while they were under arrest.  </p> <p> The Bill proposes to introduce a fixed penalty notice system for purchasers of illicit goods.  Apart from the significant IT and staffing resources that would need to be reallocated from other enforcement priorities to oversee such a regime, the practicality and effectiveness of issuing fixed penalty notices to persons who may buy illicit goods is questionable.  It is most unlikely that many offenders will voluntarily pay an amount that is well in excess of that which, even in the event of a successful prosecution, a court is likely to impose.  In addition, many persons may give false names on being challenged and will not have identity documents.  Both of these issues would result in increased arrests and referrals to the courts, which may result in a significant resource issue for all parties.  These resources include Revenue staff and legal costs, as well as the accused&rsquo;s costs, including, for example, any State provided legal aid to which he or she may be entitled.  </p> <p> Revenue acts against all aspects of the illegal tobacco trade, in order that the illicit products involved can be seized and those responsible for smuggling or supplying them can be prosecuted.  A combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence and the risk-based screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages is used to intercept illicit products.  Action after importation includes checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.  This action has achieved considerable success, with the seizure in 2017 of 34 million cigarettes and 1,768 kg of tobacco.  In March this year a joint operation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na led to the closing down of a major illicit cigarette factory in Jenkinstown, County Louth.  Over 20 million cigarettes and 70 tonnes of tobacco were seized at this facility, which could produce 250,000 illicit cigarettes an hour.  </p> <p> Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na work together on an ongoing basis in acting against fuel and tobacco crime and both bodies co-operate closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland within the framework of the North-South joint agency task force.  I am advised this co-operation plays a key role in targeting the organised crime groups responsible for much of this criminality, which operate across jurisdictions.  On the alcohol side, duties provide a financial incentive for alcohol fraud but there is little evidence of large-scale illegal activity at present.  Illicit trade in alcohol can occur through the illegal diversion of untaxed alcohol onto the market and also through the illegal production of counterfeit alcohol.  Revenue is very alert to these risks.  Revenue&rsquo;s action is based on intelligence on criminal activity, risk-based examination of commercial traffic and of stock in retail premises.</p> <p> As a result of the price differential with Northern Ireland, the collection of solid fuel carbon tax is heavily reliant on the regulatory regime covering the marketing, sale, distribution and burning of solid fuels in the State.  This regulatory regime is operated by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and is enforced by local authorities.  This regime, which imposes higher environmental standards on coal in the State than applies in Northern Ireland, enables local authorities to undertake enforcement action to prevent the sale or distribution of coal that does not meet our standards.  I am advised that Revenue has engaged with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment to discuss the effectiveness of the regulatory regime for solid fuel and to explore how Revenue could support the Department to improve matters in light of continuing concerns that fuel sourced from Northern Ireland is getting onto the market here.  I understand that contacts are ongoing with a view to undertaking a number of joint operations and to explore the scope for follow-up action by Revenue on persons found to be in breach of these regulations.  However, any such operations will be based on a clear understanding of the statutory responsibilities of the agencies involved.  While the Bill does not specifically address the issue of fuel laundering, the steps taken by Revenue to combat the illegal fuel trade include the introduction of stringent new supply chain controls and reporting requirements, together with a rigorous programme of enforcement action, demonstrate how tackling the supply chain can produce the desired results.  I understand the industry view is that the measures implemented to date have been successful in significantly curtailing fuel fraud in Ireland.  </p> <p> Ultimately, the Bill broadens substantially the scope of compliance activity by tackling purchasers of illicit goods rather than the suppliers as heretofore.  In practice, it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to establish the evidence that would support conviction of a person for knowingly buying illicit goods.  The proposals contained in the Bill are not just unworkable but would undermine the good work that is ongoing in this area by diverting resources from where they are most required.  Accordingly, I cannot support the Bill.  </p></speech>

We will not oppose the passage of the Bill to Committee Stage.  There are flaws in it, which the Minister of State has identified.  We hope to work constructively to improve it on Committee Stage.  We will support it because in principle we believe that where somebody is knowingly purchasing illicit goods, it is wrong and there should be a sanction.  However, I share some of the Minister of State's views that it may be difficult to implement.  It is something that can perhaps be explored further on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  My understanding of the Bill is that if passed it would make it an offence to purchase illicit alcohol, illicit tobacco and illicit solid fuel as well as making it an offence to purchase such goods from an unregistered or unlicensed retailer.  I question the ability of the Garda to implement such legislation but the theory is good.  We can explore that further.  It is proposed by the Bill that we provide for the imposition of a penalty in respect of such offences and provide for an on-the-spot fine in respect of such offences.  It is a welcome proposal though it may have resource implications.  We need to be conscious of the relationship between the on-the-spot fine and any potential court fine.</p>  <p>  With regard to the provisions of the Bill, section 4 deals with illicit alcohol.  Section 4(1) makes it an offence for a person to buy or attempt to buy alcohol in circumstances where he or she had known or should have known that taxes and excise duty had not been paid on that alcohol.  </p>  <p>  Section 5 deals with illicit tobacco.  Section 5(1) makes it an offence for a person to buy or attempt to buy tobacco in circumstances where he or she had known or should have known that taxes and excise duties had not been paid.  </p>  <p>  Section 6 deals with illicit solid fuel.  Section 6(1) makes it an offence for a person to buy or attempt to buy solid fuel in circumstances where he or she had known or should have known the relevant taxes had not been paid.  Section 6(2) defines the term "relevant taxes and duties" which is used in section 6.  </p>  <p>  Section 8 deals with the purchase of alcohol, tobacco and solid fuel from an unregistered or unlicensed retailer.  Section 8(1) makes it an offence for a person to buy an alcohol product from a person whose name is not included in the list of current valid liquor licences, which is maintained by the Revenue Commissioners.  </p>  <p>  Section 10 provides for immunity from suit of an authorised person for an act which is done in good faith.</p>  <p>  Section 7 deals with the burden of proof in a prosecution.  I have some reservations about it.  In respect of a prosecution under sections 4, 5 and 6, it provides for the application of a rebuttable presumption to the effect that the required taxes and duties have not been paid.  The onus will be on the suspected offender to demonstrate the relevant taxes and duties have been paid.  This seems to an extent out of step with normal practice.  I am also conscious of the potential interplay between section 7 and sections 4, 5 and 6.  If it is the case that somebody can be prosecuted for purchasing illicit goods or being reckless to that effect but it has not been proven that excise and taxes have not been paid on it because the onus of proof is on the suspected offender, is it possible somebody could be convicted without it having been proven that there were no taxes on it?</p><p>It is a potential difficulty which needs to be addressed.</p> <p> There is a provision for test purchasing but it is not immediately clear to me from reading the proposal whether this will be undertaken by the garda&iacute; or members of the public employed by or on behalf of the garda&iacute;.  It is something of which we need to be cautious.  Will the Fianna F&aacute;il representatives elaborate on that in their closing remarks, as clarity is needed?  Test purchasing is used quite regularly with alcohol through garda programmes to tackle underage drinking but it is not immediately clear to me that a garda programme is intended here, although if it is that is fair enough.</p> <p> Tobacco is one of the most extensively smuggled substances in the world, with one in ten cigarettes sold in the EU coming from the illicit trade, which means that Governments are robbed of millions of euro in potential revenue and that tobacco contraband is a lucrative criminal business.  The tobacco lobby is strong in the EU and the top companies spend millions every year on lobbying in Brussels.  They employ lobbyists to engage with MEPs on issues they believe to be relevant to their business.  The tobacco industry claims the problem with the illicit trade of tobacco is counterfeit cigarettes, but even its own data show that most of the illicit trade products are manufactured by the tobacco companies themselves.  There is a need, therefore, for a separation of the problem and the solution.  There should be no influence from the tobacco industry in putting in place an effective tracking and tracing system.  Before the budget, fuel suppliers warned that the smuggling of coal would increase significantly if carbon taxes were applied.  Coal is already brought into this jurisdiction from the North, often originating in Scotland.  Some of this coal has a high sulphur content of up to 7% and would not be allowed to be sold here, according to the industry.  The issue of the sale of illicit alcohol has a long history, probably dating far beyond partition, but it is still a significant issue which needs to be addressed.</p> <p> We support the proposal for on-the-spot fines but the fines should be ring-fenced for the health system to deal with the fallout from smoking and drinking.  </p> <p> In general, there is merit to the proposal but some of the technicalities and details need to be ironed out on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

While we will not oppose the Bill's passage on Second Stage, there are legitimate concerns about the criminalisation of the end user, just as there have been regarding those found in possession of illegal drugs for personal use.  The real criminals here are those who manufacture, distribute and supply these illicit goods.  I urge Government to join Opposition Members in seriously addressing the black economy and those who profit from it by allowing this Bill to be passed to Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  I will now speak specifically about the illicit tobacco trade.  We all know the serious threat that the use of tobacco products presents for the health of users and those exposed to this habit.  We also know it is a fact that some 5,200 deaths per year in this State directly relate to cigarette smoking.  Tobacco smoking-related health issues cost the public health budget an estimated &euro;1 billion plus annually.  A series of measures designed to encourage current users to quit the habit, discourage tobacco smoking and discourage young people from taking up smoking have a worthwhile impact, but they are undermined by the expanding market in contraband cigarettes.  Smuggling gangs trade in products that cause serious health concerns and certain early death for thousands annually.  They also undermine legislators' efforts to curtail cigarette smoking by offering these killer products at a significantly lower price than the legally marketed products sold through recognised retail outlets.  Smuggling gangs cost the Exchequer an estimated &euro;210 million annually, contributing negatively to our collective capacity to see the return and development of our public services including our acute hospital and community-based healthcare services.  </p>  <p>  I acknowledge the efforts to date of the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and others seeking to confront and eliminate this illicit trade.  In our further consideration of this Bill, therefore, I urge Government and all parties to give the lead in a European Union-sponsored clampdown on this nefarious trade.  It will not be done on the island of Ireland alone.  I urge Government to note that this clampdown must include an investigation of the potential involvement of legitimate cigarette manufacturers in facilitating this illegal smuggling business.  If links are established, the most serious penalties must be applied and enforced in each affected jurisdiction.  It must also introduce further legislation to bring in heavy fines on conviction arising from involvement in cigarette smuggling into this State, including involvement in any role with these criminal gangs; promote and secure co-operation between the relevant customs and excise and police services across the suspected supply lines; target where possible those who are the primary beneficiaries; and act with real purpose and immediacy on what I believe is the clear wish of all legislators in this House, namely, to stamp out the activities of these traders in death and contribute positively to our ongoing and shared efforts to make Ireland a tobacco-free society.</p>  <p>  This Bill deserves further and careful consideration.  I am not yet convinced that its primary proposal to target the purchaser of these illicit products is the course to take, but I have an open mind and I am willing to be convinced of the legitimacy of this course of action.  I fully support its targeted intent of seriously curtailing and, better still, eliminating these illegal businesses and, in the case of illicit tobacco, significantly reducing the overall adverse impact that tobacco products have on the health of the nation.  I encourage the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, and Government to support the passage of this Bill to Committee Stage, where further careful consideration might help ensure we have a Bill that we can all support and that will deliver on the clear intent of its author and those of us who support the core proposition and thoughts behind it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-24a.376" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="17:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102400043#WW00300"><p>I thank Deputy Breathnach for bringing this proposal for legislation before the House.  As Deputies from Border areas know, there is a further expansion and explosion of illicit trade at the moment.  We are approaching Christmas, which is the most important period for many retail businesses in Ireland for selling goods and making a living, yet due to the illicit trade, especially along the Border, many people's livelihoods effectively will be wiped out, destroyed or reduced to a feebleness that means their long-term viability is at stake.</p><p> The Bill proposes to cause a shock to consumers because should they be involved in the purchase of illicit goods, they might be subject to a penalty.  Large numbers of young people have no awareness that buying items, particularly alcohol and cigarettes, from the equivalent of the back of a van, or walking down to Moore Street or other market areas throughout the State and buying items the provenance of which they are unsure but which are much cheaper have serious social and economic consequences.  There are also serious health consequences for the users of these counterfeit and illicit products.  It is a problem in a consumer-driven society.  I can understand that many Deputies would balk at introducing a consumer-oriented penalty, but we must recognise that the proposal results from both frustration and fear.  We are in the middle of a discussion about technology being the way to a frictionless, seamless border that will properly provide for the passage of goods and services back and forth over the Border in Ireland.  Notwithstanding that, there is a great risk of illicit activity increasing in the event of a difficult Brexit.  </p> <p> Deputy Breathnach calculated that there was a significant loss of revenue to the Exchequer which brings me to a political point.  Ours is a State with strong welfare, education and health systems, which we would all like to be better resourced.  The State relies on taxation to provide those resources.  If a significant cohort of people, be they criminal gangs or individuals, are able to avoid paying legitimate taxes on products the services that we want to provide in all areas of Ireland, urban and rural, will be beyond our means.  There are strong fiscal reasons to give this legislation serious consideration.  </p> <p> Furthermore, in the case that any Minister for Finance experiences an additional inflow of revenue, some of that must be spent on beefing up the capacity of customs and Revenue resources to pursue these types of offences.  In Revenue, the old style inspector of taxes has gone and there are many more general staff, who, to be fair, are doing their best to train-up.  However, in places such as Dundalk and Letterkenny, we need more specialist staff, whether they be formally allocated to customs or Revenue staff, to crack down on these Border gangs.  The same is true of policing services.  We need to recognise that what is happening along the Border is undermining our efforts to achieve a fair and balanced taxation system which allows the kind of services that we all want to be available.</p> <p> On tobacco, it is galling that while we are running a successful tobacco harm-reduction campaign and, hopefully, persuading more people to give up cigarettes, there is a back door facility where the stuff can be bought as cheaply as possible.  We do not recognise how that contributes to encouraging young people, in particular, to continue to smoke, and when they can buy alcohol so cheaply, to drink to excess in a way that can so often shatter their personal lives, not to mention their long-term health and the peace and contentment of their families.</p> <p> It is essential that we are very clear-eyed that, no matter what type of Brexit emerges, we must address smuggling and contraband.  I am told that many smugglers do not just travel along the Border but they bring their contraband deep into the Republic, 100 miles or more away from their traditional area.  One must consider that all this returns to burden small-scale retailers, pubs and other outlets, particularly in rural Ireland, who simply cannot compete in any serious way with contraband markets that offer so much at cheaper prices, robbing the Exchequer of its correct revenue.    </p> <p> This discussion is timely.  We should take consequences into account, on the one hand, of increased smoking and alcohol consumption because of this trade and, on the other, of the State's taxation capacity.  As such, I welcome the Bill.  It will be a matter for Government primarily but it would be interesting to see it support the Bill and use the consequent revenue to put in place a better system and better services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-24a.378" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102400044#XX00200"><p>I welcome the Bill.  Notwithstanding the great work that Revenue and customs staff do, smuggling is a major issue.  It needs more State focus and intervention to combat the industry.  We know it leads to a loss of Exchequer funding, damages legally operating businesses and costs jobs in a variety of sectors.</p>  <p>  I know from parts of Dublin Central that the sale of illegal cigarettes is lucrative for smugglers.  While we acknowledge the dangers of smoking, the cost to health and to the health service, what is almost an annual 50 cent increase on a standard packet of cigarettes is contributing to an increase in smuggling and illegal selling.  Tobacco is a legal and controlled product that premises are licensed to sell in accordance with the law.  This year-on-year increase is punitive and does not help the retailers.  However, it benefits smugglers and illegal sellers.  There is a need for joined-up thinking between the Department of Health, the Revenue Commissioners and customs staff to examine the best way forward to eradicate smoking without lining the pockets of smugglers at the expense of retailers who pay their taxes.  </p>  <p>  The increase in illicit trade in solid fuel is also an issue.  Grant Thorton has estimated that 30% of the market is now illicit.  </p><p>People do not know what they are buying.  There are risks to health and the environment; people who buy illegal cigarettes do not know what is in those cigarettes.  They can be even more damaging than those sold legally; at least one knows what one is getting in the packet.  </p> <p> Revenue and customs have been to the forefront in the fight against illicit sales, but we know that those services will be stretched further when it comes to Brexit.  The onus must shift from search and seize to consumer responsibility and consumer consciousness of the products they are buying.  We have to expose the dangers they face when they buy illicit fuel, alcohol and cigarettes.  </p> <p> Another issue not mentioned in the Bill is the trade in smuggled animals, in particular puppies.  It is no coincidence that some puppy farms are in Border counties, because those who operate them have the opportunity to smuggle puppies into the UK.  These puppies live in horrendous conditions.  We have had legislation, guidelines and review of guidelines, but without proper enforcement on this issue, and the other issues I have mentioned, that will continue.  We have to get the point across that these products are not bargains, but that they are costly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-24a.380" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1361" speakername="Tommy Broughan" time="17:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102400045#YY00200"><p>I am delighted to contribute to the debate.  The illicit trade in cigarettes alcohol and solid fuel is reported to have cost the Exchequer up to &euro;2.5 billion between 2010 and 2015.  Of course, exact figures are difficult to come by but this is probably a conservative estimate.  The problem became so acute that a group known as Retailers Against Smugglers, RAS, was established and is said to represent more than 3,000 small and medium-sized retailers throughout the country.  Earlier this year an illegal cigarette factory was unearthed in Jenkinstown, County Louth, and RAS says that the fact that this factory existed at all demonstrated the demand for illicit tobacco products.</p><p>Deputy Breathnach introduced the Bill in April 2017 and I commend him and his Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues, Deputies Lahart and Troy, for bringing it forward.  Like other Deputies, I urge the Government to ensure the Bill progresses to Committee Stage.  It provides for measures to tackle the illegal trade in alcohol, tobacco and solid fuel such as coal, briquettes and sod peat.  Upon the passing of this Bill, it would be an offence to purchase these goods illegally and also to purchase them from unregistered or unlicensed retailers.  It provides for the imposition of a &euro;100 on-the-spot fine for purchasing tobacco, alcohol or solid fuel illegally from an unregistered or unlicensed seller.  Of the estimated &euro;2.4 billion in lost revenue, it is reported that smuggling of solid fuels accounts for approximately &euro;435 million and smuggling of tobacco accounts for around &euro;450 million.  </p><p>The illegal cigarette factory in Louth was closed in March, and the photographs of the plant show the sheer scale of the operation.  The capacity of the factory was reported to have been approximately 250,000 cigarettes per hour.  Combatting this element of the so-called shadow economy is a high priority for the Revenue Commissioners, with a confidential illegal cigarettes hotline for reporting instances of illicit tobacco trade.  According to the Revenue website, it works alongside An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, and Europol to combat this illegal trade, which costs the Exchequer so much in lost excise.  Revenue also states that it works closely with agencies in the North to combat cross-Border illicit trade.  This will become even more pertinent early next year, depending on how the Brexit negotiations pan out and the impact begins to be felt.  When the Minister of State replies, perhaps we could get some information on the approach to dealing with Brexit in this regard.  During this summer, 8 million cigarettes were seized at Dublin Port.  Retail Ireland said that nine out of ten retailers on both sides of the Border believed that smuggling was damaging their profits and their ability to make a living.  </p><p>It is an international problem.  Reports say that approximately 85% of smuggled cigarettes in London were found to be counterfeit and there are seizures of at least 1 million counterfeit cigarettes daily in the UK.  The illicit trade in tobacco in South Africa is reported to have doubled in the past number of years, and countries such as Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia are also reporting significant illicit trade in tobacco.  </p><p>The Ceann Comhairle is probably interested in the paper that was written four or five years ago by Klaus von Lampe, Marin K. Kurti, Anqi Shen, and Georgios A. Antonopoulos on the changing role of China in the global illegal cigarette trade.  I had raised several times in this House disturbing reports about the role of American tobacco companies in producing illegal cigarettes.  However, this role seems to have been taken over by Chinese companies.  The paper states:</p><blockquote>While previously genuine cigarettes dominated the black market, in the past decade, counterfeit cigarettes have gained a significant market share, with the People&rsquo;s Republic of China commonly assumed to be the main source [country].  Based on statistics on the seizure of counterfeit cigarettes ... it has been estimated that between 93 [billion] and 186 billion counterfeit cigarettes [were being] produced in mainland China annually ... According to another estimate, the number of fake cigarettes produced in China per year is even higher, reaching 400 billion [sticks]. </blockquote><p>China&rsquo;s importance as a producer of what we call &quot;bogey&quot; cigarettes is underscored by seizure data, with the country found to be the ultimate source.  I am not sure what they are called in the Ceann Comhairle's local language.  Do we know the sources of counterfeit and illegal cigarettes?  Why should friendly countries, such as the United States, with which we have close ties, and China, with which we have ever-increasing economic and social ties, send these products here? </p><p>I welcome the Bill.  I note that section 7(2) places the burden of proof on the purchaser and states: &ldquo;It shall be presumed until the contrary is shown that the relevant taxes and duties ... have not been duly paid.&rdquo;  That is a good provision.  Section 8(1) makes it an offence to purchase alcohol products from a retailer or person who is not on Revenue&rsquo;s list of current valid liquor licence holders.  Section 9 gives powers to the authorised person, including the ability to stop someone he or she reasonably suspects of having purchased illicit goods.  Section 11, for which I commend the Deputies, is important as it provides for test purchasing.  I have regularly tabled questions to the Department of Justice and Equality about this.  We must have test purchasing to ensure we can ascertain the number and location of places selling illicit and counterfeit goods.  </p><p>I welcome the Bill.  It is long overdue, and should make major improvements in the campaign to reduce the illicit trade in tobacco, alcohol and solid fuels, returning trade to smaller retailers, especially those in Border counties as Brexit edges ever closer.</p></speech>

The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the introduction of a series of new measures directed at attacking the trade in illegal alcohol and tobacco.  I have some reservations about how it will tackle the trade in solid fuels.  We have a huge issue with fuel laundering.  For some years I have fully endorsed calls from the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, BIPA, of which I am a member, aimed at establishing a dedicated task force to target illicit cross-Border fraud between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  It is clear from the information we have that those engaged in cross-Border smuggling of illicit goods such as alcohol and tobacco are essentially acting as economic parasites on our society.  I attended a meeting of BIPA last weekend in London.  There are huge fears there.  I was not able contribute on the post-European Council meetings debate earlier, but there should be no doubt that the British intend on leaving.  They will not accept a second referendum like Ireland did.  We were given medicine; we did not like the medicine in the first instance so we were given another dose.  The British have honour and have respect for democracy, and are leaving Europe, backstop or no backstop.  The Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, dreamt up a rock-solid, cast-iron guaranteed backstop.  Backstop or no backstop, the British are not backing out.  They are going forward, not backwards.</p>  <p>  Reports indicate that 11% of cigarette consumption in Ireland in one year alone was illicit, and the loss to the Exchequer from tobacco fraud was between &euro;240 million and &euro;575 million.</p><p>These are shocking and staggering figures of revenue loss, particularly to a fragile and depressed economy without mentioning the damage some of these products are doing to people's health.  It also means vital services are being starved of funding because the tax gain is going to those who operate outside the law.  Deputy Breathnach knows more about this living near the Border.  I have some experience of it but, as they say, if you want to know me, come and live with me.  In light of this, I hope the Minister will fully support an all-Ireland approach to tackling this insidious social evil.</p> <p> Several weeks ago, the Government was involved in tomfoolery, putting stickers on bottles of beer and other alcohol when it will not deal with real problems.  That is the way the Government has gone.  It is all shenanigans, antics and spin when it will not properly tackle real problems.  The sale of illicit goods has been going on under our noses for decades.  If we have anything like a hard border, it will be thriving again.</p> <p> The cross-Border fuel fraud enforcement group and the cross-Border tobacco fraud enforcement group must receive all the resources necessary to target these organised crime gangs involved in illicit cross-Border trade.  They have many friends in here too, compatriots of days gone by.  If necessary, these agencies should comprise seconded staff from all relevant agencies, including the environmental and criminal assets recovery agencies, as well as being supported by a central dedicated secretariat.  These gangs are almost too powerful to be brought down.  Some of them have links, some of which relate to the peace process, meaning these people cannot be reined in because they seem to be above the law.  The sooner we tackle them the better.  We must support the customs officials and enable those trying to tackle these gangs.  Every letter I get as a self-employed businessman has at the bottom of it a warning about a custodial sentence if I do not pay my dues.  These people, however, give two fingers to the legislation.  Why should they not when the Government is happy to allow them get away with it?  All agencies involved should be brought together.  It is steps like these, allied to the ones contained in Deputy Breathnach&rsquo;s Bill, that will finally allow us to make headway on this shadowy matter.</p> <p> I am concerned about the poor man selling his bags of sticks from the back of a Transit van.  He should be supported and left alone.  I am reminded of Seamus Moore&rsquo;s song, &ldquo;The Transit Van&rdquo;, about being chased by police cars, turning the van upside down with the wheels spinning.  They should be left alone.  Instead, the authorities should deal with the high-powered criminals involved in this racket.</p></speech>

I bow to his superior knowledge of some of the shadowy acts involved as he lives near the Border.</p>  <p>  However, I am not sure about going after the person who might cut a bit of timber, bag it and sell it out of the back of a van.  Usually when we hear about something from the back of a van, it means there is something wrong with it.  There is absolutely nothing wrong, however, with people getting a bit of fuel like that and delivering it to elderly people&rsquo;s homes or a customer base which they have set up.  It is up to them to keep their own tax affairs in order.  However, to brand that activity as illegal is wrong.  My late father, Jackie Healy-Rae, would have stood up here to say that he was here for the man selling the bag of turf or the load of timber.  I am here tonight to do the exact same thing because those people in my book are respectable, providing a required service in estates or in the countryside and helping older or vulnerable people.</p>  <p>  As for fuel laundering, we see these pop-up service stations which do not comply with any regulations.  The fuel they are selling is suspect as it can be washed.  These activities are backed by organised crime.  It is big business and they do not care if they are only operating for a couple of weeks or months because they can make big money in a short time.  It is the same as robbing a bank.  They are robbing the respectable of people who paid their taxes and are fully tax compliant.  They are hurting small businesses.  I must declare I am one of those.  I have been a fuel retailer for nearly 30 years.  I have carbon licences and every other licence I am supposed to have.  The last time I counted, I had something like 26 licences to my name, which is a lot.  If one is to be compliant, that is what one has to do.  I have to pay for every one of them.  I will continue to do so as long as I am able to draw breath.</p>  <p>  I also sell alcohol and cigarettes.  I do not want to see people getting away with that on the black market because they are not paying their taxes.  We have to be concerned about the quality of the product.  I am sure that within five minutes from Leinster House, one could buy illegal cigarettes.  What is in them?  Is there rat or other poisons in them?</p>  <p>  Last week, we had the ridiculous situation where we were putting labels on beer and whiskey products that are fully above aboard and up to all standards, stating they can cause cancer.  Nobody else in Europe is doing this but we are.  Of course, we have to be the first do this and give our products a bad reputation.  That is why I was totally opposed to it.</p>  <p>  The reason I have continually opposed any increase to the cost of cigarettes in budgets is because I believe it only drives people further to purchasing illegal cigarettes.</p>  <p>  For God&rsquo;s sake, the Government cannot go after the man or woman who might be supplementing his or her income a little by selling timber or turf.  We cannot throw common sense out the window.</p></speech>

With the House&rsquo;s support, this Bill will tackle the trade of illegal goods, including the illegal sale of alcohol, tobacco and solid fuel.  The Bill intends to make it an offence to buy these goods on the black market from unlicensed retailers among other measures.  An on-the-spot fine will be incurred by some purchasers.</p>  <p>  Smuggling is a major problem for our economy.  I hope the Bill will strengthen our laws with the introduction of measures designed to reduce the demand for these illegal products.  The Bill takes aim at the black economy which is estimated to cost the overall economy more than &euro;2.3 billion a year with an estimated loss of &euro;800 million to the Revenue Commissioners.  Accordingly, funds for providing necessary services in healthcare, social protection and education cannot be provided.  Alternatively, we are losing out on potential for tax cuts which could be provided to help stimulate the economy further.</p>  <p>  The black economy is run by criminals.  Most of those running these illegal tobacco, diesel and solid fuel sales are criminal organisations, as well as being involved in other criminal activity such as drugs and guns.  Recently, 55,000 l of illegal alcohol was seized at Rosslare Europort.  Wexford has one of the largest solid fuel wholesalers in the country, Stafford Fuels, which has invested millions of euro into providing smokeless coal and solid fuel which has less of an impact on our environment.</p><p>This has been undermined by illegal solid fuel smuggled into the country that does not meet the criteria.  We have top-class local merchants in Enniscorthy, including Rowsome's fuels, O'Connor's fuels and Kehoe's fuels, and there are many others throughout the county.  These honest decent retailers lose out when illegal solid fuel is brought into the country and sold.  As I have said, it supports criminal activity.  The Bill goes a long way to help target this.  Something desperately needs to be done to target the sale and purchase of these illegal goods.  The Bill is very timely with Brexit coming down the line and as it increasingly looks like there will be more smuggling if we are faced with a hard border, which I hope we will not be.  I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Breathnach, for bringing it forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-24a.387" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1257" speakername="Fiona O'Loughlin" time="17:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102400047#AAA00200"><p>By supporting the Bill and endorsing the work put into it by my colleague, Deputy Breathnach, we are absolutely taking a stand that is needed against the sale of illicit goods.  The sale of illicit goods on the black market is on the rise.  The legislation would particularly tackle the sale of illicit goods such as tobacco, alcohol and solid fuel, and would make it an offence to purchase such illicit goods, particularly from a non-registered or unlicensed retailer.  There is absolutely no doubt that the problems we have with smuggling adversely impact small retailers.  According to some estimates the black economy costs the overall economy more than &euro;2.3 billion a year and it costs the Exchequer more than &euro;800 million a year.  This is an incredible amount of money.  We do not know the true figure as, by its very nature, this activity remains unseen.  The cost could be far higher.  This is more important than ever with the imposition of minimum unit pricing and the increase in excise on cigarettes.  The onset of Brexit is also likely have an impact on the black economy.</p>  <p>  Instead of focusing on the sellers of such goods the Bill focuses on the people buying these goods when they know or ought to have known they were illegally obtained and illicit.  Alarm bells have to go off if people see a lower price than one would normally pay.  Under the Bill "illicit" means an alcohol, tobacco or solid fuel product that is counterfeit or where the applicable taxes or duties have not been paid.  While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners will continue to face down the sellers of these products, by specifically focusing on the purchaser the Bill will act as a deterrent to those who know they are buying illicit goods.  The Bill also seeks to instill a behavioural change among purchasers, which is very important.  We need to change the culture around these and increase the potential cost of buying these goods.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the fact the Bill introduces an on-the-spot fine of &euro;100 for anyone caught purchasing illicit goods from an unregistered or unlicensed retailer.  We need to stand by and support the small shopkeepers, retailers and small and medium enterprises.  The Bill is certainly a measure to support those who pay their way and pay revenue.  They are keeping their businesses going in the communities where they are needed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-24a.388" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="17:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102400047#AAA00300"><p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions to the debate.  I believe Deputies on all sides of the House agree that smuggling, the shadow economy and activities in those areas pose a threat to legitimate and compliant businesses and consumers as well as depriving the Government of tax revenues.  However, I do not think the solution is to adopt the approach set out in the Bill before the House.</p>  <p>  A number of contributors to the debate made reference to reports that have presented estimates of the losses to the economy and the Exchequer caused by smuggling and the illicit trade.  I point out, however, that estimating the extent of any illicit activity and the losses to which it gives rise is inherently problematic and must, therefore, be approached with caution.  Unless a clear and credible methodology is specified for particular estimates of illicit trade and resulting losses they must be viewed as speculative.  Having said that, there is no doubt that such activity impacts on legitimate businesses and Exchequer revenues.  This is why Revenue sees combatting smuggling and the illicit trade as a core element of its work.</p>  <p>  In tackling the illicit trade, Revenue operates as a fully integrated tax and customs administration.  The organisation has more than 2,000 operational staff engaging in activities dedicated to targeting and confronting non-compliance, including activities related to anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns, compliance, debt collection and recovery.  Revenue works closely with the other agencies of the State, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in acting against illegal activities related to smuggling and illicit trade.  The relevant authorities in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland to target organised crime groups that are responsible for a significant proportion of smuggling and other illegal activities.  This work is supported and facilitated by the joint agency task force, including Revenue, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and their Northern Ireland counterparts, established in the framework of A Fresh Start - the Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan.  Under the aegis of the task force a very successful joint initiative between Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs directed against suspicious movements of substitute fuel with potential for considerable excise and VAT fraud won the outstanding collaboration category at the UK Government's counter fraud awards in September 2016.  From Revenue's perspective, this award recognises the excellent work and co-operation between Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs on investigations into the illegal movement of suspected substitute fuels.  There is also close co-operation with relevant authorities in other jurisdictions, including the European anti-fraud office and other international bodies and agencies, in the ongoing programme of action at international level to combat smuggling and the illicit trade.</p>  <p>  From a legislative perspective, the Minister has taken action through the Finance Acts over recent years to ensure Revenue has all the necessary powers to act against these forms of criminal activity.  He is satisfied that as a result there is a robust legal framework in place that allows effective action to be taken against such crimes.  As the Minister has said in the past, he is always open to discussing with Revenue any requirements it may have with regard to resources in the future to maximise its effectiveness in combatting illicit trade.</p></speech>

Any of us who grew up in the 1980s had a weekly market.  In my case, the weekly market in Navan was a paradise to explore as a young child.  One learned fairly quickly that not everything on sale in the market was kosher and one did not have to have watched an episode with Del Boy and Rodney to figure that out.  By the time I was a teenager it was the place where one went to go to a certain stall to get fireworks at Halloween.  They were discreetly stored underneath the table.  For those who partook of cigarettes there was a separate stall that would offer them.  Thankfully, it was never a vice to which I fell victim.</p></speech>

From a financial point of view it is harmful to the revenue of the State as it takes from the money required to fund the services the public demand.</p>  <p>  From my time on the Committee of Public Accounts during the lifetime of this D&aacute;il that impact was brought home very sharply.  The Comptroller and Auditor General produces a special chapter annually on the impact of illegal tobacco sales.  The Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, Niall Cody, has given extensive evidence to the committee on the topic and will do so again in two weeks' time.</p>  <p>  Total cigarette consumption in Ireland last year was estimated to be approximately 4.3 billion cigarettes.  That, in itself, is staggering.  The Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, referred to figures and stated the losses to the Exchequer must be treated as speculative.</p><p>In his latest report on the matter, the Comptroller and Auditor General set out that although the nature of the illicit market in tobacco products makes it challenging to accurately measure the tax losses involved, using the World Bank methodology the number of illegal cigarettes consumed in Ireland last year was estimated to be approximately 13% of the total with a notional loss of revenue to the Exchequer was &euro;229 million.  I presume the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, respects the opinion of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  A higher figure was estimated by other groups.  KPMG commissioned a report entitled "Project SUN" which indicated that Ireland had the third highest rate of counterfeit and contraband cigarettes in the EU in 2016 at 17.5%.</p> <p> The illicit tobacco trade is an important source of revenue for international organised crime.  In March of this year, Revenue officers seized 23.5 million counterfeit cigarettes in Jenkinstown in the Louth constituency of Deputy Breathnach.  The cigarettes were valued at &euro;47.8 million and would have resulted in an estimated loss to the Exchequer of &euro;37.5 million.  Unlike the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, the Comptroller and Auditor General has stated that the figures in this area are real.  The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, stated that implementing the provisions of the Bill would prove very difficult.  When he considers the figures involved and the matters I have outlined, he must come to the conclusion that the Bill is worthy of consideration because we need to tackle the purchasers of these illegal goods.  This illicit trade is a huge problem which is costing us millions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-10-24a.395" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018102400048#BBB00200"><p>I compliment my colleague, Deputy Breathnach, on bringing forward the Bill.  He has raised the issue on numerous occasions since he and I entered the D&aacute;il on the same day.  As a representative for the constituency of Louth he has intimate knowledge of the issue.</p>  <p>  In the context of Brexit and the difficulties which could arise from a hard Brexit, the Bill is extremely timely.  It attempts to tackle the illicit sale of goods such as tobacco, alcohol and solid fuel.  It seeks to make it an offence to purchase such illicit goods, particularly from an unregistered or unlicensed retailer.  According to some estimates, the black economy costs the overall economy &euro;2.3 billion and costs the Exchequer more than &euro;800 million per year.  The forgone tax take would cover the overrun in the Department of Health which was discussed yesterday by the Joint Committee on Health.  We do not know the true figures for black market trading because by its very nature it remains unseen.  The cost to the State, therefore, could be even higher.  The measures proposed in the Bill are now even more important in light of the forthcoming minimum unit pricing and the increase in excise on cigarettes.  Brexit is also likely to have an impact on the black economy.</p>  <p>  Rather than focusing on sellers, the Bill focuses on buyers who know or ought to have known that they were purchasing illicit goods.  Under the Bill, "illicit goods" means an alcohol, tobacco or solid fuel product that is counterfeit or in respect of which the applicable taxes or duties have not been paid.  While the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners will continue to face down the sellers of such products by specifically focussing on purchasers, the Bill would act as a deterrent to those who know they are purchasing illicit goods.  It seeks to instil a behaviour change among purchasers and to increase the cost of buying illicit goods.  It would introduce an on-the-spot fine for anyone caught purchasing illicit goods from an unregistered or unlicensed retailer and make it an offence for a person to buy or attempt to buy tobacco or solid fuel in circumstances where he or she knew or should have known that taxes or excise duties had not been paid.  Similarly, it would be an offence for a person to purchase such product if he or she knew or was reckless as to whether the product was counterfeit.  It could make would-be purchasers consider the consequences of their actions.</p>  <p>  The victims of this illicit trade are the ordinary people of Ireland who are affected by the resultant loss of revenue for the State.  Criminals who benefit from the proceeds of such crime are also involved in other criminality more easily recognised as such by the general public.  The perpetrators of drug and gun crime are never too far away from the financial opportunities offered by the sale of illicit goods.  That makes it essential for legislators to seek to make illicit goods less profitable.  We can do so by encouraging the buyers of such goods to turn away from the suppliers thereof.  When there is no market, there is no profit and that is what the Bill attempts to achieve.</p></speech>

It would be easier and, perhaps, more popular to ignore the problem but we must not do so.  I acknowledge the great work being done in this area by the Revenue and various other State organisations.  I am very disappointed that even after listening to the contributions made on Second Stage, the Government - Fine Gael in particular which is often referred to as the party of law and order - cannot appreciate that this issue will not go away but, rather, will get worse and worse.</p>  <p>  The framework of the Bill was drawn up by a barrister.  Many may disagree with some of its provisions.  We often use the phrase "doctors differ and patients die".  People have different opinions.  Much time and work was put into the Bill but there are flaws in it, as highlighted in some of the contributions in the House tonight.  I appeal to the Government to allow the Bill to go to Committee Stage where the issues raised by Members across the House can be dealt with and we will be able to come up with a solution to what is a massive issue in this country.</p></speech>

Deputy Mattie McGrath referred to &quot;The Transit Van&quot; by Seamus Moore.  Another song of his which is well known in my region is  &quot;Flash The Lights At Me&quot; which refers to the well-known tradition of telling drivers to watch out ahead.</p><blockquote>We&rsquo;re crafty &rsquo;round the border, that&rsquo;s how we have to be<br /><br />We like to get the better of the customs and authority<br /><br />We can barely forge, we know the score, we&rsquo;ve a simple philosophy<br /><br />If the thing&rsquo;s not right day or night, won&rsquo;t you flash the lights at me.</blockquote><p>It sums up this illegality in a light-hearted way.</p><p>I appeal to the Government to allow the Bill to progress to Committee Stage.  It has support across the House.  Many of the issues raised tonight could be dealt with on Committee Stage when counter-arguments could be put forward.  I prepared a response on several of the issues raised but do not have sufficient time to outline it.  It is incumbent on all Members to at least address this issue and find a solution to what is not an easy problem but can generate revenue for the State.  I came to this House to try to make a difference, as did all Members.  The Government must stop ignoring that we have a problem and, rather, find a solution to it.  Anything can be improved if the will to do so is there.  The Government should not oppose the Bill but, rather, allow it to progress to Committee Stage.</p></speech>

In recent years, I have always tried to contribute on budgetary matters in the House.</p><p>Unfortunately, the budgetary arrangement and debate this time around has not been to my satisfaction in the sense that I am now speaking on the Finance Bill in advance of getting an opportunity to speak on the budget itself so it is a bit disappointing.  I acknowledge there are time constraints and other priorities but I believe that at the very least, Members should be allowed to debate the budget before the Finance Bill is brought to the floor of the D&aacute;il.  I still look forward to contributing to the debate on the budget.  </p> <p> One must look at the backdrop when any budget and the financial measures that flow from it are presented to the House.  Certainly if one looks at where Ireland is positioned and the challenges it faces internally and internationally, one must accept that prudence is a critically important component in developing financial strategies for any country, particularly an open economy like ours.  Added to this is the uncertainty brought about by Brexit, which is clearly upon us, the lack of direction from the UK perspective in how we progress with Brexit and the EU's inability to answer the questions because they have not yet been raised from the UK's point of view.  With that in mind, we must accept that we are in uncharted waters in terms of the impact it could and will have on the Irish economy and that of Northern Ireland.  From that perspective, prudence is critically important.  We must make sure that we go as near as possible to running a budget surplus or at least not a very large deficit.  That in itself is critically important.  </p> <p> The rainy day fund has been discussed.  It is a good idea because we know that if there are headwinds and we are buffeted, there is something there to limit the damage they would have on the economy and the Government and State will have an immediate capacity to inject a stimulus into the economy in the event of it requiring it.  Consequently, a rainy day fund is prudent.  People will ask why we would not spend that money now when we face the huge challenges that exist and argue that this would address many of the problems.  Doing that on a continuous basis means that we would never get to the point where we try to address the counter-cyclical problems we have faced as a nation for many years.  The rainy day fund will benefit us.  In a way, we had a rainy day fund previously in the National Pensions Reserve Fund, which was, of course, raided on numerous occasions to try to shore things up in the face of the critical situation the nation faced from 2007 to 2010.  That in itself proves that having access to a reserve in challenging times is a positive thing.  </p> <p> When one looks again at the budget and what we are trying to achieve with it, one must accept there are a couple of key areas that need support on a continuous basis.  I am not talking about support in the sense of a handout from the State.  I refer to small and medium-sized businesses, SMEs, and what they need is incentivisation and a stimulus.  We pride ourselves on removing red tape and making it easier to do business.  We think of ourselves as the best little country in the world in which to do business but when one distils it down, we are not the best.  It is just that our SME sector is very innovative in its own right.  However, it does not get the support from Government in terms of taxation policy and other soft supports to encourage and foster enterprise and innovation, to reward risk and in the event of things going wrong, to support the sector.  Equally, when things go very right and a business does exceptionally well and has moved on and taken on more employees and at some stage, there is a wish to sell it on, there is an inherent barrier facing the people who have invested their money in establishing and developing the business.  When they want to extract themselves from that business, there are inhibitors in terms of taxation policy.  We must look at that, particularly with regard to SMEs, intellectual property and copyright and software design where the asset requirement is not massive but is mobile.  Very often, those companies will leave our shores and go elsewhere as they plan to grow and expand with the idea in mind that at some stage when they are disposing of the business, they will not be caught by huge capital gains tax.  I believe we must address this.  If we are talking about stimulating innovation and enterprise and fostering people in terms of getting involved in this type of activity, we must allow them at least some benefit after years of work and investment.  This is a key area that must be addressed.  </p> <p> Another area that must be addressed is access to seed capital.  Again, we are not great at this when one looks at other areas of the world, particularly the west coast or even the east coast of the United States, as well as the UK, where there is incentivisation to back risk and provide private seed capital.  This is not very evident in this country.  Again, it requires changes to taxation policy.  I know that as a nation, we are risk averse in many things but I believe there should be incentivisation to encourage people who have access to money to invest it in start-up businesses and that in the event of it going right, there is a reward but equally, in the event of it going wrong, losses can be written off etc.  This is a key area that must be addressed.  </p> <p> There is no doubt that we are burning through our competitiveness at an alarming rate.  We applaud ourselves for the fact that unemployment has dropped substantially in recent years down to a rate of approximately 4.2% or 4.3% to the point where we need to attract migrant workers to key areas of the economy to ensure the economy can sustain itself and grow and that labour is there to serve the needs of certain key areas of the economy.  However, we are hiding behind the fact that our competitiveness is under major threat.  All the indices and matrices the Government will use will indicate that is the case.  The cost of energy, insurance and childcare along with rates are huge barriers to our competitiveness.  All these issues come about because of policy decisions by Governments.  Policy decisions by Governments have consequences for these areas of the economy, which have consequences for SMEs.  Childcare is an area we have failed to grasp on numerous occasions and not only in the context of it being a barrier to and undermining our competitiveness.  It is a barrier to a functioning society.  We should accept that it is inherently wrong for families across this country to spend so much of their money on putting a roof over their heads and childcare.  We are bordering on a situation where our society does not have any surplus in terms of being able to invest in social capital.  Individuals and families are unable to invest in their social capital because they are slaves to bricks and mortar if they have a mortgage or slaves to the rental sector if they rent.  They are equally enslaved to childcare costs.  This is not acknowledged in a policy-driven manner.  If we do not address these issues, we will store up huge societal problems.  I do not mean to be alarmist but everybody will accept that people with children need to have money to invest in them - in the social aspect of their development.  It is fine to talk about putting a roof over their heads but if there is so much pressure in that house because the family cannot afford other things that are important for the development of an individual, we are clearly undermining society and storing up bigger problems down the road.  This budget has fundamentally failed to address the key areas of shelter and childcare and I have outlined the reasons I believe this to be the case.</p> <p> It applies to the economy as well and to our competitiveness.</p><p>Pressure must come on for wage increases if people are paying &euro;1,400 or &euro;1,600 a month for a room in south Dublin.  This is happening.  The idea that we can consistently force people to pay exorbitant costs for in mortgages or rents and that will not have a knock-on effect on our competitiveness defies logic.  One does not need to be an economist to accept that this is an issue.  Any handy home economics student would know that.  We have, collectively, failed to come up with solutions in this House to address the issue.  It is camouflaged while the economy is growing, but any pressures will find our competitiveness out and there will quickly be massive job losses and SMEs under major pressure again.  The pressure will come from employees  because of the cost of living.  People will have no choice.  They must live somewhere and, if they have children, must provide childcare.  There is little being done.  There have been few efforts to even address it.</p> <p> The cost of credit must also be addressed.  A recent report from the Central Bank showed that Ireland has the highest interest rates in the eurozone for residential mortgages and SME lending.  Our pillar banks are pillaging us and gouging profits from the pockets of mortgage holders and SMEs.  A cursory look at the interest rates charged across the eurozone shows that Ireland is at the top of the tree.  Our pillar banks pay the lowest deposit rates but charge the highest interest rates.  They then issue, with great fanfare, the profits they are making every now and again.  In a sheltered economy like ours, where there is little competition in the credit market, it is obvious they will make lots of money.  They are gouging it from mortgage holders and small and medium-sized businesses.  A variable interest rate in this country, over the lifetime of a 25-year mortgage, means an Irish family will pay &euro;60,000 more compared with the average in the eurozone.  The government then says various sectors of the economy are competitive and the country is competitive.  Ireland would be much more competitive if the banks accepted they have a role to play in ensuring reasonably priced credit is available to mortgage holders and to small and medium-sized businesses but they do not.</p> <p> There is ostrich syndrome on this issue.  Everybody is afraid to challenge banks, including the Central Bank.  We saw how inept and incompetent the Central Bank and regulators were in previous times.  There is deference again being shown to the banking industry.  Bank officials are back high on the hog again and, at the same time, failing to provide credit at reasonable costs where there is almost no risk, particularly in the domestic mortgage market.  They are pillaging and gouging us.  The average interest rate in the eurozone is 1.77%; in Ireland, it is 3.3%.  That is double the rate.</p> <p> Small and medium-sized businesses face the same issue.  It is almost impossible to get lending to them.  Banks are spending a lot of money trying to convince us that they are lending to small and medium-sized businesses.  A cursory assessment would show that they are not lending where there are key demands in the economy for credit.  The Credit Review Office in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation should be wound up.  It is a waste of time and I say that as one of the people involved in trying to establish it a number of years ago.  It does not have teeth and it does not have the capacity to assess the credit market.  We need independent assessment of what lending our banks are doing.</p> <p> I do not believe the Central Bank always acts as an honest broker when it is delving into the banks.  The proof of that lies in its lethargy and ineptitude in dealing with the tracker mortgage scandal.  It was forced by the Committee of Public Accounts, the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach and others to take action.  Officials were slow to act.  That is another key area of policy that must be addressed to ensure the banks are competitive.  </p> <p> The Government can borrow.  Interest rate charges to the Government are among the lowest in the eurozone.  At the same time, our banks are charging the highest rates.  There is an inherent difficulty in the banks that must be addressed.  The Government should be proactive in establishing an independent assessment of banking practices in this country, if the Central Bank is incapable, too inept or unwilling to do it.  Something must be done.  Every day, people who are taking out mortgages are enslaving themselves for 25 years.  A mortgage in another part of the eurozone will cost &euro;60,000 less over the lifetime of that mortgage.  That money could be invested in children and their hobbies and the social capital of the house; something productive in our society.  The banks will not allow us do that.</p> <p> The 2017 brief for the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation makes numerous references to investment in rural Ireland.  There have been recent difficulties with broadband provision.  Delivering the roll-out of broadband is beyond whoever is in charge of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We have been talking about it for years.  It has been raised continually in this House for 20 years.  Rural broadband has been around this House as an issue as long as I have, yet there are still 542,000 homes without access to reasonable broadband.  I live less than three miles from St. Patrick's Bridge in Cork as the crow flies and, if not for being able to access satellite broadband, I would be down to 1.2 Mbps on my line.  That is three miles from St. Patrick's Bridge, which spans the River Lee in Cork city.  We want to ensure Ireland is a modern, vibrant country that can not only attract foreign direct investment but can elevate itself as well.  We could provide more resources into rural Ireland if there was a broadband service.  It could become self-stimulating.  People could work from home, rather than having to always go to urban areas.  i have been informed by many multinational companies that up to 15% or 20% of their workforce could work from home if broadband services were better.  People are dragging their children out of bed and into the car every morning, haring the across the countryside to drop them to childcare facilities at 7.30, and going off to work for some company, all because we, as a nation, have not got our act together.  Broadband is a critical part of any modern economy and must be delivered quickly.  The lack of ambition and lack of ability to deliver broadband is a scandal.  I do not know who to blame, or at whom to point the finger, but the Department that has been overseeing this for a number of years has failed to make inroads into this issue of strategic importance to rural Ireland.</p></speech>

The Bill gives effect to many elements of the budget and very significant things often happen in the detail of the Bill which have real consequences for our society.  However, because of the nature of those, particularly taxation measures, being complex and technical, it often happens that nobody gets it at the time.</p>  <p>  I commend the Department of Finance officials and others who worked on the Bill on producing legislation like this.  The consequences of it are not their fault; that is down to policy decisions.  However, they have to give technical effect to it, which is a pretty amazing task when one considers some of the complex detail of the Bill, which I still have not got my head around.  We will need to do considerable study and scrutiny as we go on to Committee Stage to really see what it all means.</p>  <p>  I will make a few general comments about what is at stake in the budget and will deal with a few specific areas that the Bill deals with or does not deal with.  Most ordinary people were completely underwhelmed, if not deeply disappointed, at what the budget did not do in respect of the big social crises that face society, most obviously the housing crisis and the lack of local authority housing.</p>  <p>  It has just been reported that the homelessness figures are up again, with another 171 people homeless, many of them children.  Nearly two and a half years after the launch of Rebuilding Ireland circumstances are getting worse.  It is a shame and a scandal; it is a stain on our society.  It makes a mockery of the claims of economic success and recovery when we have historic numbers of people and children living in emergency accommodation with no signs of this abating.  There is an utter failure to build local authority housing and to control a private market that is out of control in terms of rental costs and property prices.  A huge protest prior to the budget pleaded with the Government to make a radical change in policy and allocate a dramatic increase in resources to provide local authority and affordable housing.  That was not dealt with.</p>  <p>  Some extra money was allocated to address the health crisis, mostly to deal with an overrun in a health service that is completely crumbling.  We have shocking statistics and human stories about waiting for basic operations for scoliosis, hips and cataracts.  Home care packages are promised to people but not given to them.  I could go through the list of failures in the health service.</p>  <p>  Something not talked about but which I have mentioned a few times since the budget is the very worrying situation in third level education.  The Irish Universities Association is deeply concerned about the dramatic increase in numbers of going into third level not being matched by increased investment in the sector both in capital investment and student investment.  Ireland is effectively at the bottom of the European league table for the amount invested per student in third level education.  Our universities are tumbling down the international rankings.  Students will confirm that poverty is rampant among them, which is why many of them are out on the streets.  That is not just a case of injustice and hardship for students and teachers, but is a real threat to the economy.</p>  <p>  On climate change, major fines are coming down the line and the Government is doing nothing significant on climate change.  In trying to judge what a budget is trying to address and assess its impact, it does not get more basic than housing, health, education and climate change.  On all of them, it fails.  It does not do anything significant on any of those areas.</p>  <p>  Where that general and correct perception relates to the Finance Bill is that when some of us on this side propose dramatic increases in investment in these areas, the Government claims we just do not have the money.  The Taoiseach would often say that in an ideal world the Government would do all these things but it just does not have the money.  That is the big lie.  We do just have the money.  Ireland is wealthier than it has ever been.  The rate of economic growth would confirm that, would it not?  We have spectacular levels of economic growth, outpacing any other European country, but we do not feel it in basic services.</p>  <p>  The money is going to vulture funds, banks, property speculators, landlords and corporations which are making mind-boggling profits.  The figures are so staggering that they do not even mean anything to people because there are so many zeros at the end of the profits they are making.  To put it in simple terms, in the time that Fine Gael has been in government, pre-tax corporate profits have doubled.  They have gone from &euro;77 billion to &euro;144 billion.  As that comes from the latest available figures which are two years out of date, they are probably even greater than that now.  They also pay pitifully low levels of tax.</p>  <p>  One of the features of the budget, about which I tweeted the other day is an anti-tax avoidance measure mentioned by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.  This measure will generate nothing. That is how seriously the Government takes anti-tax avoidance when we know there is rampant tax avoidance by multinationals over issues such as intangible assets.  There are accusations of abuse of tax reliefs in the film industry.  We know that the property sector is benefitting from enormous tax reliefs and there is even pressure to give more tax reliefs to landlords and vulture funds.</p>  <p>  We have the absolutely shocking scandal of section 110, which I keep raising.  At the Committee on Budgetary Oversight I asked the Minister to tell us how much tax revenue is foregone through section 110, a tax relief given to property investors who came in here and invested at the bottom of the market and have now seen the value of their investment go through the roof in terms of rents and property value.  They will pay no tax under the section on the rental revenue they make as long as they keep their investment for seven years, or on the capital gains.  Can the Minister tell us how much revenue has been foregone on that bearing in mind what is happening with property?  He cannot tell us because he cannot estimate it.  He does not know how much tax revenue has been foregone.  Imagine giving a tax relief like that.  Property developers must love this place.  Where else would they get a tax relief worth billions of euro and a Minister who cannot even tell us how much it is worth?  It is an absolute scandal.</p>  <p>  One of the problems with this guff is that it is necessary to get complex spreadsheets off the Revenue website.  Fair play to Revenue for producing them.  However, the small print is tiny.  This spreadsheet lists all the tax reliefs and there are loads of them.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">Some of them really jump out.  One of my favourites concerns intra-group transactions, which are transactions between two parts of the same company.  The latest available figure is &euro;9 billion in tax reliefs.  The Comptroller and Auditor General confirmed some of this.  We have been saying this for a few years.  In the past few weeks, the Comptroller and Auditor General brought out a report referring to this matter.  Ninety of the richest people </font>in Ireland, whose average earnings are more than &euro;50 million per year, are paying less tax than the average industrial worker.  The Comptroller and Auditor General states the reason is that there is a myriad of tax reliefs, deductions and allowances that he estimates are allowing &euro;216 billion in profits not to be taxed at all.  He estimates this could cost &euro;29 billion in tax revenue over the term of the reliefs.  Imagine what &euro;29 billion could do for housing, health, education and the effort to deal with climate change.  It is staggering what it would do.  It would transform this country.  I have outlined what is in the small print.<br/><br/>Does this Finance Bill tackle any of this stuff?  That is  the big question.  I mentioned that the avoidance measure in the budget &mdash; the one avoidance measure &mdash; has a figure of zero beside it.  Clearly, the budget does not do much in this regard.<br/><br/>There are more tax reliefs in some areas than others.  We will have to scrutinise them.  Some may have merit.  There are to be tax reliefs for gyms and childcare facilities in workplaces.  These could be good but they could be abused.  Therefore, we need to think about them.  Of course we want to make child care cheaper and we want people to be fit but we do not want well-paid executives essentially giving themselves free child care and free gym equipment while the relief is not available to ordinary people.  It could be just a way of writing off against tax and giving an additional benefit to the wealthy.  I do not know whether this is the case; we will have to scrutinise it.  I am sure the officials can help.  These provisions have to be examined because one never knows what could be included.<br/><br/>There are to be wear-and-tear allowances for biogas vehicles.  These could be good.  I hope this is an environmental measure.  There are to be reliefs for energy-efficient equipment but let us not forget how the renewable energy initiative in the North turned out.  There were people in the know buying loads of equipment for which they did not even need to avail of a tax relief.  They were burning wood chip they did not need to burn to benefit from the tax relief.  I am not saying there are problems but we need to scrutinise all the measures.<br/><br/>I want to say a good word about one provision.  There may be more that are good.  I am referring to a matter I have been campaigning on a lot, prompted by people in the film industry.  I refer to the section 481 tax relief.  This is a very generous relief, worth approximately &euro;70 million per year, given to the film industry.  I would like to see &euro;140 million going to the industry.  In fact, in our budget submission, we doubled the provision for the arts.  Much of this would go towards film and other art forms but the investment, given its size, would have to have a real economic and social impact for the country.  Prompted by those in the industry, particularly workers, I have raised here the very serious concern that the tax relief has not been policed properly.  I also raised the concern that the figures for employment generated through the relief by the relatively small group of production companies that have been getting the overwhelming majority of the benefits from it, were totally made up.  I presume generating employment is the purpose of the relief.<br/><br/>I am not a member of the arts committee but I attended a meeting to see what those concerned had to say about this matter.  They said there were 17,000 jobs in the Irish film industry.  If that were the case, there would be a pretty good return on &euro;70 million.  If, however, one talks to people working in the industry, one learns there are not 17,000 jobs.  There are not 7,000 jobs, and there may not even be 3,000.  There may in reality be about 700 people working in the industry today.  This is because nobody has a permanent job in the industry.  The people getting the money are getting it through special purpose vehicles through which they essentially absolve themselves of any responsibility for their employees.  They have a hire-'em-and-fire-'em workforce whom they hire on a project-to-project basis, but the work is totally precarious.  This is despite the fact that section 481 relief has specific requirements.  <br/><br/>The Taxes Consolidation Act requires the provision of quality employment as a condition of benefitting from the tax relief.  There is, however, most precarious employment, or a lack of employment, in the industry even though it is getting &euro;70 million through a tax relief.  This is not acceptable.  I could create more than 700 jobs directly with &euro;70 million.  If it were 17,000 jobs, it would be great but when there are only about 700 jobs, which are not permanent and which are totally precarious, there is something problematic, to say the least.<br/><br/>In the past few weeks, Mel Gibson made allegations confirming some of these points.  He is not the only one.  I do not know whether the allegation is true as it has to be investigated but it is worrying if Mr. Gibson says Irish production companies were abusing the system and artificially inflating their claims for expenses in order to benefit more from the section 481 tax relief on the basis that expenses are tax deductible.  That is a serious problem.  I am glad the Bill does tighten it up.  There has been a focus on it.  I have certainly spoken on this on several occasions in the House.  It was discussed by the arts committee and so on.  There was some attempt to address the matter.  There is a lot of detail but I am glad to see the matter is to be addressed.  It is stated that the Revenue Commissioners will have the power to find out whether the conditions of the relief are actually being met by the production companies.  That has to happen.  It is a bit like what was going on in the construction sector with bogus self-employment and rogue builders employing people on a completely precarious basis, not paying taxes and so on.  In fact, there is a quite strong overlap between what goes on in the construction industry and what goes on in the film industry, particularly for many grades of workers.  This has to be addressed.<br/><br/>Let me respond to what some of the producers say about this, in addition to Screen Ireland.  The latter tried to defend the <i>status quo</i>by saying film is just a precarious industry and that is the way it is.  It claims I do not understand and that film is different.  I was chatting to somebody I met on the street who is knowledgeable about animation.  We have a big animation industry.  There is no precarious work in this industry.  Animation is based on film but workers have proper training.  They get jobs in animation companies and then make movies.  This is episodic work also but it seems that we have got it right in the animation industry.  The standard of Irish animation is fantastic.  Ireland is a serious player internationally in terms of the big movie industry.  Has that anything to do with the fact that we have proper, secure, decent terms of employment for many of the people who work in the animation industry?  We need to monitor, in a very tight way, the investment being made absolutely correctly in the film industry.  We want to see more of this investment because we have a massive pool of talent in this country.  We will not, however, get the best out of the talent pool socially or in terms of employment, the proper treatment of workers or the quality of film production if the staff are not treated properly.  They must be given a proper training structure.  If one goes to the bother of learning about what are often very technical, creative difficult steps involved in the making of films, one should not have to live a precarious existence for the rest of one's life.</p></speech>
