This scandal has hit many areas across the State but it is most acute in Donegal, Mayo and Clare.  This scandal is a result of the light-touch regulation and reckless practices of the Celtic tiger years.  It is not the fault of the families concerned, it is the fault of those who were supposed to have their backs and who were supposed to be looking out for them.  These families have been failed by the system and by the State.  These people have worked hard and saved hard to buy homes for themselves and their families and to secure for themselves what everyone deserves, that is, a safe, secure roof over their head and a place to call home.  Yet, through no fault of their own, they find themselves in a nightmare situation where their houses are literally crumbling around them.</p>  <p>  Meeting recently with some of those affected was a powerful and heartbreaking experience.  These people are at their wits' end.  They are heartbroken.  What has happened to them has taken its toll on their family lives and health, including their mental health.  Everything many of these families own is falling in around them.  They go to bed at night wondering if their gable wall will collapse or if the chimney on their home or a neighbouring home will fall down.  Despite everything they have been through, they remain strong and resolute.  These are good people and they are determined to get justice.  They are gathered outside this building today and they are welcome to Dublin to pursue justice.  They deserve and need the support of all of us in this House, including the Taoiseach, me and every Deputy here.</p>  <p>  I promised these families we would do everything we possibly can to advance their cause for a 100% redress scheme.  Sinn F&eacute;in will lay a motion calling for that support before the D&aacute;il tonight to see that these families and homeowners are insured to get 100% redress.  That is what they deserve and nothing short of it will suffice.  The scheme that the Government previously put in place is not working.  It is letting people down.  Under that scheme, some families are expected to come up with up to &euro;100,000 or more to contribute to fixing their homes.  Who has that kind of money?  It is incredibly unfair.</p>  <p>  The campaign and demand for a scheme that covers the cost of rebuilding their homes is right and just.  Ba mhaith leis na teaghlaigh sc&eacute;im a fheice&aacute;il a chl&uacute;d&oacute;idh an costas a bhaineann lena a dtithe a at&oacute;g&aacute;il.  Bheadh s&eacute; sin ceart.  Is &eacute; an t-aon r&eacute;iteach c&oacute;ir at&aacute; ann n&aacute; sc&eacute;im s&aacute;saimh 100% a shocr&uacute;.</p> <p>This nightmare needs to come to an end.  These families have been failed by the system and by the State and the current scheme fails them again.  They cannot be left in this situation.  The only fair solution, therefore, is for the Government to deliver a 100% redress schemes and to do so urgently.  I ask the Taoiseach directly to give us and them a clear, unambiguous commitment that the Government will deliver a 100% redress scheme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-15a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021061500004#B00200"><p>First, what has happened to the homeowners in County Donegal, and indeed in counties Mayo, Clare and elsewhere but particularly the vast majority in Donegal, is scandalous.  It is devastating for those homeowners.  I visited one such home last week owned by the Murtagh family in Raphoe.   Last year, I saw the outsides of other houses.  What has happened is appalling.  We all know the impact it can have on people when one of the key objectives in life to build their family home, and the sweat, toil and effort that entails, is taken away from them, in this case by the supply and provision of defective blocks.</p>  <p>  The Government's and my view is that we will do everything we possibly can to help the homeowners and to refine, amend and change this scheme, in consultation with the Mica Action Group, with a view to making sure we have a sustainable scheme that can bring these homes back, make them habitable for the families and give them the experience they originally envisaged when they first took out the mortgage and provided for themselves to build a house.</p>  <p>  In fairness, the previous Government, working with the Mica Action Group at the time, brought in the scheme in January 2020 in very good faith.  In fact, it was accepted all around.  I recall the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesman at the time, Deputy Mac Lochlainn, welcomed confirmation of the scheme back then.  He identified some issues, in that he believed the banks should have been involved in helping.  It is fair to say that it initially got broad acceptance, however.  I do not, therefore, believe assertions of bad faith on anyone's part are correct.  Everybody wants to do and is interested in doing the right thing here.</p>  <p>  The Minister has written to the Mica Action Group and has spoken with it over the last number of days.  I spoke with the Mica Action Group on Thursday when I had a meeting with it and Donegal County Council, including the director of housing, the manager and the chairman of the group, Councillor Martin McDermott.  Our view is that we should set in train a time-bound process lasting approximately six weeks involving the Mica Action Group, representatives from the different counties, the local authorities and the Department to work on the scheme and iron out all the issues.  Different issues apply to different homeowners.</p>  <p>  I refer to the figure of &euro;100,000.  Nobody wants someone to be caught for &euro;100,000.  I acknowledge there are issues about upfront costs that must be dealt with.  There are issues around people having to rent accommodation while their house is being rebuilt, which have to be dealt with.  There also are other issues and supports that we may be in a position to provide.</p>  <p>  I believe that we have to carry out an analysis, however.  A number of applications have come in.  When I spoke with Donegal County Council, it said that 33% of those houses would have to be rebuilt.  An analysis of what has come in so far might give us a good picture of how we amend and improve this scheme overall.  Motions will come and go but the work must be done to improve this scheme and ensure that homeowners can avail of it to get their houses rebuilt or repaired without any undue impact on them.</p>  <p>  The scale this programme will be far in excess of any other entered into so far.  The Department's estimate of the original scheme, which was entered into in good faith, was close to &euro;1 billion.  I believe we will go over that &euro;1 billion.  The defective argument is also important.  Some 31 local building control authorities have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement.</p> <p>There are the requirements of the building regulations, the EU directive and so on.  There are responsibilities on designers, the builders of buildings and the suppliers of bricks as well, of which we cannot lose sight.</p></speech>

Something went catastrophically wrong with the blocks that were used to construct these homes.  Let us also agree that those responsible for these catastrophic wrongs have to be identified and held to account.  I have no argument with the Taoiseach and the people of Donegal, Mayo and Clare have no argument with him on that score.  He has called this is a scandal and said it is appalling.  He is correct on both counts.  He has said he will enter into a time-bound process to put things right.  I welcome that because we need to be timely and efficient.</p>  <p>  However, what we also need to hear from the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, is that the scheme that is landed on will represent, in reality, 100% redress.  The last scheme may have been introduced in good faith but the truth is that it has not worked.  That scheme has left families in misery, living this nightmare day after day, night after night.  That must stop.</p></speech>

I had a very good meeting with the Mica Action Group last Thursday.  As a result of that, I contacted the Minister again and said, "Let us put in place a process here."  The Deputy talks about 100%, but 100% of what?  It is not as simple as asserted.  That came up in the conversation.  There is a whole range of issues we have to discuss in terms of the grant caps, allowable costs, engineering costs, upfront costs and how we can make it easier for the homeowners in this context.  That is what we want to do.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-15a.37" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1610" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021061500005#C02900"><p>For many weeks and, indeed, months, I have been raising the same issue with the Taoiseach in regard to people in the 60 to 69 age group, some people in cohorts 4 and 7, and also some healthcare workers, all of whom were vaccinated with AstraZeneca and who initially had a 14-week wait for their second dose and then a 12-week wait.  I am not an immunologist or a scientist, and nor is the Taoiseach, but I believe in common sense.  We have a collective need to address this issue now because there is a race on between, one, the Delta variant coming into our country and, two, the vaccination programme we are doing.</p> <p> The issue is this: these are the most vulnerable people but, compared with their children and many individuals in their 40s, they are going to have to wait for some period before they are vaccinated.  We supported the Government in respect of the age-based roll-out but the latter has been negated as a result of this situation.  There are 460,000 people in these categories and they will have to wait up to 12 weeks.  We are going to have to do something about this.  I have raised this with the Taoiseach in a genuine way, week after week.  Respectfully, he knows that.  He asked for time and said the Government was looking at it and that the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, was looking at it.</p> <p> Since I first raised this issue, I have been inundated with messages.  There is deep concern.  That concern is intergenerational and involves grandchildren who are worried about their grandparents and sons, daughters, nieces and nephews who are worried about their parents, uncles and aunts.  We know from a study in Britain that if a person has the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, he or she is approximately 33% inoculated against the Delta variant.  That leaves a major risk for these people.  In that light, I ask the Taoiseach if, working with NIAC and, in particular, the HSE, he will bring forward the second dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine for this group of people?  This would ensure that, instead of waiting until the end of July, August or whenever, in a few weeks' time - if supplies are available - all of these people can get their second inoculation.  The study in the UK to which I refer shows these individuals will have 80% protection against the Delta variant.</p> <p> I do not want to get into what the Minister for Health said previously about reducing the period to five weeks because, to be honest, that was a bit of sleight of hand.  We need a concrete decision from the Government.  These are the most vulnerable people.  It is ridiculous that younger people are being fully vaccinated.  It is ridiculous that the individuals to whom I refer, who comprise the oldest group in the country to not be fully vaccinated - or at least not yet - cannot travel or do everything that everyone else will hopefully be able to do and have been left in a situation whereby the supposed vaccine bonus will not apply at the level previously indicated.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to give us good news that we will be able to bring forward the second dose of AstraZeneca in particular for this cohort.</p></speech>

The point is that the vaccination programme is going well and that it is going well through the age cohort approach and through the vaccination centres.  One of the most pleasing aspects of it is the very high level of participation by people as we go down through the age cohorts.  Our level of participation is very high relative to our European counterparts and other countries and that is giving good protection to society as a whole.  We are close the point where 58% of people will have had their first dose and in the region of 27% will have had their second dose.  That is very good progress indeed.  Everything is dependent on supplies of both the mRNA vaccines and the AstraZeneca vaccine.  We want to keep the programme on target.  What the Deputy is suggesting would delay the programme overall, potentially.  I am sorry, is he suggesting the mixing of vaccines?</p></speech>

What was to have taken nine weeks, namely, the administering of the second dose, will now take five.   That is happening as we speak and the HSE is engaged with that plan.  Basically, we will be finishing the second dose of AstraZeneca three to four weeks earlier than was to have been the case.  However, we need the necessary supplies of the AstraZeneca vaccine and, in particular, the mRNA vaccines, to keep coming in over the next number of weeks in order to make progress down the age cohorts, otherwise we will delay the vaccination programme itself.  As the Deputy knows, this is because of the age restrictions when it comes to administering the AstraZeneca and Jansen vaccines.</p> <p>NIAC has given recommendations in that regard to the HSE.</p> <p> We must also bear in mind that the vaccination programme is working.  What we have learned is that once we start changing or giving mixed signals, this can disrupt the vaccination programme and genuinely undermine it.  I am not saying anybody wants to do that in making new suggestions or proposals.  That has been the experience and it can affect vaccination take-up and so on.  The vaccination programme has worked on the basis that people have received vaccines as they have become available.  We are looking at approximately 4.1 million doses to be supplied by the end of quarter 2.  We need to keep going.  Let us not disrupt a model that is working well right now.</p></speech>

I did not raise the question of a second mRNA vaccine but I had asked if that option had been considered by NIAC.  I did not raise it today, although I will always make suggestions that might be considered.</p>  <p>  I raise this matter for the 460,000 affected people and I am delighted the Taoiseach has confirmed that the second dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine is being brought forward.  Will he confirm that by the middle of July every person in that affected cohort, particularly those between 60 and 69, will have a date for the second dose of AstraZeneca to be administered, which would see 80% efficacy against Covid-19?</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach look at the script issued on the vaccine bonus?  It probably should be reissued.  We have been told that because the Janssen vaccine is going to pharmacies, there are not enough people to take up all the doses in the vials.  Will the Taoiseach ask for that to be looked at?  It would be terrible to see vaccines wasted.  If required, common sense and discretion for pharmacists should be the order of the day.</p></speech>

The HSE has already announced that it will move from the current 12-week interval for AstraZeneca vaccine doses down to eight weeks.  It has said that within five weeks, we will achieve that eight-week interval.  I can double-check that with the HSE for the Deputy but that is the target.  Essentially, it is compressing that process.</p></speech>

It is good news and important.  The big issue all along has been supply and the mRNA vaccines in particular have played an outstanding role.  AstraZeneca has increased its supply and we are getting greater visibility over that supply, which is positive.  Again, we hope the manufacturers and the global supply chain can improve their performance.</p>  <p>  The vaccine bonus is what it is.  It will continuously be reviewed by the Chief Medical Officer and his team.  The latest data from Public Health England show that two doses of AstraZeneca are 92% effective against hospitalisation from the Delta variant and 86% effective against the Alpha variant.  That is good news as well.</p></speech>

The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, which is responsible for monitoring standards in all our nursing homes, both public and private, stated in its annual report, which was published last week, that 82% of nursing homes reported at least one case of Covid-19 and the virus still presents a real and present danger to the sector.  HIQA is seeking an urgent review of the current nursing home care regulations.</p>  <p>  At the same time, we have the Coroners Society of Ireland calling for a wide-ranging inquiry into all Covid-related nursing home deaths.</p> <p>Its president, Frank O'Connell, believes there is a basis for a more wide ranging inquiry into all Covid related deaths in nursing homes, to deal with such questions as design, ventilation, isolation, staffing etc.  Yet as we hear these calls the Department of Health is cutting back on the financial supports to the nursing home sector just as we face into a fourth potential wave from the Delta variant of the virus, which has been so deadly within the sector over the past year.  The Department of Health has confirmed that the temporary assistance payment scheme, TAPS, which provides payment for Covid-19 infection control measures is to be completely withdrawn from the long-stay residential sector for older people from the end of this month.  Despite the Government categorically stating there would be no cliff edge for Covid supports for any sector, we now find that the State is planning to withdraw this support completely.  There is a fear from residents and their families that nursing home care is being de-prioritised at a time when there should be a thorough review of all supports and standards within the whole sector before there is any change to the current scheme.</p> <p> I put it to the Taoiseach that older people in long-term care have been at the front line when it comes to the threat of Covid infection.  The reality is that they remain on that front line until all of us are vaccinated.  There remains a threat of a new variant taking hold that circumvents the immunity provided through the current vaccination programme.  I urge the Taoiseach to ensure, at the very minimum, that the current level of Covid protections remain in place until the reviews sought by HIQA and the Coroners Society of Ireland are completed.</p></speech>

As society begins to reopen we will be able to reduce our reliance on many different supports that the Government has provided throughout the pandemic.  The Covid-19 temporary assistance payment scheme was established as part of a comprehensive package of support measures for nursing homes at the start of the pandemic.  It was originally introduced for three months, to conclude in June 2020, but obviously the continuation of the pandemic meant that there were two further extensions.  It was and is a successful scheme and it has been very impactful.  It provided additional funding to those nursing homes that required it, to contribute to the costs associated with dealing with Covid-19.  These included the costs incurred in preparing for and mitigating against Covid-19 and in the management of outbreaks when they occur, contributions towards the costs of maintaining isolation rooms, and a once-off contribution towards temporary visiting infrastructure during winter 2020.</p>  <p>  The cessation of TAPS has been communicated with all stakeholders.  As of 11 June about 7,148 claims had been submitted and &euro;134.5 million has been allocated or made available under the scheme.  It has always been just one component of a suite of supports.  Other supports included providing access to personal protective equipment and oxygen, the establishment of Covid response teams, support for staff accommodation, access to training and the serial testing programme.  Many of these and other supports will continue for the time being as required.  Furthermore, an outbreak assistance payment will continue to be made available until the end of the year as a support for any nursing home that experiences a Covid-19 outbreak.</p>  <p>  In addition, it has to be taken on board that the vaccination programme has had a very significant impact on nursing homes.  There has been a huge uptake, close to 100%, by residents and staff.  The effect is very strong with significant reductions in cases, outbreaks and mortality.  This is a factor.  We also need to move on from the current temporary schemes to working through the more medium-term reforms that have to happen within the nursing home sector and perhaps the changes that will cost not just the nursing homes but also the State, in light of the Covid-19 nursing homes expert panel report.  The panel identified 86 recommendations in the report and the Government is fully committed to its implementation.  Costs will arise across the system relating to the necessary systemic reforms.  It is best to do that through a more informed and developed scheme as opposed to doing it through a temporary scheme.</p> <p>We will keep the situation under review.  We are fully open to evaluating what happened in nursing homes, outside of the pandemic and right through it, and learning lessons from it.</p></speech>

Fifteen months ago, our nursing homes and hospitals received their first Covid-19 patients.  Since then, front-line healthcare workers have managed three waves of the virus and a cyberattack.  These people are now mentally and physically exhausted.  We must provide staff with time off because exhausted healthcare staff are a recipe for mistakes.  We must give proper recognition to staff on the front line in the battle against Covid-19.  For example, the Scottish Government is paying every NHS worker a bonus of &pound;500.  Over the past year, I have consistently raised with the Taoiseach and other members of the Government the issue of recognising front-line workers.  They have been selfless and the country owes them a great debt of gratitude.  The Government must now recognise their efforts.</p></speech>

I have consistently said the Government wishes to recognise not only front-line healthcare workers but front-line workers, and is continuing to examine the optimal way of doing this.  However, we are not out of the pandemic yet and all our attention and focus are on making sure we continue with progress on the vaccination programme and the very positive impact the vaccination programme is having on the prevalence of the disease and monitoring variants, such as the Delta variant, to make sure they do not undermine our efforts to keep the virus under pressure.  We will keep in touch with the Deputy on the issue.</p></speech>

I have said this to the Taoiseach many times before.  There we are, up in the north-west of Ireland, happy to be living in the most beautiful county in the country but despairing at how we have been treated by successive Governments.  The people of Donegal are making their voices heard now.  They are making their voices heard here today.  They are harnessing the power of social media and media to say the Government cannot ignore them any longer.  There cannot be one rule for Dublin homes in the pyrite redress scheme and another for people in Donegal and Mayo whose homes are crumbling with mica.  We will not be forgotten and, wonderfully, the public is behind us in our call for no less than 100% redress.</p>  <p>  At the end of May, thousands took to the streets of Donegal to highlight the atrocity and injustice being imposed on homeowners in the county.  Today, more than 40 busloads of people have come to Dublin to show the Government they will not be forgotten.  At the beginning of 2020, the Government launched the defective concrete block grant scheme for homeowners affected by pyrite in Mayo and mica in Donegal.  However, it was in early 2014 that the Mica Action Group was formed.  It is a lobby group made up of volunteers directly affected by the scandal.  For seven years, it has been seeking redress and liaising with local and national government officials.  It has been fighting for recognition for seven years.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach's covert mission to Donegal last week and his photo opportunity with some crumbling walls was far too late.  Now that our voices are louder, the Taoiseach has to listen.  As the Taoiseach knows, access to the defective concrete blocks grant scheme costs between &euro;5,000 and &euro;7,000 but the cost to access the scheme in Leinster is much lower, at &euro;500.  Up to 5,700 homes throughout Donegal and Mayo are crumbling away because of the presence of mica in defective concrete blocks.  Approximately 1,000 local authority provided social homes in Donegal are also affected.  Tenants are paying rent and hoping their ceilings and walls do not fall down on them.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach said he needed to speak to the Attorney General on the next steps.</p></speech>

Perhaps he will clarify the matter in his response because I will be glad to hear it.  I do not believe the Attorney General has any role in this.  Now that the scandal is on a national scale, what will the Taoiseach do?  We need 100% redress.  An amnesty in mortgage repayments while remediation works are taking place is the only option.  Earlier, in response to Deputy McDonald, the Taoiseach asked 100% of what was she calling for.  What people are calling for is 100% redress and no cost for people to access the scheme, plus rental costs to be covered, the same as for the pyrite action group in Dublin.</p> <p>It is as simple as that.  That is what Donegal demands.</p></speech>

The key focus of that was not only to visit a home, meet the Loftus family and see the appalling condition of their home but also to meet the action group, Donegal County Council and the chairperson of the mica action committee on Donegal County Council, Councillor Martin McDermott, who was in the group, to have a long and thorough meeting with them on the issues they wished to raise with me and with the Government in terms of getting this issue resolved.  That was the purpose of the visit.</p>  <p>  I had to do it in between meetings I had here and going to Fermanagh for the British-Irish Council.  I changed my diary and schedule, which is no big deal, but I wanted to meet people.  I believe in getting resolutions.  I do not showboat on issues like this.  I do not try to make political capital out of it.  I have no interest in doing that because for the family owners, all that matters is whether they can build a home for their family and their children.  That is what they wanted to do originally.</p>  <p>  What happened was disgraceful.  The supply of those defective blocks was a disgrace; end of story.  I have no interest whatsoever in defending those who were responsible for this.  I have an interest in getting the issue sorted.</p>  <p>  The previous Government, in good faith, developed a scheme.  It was welcomed broadly.  It was welcomed by Sinn F&eacute;in at the time.  Few parties or individuals in this House raised this until quite recently, if the truth be told.  I looked at some of the manifestos.  It does not even get a mention.  It is not even mentioned in the Sinn F&eacute;in manifesto.  People thought the scheme was okay.</p>  <p>  When the scheme started being implemented or when applications started going in, it became known to the homeowners that the upfront costs were far too expensive.  We will deal with the upfront costs.  Anybody who cannot afford it should not have to pay &euro;10,000 or &euro;8,000 upfront to get an engineering report.  We will deal with that.  We should also deal with the rental issue but we also need to get a proper assessment.  What was clear from the meeting was that there will be different solutions for different houses and for houses of different size.  People want certain undertakings in respect of what happens if, in the case of a repair, subsequently the issue arises again.  These are the kind of issues that need to be resolved.</p>  <p>  I understand fully the anger of the homeowners.  I understand what they want.  It is now our job as the Government, in good faith and working with the group.  The Minister has written to the group.  He has spoken to them.  He has put this idea to them.  Let us have a time-limited engagement with homeowners' representatives, with the local authorities, with the Department officials and work through this so that we can improve this scheme in such a way that does not pose an excessive financial hardship on homeowners.  That is, in good faith, what I am putting before the House today, what the Minister has put to the Mica Action Group and what we discussed at the meeting on Thursday last.</p></speech>

I am glad the Taoiseach put it officially on the record today what happened last week at the meeting because it is important that it is on the record that everybody knows.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach stated last week as well - it has been widely reported that the Taoiseach said he would address it but he has not in his response - that he had to talk to the Attorney General about it.  What is the role of the Attorney General?  I believe the Attorney General has no role and that will be a deflection.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach states that he will have a time-bound process with five to six weeks to respond.  By my reckoning, that five to six weeks would be up on 14 July.  Can the people of Donegal expect a response from the Taoiseach and the Government on 14 July that will address their concerns?  That is vitally important and that is what people need to hear today from the Taoiseach.</p></speech>

This has gone on too long.</p> <p>I have looked at the timeline as well.  I was not in government for the past ten years but this thing has gone on too long.  Homeowners have raised legitimate issues.  They have got to be dealt with.</p> <p> I referenced the Attorney General last week.  I have an issue with certain people walking away from this.  That is my issue.  Who supplied the blocks?  Who designed them?  As for insurance companies and HomeBond, everyone seems to have walked off the pitch.  Banks have a role as well.  To be fair to Deputy Mac Lochlainn, when he welcomed this, he thought that banks could have played a useful role in helping people.  The Mica Action Group signed off in good faith originally as well, but issues have now arisen.</p> <p> I have discussed this with the Attorney General.  The State cannot forever be held accountable alone in respect of behaviours or actions where others fell short, be they in the private sector or elsewhere.  That is the only point I was making, and I wanted the Attorney General to examine that, not just for this Government, but for future Governments and, more importantly, for taxpayers.</p> <p> I do not want this to be distorted, because there can be an element in this kind of debate of comments being distorted.  I am very clear about our role in helping the homeowner, but there is a separate piece of work needed as well to examine this in greater detail in terms of how it came to be that thousands and thousands of homes were supplied with an appalling block.  Stand up and-----</p></speech>

Our group will have six minutes, which will be inadequate for such a serious issue.  The debate on fishing has also been pruned, although I know that is being done to allow for other important matters.  Both of these industries are under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We need a proper, meaningful and thorough debate on CAP and its implications for Ireland and Irish farmers.  We want more time.  Groups like ours, the Rural Independent Group, have just six minutes each.  The fishing industry has been wiped out.  Fishers will come to Dublin next week to protest, and rightly so.</p></speech>

The State is defending in the High Court the commission's report.  At the same time, the Minister is saying that he believes survivors and that an independent review should be done.  We need to know which is the position.  The Government is talking out of both sides of its mouth on this matter.  Time must be set aside for the Minister to answer questions because survivors need clarity about what is happening.</p> <p>The time given for the climate Bill and the guillotine on the Bill are inappropriate.  The rush to get this Bill through is undemocratic.  We had 230 amendments last week, none of which was taken.  There has been an inordinate rush to get this legislation through.  While I understand its importance, we need to have a discussion on it and people's voices need to be heard.  I ask that more time be given for the Bill.</p></speech>

Legitimate questions on the impact of this legislation have been raised in the House but not answered.  On the financial impacts alone, we are not getting basic answers.  On 19 May, I asked the Taoiseach to ensure the McKinsey report on the cost of decarbonisation up to 2050 is published before we pass this law.  Since then, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has highlighted the lack of detail on the costs and challenges in achieving Ireland's climate goals.  On Thursday, the day after we pass this legislation through all Stages, the Committee on Budgetary Oversight will commence hearings on the cost of climate change.  We accept we need the new legal tools.  None of us disagrees with that.  However, we are rushing this legislation through without legitimate answers to legitimate questions.</p></speech>

Amendments should not be ruled out in the way they have been.  I say that despite the fact many of the amendments are from right-wing opponents of climate progress.  More time should be allowed for a debate on this key issue.</p>  <p>  Time should also be provided for brief statements alongside the moving of the writ for the Dublin Bay South by-election.  Important issues are at stake.  It is the first opportunity since the general election for part of the electorate to have its say on the housing crisis.  If the by-election is lost by the Government, it will have profound impacts on it.  There should be a debate on it.</p></speech>

I am having a social dialogue sectoral meeting with a representative group of the fishing industry.</p></speech>

We had similar structured dialogue prior to Brexit.  We need a structured approach with the fishing industry to deal with the issues in a frank and realistic way and to deal with how we can best help the industry to deal with the significant challenges before it.  Unfortunately, distortions that we were against having a debate on the fishing industry were put about the place.  A screen-grab of a vote on the Order of Business was used to distort.  Someone voting to have an Order of Business was somehow transformed into someone being against the fishing industry.  It is disreputable behaviour that that kind of stuff goes on in modern politics.  The Deputies should be a bit more mature than that.</p></speech>

It does not mean they are against holding a debate on something else.  It is unfair to cast that aspersion on Members.  When Members vote for an Order of Business that has been agreed by the Business Committee, that suddenly gets translated as these Deputies being against the sector on which another Deputy sought a debate.  That is too cynical by half and it goes on far too often in the House.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Whitmore's question, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is reflecting on that situation and will be coming to Government next week on it.  I do not think he has any issue with coming before the committee.</p> <p>He has indicated to me and to the Government that he wants to come before the committee and the House more generally. </p></speech>

The collapse of Stobart Air last weekend came as another major blow for the sector and for our regional economies.  The announcement followed the recent Aer Lingus base closures in Cork and Shannon.  After 15 very difficult months, hundreds of workers have been made redundant.  It is now reported that Nordica, the Estonian state-owned airline, may take over the Kerry-Dublin route.</p> <p>This is welcome, as any future re-establishment of public service obligation, PSO, routes would be.</p> <p> However, it begs the question as to why more was not done to protect Irish jobs, which could now be outsourced.  Why was more not done to protect connectivity?  Connectivity and regional economies are at risk and jobs are lost.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan's hands-off approach is seriously damaging Irish aviation.  We need a survival and recovery plan now.  What action will this Government take to help the aviation sector and secure the future of our regional airports?</p></speech>

The Government has provided a range of services and in particular, we want to get back connectivity to Kerry and Donegal airports as quickly as we possibly can.  Good progress is being made on that.  This was a sudden announcement by Stobart Air that it had ceased trading.  Aer Lingus and BA CityFlyer will operate temporary replacement services, which will cover most of the affected routes operating out of Dublin and Belfast city airports operated by Stobart Air under a franchise agreement with Aer Lingus.  This will allow passengers who are affected to return home.  Kerry and Donegal airports, as the Deputy knows, have been supported by Government under the PSO arrangement with about &euro;7 million per annum.  The current contract is due to expire on 31 January 2022.  We discussed the replacement of those PSO services linking Dublin, Donegal and Kerry as quickly as possible at Cabinet today.  That is happening in real time.</p></speech>

Over the last eight years, house prices have risen by 68%.  As the Taoiseach is aware, my party is putting forward a Bill tomorrow to implement the Kenny report, which the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, has already said is necessary and it supports it.  The land is a large component of the cost of building a house.  I note that in 2018 the Taoiseach said:</p> <blockquote> 	I think implementing [the] Kenny [report] is morally the right thing to do - I don't think there should be windfall profits once land is rezoned but it would also undoubtedly reduce the cost of housing because the price of land at the moment is a significant factor in increasing the price of houses. </blockquote>  <p>Based on those comments a couple of years ago, will the Taoiseach support the Labour Party's honest attempt to address this tomorrow through the implementation of the Kenny report in legislation?</p></speech>

That is one issue that is in the overall mix and the Minister is preparing a broad housing strategy, namely, Housing For All.  Our objective is to get as many houses built as quickly as we possibly can using every available mechanism to do that.  That is essential.  Housing is the biggest issue facing us as a society and we have to demonstrate a capacity and put in place the policies that will enable us to build enough social houses and houses that single people and people planning a new home can be in a position to afford to buy.</p></speech>

Today in the High Court, the State will strongly defend the report of the mother and baby homes commission in legal action brought by survivors against the report.  Simultaneously, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, has said that he believes survivors and intends to appoint an independent expert to review the testimony of survivors given to the confidential committee.  Which is it?  Does the Government support the report, as it claims in the High Court, or does it believe that there are such fundamental problems with it that it is necessary to authorise a separate review of the report?  There is an inherent contradiction in the Government's approach.  It cannot simultaneously defend the report and suggest that it is so fundamentally flawed that a separate review of it is required.  This approach is nonsense.  The Minister needs to make up his mind.  He must repudiate the report and ensure that the historical record about this dark period in Irish history is accurate.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, particularly in relation to the testimonies that were given to the confidential committee, wants the voices of survivors to be given proper status in all of this.</p></speech>

When the Oireachtas decides to establish a commission of investigation, it decides from the outset that it cannot interfere or interrupt the investigation.  The report has been produced and covers mother and baby homes and the county homes from 1922 to 1998, a span of 76 years.  The report is approximately 3,000 pages long.  It is a very comprehensive report that took five years to produce.  The recommendations from the report-----</p></speech>

We want to implement quickly the recommendations from the report.  I am clear that the vast majority of people are anxious that we get access to information, including birth certificates.  The birth information and tracing Bill has been published.  The legislation relating to Tuam is important, as is the redress scheme.  The Government is focusing on implementing the recommendations.</p></speech>

On the issue of honouring collective redundancy agreements in liquidation situations, the Government says "No".  On the issue of prioritising workers for payment in liquidation situations, the Government says "No".  On the issue of making employers pay a serious penalty if they refuse to comply with soon-to-be-extended consultation provisions, the Government again says "No".  With one Deputy Varadkar-like shimmy, the Government has buried half of the Cahill Duffy proposals, ignored the key issues raised by the Debenhams dispute and sent a clear message to workers who face job losses that they are on their own.  It is interesting that this report was published on a Department website in a week the D&aacute;il was in recess.  This begs the question as to whether the Taoiseach is embarrassed or ashamed of the Government's proposals.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste has published these proposals and there will be continuing engagement with the social partners on the matter.  There has already been engagement.  We want to advance, modernise and improve the situation as it applies to redundancies and situations arising out of liquidations.  We also want an improved situation more generally to protect employees and in the context of employment protection law.</p></speech>

Should the Western Development Commission still get more than &euro;2 million of public money year after year on the nod, to add to its &euro;72 million investment portfolio?  The regional problems those organisations set out to address are fully resolved.  One might question if they are now victims of their own success.  It is hard to argue against the recent &euro;108 million endowment of the just transition fund for the midlands and another &euro;28 million for the Border fund, but the south-east region is in the same economic situation as the midlands and Border regions.  Surely it also needs a similar strategic development agency and fund.  Will the Taoiseach give any commitment that such oversight, presumably related to lack of attention from Cabinet, will be remedied?  Will he commit, on behalf of the Government, to the formation and implementation of a nationally funded, dedicated strategic development agency for the south-east region to address the ongoing regional economic deficits which have prevailed unattended for far too long?</p></speech>

I am not convinced that an agency, as outlined by the Deputy, would be the best model to deal with the issue but we are open to all proposals for developing increased economic activity in the south east.  The south-east technological university is an advance that will significantly help the south-east region into the future.  It will attract more investment from the State.  Additional funding is going to be provided to technological universities through the economic recovery fund from a capital perspective.  The investment through the urban regeneration and development fund in the city of Waterford is significant.  Sometimes a sectoral approach can be more impactful.</p></speech>

I wish every business that is open all the very best.  We should support them all.  There are day care centres from Donegal to Tipperary, where there are several, that have tremendous voluntary boards of management, workers and volunteers.  People, especially older people, have missed those centres.  They have missed the acts who perform at those centres, the likes of Stefan Grace and others, who entertain them free of charge.  It is part and parcel of those people's lives and they need to get back to sharing with their friends.  They have lost many of those friends, unfortunately, and some of them have regressed terribly because of having no interaction with other people.  They used to have social days that included music, song, dance, a meal and access to chiropody, hairdressing or whatever.  Can the Taoiseach give us a date for the reopening of the wonderful day care centres throughout the country?  They are desperately badly needed from the point of view of our people who are isolated.  Buses bring people into the day centres, giving them a day out.  They are not residential facilities, they only provide day care.  They do an excellent job and are quite safe.  I am talking about senior citizens.</p></speech>

I will follow up on that.  Given the success of the vaccination programme, those facilities can be restarted.  I will engage with the Minister of State on the matter.</p></speech>

We have all seen the gaping cracks in the side walls of houses and the holes appearing under windows and doors.  We know that the level of financial distress and stigma is huge.  I raised this issue with the T&aacute;naiste nearly five weeks ago because Sligo County Council had written to the relevant Minister stating that a minimum of 140 houses in west Sligo have been significantly damaged by pyrite.  I am asking for Sligo to be included in any 100% remediation scheme for homeowners.  Concrete blocks containing pyrite and mica do not respect county boundaries.</p>  <p>  I listened to the Taoiseach's earlier responses on this matter.  I heard him say that he does not showboat and I accept that.  I am asking for commitment from him that Sligo and any other county affected will be included in a 100% redress scheme and that those who have responsibility will bear it.</p></speech>

This has been acknowledged by the Department and has led to considerable cuts to services.  Carlow County Council tells me that it cannot take on extra staff and that it is 30 staff short at the moment.  It might be looking for even more staff.  The Taoiseach knows that local authorities are the hubs of their communities.  Their services are essential.  I believe a review of local property tax is ongoing at the moment.  I ask the Taoiseach to talk to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the different Departments.  We need to get funding into Carlow County Council.  We cannot do without services and it is unfair that we are being neglected like this.</p></speech>

I will engage with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage in respect of this matter, particularly in terms of the equalisation fund and what the Deputy says has been a consistent underfunding of Carlow for quite a number of years in the amount of &euro;2.7 million per year.  I will engage with the Minister and raise with him the points the Deputy has raised in respect of the local authority in Carlow.

We have seen a sea change in the world of work during the course of the pandemic, in particular, the explosion of remote working, which will hopefully move to a blended working model.  We have also seen an expansion of platform working, the most visible sign of that being delivery workers.  Our employment law is lagging behind.  It is essential that we bring it up to date and make it fit for purse for a post-pandemic era.  Where are we in terms of progress on that?</p></speech>

My understanding is that something similar to the company law review process, which was established many years ago and has proven to be very effective in the area of ongoing company law review, may be developed in respect of employment law review.  I will revert to the Deputy with more substantive information and details on that.  The point he makes is very fair.</p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy's point that we must go over and above measures to redress the imbalance in economic and social development in the south east.  The only issue is around the best mechanisms and models to work through to achieve that objective.</p></speech>

Today, we heard that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, announced yet another task force; here we go again.  This follows numerous task forces and reviews, which have amounted to nothing.  This is an urgent issue that requires urgent action.  I call on the Taoiseach to intervene and engage with the stakeholders in the mid-west region, for example, Shannon Chamber and the workers affected, and implement recommendations.  More than 13,000 people in County Clare have signed a petition in County Clare to save Shannon Airport.</p></speech>

Deputies and Senators should always reflect on the policies they announce one month as opposed to what they announce the second month.  I am amazed at how everybody who was advocating for zero travel has suddenly had a complete change of mind.  I understand it but decisions have consequences too.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 has been the main factor disrupting travel and undermining the aviation industry.  It was not governments or anything else.  Deputies jump up and down and say it is the Government's fault.  Covid-19 has disrupted travel.  Mandatory hotel quarantine was brought in.  The House urged the Government to bring it in much more quickly.  The task force was a commitment in the programme for Government for the wider Shannon development area.  It is a good thing and will yield good results.</p></speech>

The company is a major employer in the mid-west, providing 500 highly-skilled jobs.  The Government has invested heavily in this critical company over the last 18 months by means of the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, and the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.   The company has also benefited from the rates waiver.  It is critically important that the Government and its agencies engage with this company and secure the 500 jobs at risk.  The current strategic review is looking at possible closure, sale or restructuring.  It is important that the Government, and the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, provide every support necessary to secure these jobs.</p></speech>

The area has seen a serious increase an antisocial behaviour, drug crime and serious unprovoked attacks.  Frantic calls for help have to go through to Ashbourne Garda Station, some 33 km away.  When the Garda Commissioner reduced Garda divisions from 28 to 19, he promised increased visibility and more localised service.  The complete opposite has happened in east Meath.  People feel completely abandoned.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach commit, in the Government's capital plan, to include provision for a fit for purpose Garda station in the Laytown-Bettystown area?  A population of 22,000 people live in that area.  Garda&iacute; are operating from a dilapidated bungalow in the middle of a housing estate and only provide Garda service 20 hours per week.  I raised this matter with the Commissioner, who is aware there is an issue in the area but continues to ignore it.

This is of vital importance.  The Taoiseach knows how important it was that this lifeline was kept open for us during the pandemic because of healthcare and other necessities, for which the airport is required.  That PSO is of such importance.</p>  <p>  We must remember that Ireland is an island of air connectivity, however.  It is not just critical but critical care for both passengers and cargo.  A Government is elected to serve all its people, which means regional development and balance.  One cannot find a balance in anything; it must be created.  In recent days and weeks, we have had the closure of the Aer Lingus crew base at Shannon Airport and the collapse of Stobart Air.  I sympathise with the workers who operated the PSO services on behalf of Aer Lingus to counties Kerry and Donegal and lost their jobs.</p>  <p>  We are all aware that the west extends from Kerry to Donegal.  We have a huge decline in air services on the whole.  I thank the Taoiseach for his commitment to Kerry but ask him to ensure that continues.</p></speech>

I am fully aware of the importance of Kerry Airport to enterprise in Kerry and surrounding areas.  It is an enterprising county.  Kerry technology park in Tralee, for example, has some very groundbreaking companies.  Killarney tourism is probably the model around the country.  Many people need connectivity.  Kerry has companies such as Liebherr, one of the oldest foreign direct investment, FDI, companies that came into country.  There has always been a strong enterprising spirit in Kerry, which needs to be reflected in connectivity.  It has always had connectivity issues in terms of road transport and geographic location.  The airport is, therefore, important to that location.  We are very committed to the PSO provision to facilitate the continued operation of flights in and out of Kerry.</p></speech>

We had a constructive engagement across a number of issues.  Our discussions focused on ways our two Governments can continue to work together to support all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and promote peace and prosperity on both a North-South and east-west basis.  We also discussed issues around implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol and stressed the importance of addressing implementation issues in the agreed European Union-United Kingdom framework.</p>  <p>  We discussed the long journey of the Ballymurphy families to achieve justice and vindicate the innocence of their loved ones.  In that context, I emphasised the importance of the British Government responding to the families in a way that recognises the gravity of the findings of the inquiry, which categorically established that ten innocent people were killed.  As well as discussing Ballymurphy specifically, Prime Minister Johnson and I spoke about legacy issues and how best to secure progress and answers for the many families who have been pursuing truth and justice for far too many years.  These include the families of those killed in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings on 17 May 1974, the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973 and the bombing of Kay's Tavern in Dundalk, as well as that of Seamus Ludlow and the families of those killed in atrocities in Belturbet and elsewhere, all of whom the Government is fully committed to supporting in line with the programme for Government commitment and the three motions passed unanimously by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  I was clear with the Prime Minister that every family bereaved in the conflict should have access to an effective investigation and a process of justice, regardless of the perpetrator.  The Stormont House Agreement framework allows for the crucial elements we need, namely, investigations, truth recovery, oral history, reconciliation and acknowledgement.  While the Government is ready to engage and work with the British Government and the Northern Ireland parties in regard to any concerns around the aspects of the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement, I made clear that this must be a collaborative and collective process.  I also made clear that unilateral action cannot be the basis of any sustainable way forward.  We will continue to engage with the UK Government on this.</p>  <p>  We also discussed British-Irish relations.  We are both ambitious for the development of the next phase of the bilateral relationship, framed around a number of areas of common interest, including research and innovation, sport and tackling climate change.  We had a good exchange on the response to the Covid-19 pandemic and the value of working together.  The Prime Minister and I agreed to remain in close touch over the coming weeks.</p></reply>

I am very glad both he and Prime Minister Johnson committed to supporting all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.  The agreement must be implemented in all its aspects, with no cherry-picking of its provisions.  It is very important that the Taoiseach raised a number of atrocities that were committed, including, unfortunately, some in my constituency, namely, the Belturbet bombing and the Monaghan bombings, as well as the Dublin bombings.</p>  <p>  On many occasions in this House and in committees, I have repeated my call for a full, thorough and comprehensive investigation into the Belturbet bombing of December 1972.  That appalling atrocity resulted in the death of two young teenagers, Geraldine O'Reilly from Belturbet and Patrick Stanley from Clara, County Offaly.  Last September, the University of Nottingham provided information to me, through the work of Professor Edward Burke, which I put on the record of the House.  I am very glad the Minister, Deputy McEntee, referred that information to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for investigation.  The work done by the University of Nottingham, involving research into state papers in Britain, clearly shows there was collusion by state forces in Northern Ireland with the UVF and other paramilitaries, which resulted in a bomb being brought across the Border from County Fermanagh into Belturbet that cost the lives of two young people and caused injuries to many more.  Unfortunately, the perpetrators have never been brought to justice for that heinous crime.  We need a comprehensive investigation in Northern Ireland into the atrocity.  It happened nearly 50 years ago but it is never too late to get to the truth.  I have campaigned along with the O'Reilly and Stanley families, who have made their case with great dignity despite their terrible grieving for the loss of their young family members.  I am very glad the Taoiseach has raised this matter and I sincerely hope the information I put on the record of the House will be thoroughly investigated by the Northern Irish and British authorities.</p>  <p>  In regard to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, it is absolutely reprehensible that the British Government has not responded to the requests of this Parliament in July 2008, May 2011 and May 2016, when we, as a D&aacute;il, unanimously passed motions calling on the British Government to give access to an independent international legal person to all files and papers pertaining to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 17 May 1974.  The 47th anniversary of that desperate atrocity, when 33 people were killed and hundreds more injured, has just passed.  The Taoiseach will agree it is absolutely scandalous that the British Government has not responded to the unanimous calls from this sovereign Parliament on three occasions for Britain to co-operate in a meaningful way and advance the investigation into an atrocity that resulted in the greatest number of deaths in a single day during the era of the Troubles on this island.</p></speech>

Does he remain satisfied regarding the sincerity of the British Government in undertaking to ensure that the letter and spirit of the Northern protocol are accepted and implemented in full?  There are things happening on an ongoing basis that appear to undermine the protocol.  At the same time, the protocol seems to be blamed for any issue that has arisen when, in fact, Brexit is the real reason for those issues.  That was pointed out in the beginning to everybody involved.  Moreover, the British Government knew full well what the consequences would be before all this debate started.  At this stage, it should be mentioned again that the people of Northern Ireland did not vote for Brexit but are being forced to accept it.  The economy of Northern Ireland is being forced to accept the downside of Brexit just because it suited the British Government at the time.  Will the Taoiseach continue to impress upon his British colleagues the necessity to ensure that any agreement reached is honoured in full, with no exceptions?</p></speech>

He described it at the time as a constructive discussion.  However, things have deteriorated incredibly since then and there is deep concern across a whole range of issues.  Last Sunday, Mr. Johnson said he would do whatever it takes to protect the territorial integrity of the UK, as he recklessly wound up tensions over the Northern Ireland protocol.  Following on from that, we have had various loyalists saying they are coming to Dublin with their protests.  They are playing with fire, as I am sure the Taoiseach agrees.  One thing follows the other and there has been a deliberate stoking of the issue just as the power-sharing institutions at Stormont are at risk.</p>  <p>  This is a cyclical process and we have been here before.  Now, however, the situation seems to be more sinister and dangerous and the British are all but threatening to trigger Article 16 at the end of the month.  Can the Taoiseach give the House an honest assessment of where we are at in this regard?  Such a development would be potentially devastating to the peace process.  Has he any sense of what is being talked about in terms of the EU applying trade sanctions and tariffs, if that happens?  We hope it will not.  Has he spoken to Boris Johnson since the weekend and, if not, does he intend to do so?  The next month or month and a half is going to be incredibly tense.</p></speech>

When I raised this issue in the House three weeks ago, we had 70 cases of the Delta variant here and now we have 130-plus cases.  There is a real danger of it getting out of control.  The variant presents a real danger to people's health, to their lives and to our ability to reopen society, provided it manages to beat us as we race to get people fully vaccinated.  This is because it is 50% more transmissible and because one dose of the either the AstraZeneca or the Pfizer vaccine is not very effective against the Delta variant.</p> <p> We need to take action now before it is too late, before the spread of this variant means that we cannot reopen and before it impacts on people's health and lives.  The question is whether the Taoiseach accepts that what he is talking about with respect to extending at-home quarantine does not cut it.  Many people cannot quarantine at home.  There is also no supervisory mechanism.  Will he move to introduce mandatory hotel quarantine for a period of a couple of months to allow us to stay ahead of the Delta variant?  Will he act to reduce the time between doses for people in the older and more vulnerable categories so they are not vulnerable to this variant?</p></speech>

The seventh meeting of the EU-UK joint committee took place recently.  It was Lord David Frost's first meeting as co-chair since he replaced Michael Gove, MP.  This change in personnel does not appear to have had any material impact on the British Government's approach to the work of the joint committee.  From the comments of the European Commission Vice President, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič, following the meeting in question, it is clear that the EU's patience is running out and that further unilateral actions by the British Government are a real cause of concern.  In light of this, US President Joe Biden's intervention in support of the Irish protocol and the Good Friday Agreement must be welcomed.  Despite some of the vexatious public commentary on the flow of trade between the North and Britain, it is opinion of businesses and people in the North that operational challenges can be resolved for access to both the EU and British markets.  It is critical therefore that all stakeholders speak with a unified voice to the effect that any further unilateral action by the British Government cannot be tolerated.  It is our expectation that this is, and will continue to be, the clear message from the Taoiseach and his officials when engaging with their British counterparts.</p></speech>

Deputy Brendan Smith has been a very strong advocate for the Stanley and Reilly families for many years regarding the murder of their loved ones, Patrick and Geraldine, in the 1972 Belturbet bombing and also in respect of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  The information about the Nottingham University research which the Deputy referred to has been forwarded, as he said, to the Minister for Justice and may establish that there was collusion with the UVF in the context of that heinous crime.  We will continue to pursue those issues.  The key point is that the Stormont House Agreement provides us with mechanisms to deal with some of these cases but there must be political will on all fronts.  The British Government must also be clearer about providing access to its files.  The Irish Government has been open about any assertions of collusion in the Republic in respect of certain crimes and the Smithwick tribunal was an example of this.  We continue to be open-minded about co-operating with any allegations or assertions in that regard but equally the British Government and other parties must come forward as well, in the form of giving full access to information and to all the files and papers relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as Deputy Brendan Smith has articulated.  There must also a collective approach to legacy issues; there cannot be a unilateral one.</p>  <p>  On issue of the protocol, which was raised by Deputy Durkan and others, the key avenues for resolving this are the &Scaron;efčovič-Frost discussions, the joint committee, the mechanisms in place in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the withdrawal agreement and the protocol itself.  Where there is a will there is a way.  I have spoken to Vice President &Scaron;efčovič and I have met with the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State, Lord Frost.  The issues that are outstanding can without question be resolved if there is a will to resolve them and progress can be made.  It is important all sides go at this with a view to, as Deputy Kelly said, defusing tensions and doing the responsible and sensible thing here to deal with the trading aspects of this protocol.  The intervention by the American Administration last week, in making it clear that agreeing a sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, agreement would not impair the capacity of the UK to do a comprehensive trade deal with the US, is significant.  An SPS agreement was something the UK had advanced as being problematic.  An SPS agreement would potentially remove up to 80% of the issues that have arisen.  There are issues to be resolved, but I am convinced of Europe's bona fides in this regard and of its desire to have these issues resolved.</p>  <p>  I should say we are not at the stage of trade tariffs, sanctions or anything like that yet.  There needs to be serious engagement on the issues.  If there is serious engagement, progress will be made.  There is no doubt about that.  The issue is whether people want progress to be made and whether there is a political will to make progress.  The latter must be there on all sides.</p></speech>

The statement of strategy outlines the context and challenges ahead in pursuing this goal and is reflected in the six strategic priorities for the period ahead.  These are: support for me, as Taoiseach, and the Government; securing our future by tackling Covid-19, Brexit and climate action; restoring the economy, including an absolute focus on housing; building a better society; strengthening Ireland's place in Europe and the wider world; and building consensus on a shared island, North-South and east-west.</p>  <p>  The system of Cabinet committees has already been restructured to reflect these priorities to ensure that Government policy is well harmonised and responsive.  The statement of strategy has been developed with particular reference to the immediate challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit, but my Department will continue to be responsive to new and emerging challenges in the future.  In addition to its ongoing work, my Department will undertake new work streams including the new shared island unit, the Future of Media Commission and developing social dialogue.  It will also ensure the collective work on housing and climate action is prioritised right across all Departments.</p>  <p>  My Department's annual report for 2020 will be finalised and published in the coming weeks and will set out the work of my Department last year, much of which involved supporting the whole-of-government response to the Covid-19 pandemic.  Over the past year, officials in my Department have been working night and day on matters related to the pandemic and pulling together the different departmental strands of that, ensuring a collective Government response.  I pay tribute to all the senior officials in the Department of the Taoiseach for the extraordinary effort that has been required from the outset of the pandemic right up to today.  It has been out of the ordinary in terms of the normal duties civil servants have had to attend to.  It has been extraordinary work and speaks well of our public service more generally.  The same applies to many other Departments.</p></reply>

I want to refer to two very different issues.  The first is something that has been raised continually in the House, namely, aviation.  We all know the issues relating to Stobart Air and the loss of 480 jobs, the regional connectivity and the public service obligation, PSO, which I believe will be brought back.  There is the issue relating to Lufthansa Technik in Shannon, which is very close to my own area, and a range of other issues regarding aviation.</p> <p>We clearly need a plan.  The Minister for Transport this morning stated there would be a task force for Shannon but will the Taoiseach elaborate on what that will be?  Sometimes task forces work and sometimes they do not.  I was part of one that worked and I have seen others implemented by various Governments, including those of which I was a part, that may not have achieved as much as desired.  The position of chair of Shannon Airport is still vacant.  We need a longer-term plan for Shannon, perhaps up to 20 years.  Some Government must be brave enough to deal with Foynes, Shannon Airport and the entire area in one go.</p> <p> With regard to the cyberattack on the HSE, there are two reports, with one commissioned by the board and another from an international agency.  When will we have sight of those?  We will need to look at them to consider what we must do when we progress our infrastructure for healthcare.</p></speech>

One of the groups - I have raised this repeatedly with the Taoiseach - with a very uncertain future which has seen a massive and continuing adverse effect from Covid-19 is taxi drivers.  After the Minister for Transport's announcement of a so-called package of support last week, taxi drivers wrote to the Taoiseach again to express their extraordinary disappointment at the failure of the Government to meet any of the demands they made.  They made five very simple demands to save the taxi industry and their livelihoods.  These included a financial package to cover ongoing costs, a moratorium on future licences and, critically, an extension of the requirement to replace a vehicle after nine years to approximately 15 years, given the loss of income and major debts taxi drivers would have to incur in a very uncertain position if they had to finance new vehicles.  There were also requests to disband the taxi advisory committee, which the group feels is unrepresentative of taxi drivers, and the provision of access to bus corridors.  None of those demands was met.</p>  <p>  When the Taoiseach met representatives of the four taxi groups that organised the recent protest, he said he would get back to them about their demands but he did not do it.  There was an announcement but there was no response from the Taoiseach and none of the demands was met.  It is really not acceptable.</p></speech>

Five years of delay meant the Debenhams workers were left without legal protection when their company did the same to them.  The promise was always that the Government would eventually take action.</p>  <p>  Last week, the Government announced what it would do about the key recommendations of the Duffy Cahill report, namely, absolutely nothing.  The key demand of workers from Clerys, Debenhams and elsewhere - that their collective redundancy agreements would be honoured in a liquidation process - has been rejected by the Ministers of State, Deputies Robert Troy and Damien English.  The Duffy Cahill report recommended that companies that failed to provide proper consultation before liquidation should face serious sanctions of up to two years' of pay but the Ministers of State, Deputies Troy and English, want to overrule that recommendation and continue with a greatly reduced four-week sanction, which amounts to a mere slap on the wrist.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions called for Labour Court awards to be given preference in winding up and that has also been rejected, as has the proposal that directors of companies who break workers' rights be restricted from simply moving on to other company directorships.</p>  <p>  How can the Taoiseach stand over this whitewash of the report from his Ministers of State?  Instead of pushing through with this betrayal of workers from Clerys and Debenhams, will he intervene now to ensure the Duffy Cahill proposals are implemented in full to protect workers?</p></speech>

I am sure the process has been very challenging.  Where in the name of God did the general scheme of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na powers Bill, published on Monday by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Heather Humphreys, come from?  It was described by one legal academic as a land grab by the Department of Justice and having read the information about it, I must agree, particularly in light of recent and historical controversies that we have raised here.  It is unacceptable when we think of the cases of Dara Quigley, George Nkencho and Terence Wheelock.</p>  <p>  We know emergency powers have been used overwhelmingly in working class areas and against young people and there is every chance these new powers will be used in the same way.  We also know there is an utter lack of accountability when it comes to Garda actions.  Some of the shocking details include the fact that search warrants could be issued by Garda superintendents, as opposed to judges.  This reminds me very much of the internment without trial period in Northern Ireland.  These powers go too far and are too sweeping.  We must ask where the Taoiseach or the Department of Justice believes the need for these powers comes from</p>  <p>  Where is the demand for such sweeping powers of the State and police control coming from?  We know this started with emergency powers given during the Covid-19 pandemic but will the Taoiseach give us the justification for these powers?  It is shocking that the Bill purports to allow a position where the presence of a lawyer at an interview would no longer be guaranteed.  The Taoiseach may as well ask Garda Commissioner Drew Harris to introduce internment without trial as pass this sort of legislation.</p></speech>

It has set out in clear terms the enhanced role of the State in protecting and sustaining society and building a fairer economy.  Many groups and individuals engaged in the assembly's work were alarmed by the Fine Gael Party's opinion of limiting consideration of the assembly's recommendations to the proposals that require constitutional change.  Establishing a special Oireachtas committee to only consider such matters would fly in the face and spirit of the work of the assembly.  In addition to the recommendations on the Constitution, the assembly's work has given clear guidance to the Government on policies and leadership; caregiving and childcare; domestic, sexual and gender-based violence; pay in the workplace; and social protection.  As Dr. Catherine Day has said, the recommendations agreed by the citizens do not just call for incremental change but big changes that can make Ireland better and a more gender-equal place to live for all of us with changes to the Constitution, new laws and policies and stronger enforcement.</p>  <p>  Many of these policies intersect so they cannot be considered or addressed in isolation from each other.  Does the Taoiseach share Fine Gael's view that the Oireachtas should limit its consideration to just constitutional recommendations and, if not, will he take responsibility for the implementation strategy that is so clearly needed to deliver gender equality for Ireland?</p></speech>

The Government is very clear about the importance of connectivity for our economy and society.  I have said repeatedly that we are a small, open economy and society.  Covid-19 has hit us hard.  We have provided a direction of travel, so to speak, for resuming travel in a structured way from 19 July, arising from our adoption of the European Union Covid certificate.  That gives an indication to airlines of where the country will position itself from approximately 19 July.</p>  <p>  Substantial supports have been given to the aviation sector.  Many Deputies are standing up to say the Government has neglected aviation and so on but approximately &euro;300 million in supports has been allocated to aviation.  That includes the employment wage subsidy scheme and a range of other income supports.  Additionally, capital funding has been provided to airports, with approximately &euro;80 million alone in 2021.  There has been &euro;21 million provided under the regional airports programme, as well as &euro;32 million for Cork and Shannon through a new one-year Covid-19 regional State airports programme.  There is a &euro;26 million state aid scheme to compensate airport operators for the losses caused by Covid-19 and the travel restrictions imposed by Ireland to limit its spread.  That scheme augments supports already in place and will help the industry to maintain connectivity and make a recovery from the impact of Covid-19.</p>  <p>  Aer Lingus has received very substantial liquidity supports in a loan through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund.</p> <p>The bulk of the support to airlines is through the wage subsidy schemes.  They were specifically designed to maintain the link between employers and employees.  Overall there has been very substantial support given to aviation but unfortunately, travel has been way down due to the impact of the pandemic.  This is just the reality.</p> <p> I am in agreement with Deputy on the Shannon Estuary task force and that it must be broadly based.  We want to ensure that the local development plans are developed to stimulate economic activity for those areas where we would expect economic developments arising, for example from fossil fuel infrastructure, but which is not taking place, but where other infrastructures can take place such as wind energy.  Offshore wind energy offers substantive opportunities in the Shannon Estuary area.  We believe that we need to take on board the wider regional agenda there with regard to economic development across transport, logistics, manufacturing, renewable energy and tourism, and to develop a strategy to achieve this potential with support from the Exchequer.  This is the context of the task force.  The T&aacute;naiste will make announcements on the personnel shortly.</p></speech>

Is this true?  If not, then perhaps the Taoiseach will tell us it is not.  These are so necessary and we in the Labour Party, including Senator Bacik and Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, have fought for these for many years.  We need to ensure we have a supply of such schools.  Why is there no plan and why are the targets and the roadmap for this not in place?</p><p>When does the Taoiseach expect to hold the citizen's assembly on education, and especially with regard to the role of religious orders in education?</p><p>The Labour Party has raised the issue of an autism empowerment strategy in the D&aacute;il numerous times, including with a motion, and in particular on the volume of autistic spectrum disorder, ASD, units in Dublin 2, 4, 6, 6W, and 12.  There have been lots of pledges.  Again, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Senator Bacik have written to patrons to ensure that pledges will be honoured and that there will be resources.  There seems, however, to be a lack of urgency.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that the Minister, as has been done quite rightly before, use emergency powers to ensure such ASD units are built in time?</p></speech>

I am no fan of the current leaving certificate model but it worries me gravely that we are moving backwards and not forward when it comes to compassion for students.  Compassionate leave was granted for the first time in 2019 to students who suffered a close family bereavement over the course of their written examinations.  I believe that this leave did not go far enough, as it extended only to three days' leave from examinations.  Almost 50 students availed of this leave in 2019.  Almost 50 students who could have lost a parent or a sibling on a Monday were expected to return for their examinations on the Thursday.  This is the most compassionate the leaving certificate has ever been but we have removed it for this year.  Tomorrow, if a student who is due to take the French paper takes ill or experiences an epileptic seizure or any medical emergency, there is no alternative arrangement in place for the student to take the examinations at a later date.  As the Taoiseach has said himself, the current system is too inflexible.  We have crossed the Rubicon in respect of the leaving certificate due to Covid.  I ask the Taoiseach that we introduce the bereavement leave as offered to students in 2019 and go far beyond what was offered by investigating the accredited grade model in order that a student who experiences exceptional circumstances at any point in his or her sixth year can avail of an accredited grade.</p></speech>

I have spoken repeatedly with the Taoiseach and with the Minister, Deputy Foley, about this issue over the past months.  Following on from what the previous speakers have said, I have a genuine concern about provision for ASD students nationwide.  I acknowledge that a lot of resources have been pumped in over the past 12 months but it also needs to be acknowledged that more children than ever before are getting diagnoses and assessments of need.  I am concerned that there are areas of this country and of our own county where the education provision for students with ASD is left to the devices of principals in schools.  The policy needs to change.  The Department of Education and the Government need to take this issue by the scruff of the neck so that where there is demand for provision of such educational services, they will be provided in any school that is publicly funded.  I do not believe this to be a major ask.  The Government needs to look at this.  There has been a dramatic increase in the number of ASD classes provided, even in the short time that we have been in government.  That said, the existing demand needs to be addressed.  The best way to do that is to do it from a Department point of view, where the Department makes the decisions on where the services are in demand.  I welcome the Taoiseach's comments on that.</p></speech>

We both have noted the hurt and anger this delay continues to cause the survivors of Creagh Lane National School in my constituency in Limerick and in many other places.  Deputy McDonald wrote to the Taoiseach and to the Minister two months ago on behalf of the Creagh Lane survivors and to date has received no response.  This is a scandal.  The survivors do not even know if they are included in the review system.  When Deputy McDonald raised this matter with the former Minister for Education in December 2019, he stated that the <i>ex gratia </i>scheme was being reviewed by his Department.  It would appear from questions asked of the current and previous Ministers that little progress has been made in the intervening period.  This is completely unacceptable.  It must be remembered that the only reason there is a scheme is down to the heroic efforts of Louise O'Keeffe, who was fought by the State at every turn in her campaign for justice.  Even then, the Government sought, wrongly, to limit its responsibility to many of the survivors.</p> <p>Almost two years have passed since the former Taoiseach publicly committed to reopening the <i>ex gratia</i>scheme.  Earlier this year, the current Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il that he is keen to see the review concluded.  People who were in Creagh Lane do not even know whether they are included.  Will the Taoiseach tell us the reasons for the protracted delays in the review and what actions will be taken to ensure its conclusion?</p></speech>

The latest in a long line of examples is St. Mary's Boys National School in Booterstown.  I met representatives from there this week.  They have made a request of the Department of Education for the acquisition of an existing building.  Nothing needs to be built.  It has a parish hall available to it for an ASD unit and for the additional school facilities it lacks.  There is an acknowledged need for a unit in the area but the Department of Education seems to be incapable of making a decision.  When I ask questions on the school's behalf I cannot get an answer.  Will the Taoiseach look into this?  This special needs provision is desperately required.</p>  <p>  This speaks to a larger problem.  Sallynoggin Educate Together National School has no temporary site for a school this September and no permanent site.  Gaelscoil Laighean is moving between one temporary site and another and is still uncertainty about a permanent site.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire Educate Together National School is moving from one temporary site to another.  For years, The Red Door School has been in a completely unsuitable temporary site.  Gaelscoil Phadraig in Ballybrack has been in a temporary site for years.  Does the Department understand the meaning of planning for schools that exist or for ASD units where there is an acknowledged need, and the urgent decision-making required to give people certainty about the provision of facilities and school buildings?</p></speech>

We could debate this.  The Taoiseach is using a very narrow definition of what is fair and unfair.  Yesterday, there was another story in <i>The Irish Times</i>on something that even in this narrow definition appears to be very unfair for a select group of students.  This is the fact that, according to the newspaper, significant numbers of leaving certificate students have ended up being marked down in their oral examinations this year, through no fault of their own, due to shortcomings in the way interviews were conducted, according to some examiners.  The newspaper states one examiner for the German orals marked 78 candidates and estimated that a majority lost marks due to omissions on the part of the teachers who conducted the interviews.  The examiner stated that to penalise students for no fault of their own is not fair nor is it candidate-centred.  This is absolutely correct.  The idea any student should be penalised as a result of mistakes made by the person doing the interviewing is absolutely horrendous.  Will the Taoiseach tell us how many students have been affected by this?  Will he confirm there will not be a cover-up of this?  The newspaper story seems to suggest there was some attempt at a cover-up.  Will the Taoiseach please give a commitment to those students affected that no one will lose out due to mistakes, which presumably were genuine mistakes, made by the interviewers and that the students will not pay the price for them?</p></speech>

The Taoiseach may not be familiar with the independent review group in Ratoath College in County Meath, which is shining a light on the problems emerging with a policy that has no uniformity and no structure across the board to deal with technology and the provision of iPads and other digital equipment for students.  The independent review group's report shows that in this situation the question of digital poverty and device inequality looms large.  There are many cases where parents and teachers struggle to pay for devices for post-primary children need in order to learn.  If we want to move to a system that is now commonplace throughout Europe we need some uniformity across the education structure.  Whether it is access to the Internet inside or outside school is a separate debate.  What type of technology we use is also a separate debate.  The point is whether the Department is about to fund the provision of technological devices for post-primary schools so that no child is left behind and everybody is treated the same.  The report looks at the school prior to Covid and during Covid.  It shines a light on the problems and, of course, these problems intensified during the pandemic and lockdown.  Will the Taoiseach comment on this?  Would he care to highlight the glaring gap in poverty, digital poverty and digital inequality that exists throughout secondary education?</p></speech>

That was without a plan at all and had to do with the amalgamation of existing buildings.  Be that as it may, I am very committed to the provision of multidenominational schools.  When I was Minister for Education and Science in the late 1990s, I was responsible for the first breakthrough in taking away the contribution that had to be made up until then.  It was impossible for new schools and new patrons to finance new buildings and purchase land.  The demographics and the locations dictate.  We now go out to communities to invite them, through plebiscites, to decide what form of school patron or school they want and they vote accordingly.  Progress is being made in respect of this.</p>  <p>  Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan and others raised the issue of autism and special needs more generally.  Approximately &euro;2 billion is now being spent on special needs education, which is 50% more than in 2011.  There is huge provision of special needs assistants, with approximately 18,000 provided for in 2021 and they deal with well over 40,000 students.  No school will suffer a reduction in its allocation for the school year 2021 to 2022 and this is an important point.  As Deputies know, we have thousands of other provisions in special education.</p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan's point, I am anxious to ensure that there is a more structured approach to ensuring that there are places in given areas for students so that well parents will know well in advance that there is a place for their child the following September and will not have to go through the struggle of going from school to school trying to secure places for their children, which is unacceptable.  In this respect, we need to look more broadly at ownership and patronage more generally.  Very often, we go to certain providers who state they do not have any more capacity to add a school or a class or take extra places.  This is not good enough any more, particularly when the State has to fulfil a constitutional obligation to make sure children have access to education.  A special needs child has an equal right to access education as children in mainstream situations and I am very clear about this.  There may be an increased role for education and training boards where there are gaps and where people do not come forward quickly and speedily in order that the State enters quickly and speedily and provides additional places, builds schools and gets on with it.  We had a meeting of the Cabinet sub-committee, to which Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan and others alluded, to examine the legislation.  The legislation in place was introduced some years ago.</p></speech>

When I was Minister for Education and Science 20 years ago, I tried to introduce an alternative approach for someone who suffers an appalling bereavement or trauma in the middle of the leaving certificate examination.  To be fair, at the time the view of the examinations section was it could undermine broader marking schemes.  It was considering this with a view towards fairness.  That said, unfortunately, some people suffer a terrible trauma and students are expected to go through exams in the middle or aftermath of such a trauma.  There is a big legitimate issue and I will ask the Minister for Education to look at it again not just with regard to 2019 but more broadly given the experiences we have had during Covid.</p> <p>In response to Deputy P&aacute;draig O'Sullivan regarding special needs and genuine ASD needs and provision, and Deputy Quinlivan in terms of the review, I have been in touch with the Minister for Education in relation to that and I am pursuing that.  I myself have been involved in that for quite some time and I am anxious that that review would come to a conclusion.  The Minister will be back to me, hopefully, within a short time.</p> <p> Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned some individual specific schools which I can relate back to the Department.  I do not have the operational details on specific schools.</p> <p> In response to Deputy Paul Murphy, I am not aware of that given situation in terms of examiners and the assertions the Deputy made.  I am sure the Department will respond to those assertions and we will seek replies on those.</p> <p> In terms of technology in post-primary schools, for many years Governments have been supporting technology in post-primary schools.  The latest economic recovery plan - we have applied to Europe for substantial funding for a recovery and resilience plan - involves very substantial investment in technology in schools of up to &euro;60 million, if I am not mistaken.  That would take a variety of forms in terms of both increased connectivity for schools and the deployment of technology devices etc.</p> <p> In fairness, there has always been a policy to discriminate in favour of Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, schools or schools where there are considerable socioeconomic disadvantage.</p></speech>

I suppose it behoves the Government to make noise about certain Bills and to hope that others will slip under the radar of experts and activists.  This is a really important Bill.  It aims to consolidate our maritime jurisdiction legislation and provide for updates relating to recent international law developments.  The reason I think there should be more interest in this Bill is because it is part of a suite of legislation and frameworks that are looking at our maritime areas.  We have a national marine planning framework and are expecting the maritime area planning Bill and yet our marine protected areas have not even been designated.  I welcome the Irish Wildlife Trust's initiative of holding town hall meetings around the country on marine protected areas, MPAs.</p><p>We cannot discuss maritime legislation and international law without mentioning fishing and our relationship with the EU on it.  They have taken over &euro;120 billion worth of fish that we gave the EU up to 2000.  Ireland allowed members of the European Union to take this huge amount of fish out of our waters.  In my submission to the seafood sector task force earlier this year, I stated that the Government must ensure that our seafood sector receives its fair share of the quotas available to EU member states.  It is well beyond time that the wrongs that were done to our fishing industry as we negotiated to join the EU were corrected.</p><p>I have consistently reminded the Government that our negotiations on fishing were taken away from us, Denmark and the UK in the first days of the then EEC.  This had the impact of directly hampering the west of Ireland's development and led, I believe, to Dublin-focused development within Ireland that has hampered and hindered the development of the entire country since we joined the EU.  Any promotion of a fleet tie-up scheme will be a direct recognition that the future of the fishing communities within Ireland is not a priority for the Government and will confirm and show that the Government is intent on the decline and ending of those communities.</p><p>I note the contribution of Senator Higgins on this Bill in the Seanad earlier this month.  I was also liaising with some NGO representatives who raised concerns about the constitutionality of certain parts of the Bill.  There are concerns about the provisions on orders, and the approach to the continental shelf on the basis of designated areas within the discretion of the Government alone.</p><p>This Bill will provide for Ireland's maritime zones in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, UNCLOS, which was adopted in 1982.  This means that UNCLOS predates much EU environmental legislation, as well as significant developments which have taken place since then in international spheres.  The Government is deciding to blindly adhere to UNCLOS and not reconciling or resolving some of the maritime jurisdiction issues for various areas, for example, the EU nature directives.</p><p>Unfortunately, we do not have a great track record at implementing protections required under both the birds and habitats directives in the territorial sea never mind those in the contiguous zone, in the exclusive economic zone, EEZ, or on the continental shelf.  This Bill should at least provide for handling offences under these directives, and potentially as set out in the environmental crime directive.</p><p>There are concerns about the UK's exit from the European Atomic Energy Community, Euratom, and the movements of nuclear materials in and out of the UK and concerns on undersea development of radioactive waste facilities.  How lines get drawn, what we consider as an installation and the vagueness of the term, &quot;in the vicinity of&quot;, are all worrying aspects of the Bill.</p><p>There are also significant jurisdictional issues around the Loughs Agency, issues exacerbated by Brexit, as well as concerns around the upholding of our interests in Rockall.  The Maritime Jurisdiction Bill 2021 makes no provision for Rockall despite there still being disputes between Ireland and Scotland around fishing rights in that area.  Because Rockall is uninhabitable, it has no entitlement to a continental shelf or exclusive economic zone.</p><p>This Bill repeals sections 2(1) and 3(2) of the Continental Shelf Act 1968 and Part 3 of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  The outer limits of the exclusive economic zone are defined in the Bill as lying 200 nautical miles from the nearest baseline point.  There are 33 sections in the Bill, six parts and two schedules.  Schedule 1 sets out the text of Parts II, V and VI of UNCLOS.</p><p>In 2014, a single maritime boundary with the UK was agreed but since then there has been strategic use of marine zones around carbon sequestration and submarine cables for energy transmission and, therefore, legislation was required for definitions.</p><p>There has been no public consultation around maritime jurisdiction and pre-legislative scrutiny was waived by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.  Ireland negotiated the sustainable development goals, one of which is &quot;life below water&quot;.  Sustainable development goal 14 set out goals for 2020 and 2025, with targets to have certain achievements by 2030.  Therefore, there are a number of goals that we signed up to but have already missed.</p><p>Recently, I asked the Minister for Defence if a ship, the destroyer <i>USS Paul Ignatius</i>, DDG-117, was in Irish waters on 13 and 14 May 2021.  I asked whether the vessel had permission to pass through Irish waters; and if so, the distance it passed off the west coast at the time.  The reply to the parliamentary question stated:</p> <blockquote> 	With regard to Ireland's EEZ, it is not unusual for naval ships or vessels of other States to carry out training exercises within this area or to passage through this area.<br /><br />This would normally involve prior notification to Irish Authorities where an exercise was taking place close to our Territorial Waters but this is not a requirement.  In the case of the USS Paul Ignatius the US authorities did inform Irish Authorities of their presence in the region in advance and I welcome this engagement by our US colleagues.<br /><br />The location of the US destroyer was within the Irish EEZ, however the ship did not enter into Irish territorial waters.  Other State's naval ships or vessels would be within their rights to carry out a training exercise in our EEZ or to traverse the Irish EEZ.  This is not in any way an infringement of our national territory. </blockquote>  <p>I hope that the Minister is open to amendments, especially given that he did not allow for pre-legislative scrutiny.  We have one of the largest sea-to-land ratios of any of the EU member states, at almost seven times our land mass.  This is significant legislation, as part of a significant move around maritime planning and development and we need to be thinking strategically about this.</p> <p>Why spend so much time talking about climate action and climate change while leaving our maritime jurisdiction as an afterthought?  We need to examine the Bill closely.</p></speech>

I always complain that we do not have enough time, but I certainly have enough time now.  I will discuss the Bill itself before turning to my serious concerns about it and the manner in which the trinity of it, the framework and the forthcoming planning Bill are being handled.</p><p>I thank the Library and Research Service.  I also thank the Minister's office for its briefing, which was helpful.</p><p>The Bill's purpose is to update the State's maritime jurisdiction law to reflect developments in international law and practice as well as relevant developments in Irish law.  This is important.  Along with updating the law to reflect those national and international changes, the Bill will consolidate in a stand-alone enactment the State's maritime jurisdiction law for the first time.  This is significant, positive and good.  Legislation in many other areas should also be consolidated.</p><p>The background to the Bill is important.  I will speak about the legal background before discussing our climate change obligations and our dumping at sea.  The Maritime Jurisdiction Act 1959 sets out the definitions of various territorial limits and boundaries, including for sea fisheries.  The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, UNCLOS, was adopted in 1982.  I do not quite understand something in that regard, although I understand that the convention defines the agreed parameters of near and far shore limits and the means for changes to territorial limits to be evidenced and agreed among nations.  This Bill sets out to provide the primary legislation in recognition of that international treaty.  My colleague mentioned this matter and I will revert to it.  The convention was adopted in 1982, we deposited the relevant document on 21 June 1996 and the convention entered into force on 21 July 1996, yet here we are in the 21st century, having declared a climate emergency and a biodiversity emergency, and we are using language from 1982.  The word &quot;exploitation&quot; is repeated throughout UNCLOS and the Bill.  I am concerned about this.  I do not know why the word is included or why it took so long in the first place to introduce primary legislation relating to UNCLOS, but now that we are introducing such legislation with no explanation for the delay, we are using language that is outdated and out of keeping with our climate change obligations.</p><p>Since 1982, a number of amendments regarding the State's maritime jurisdiction have been made.  The first amendments were to the Continental Shelf Act 1968, which was the first Act to define Ireland's maritime territorial limits.  We are now informed that those limits are outdated but, interestingly, the language is not.  The Bill will repeal and replace sections 2 and 3 of that Act.  It will also amend Part 3 of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006, which contains definitions of fishery limits and maritime and territorial zones and limits, because it is outdated.</p><p>The Bill, which was initiated in May, is described as a technical Bill.  That is an interesting use of language, given the considerable implications that the Bill has for climate change, the sustainable use of our seas and making reality of the language we are using.  We can never go back to pre-Covid times.  We must have a fundamental transformation of society.  However, what should be a wonderful opportunity to make use of that language in the relevant provisions of the Bill and to recognise what our oceans are and what we should use them for sustainably is missing.</p><p>The Bill has 33 sections across six Parts and two Schedules.  Importantly, it provides for definitions of the State's internal waters and territorial seas and provides a means of establishing boundaries and zones in the territorial seas in accordance with UNCLOS.  The Bill includes terms that some of us are now more familiar with than we would like to be - &quot;baseline&quot;, &quot;contiguous zones&quot;, &quot;exclusive economic zones&quot; and &quot;the outer limits&quot;.  Specifically, Part 2 contains definitions and provides for prosecution of offences on foreign as well as Irish ships.  I will not go through the rest of the Bill because it was set out repeatedly by the Minister of State in what was a good opening statement on a practical level.</p><p>I wish to return to the definition of the Bill as a technical Bill.  The Library and Research Service's Bill digest tells us that the definitions in the Bill have significance for natural resources.  When we were growing up, we were told in school that Ireland had no natural resources.  That was our background.  The digest also tells us that the Bill has significance for marine development, potential energy, including geothermal, the submarine storage of natural gas, carbon sequestration, fishery limits and submarine cables.  I imagine that this is not an exclusive list.  What the digest tells us is the only reference that I can see that gives us an inkling of what this Bill, the framework and the future planning Bill will cover.</p><p>We are now putting the UNCLOS into law, but I have serious concerns in this regard.  When I read section 14 of the Bill, I thought that the term &quot;exploitation ... of the natural resources&quot; was inappropriate.  It was pointed out to me by someone who works hard in my office that the Bill is replete with the word &quot;exploitation&quot;.  The reference to &quot;the protection and preservation of the marine environment&quot; comes way down the list and is not repeated in the manner that &quot;exploitation&quot; is.</p><p>As my colleague, Deputy Pringle, stated, there was no pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill.  It is the second time that we want to support the Government and participate in positive legislation but are not being given that option.  It is essential that there be pre-legislative scrutiny.  Post Covid, post Brexit and post our declarations of a climate crisis and a biodiversity crisis, we have to begin doing things differently.  The first step is proper scrutiny by a committee of the implications of this &quot;technical&quot; Bill, which is far from technical.  If we are to learn anything, it is that we must change how we are doing things.  We should start with that transformation.</p><p>I do not like the word &quot;demonised&quot;, but we have been accused repeatedly of being negative and trying to paralyse development.  The Taoiseach said that.  None of us wants to paralyse development.  Rather, we want sustainable development so that we will get out of the climate crisis.</p><p>Let us consider what people have said, for example, Sir David Attenborough, who recently told the G7 leaders that the world was within ten years of reaching dangerous tipping points.  He stated:</p> <blockquote> 	We are now on the verge of passing tipping points, boundaries that once passed will unleash irreversible and self-amplifying change.  Then all the innovation wealth and political will in the world will not be enough to save our civilisations. </blockquote>  <p>He also stated that our natural world would change from being &quot;our greatest ally to our biggest foe&quot; and accelerate global warming.  The G7, not known for its radicalism, stated: &quot;the unprecedented and interdependent crises of climate change and biodiversity loss pose an existential threat to people, prosperity, security and [the planet]&quot;.  This was not the radical left talking about the planet, but the G7.  These countries said that 2021 could be a turning point.  I would like to tell young people in our country that 2021 and 2022 will be a turning point in the way we do business.  I turn to this legislation, which is described as a technical Bill, and I look for transformation, a change in spirit and a change in leadership that views our oceans and seas as belonging not just to Ireland, but to all of the world, given that we are all interconnected, and determines whether we use sustainable words about how we need to bring life back to our oceans and seas, but I see none of that.  There is no commitment to the UN's 17 sustainable development goals, No. 14 of which commits to life below water.  These goals were passed in 2015 and we are supposed to have fulfilled our obligations under them, including banning poverty, by 2030.</p> <p>We are eternally grateful to the non-governmental organisations, NGOs, on the ground for filling in the gaps in our knowledge, which should have been filled by the briefing document.  It was not a bad briefing document but it was not comprehensive or complete.  We find out from the NGOs that we do not have any marine protected areas.  Will we address that at some stage in the future?<br/><br/>We see the plastic.  I will quote the foreword to a document from a non-governmental organisation, the Minderoo Foundation, which was written by a former American Vice President, Al Gore.  We like to praise some American Presidents, do we not?  The current US President is our friend and I presume the Government thinks Al Gore was our friend.  What does he say in his introduction to this document?  He states:</p><blockquote>	The trajectories of the climate crisis and the plastic waste crisis are strikingly similar &ndash; and increasingly intertwined. For generations, we&rsquo;ve treated our atmosphere like an open sewer, constantly pumping massive amounts of greenhouse gas emissions into the air each day. Similarly, we are treating the ocean like a liquid landfill [we are talking about the ocean and seas here] left to accumulate at least eight million metric tons of plastic waste each year.  </blockquote> <p>Where is the plastic coming from?  Twenty companies produce 55% of the once-off plastic and 100 companies produce more than 90% of the plastic.  There is no mention of anything such as that.  To go local, let us look at wind farms.  I am fully in favour of recyclable goods.  I am on record as saying we need to take drastic action on climate change.  However, we are putting up wind farms on land and in sea without any consultation with communities and without a return for or ownership by communities in order that profits would go back to them.  Instead, once again, as the T&aacute;naiste put it, the economy will take off like a rocket, which tells me we have learned absolutely nothing.  This Bill, described as a technical Bill, is anything but and it should be a golden opportunity to bring the transformative action we need.</p></speech>

The case of the national marine planning framework was extraordinary because many years of work went into its preparation, yet Government members of the Oireachtas committee voted to push it through without further scrutiny.  Environmental NGOs and inshore fishermen wanted to have their say on the final plan being submitted to Europe, which was an entirely reasonable position, but the framework was just pushed through.  We were told it was urgent but it was several weeks before it was voted through the D&aacute;il.  There was plenty of time for further scrutiny but the Government decided to rush it through.</p>  <p>  Similarly, there is a sense that this legislation is being pushed through without proper scrutiny.  I have spoken to interests in the fishing community and environmental NGOs, which are seriously concerned this legislation will come through, I assume by next week, without their having had their say before a committee to which they can make structured submissions.  Sinn F&eacute;in will submit a range of amendments based on our consultation with those different interests.  In the area of environmental concerns, we will introduce a range of amendments seeking clarification on the parameters and powers of the State, but also seeking to make the State accountable.</p>  <p>  I will focus on a couple of areas in particular and talk about Rockall.  In 2013-14, the Government of the day signed an agreement that was not debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The agreement copper-fastened this State's acceptance of British control of the Rockall area.  We protest that an uninhabited island cannot have a 12-mile limit put around it.  However, fishermen from Donegal are being physically prevented from fishing in the 12-mile limit around Rockall.  Marine Scotland and the British navy has intervened and prevented them from fishing within that area.  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, has checked with these fishermen to make sure they are not fishing within that 12-mile limit.</p>  <p>  The Government states that, having made this agreement in 2013-14, it does not accept the 12-mile claim, yet here we are, after Brexit, dealing with just that issue.  Every time I submit a parliamentary question to the Minister, he tells me talks are ongoing.  It has been almost six months since Brexit and still our fishermen cannot fish within the 12-mile limit.  Remember, we have a historical claim going back hundreds of years.  Our connection with that territory goes back to Gaelic civilisation.  We had not claimed it and that was a mistake.  Our failure to challenge the British claim and instead to adhere to it in 1989 and 2013-14 was a huge mistake.</p>  <p>  In the amendments I will submit, I will clearly state that the 2013-14 agreement made between the British and Irish Governments is null and void because of Brexit.  Brexit changed everything.  The defence at that time was the were managed European waters that fell under the Common Fisheries Policy.  People asked what the issue was.  However, they are now UK territorial waters and the UK authorities are claiming a 12-mile limit of exclusive rights around the rock of Rockall.  This cannot stand.  What does the Government do?  It brings in legislation to copper-fasten that agreement.  It is remarkable.  It is copper-fastening the agreement, rather than making the case for why we should be standing up to an extremely arrogant claim.</p>  <p>  When I am on the subject of arrogance, a few short years ago, the British Secretary of State, in response to a parliamentary question, stated the UK claimed the entirety of Lough Foyle.  That is an extraordinary statement.  Normally, under international law, when a body of water borders two states, a line equidistant from either side is drawn down the middle.  That is international practice but it has not happened in the case of Lough Foyle.  One suspects the reason is that the shipping channel would then be on the Inishowen side of the lough and there would be an issue for British security interests.  That, I suspect, is why we have not sorted out this issue.  It is why we have thousands of unregulated oyster trestles on Lough Foyle.  People have a right to make a living from aquaculture and there is a place for that on Lough Foyle but it should be done in a managed, regulated way.  However, that is left unresolved due to this failure.</p>  <p>  My difficulty with this legislation is that while the idea of pulling together various pieces of legislation and putting them under one roof makes sense, many unresolved and live issues remain.  Sinn F&eacute;in has great difficulty with this legislation.  We will submit substantial numbers of amendments when it comes before the D&aacute;il on Committee Stage.  We will argue for those amendments and we hope the Minister will listen to us.  We hope he will be ambitious for Ireland and the State.  We hope he will listen to the concerns of environmental groups and our fishing communities and take the opportunity to rectify the errors.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister and the Government to give the following some thought.  The Government argues that the 2013-14 agreement merely regularises the previous 1988 agreement and what preceded it, and agrees the continental shelf and the exclusive economic zone of both states.</p> <p>The problem is that it was done in the context of the Common Fisheries Policy, and Brexit rules that agreement null and void.  It is an act of bad faith which changes the context of the entire agreement and we have every right to withdraw from it.  The Government should take the chance our amendments present and consider making a claim for Rockall.  We should challenge the British claim to it and defend the interests of our fishing communities.  God knows we have not taken enough opportunities to do that.</p></speech>

As was previously highlighted in the Seanad, there is some concern about Schedule 1 of the Bill, which interprets our role in governing our seas in a very restrictive manner.  Regarding the sovereign rights of Ireland's maritime jurisdiction, there are a number of criteria to which the State must have regard under this legislation.  The inclusion of exploitation and conservation of natural resources in this Bill, but not the restoration of our maritime natural resources, is an oversight that could have serious consequences for the future of our marine ecosystems.  So much of our marine environment and biodiversity is already damaged, if not destroyed, and including restoration in the Bill would go some way towards acknowledging the work we still need to do.  While conservation is necessary it will not go far enough in protecting our waters.  Including restoration would also be appropriate given our obligations under EU environmental law pertaining to marine habitats, species and ecosystems, as well as other international conventions to which Ireland is a party and in which it has been involved since UNCLOS.</p>  <p>  Most people think of the atmosphere as being at the front line of climate change when, really, it is our marine waters that are at the coalface when it comes to our warming planet.  The capacity of our waters and the marine life within them to absorb carbon dioxide is dwindling as a consequence of our damaging activities, and so are our chances of recovering our most vast and important lifeline.  The oceans are our life support machine.  They uphold life on this planet and provide 50% of the oxygen we breathe, most of which comes from phytoplankton.  However, phytoplankton populations have dropped by 40% since the 1950s so we are already on a path towards maritime destruction, which will have tremendous consequences for us.  Our seas and oceans are under huge pressure from the combined impact of climate change, acidification, shipping, economic exploitation, fossil fuel exploration, sonar activity and seismic surveys.  Since Ireland was declared a dolphin sanctuary in 1991, cetacean strandings - that is, strandings of whales and dolphins - have increased by 350%.  Increasingly, the effects of offshore oil and gas exploration practices are being linked to these events and to marine biodiversity continuing to experience serious pressure.</p>  <p>  At present, only 2.4% of Irish waters are designated as marine protected areas, which is the second lowest level in the EU.  That is despite Ireland agreeing to designate 10% as protected areas by 2020 and 30% by 2030 under the EU biodiversity strategy.  The Government must raise the level of ambition and immediately ratchet up the designation process.  That must be accompanied by better marine regulation, including around seismic activity, which can disrupt sonar or migration patterns.  We also need strong interim measures on a precautionary basis, pending the delivery of a fully defined and properly specified marine park network.  It is simply not good enough to say that we will get there by 2030.  Our high water-to-land ratio also presents us with a golden opportunity to showcase how we should manage and protect our marine waters and biodiversity.  Why not meet that sense of urgency and take this challenge on board to demonstrate to Europe the importance of our waters, key species such as cetaceans and habitats such as seagrass in pursuit of climate action?</p>  <p>  As the Minister of State knows, I recently introduced my first Bill to the House by means of which I am seeking protection of basking sharks under the Wildlife Act.  They are endangered and at very high risk of extinction in the wild and should be afforded the same protections we afford whales and dolphins under the Wildlife Act.  They have been a protected species in UK waters since 1998 but, despite their endangered status, they are still not a protected species under our own national marine conservation legislation.  Apart from seeking support from the Government to progress my basking shark Bill, we have an opportunity in the Bill before us to address the restoration of that species and others by identifying living species as something against which offences may be committed and to which appropriate legal protection can be given, making it an offence for a person in an exclusive economic zone to economically exploit or explore the non-living natural resources of that zone.  In the Seanad, the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, indicated that he would consider some of these matters when the Bill moved to the D&aacute;il, including the ease with which offences can be addressed where breaches of nature laws are involved.  I would like him to clarify his comments on nature reserves under the Wildlife Act, particularly as there was some confusion about what was being proposed.  I ask that the Minister of State engage with the Parliamentary Counsel to see if protections for marine biodiversity can be included in this Bill and to ensure that it is future-proofed to incorporate future conventions relating to marine conservation coming down the line.  I hope to bring forward amendments to that effect.</p>  <p>  When I began my career, which was a long time ago now, it was after I had grown up in a marine household.  My neighbours worked for the Marine Institute and would often bring me samples to look at under the microscope in my bedroom.  The marine area has been an important part of my life growing up, as well as that of my family and community.  We have a very long history and culture in connection with the marine, but we have never actually protected to the full extent necessary.  We now have an opportunity - and I do see the biodiversity and climate crisis as an opportunity - to rethink our engagement with our environment, the marine and our terrestrial areas, and to re-envisage how we are going to live and what our connections to nature will be.  We have lost our cultural and natural connections with much of our environment and that is a large part of the problem.  We should use the next number of years to reassert those connections, demonstrate their importance to our communities and listen to what our communities want to happen.  We must work to make Ireland a much better place that is more respectful of the natural sphere in which we live because we have not been respectful of it so far.  We have only seen it as something to make use of from an economic perspective.  We need to be ambitious in this regard because we are not just talking about our relationship with the marine and our environment but about future generations' relationships with them as well.</p>  <p>  I ask that the Minister of State take these suggestions and comments on board, as well as those of my colleagues.  There was a great deal of discussion on the issues that have been raised in the Seanad.  I ask him to look at how we can strengthen this Bill and make sure we do as much as we possibly can to protect future generations.</p></speech>

I take this opportunity to raise the general issues that fishermen are experiencing.  It is important that those issues are highlighted.  I do not know what is wrong with the Government.  It is so blas&eacute; and careless that it has not had any public consultation on this Bill whatsoever, no pre-legislative scrutiny and no regulatory impact analysis.  Is this government by diktat?  Have the Government's emergency powers gone to its head or is it just sheer laziness?  Is it a matter of disrespect for the House or are there just not enough officials in the Department?</p> <p>This is mad stuff, and either the Minister of State or the Minister, who I acknowledge is in negotiations on the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, at present, needs to explain it.  This is no way to treat the House.  I heard Deputy Connolly speaking earlier about this Bill earlier and her understanding of it is far greater than mine.  This is no way to treat the Oireachtas, the House and the people who elected us.  We might as well close this House and let the NGOs and some other people run the show altogether, because that is what seems to be happening anyway.  I cannot believe there has been no pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill and no public consultation.  The public does not matter.  More importantly, no regulatory impact analysis accompanies this Bill.  <br/><br/>This Bill was initiated in May 2021 and its purpose is to revise and consolidate relevant maritime jurisdiction laws to provide for the State's maritime zones in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which was adopted in 1982.  The Bill provides for the repeal of sections of legislation dealing with the definitions of maritime territories, particularly sections 2 and 3.  Articles of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea from Parts II, V and VI are reproduced in Schedule 1 to the Bill.  <br/><br/>Regarding the policy background and the legislative context, the Maritime Jurisdiction Act 1959 set out definitions of the various territorial limits and boundaries, including for sea fisheries.  Several amendments regarding the State's maritime jurisdiction have been made since then in the Continental Shelf Act 1968 and the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  As they preceded my time as a Deputy, I do not know if there was pre-legislative scrutiny or impact analysis.  I cannot comment on that.  However, I can comment and must take responsibility for my role in this Oireachtas and the legislation that we pass now and I am simply appalled.  <br/><br/>As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is aware, I am on the Business Committee and we get requests nearly every week to waive pre-legislative scrutiny for one Bill or another.  That is a dangerous pattern, because it means there will be no role for a committee to examine a Bill in detail, undertake proper research, understand the legislation, ask questions and make amendments.  The purpose of the Bill is to update and set out in one stand-alone enacting law regarding the State's maritime jurisdiction, including by giving further effect to relevant provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and repealing sections 2 and 3 of the Continental Shelf Act 1968 and Part 3 of the Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.  The Bill contains 33 sections across six parts, so it is obviously hefty and extensive legislation.  It covers a vast area and we must have some scrutiny and understanding of its potential impact on people.  <br/><br/>Turning to the topic of Rockall, we have never really claimed it.  While we have given some reasons for not doing so, I believe it is important that we should claim it.  Rockall is a small, uninhabitable granite rock which is located approximately 160 nautical miles west of the Scottish islands of St. Kilda and 230 nautical miles to the north-west of Donegal.  It measures just 30 m wide and is only 21 m above the sea.  This Bill has no direct implications regarding Ireland's claim to Rockall, but it is discussed.  Given there has been no engagement on this issue in recent years, we certainly must exert our rights as a small sovereign nation and embrace this matter.  We have not really claimed sovereignty over Rockall but this position is in accordance with the UNCLOS.  As an uninhabitable rock, Rockall has no significance in establishing claims to either the continental shelf or exclusive economic zones.  <br/><br/>However, in replies to parliamentary questions on 25 June 2019 and 26 November 2020 on the progress made in having the international community, including the European Union and the United Nations, recognise Ireland's sovereignty over Rockall, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, replied:</p><blockquote>	The UK claimed sovereignty over Rockall in 1955 and purported to annex it under its 1972 Island of Rockall Act.<br /><br />While Ireland has never recognised British sovereignty [nor should we] over Rockall, neither have we ever sought to claim sovereignty ourselves.  </blockquote> <p>There is a dichotomy there and a lacuna.  Why have we not done that?  I believe we must claim sovereignty.  The Minister continued his reply by stating &quot;The consistent position of successive Irish Governments has been that Rockall and similar rocks and skerries should have no significance for establishing legal claims to continental shelf or an exclusive economic zone.&quot;  I do not know why we do not make a claim.  I cannot understand it.  If we own Rockall and if it is ours, then we should be claiming sovereignty over it.  We should be resisting other nations trying to claim sovereignty because, goodness knows, they have enough already, and we had enough of a job for hundreds of years getting them out of this country.<br/><br/>Turning to the sea, the development of wave energy, the use of the sea and the role it plays in climate change, Members will be debating the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 tomorrow evening.  It has been rushed.  I do not know why we have not had proper public consultation regarding that Bill, proper time to debate it and proper engagement with the communities concerned, including our offshore communities.  I recently listened to contributions in this regard from Deputies Connolly and Boyd Barrett concerning some developers now moving to embrace opportunities at sea.  Those developers have scant regard for the sea, its amenities, fish stocks or any other life in the sea.  Instead, they are just bulldozing ahead as if they can do whatever they like out there, because it is not accessible for people to see what is going on.  That is not the way to develop our energy sources and sustainable solutions.  <br/><br/>Moving to the subject of plastics, I refer to the amount of that material in the sea and which is washed up after every tide.  I salute the volunteers on many strands and beaches who do great work in recovering waste material and in trying to save the bird and fish life from being choked with these plastics.  Masks are now a major issue as well because they are being dumped on the streets and they all end up in the rivers and then in the sea.  There must be protection in this regard.  On the matter of not protecting our valuable sea resources, we listen to the United Nations and I heard Deputy Connolly quoting the former Vice President of the United States, Al Gore, and others, in her contribution earlier.  We must, therefore, take heed and look after what is in the sea.  <br/><br/>Turning to fishermen and the incident in Cork raised by Deputy Michael Collins concerning an Irish boat being interfered with by a foreign trawler in our waters and the lack of response from the navy for several hours, that occurred because the navy has been run down to nothing.  I am not blaming the naval personnel.  I do not know the circumstances but to take that many hours to respond to that kind of a serious incident is quite shocking.  The fishermen must have some belief and safety in knowing that when they are out there at sea doing their legal day's work, and a fair day's work for a fair day's pay, which they are not getting any more, they will be protected and know that the navy can be called upon.  My goodness, if one of those fishermen misbehaved-----</p></speech>

I was just getting into top gear with the navy.  I do not know the name of the ship, but we have very few of them now and the navy also has fewer personnel.  I have no direct experience in this area, but I have learned a great deal from the experience of my colleague, Deputy Michael Collins.  He is one of the hardest working Deputies to ever come out of Cork South-West.  I refer to what he has done for the fishing sector.  I remember the day of the protests in Cork, when he left here to go down to those protests and then came back up here to resume his duties and to speak on behalf of those fishermen.  There was an attempt by the Taoiseach to belittle Deputy Michael Collins.</p> <p>He has not corrected the record of this House.  We have written to the Ceann Comhairle on the matter and are waiting for the Taoiseach to correct the record.  He suggested that Deputy Michael Collins was seeking personal favours from him but Deputy Collins never asked for such or looked for such and the Taoiseach needs to withdraw that suggestion.  Whether it was made in the heat of battle or in the crossfire, he should not be saying things that are totally without foundation.  He was being totally disingenuous towards a hard-working Deputy but the people of Cork South-West have recognised his hard work and put him back here.  </p> <p> The navy has been and is often quick to impound or board our own vessels in Ireland.  If there is any sign of a misdemeanour, the navy will board a vessel, impound it and bring it back to port and the skippers of same will face consequences.  We have a ridiculous legislative situation in the fishing industry that does not apply anywhere else.  If I get penalty points on my driver licence - and I got two once - after a certain amount of time, thank God, they diminish.  Fishers can be proved innocent in court but the penalty points will remain on their record.  This is a bizarre situation.  Since 1973 and our accession to the EU, we have lost out.  The fishers of Ireland have been sold out and let down.  In the most recent talks, we have been completely abandoned.  We have information to the effect that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue - I have nothing personal against him - did not even open his mouth at some of the meetings.  Was there some sort of side deal done whereby we would give them all the fish they wanted, they could take our waters and plunder them, if we got something else?  If so, the something else was very little.  We are getting less than &euro;1 billion out of the recovery fund and sadly, half of that has been ring-fenced by the Government for green initiatives.  I have nothing at all against green initiatives.  I am very much in favour of them but we must have balance here.  I support An Taisce and the work it does in schools, with Tidy Towns committees and so on.  I support the work it does in the educational area in particular, with the green schools initiative but we must be proportionate in our dealings with the rest of the economy.  We cannot just go off on this fanciful journey of introducing green legislation with no impact analysis.  </p> <p> To return to the issue of fishing and this legislation, I have made my point about pre-legislative scrutiny and public consultation was also required.  An earlier contributor mentioned town hall meetings, which could not be held.  A lot of things have slipped through without any proper consultation.  We need to ensure that our waters are protected.  We have a serious issue with drugs being imported by sea and there is no proper protection in place in that regard.  </p> <p> Mar focal scor, on the issue of plastics, we have a number of operators in Ireland who collect farm plastics.  They are doing their best to keep the environment safe.  We do not want any plastic ending up in the sea.  However, we do not need a cabal to take over the collection of plastic, as it has, because it will diminish and destroy the single operators who did great work.  They were pioneers.  I know of one operator in my own area and one in Deputy Michael Collin's town of Bandon who pioneered the collection of plastic.  The gentleman I know is a comhairleoir i gContae Phort L&aacute;irge, Councillor Declan Doocey.  He is a hard-working family businessman who now has huge stocks of plastic on his land and is being prosecuted for that.  He could not export the plastic but when he got a market for it, the cabal to which I referred, the Irish Farm Film Producers Group, IFFPG, decided to undermine him, go cheaper and close his contracts.  This is not good enough.  Why can we not support ordinary people in this country doing ordinary things?  Why does greed always have to come into it?  Some former members of a national farming organisation saw an opportunity and set up this group.  They have been complaining for all of their lives about the cartels in the beef industry and now there is a cartel in the plastic recycling industry and the likes of Declan Doocey and others, one-man operators employing a couple of people and giving a very valuable service to the farmers of south Tipperary, north Tipperary, west Waterford, south Kilkenny and east Cork are being forced out of business and cast aside.  They are being diminished and it is not good enough.  The IFFPG people appeared before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and were questioned by Deputy Michael Collins and others but they were not truthful and did not give us the full story.  They got out through the gap, laughing.  There are people out there who are willing, ready and able to collect the plastic for recycling in order that it does not end up in the sea but this cabal-type outfit got together and has sucked them up.  Big is not always wonderful or powerful.  The small operations, the one-man operators, whether they are showbands, agricultural contractors or lorry drivers, are all fighting for support following Covid.  They are doing a great job.  The Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, will understand the issue of farm plastics because he is involved in agriculture himself.  What the former members of a farmers' organisation that have set up this group are doing to the smaller collectors is not good enough.  Above all we do not want the plastic in our ditches, dykes, drains, rivers or our seas.  </p> <p> I will not say much more on this Bill except that I am extremely disappointed with it.  Given the Minister of State's interest in many issues, he cannot be happy with this Bill either or with the lack of public consultation, pre-legislative scrutiny and above all, impact analysis.  All legislation requires that.  We debated a Bill some months ago which renewed criminal legislation.  A full 18 or 20 years had passed before there was any impact analysis done on that legislation.  Every Bill should contain a date, after a suitable bedding-in period, for an impact analysis to determine whether it is fulfilling the functions it was set out to fulfil, whether it is fit for purpose and above all, whether there are any glaring anomalies or holes in it that could leave it open to legal challenge.  Such analysis should also determine whether it sits well with the public and serves the public we are elected to represent in this House.  That is very important.  The fishermen of Ireland are not being served well by public representatives in this House, with a couple of notable exceptions.  The Taoiseach name-dropped a few Deputies on the Order of Business.  Let other Deputies do their own work but the Taoiseach should not try to take from the work of Deputy Michael Collins, who is an outstanding representative of the fishermen.  I understand that the fishermen are coming to protest here next Wednesday and I look forward to meeting them. </p></speech>

I thank Deputies for their consideration of the Maritime Jurisdiction Bill and for their contributions to this Second Stage debate.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, indicated in his opening statement, this Bill will update and clarify the law relating to the maritime jurisdiction of the State in a single, accessible, stand-alone enactment.  It describes the different maritime zones and the national jurisdiction recognised by international law.  It sets out the State's sovereign and jurisdictional rights in each of those zones and confers powers on the Government to delineate the zones in domestic law.  As Deputy Brophy pointed out, how the State then decides to exercise those jurisdictional rights is left to separate legislation and is beyond the scope of this Bill.</p>  <p>  I wish to address a number of the points made by Deputies during the debate.  Today a number of Deputies, including Deputies Connolly, Mattie McGrath and Mac Lochlainn raised concerns about the lack of pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill.  I am informed that pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill was waived by the relevant Oireachtas committee, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence.  That was a decision of the committee, which is its right.  Oireachtas committees are entitled to make such decisions but the Government did not ask for scrutiny to be waived.  It was not a request of the Government but a decision of an Oireachtas committee.  Members of the committee can answer as to why they felt it was opportune to do so but-----</p></speech>

We get waiver requests all of the time from Departments.  If the Government did not request it, how did the committee grant it?  That needs to be clarified.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-15a.229" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="17:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021061500029#BB00500"><p>Committees have the right to waive pre-legislative scrutiny because they will be doing it.  It is in a committee's gift to do so.  When I was on committees, members would decide whether pre-legislative scrutiny was warranted.  That is the role of Oireachtas committees and they have the right to make that decision.  I would also like to put it on the record that officials from the Department made themselves available to Deputies and were happy to provide detailed briefings to the Opposition Members who requested same.</p>  <p>  A lot of the points made during the debate relate to issues that are beyond the scope of this Bill.  A lot of the issues related to this Bill will be dealt with under different legislation.  Most of the points raised in the debate are not specific to this Bill and are outside its scope.  That said, those elements that do come within the scope of the Bill can be the subject of amendments on Committee Stage.  Consideration will be given to this debate and the points raised here will be borne in mind as part of that process. </p> <p> I would also like to address the issue of the exclusion of Irish fishing vessels from the 12-mile zone around Rockall, which has been raised by numerous Deputies.  I assure Deputies that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is working closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs on this issue.  As Deputies will be aware, the Government's long-standing position has been that remote rocks in the middle of the ocean that cannot support human habitation should not be subject to claims of sovereignty by any state.  It is for that reason that no Irish Government has ever made such a claim, nor has it recognised the UK's 1955 claim to Rockall.  Traditionally, we have treated the waters around Rockall as part of the UK's exclusive economic zone and, therefore, while the UK was a member of the EU, part of the EU's waters opened to the vessels of all member states.  We did not recognise a 12-mile territorial sea around it.</p> <p> The Government has been in contact with the relevant Scottish and UK authorities about Rockall in recent years and intensively so since the beginning of this year but clearly the issue has become more complex since Brexit.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs discussed the matter directly with his then Scottish counterpart, former Cabinet Secretary Michael Russell, before the recent Scottish election.  Contacts have resumed since the election and we continue to engage with the Scottish side.  We are committed to addressing the issues involved, reflecting the long-standing fisheries tradition in the area.</p> <p> I would also like to take this opportunity to address a related issue raised during the debate, namely, the 2013 agreement between Ireland and the UK establishing boundaries between the exclusive economic zones of the two countries.  That 2013 agreement builds on the 1988 agreement, which established continental shelf boundaries between Ireland and the UK.  It provides that the continental shelf boundaries should also serve as the boundaries between the exclusive economic zones.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, has explained, the exclusive economic zone is the water column that sits above the continental shelf out to a maximum distance of 200 nautical miles from the coast.  By using the 1988 boundaries with the 2013 agreement, a single maritime boundary was established between 12 and 200 miles, both in the water and on the seabed beneath.</p> <p> I should add that Rockall should not be confused with the extensive Hatton-Rockall continental shelf area, which extends westward beyond the Rockall trough and into the north-east Atlantic to a distance of more than 500 nautical miles from Ireland and Britain.  The rock of Rockall is the only part of the Hatton-Rockall continental shelf that protrudes above the water.  The 1988 agreement divided the Hatton-Rockall area between Ireland and the UK, although that agreement is not accepted by Iceland or Denmark, which make competing claims to the area but not to the rock.  Rockall was irrelevant to determining the 1988 boundaries.  Nothing in either the 1988 agreement or the 2013 agreement altered Ireland's long-standing position on Rockall, nor does either agreement have any implications for the present difficulties between Ireland and Scotland over fishing within 12 miles of Rockall.</p> <p> Offshore available energy was also referred to during the debate.  The question of where offshore wind farms would be located, including matters relating to minimum distances from shore, will be addressed within the framework of the forthcoming maritime planning and development management Bill.  Questions relating to the planning permission for wind farms are beyond the scope of the maritime jurisdiction Bill.  What I can say at this stage is that there is no provision in Irish law for licensing a wind farm outside the 12-mile limit of the territorial sea.  The Bill sets out clearly that the State has jurisdiction to license such developments in the 200-mile exclusive economic zone.  The maritime planning and development management Bill, in turn, will make detailed provision for how this is to be carried out, including in planning permissions.  The programme for Government contains a commitment to developing a long-term plan for the production of at least 30 GW of offshore floating wind power in our deeper waters in the Atlantic.</p> <p> A number of Deputies raised issues relating to fisheries in general.  While I understand the concerns that have led to Deputies raising these issues here, I am afraid that they lie beyond the scope of this Bill.  However, the Government is well aware of these matters.  I assure Deputies that they are receiving attention within the relevant frameworks.</p> <p> It is important to recognise that we cannot provide in our domestic law for rights or jurisdiction that exceed what is permitted by international law.  As I have explained, for each maritime zone international law establishes a suite of rights and obligations for the coastal state, which balances another suite of rights and obligations for all other states whose vessels and citizens may share that ocean space.  The development of maritime zones in international law has been an essential element in reducing both conflicts at sea and conflicts between states caused by competing claims to uses of the sea.</p> <p> I wish to thank Deputies for their careful consideration of the Bill this afternoon and during the previous debate.  It is my pleasure to commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

This motion follows the visit of Deputy McDonald to the affected families in Donegal just over a week ago.  The families said they would be protesting on Tuesday, 15 June, when the D&aacute;il returned after its recess.  They asked the Deputy to put their case front and centre on that day, as Leader of the Opposition.  That is how this motion came about.  It reflects the demands of families in Donegal, Mayo, Clare and Sligo.</p><p>The motion calls for 100% redress that is fully funded.  That would provide equality between the families in Donegal and Mayo and families in Dublin and north Leinster.  More than 2,000 families in Dublin and north Leinster have availed of the fully funded pyrite remediation scheme.  It is right that the scheme was fully funded.  I ask the Minister, in his comments today, not to make a comparison between the cost of the pyrite remediation scheme and the cost of the defective concrete block scheme.  Such a comparison is utterly offensive to people.  It is the equivalent of two people drowning, one of whom is told they will be saved because they are not too hard on the diesel for the helicopter while the other person, who is far out at sea, is told they will be left to drown because we cannot afford the diesel.  That would be unheard of and I ask the Minister not to make those sorts of comparisons today.  These people are in exactly the same situation.</p><p>The people we represent did nothing wrong.  They were victims of an era of light-touch regulation, self-regulation and no regulation during the Celtic tiger period, just like the families in Dublin and north Leinster.  They are looking to be treated the same.  That is our appeal to the Minister.</p><p>I also note the proposed amendment to the motion that adds Sligo into the narrative, which is fine.  There is also an amendment that refers to a public inquiry, which is also absolutely fine.  We want to focus our motion on 100% redress but we welcome the additions from our colleagues in the House and we can support those amendments.</p><p>I also understand the Government will not be opposing this motion, which is welcome news.  There are people who are now heading home to Donegal, Mayo, Clare and other counties with hope in their hearts.  We also hope they can get a good night's sleep for the first time in a long time.  We were speaking to those families and many of them said it is a weight off their shoulders that the Government is signing up to a motion that calls for 100% redress.  Let us be clear what is happening here.  This is the democratically elected Parliament of the people and it will, it appears, this evening pass a motion calling clearly for 100% redress.  I ask the Minister to urgently go about the process of implementing the desire and wishes of this Parliament, to work in partnership with the campaign groups to come to a 100% funded scheme to ensure that people will not be out huge amounts of money to make their homes safe.  That is the call.</p><p>I have repeatedly raised this issue with the Minister over the past year through parliamentary questions and in this forum.  Our requests to review the scheme were repeatedly put back.  We were told it was too early.  I welcome the fact that in recent times the Minister has accepted that this scheme is utterly unfit for purpose.  I welcome the fact that the Government has agreed not to oppose this motion and it accepts that the desire of our Parliament is for a 100% funded scheme.</p><p>We ask the Minister to ensure the scheme is implemented urgently and as soon as possible in partnership with groups in Donegal and Mayo.  We also ask that the families affected in Clare and Sligo are added to the scheme.  Other families might also need to be added to the scheme.  That is the challenge.  We want to work with the Minister.  The truth is that none of the public representatives in Donegal, no matter which political party they represent or who they are - they all know their neighbours - wanted this to happen and they all want to support their neighbours.  I reach across and ask that we make this a fully funded scheme.  Let us create equality between the east and west of Ireland.  Let us work together to get this right, give people hope and show those young people who came out to the protest that when things are wrong, they can stand up, work with the political system and make change.  It would give people faith and belief.  That is my appeal to the Minister.</p></speech>

I commend the homeowners and families concerned on their tenacity and fortitude.  We saw thousands of them earlier who made that long journey to Dublin to send a clear message to the Government that the current redress scheme is simply not fit for purpose and immediate action must be taken to right this wrong.  I extend my sympathy and solidarity to those homeowners and families.</p><p>This scandal has exacted a heavy toll on many of those affected, not only financially but also mentally, emotionally and even physically.  That they have mounted such an effective campaign despite those difficulties is testament to their determination.  It should never have come to this.  The Government must do the right thing now and deliver a 100% redress scheme.</p><p>I have spoken to and heard from families who have experienced the gradual erosion of their homes, the slow creep and growth of cracks along the walls, and the plaster falling from walls and ceilings into their children's bedrooms.  They have experienced the crumbling of bricks and gables.  Put simply, their homes are falling apart.  As one homeowner put it, his home is crumbling like Weetabix.  That is not an exaggeration but a perfect description of the living reality of all those who have witnessed it.  We know that many of those homes are simply no longer safe.  I cannot describe the impact this continues to have on the affected homeowners and their families.  They have poured their hard-earned money, savings and hopes for their futures into their homes.  </p><p>On 15 June, an 11-year-old from Donegal wrote to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I had the pleasure of chatting with her at the demonstration today.  She is an excellent writer.  She expressed the reality that she and her family face eloquently and succinctly.  In an extract from that letter, she stated:</p> <blockquote> 	Our house is affected by mica.  In my bedroom, we had to move my bed because the plaster was falling off my wall and onto my pillows.  It is so sad that the house we are living in is crumbling.  It is so unfair that the Government is doing nothing. </blockquote>  <p>For any child, their house should be their sanctuary.  It should be the place in which they feel safest and where memories are made.  This scandal has left children growing up in homes that are falling apart and dangerous.  They are growing up in the crumbling surroundings of a scandal that has left their parents stressed, distressed and despairing for the future.  No child deserves that, nor does any parent or family.  I have heard from parents who find a quiet moment away from the eyes and ears of their children by going for a drive or sitting in their car and crying under the stress of their ordeal so as not to alarm or worry their children.  </p><p>The financial impact cannot be overstated but we can describe it.  For many families, the homes can no longer be lived in because parents fear for the safety of their children.  They have had no option but to leave their homes, a devastating but unavoidable decision.  They have been forced to rent as they seek alternative accommodation.  Mortgage repayments must also be paid on their crumbling homes.</p> <p>They then faced the uphill task of accessing the current scheme, which was introduced in 2020.  The immediate challenge is the cost for the structural engineering report needed to prove eligibility, which itself can cost up to &euro;6,000.  That cost, which is considerable, locks many families out of the scheme from the start.  Others have sought loans from the banks just to prove that their homes are affected by mica as the cracks widen and the blocks crumble.</p> <p> Those who manage to jump the first hurdle face even greater costs as they approach the second one.  What is routinely and inaccurately described as a 90% redress scheme in many cases proves to be 70% redress, and often even less.  The remaining costs are huge, in some instances upwards of &euro;100,000 and equivalent to a second mortgage.</p> <p> The scheme is not fit for purpose and there is no debate about that.  Unless it is replaced, the repercussions for these families are grave.  Equality is also at stake, with homes affected by pyrite in Dublin and north Leinster having rightly received 100% redress through a similar scheme.  Let us, therefore, be honest and frank.  Not only can the Government put in place a scheme that provides 100% redress to those affected, it must put in place that scheme of 100% redress for those families.</p> <p> This motion calls on the Government to provide those affected by defective blocks in Donegal, Mayo, Clare and other counties with 100% redress, nothing less.  That is what is required.  It must ensure that those who are responsible, that is, the developers, builders and suppliers, are held to account with a contribution extracted from the industry towards the remediation.</p> <p> I want to finish by commending the homeowners and families for their determination, fortitude and strength.  I call on every Teachta D&aacute;la to support this motion and on the Minister to act.  Do not give false hope where there is none.  Give a commitment today on what his party leader refused to do and support the principle of 100% and the principle of equality.  Please lift that burden off these families, who are weighed down by this nightmare with which they have been living for so many years. </p></speech>

Locally, the Clare Pyrite-Mica Action Group gathered and protested in Ennis yesterday.  I attended that protest and spoke to some of the people who have been affected by defective blocks.  They have literally watched their homes and sense of future, security and shelter crumble before their eyes over the past few years because of light-touch regulations during the construction boom.  I commend the chairperson, Dr. Martina Cleary, and all the members, who even in their despair mobilised themselves and did great work on this issue, including during the restrictions which must also be noted.</p>  <p>  These people, whose hard-earned money was invested into their homes, have been denied any clarity about who, if anyone, will accept responsibility for the State-sponsored shoddy workmanship that has led to nationwide scandal.  In my county of Clare, a relatively small initial sample of only five houses were tested and have proven that it is pyrite.  Even more worrying is the fact that the initial sample included homes scattered at five far-flung locations across the county, which has led people to suspect that the issue is widespread and far-reaching.  That is five, however, when we know that more than 50 households have come forward.  These houses were built between 1981 and 2007.  Since then, we know that 55 houses have been logged as having defective blocks.  A further 35 have more recently been identified.</p>  <p>  Let us consider the backdrop against which these constituents' concerns were rising.  The initial scheme, which included only homeowners in counties Donegal and Mayo, was only offering 90% of redress costs.  It has come to light that they are not even receiving the 90% and are burdened with, in some cases, up to 30% of the cost.  This is absolute madness, especially considering that this was not the experience for those homeowners on the east.  The Government in Dublin simply has not been listening and has not been getting the message.</p>  <p>  On closer inspection, the scheme is not fit for purpose.  The scheme, in its current form, excludes the most vulnerable homeowners impacted as it expects homeowners to be able to come up with 10% of the overall reconstruction costs from the outset.  These homeowners bought or built their homes in good faith and should not be liable for the cost of remediation caused by the incompetency, negligence or deliberate non-compliance of others, end of story.</p>  <p>  Imagine having invested your life savings in a big, beautiful house at the tail end of the Celtic tiger and taking out a mammoth mortgage to secure this forever home.  Now, imagine the walls are starting to fall down around you ten years down the line.  Imagine having to move out because this building, the very security of a roof over one's head, is no longer safe to raise a family in, and when we are in the midst of a housing crisis.  Imagine one's county is not even included in the approved areas that will be able to recoup the devastating cost of this structural damage.  Not only will they have to fight tooth and nail for recognition that their home is actually part of a much wider network of buildings that need significant reconstruction, they are also being asked to come up with 10% of the overall cost on top of their mortgage repayments for a building they technically cannot even occupy.  That is on top of the rental of an alternate premises.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's Bill, on the other hand, is putting forward policy that will offer 100% redress for all homeowners of defective block houses, regardless of location, without the unrealistic expectation of them to come up with some of the cost themselves.  Homeowners are not to blame and should not be footing even part of the Bill.</p></speech>

Go raibh maith agat freisin to all the people who travelled to Dublin today to protest against the lack of action on their cause and brought their protest to their capital city.</p>  <p>  I am delighted to speak on the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.  Wherever a dodgy block is sold or big bucks are to be made off the backs of the home buyer, home builder or worker, immediate redress is required.  Full and immediate redress is the only way to address the wrongs inflicted and the damage done to people living with the effects of the greed that characterises housing in Ireland.  It is not only in Donegal; this matters everywhere.  It matters in north Kildare, Mayo and Clare or wherever damage shows its ugly face.  This damage is not just to buildings but to families, communities, mental health, financial health and people's sense of feeling safe in their own homes, which they built, bought and paid for and which, through no fault of their own, are disintegrating around them.</p>  <p>  It is not just mica or pyrite that caused this crisis but the housing culture and its greed, dysfunction and lack of respect for the citizen.  It is a culture where builders, developers and politicians took one of the most basic and powerful human needs we have - the need for a home - and reduced it to a commodity and a scheme for profit with the regulation of "Whatever you are having yourself".  Big bucks could be made and corners cut along with deals with the boom-is-getting-boomier devil.</p>  <p>  They say bad housing is designed and built by people who know they will never have to live in it.  Dangerous housing, the soul destroying housing of mica and pyrite, was given to us by the State-wide housing culture of "Sure look, we will get away with it".  And they did, with their shoddy materials, worse work and shocking finish, and people lined up to hand over their life savings for the privilege of a 30-year mortgage.</p>  <p>  For years now at our Ard-Fheiseanna, comrades from counties Mayo, Clare and Donegal, in particular, have shared their stories with us about light-touch regulation and the devastation it brought to their lives.  Over the years, skirting boards, tiles, lights, wooden presses, slates and doors were falling in around them along with their spirits, marriages, bank balances and peace of mind.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in calls for full redress for the families affected here.  We must cast a cold eye on the housing culture then, and by and large, the same housing culture now.  The absence of a philosophy of housing beyond markets and profit is destroying our State and society.  It gives us penthouses alongside tent cities, cheek by jowl.  Parents and children are living on takeaways and their nerves in bed and breakfast accommodation.  Mica and pyrite are simply a symptom of a social and political disease where there is no respect for the citizen.  Profit is venerated and citizens are exploited.  The only cure is new thinking and a new Government.  In Sinn F&eacute;in, we have that thinking and when the people decide, we will be that Government.  The families affected cannot wait another second, however.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that the Government is not going to vote against our motion.  I ask the Government to support it, thereby supporting our people.  We must mind all our people, whatever county they live in, and not abandon them.  In housing, the people out there must know that the people in here are on their side.</p></speech>

I welcome this important debate.  Decent people who bought a house in good faith, in which to live and raise their family in their local community, have found themselves in an impossible situation through no fault of their own.  Crumbling walls have turned bright dreams into darkness.  Mica is a blight on these communities and it has devastated lives.  I want a scheme that works for these ordinary homeowners by providing a very clear pathway out of this scourge.</p>  <p>  N&iacute;l an Rialtas i gcoinne an r&uacute;in seo ach is fi&uacute; a r&aacute; nach r&eacute;iteoidh r&uacute;n D&aacute;la an fhadhb seo agus n&iacute; shocr&oacute;idh s&eacute; fi&uacute; teach amh&aacute;in.  Is iad comhoibri&uacute; agus tiomantas a r&eacute;iteoidh ruda&iacute;.  Oibreoimid le gach aon gheallsealbh&oacute;ir ar r&eacute;itigh phraitici&uacute;la agus bhuail m&eacute; inniu le hionadaithe na gclann at&aacute; buailte maidir leis sin.</p>  <p>  Earlier today, I met members of the Mica Action Group.  I want to advise colleagues of the course of action that I, as Minister, have taken in the past number of months.  Indeed, going back to last year, one of the first events I attended as Minister was in Buncrana in Donegal last August, where I encouraged residents to engage with the scheme that had been agreed and put in place the previous January.  I mentioned to residents at that meeting that my experience of previous remediation schemes was that they evolve and we only learn from them once people start engaging with them.</p>  <p>  At the end of February this year, very particular concerns were raised with me, through the Mica Action Group in Donegal and pyrite and defective block groups in Mayo, about how the scheme was operating for them.  Members opposite, as well as members of the previous Government, had initially welcomed the scheme in good faith.  Now we must look at how we can change that scheme to ensure it works for people, their homes and their families.  When I met the groups virtually at the end of February, I asked them, particularly the groups from Donegal, to make a submission to me highlighting the issues they had.  Those issues cover many aspects, as raised by Deputies, such as upfront costs, caps, grants and all the other elements of the scheme.  The submission I requested was sent to me on 29 April.  In May, I met with Deputies opposite, colleagues from both Donegal and Mayo and the various groups.  I gave a commitment to work through the issues raised and seek to improve the scheme.</p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy Mac Lochlainn that it is not helpful to compare one scheme versus another.  If anything, mica in blocks is far worse than the pyrite problems my constituents and other homeowners in Leinster have experienced.  I visited homes in Donegal last year that were crumbling.  Just before last weekend, the Taoiseach also visited homeowners and met with groups, in a very open and honest way.  I acknowledge that the Leader of the Opposition has done the same.  I am not about throwing political charges at people on this issue.  Everybody wants to work earnestly to resolve it.  Thousands of people have come up to Dublin today, representatives of whom I met this afternoon in Leinster House.  I proposed to them and to homeowners in Mayo that we set up a time-bound working group.  This follows discussions I had over the weekend with the group, which continued on Sunday and into Monday.  The objective is to work through the specific issues that have been highlighted, with a deadline of 31 July.</p>  <p>  We all know there is a very significant cost to the Exchequer in addressing this issue.  That is just a fact.  I believe changes are needed to the scheme and those changes will have the effect of increasing the cost.  We need to quantify that cost, as was done when the initial scheme was put in place last January.  From talking to people in Mayo, Donegal and other counties that could potentially be affected, not just today but over recent months, I know the impact this is having on their lives.  I want to say very clearly to people that I, as Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Taoiseach, the Cabinet and all my colleagues in government are committed to making changes to the scheme to ensure it works.  There is a large body of work in this.  Thousands of homes are affected and how we go about the work, either by remediating or replacing those homes, will in itself be a major task.  We have a pyrite remediation scheme in regard to infill that has taken nearly ten years to remediate 2,000 homes.  That shows the scale of the issue and what needs to be done as we scale up the scheme.  We also need to look to the expertise we have within the Housing Agency.</p>  <p>  I said to residents today that my proposal is that there be no red lines and we have a full and open discussion to go through the issues.  The most important aspect is that we work through and agree solutions, with the residents in the room and involved in the discussions on a time-bound basis.  Eamonn Jackson, Michael Doherty, Eileen Doherty and Paddy Diver told me today that, in regard to the original scheme, they felt they did not have a part in the construction of it.  To be fair, it was only by engaging with that scheme that the issues became clear.  There is a large commitment from the State in general in regard to the cost, but we also need to look at those who were responsible and those who have responsibility, such as the insurers, producers and lenders.  Many of the homes that will be remediated and brought back to full value by the State are the assets of lenders.  People are still paying mortgages on them.  There is a whole aspect to look at in this regard but I do not want it to delay the changes we need to make to the scheme.</p>  <p>  I made my proposal in good faith to residents today.  In fact, I made it on Sunday.  The initial response has been positive.  I am committed to working with them and with Deputies opposite of all parties and none.  We need to be focused and time-bound in our discussions and ensure we have a scheme that works for people.  That is what I, as Minister, am committed to doing.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the Minister's work on this issue in recent months and over the past number of days in particular.  It is important that his huge effort and great personal commitment to the matter give results for homeowners.  We in this House and the Minister do not have time for delays.  Homeowners, their families and their communities do not have time.  We need a scheme that begins to deliver without any further delay.  Homeowners' lives are broken.  For every crumbling block, there is a crumbling life.  I spoke to homeowners this evening who have been campaigning on this issue for nearly ten years.  I commend all of those involved.  Their courage in telling their stories stands in contrast to the lack of courage and the behaviour of quarry owners and various agencies that have left homeowners abandoned in this.</p>  <p>  The motion commits to a scheme of 100% redress and that is what must be delivered.  Priority must be given to homeowners but we cannot ignore the rental sector.  To ignore those houses would mean being left with a decimated rental stock.  There are other areas of home ownership that are excluded from the current scheme and they must also be addressed.  We must have a mechanism to include homeowners in other counties, particularly County Sligo.  The process for rolling out the scheme needs to be addressed and made much easier.  The role of the Pyrite Resolution Board and its experience in running the current scheme should be incorporated within local authorities.  There must be agreement on a communal and shared cost per square foot.  In assessing applications, local authorities are using a model that is very different from the reality in terms of current building costs.  Those costs have increased by 30% since February and many applications that were submitted at that time are going out of date.  We need a State guarantee around building because builders will not engage with the scheme in that aspect.  We also need to follow up on a State inquiry as to why those who caused this problem are getting away with it.  If they are still getting away with it, that needs to be resolved urgently, without any further delay.</p>  <p>  The first scheme had the basis of a good system but its roll-out, the lack of commitment to it from local authorities and the detail of it, which did not involve homeowners, made it a scheme that is not working.  I welcome the Minister's inclusion of homeowners on this occasion.  We must ensure they own the scheme and that it delivers for their families and communities and will take away the trauma of their daily lives in houses with pyrite and mica.  I acknowledge the trauma it is causing people, forcing them to leave bedrooms at night because of draughts and sleep in sitting rooms, or even forcing them to leave their homes.</p> <p>When they leave their homes to have them repaired, they must be given compensation for the rental costs.<br/><br/>I wish the Minster well with this.  Residents in counties Mayo, Sligo and Donegal were sold defective blocks.  They will not be sold a pup in relation to this scheme.  I ask that the Minister to stand with them, because I certainly will.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-15a.245" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1467" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="18:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021061500034#GG00200"><p>I am thankful for the opportunity to speak on this important motion.  There are many people watching this evening whose houses have been affected by the mica scandal and I pledge to them my solidarity and that of Sinn F&eacute;in.  Also watching will be people from north County Dublin whose houses have been affected by pyrite or whose apartments have been affected by defects.  I reassure them that we stand with them.</p>  <p>  The mica, pyrite and apartment-defect scandals are a legacy of the light-touch building regulation which has existed for far too long in this State.  Indeed, as recent years have seen reduced sizes for apartments and the sanctioning of co-living, I am reminded that this light-touch regulation still exists.  It is as if we have learned nothing.  Across north County Dublin, particularly in Rush and Lusk, but also, as the Minister will be aware, elsewhere in the north of the county, houses have been literally destroyed by pyrite while apartments have been crippled by latent defects.  There are those whose houses are undergoing remediation but there are others who cannot sell their houses because there is pyrite in the infill and while that does not affect the structure, they cannot get a search to verify this.  These are people who bought what would traditionally be known as "starter homes" and are now outgrowing those homes, but they are stuck where they are and their lives are in limbo.  I urge the Minster to take a look at that situation and would be very happy to work with him on it.  I have constituents, and they are constituents of the Minister as well, who have emigrated because of this.  They were trapped in their homes and felt they had no option.  They have let their houses and emigrated.  To see one's home reduced to rubble or for it to be condemned as unsafe for one's kids or grandkids to be in is just shocking, and that is before we even mention the hundreds of thousands of euro people have spent just to try to keep their homes right.</p>  <p>  In the case of the houses in County Donegal, I am told the root cause of this is provision of defective blocks from quarries.  These people are still operating and that must be absolutely infuriating, just as it is for myself and the Minister's constituents who see the builders who built their homes getting away scot-free and now building new developments just across the road.  Imagine how heartbreaking that must be for people.  I commend the strength and the dignity of the people affected in counties Donegal and Mayo for how they have conducted themselves throughout their campaign.  They are a credit to their counties and to their families.  They are an example to all of those people who have been wronged as to what can be done if people pull together with a common cause and a stated common aim.  I have seen the same strength across north County Dublin in those people who have campaigned for redress for the victims of pyrite and for those affected by the latent defects scandal.  The legacy of light-touch regulation is being faced in family homes across the State.  While it is not right to compare schemes, and we should not do that, the experience for families is scarily similar.  People talk of lying in bed at night listening to their houses crumbling around them.  That is the experience these families have had and the impact on the lives of the residents is scarily similar.</p>  <p>  I commend the people of County Donegal and I commend this motion.  I ask the Minister that he not simply not oppose the motion but actively support it.</p></speech>

It is timely and very important.  I extend my solidarity to the people of County Donegal who came in such great numbers today and commend them for everything they have gone through to fight their corner.</p>  <p>  It is clear the scheme in place is not fit for purpose.  Deputy O'Reilly referenced how the experience of building, creating and investing in one's own home, full of hope and plans for the future, only to see that literally crumble around one is devastating.  I do not know any of the people involved but I can see from the footage, and from speaking to people today, what it means to them.  I know about the experience of living with pyrite from my own constituents in Meath East, particularly in areas like Ashbourne, Dunboyne and Dunshaughlin.  They fought their own battle, took it to the High Court, failed there and went the political route so a scheme would be put in place for them.  I am sure every one of them would say it must be a 100% scheme.  The scheme must be fit for purpose.  It is no addition if people cannot get on the first step of the ladder to it, if they cannot get access to it.  I draw the comparison as well between the cost of the initial test, as it appears to be in County Donegal, versus the visual test for the pyrite scheme.  The damage that is done is quite obvious.</p>  <p>  To follow up on Deputy O'Reilly's points, there are a number of issues still outstanding with the pyrite scheme.  From dealing with people in my own constituency, there are issues with estates where pyrite is only now becoming apparent after the deadline of December 2013.  I know of one particular case where a lady encouraged her mother to buy the house next door for practical reasons, only for it to have pyrite and for them to have to appeal, and to go into the process is a difficulty.  There is an issue with the caps on the rent, and the scheme in County Donegal must include that element of supporting the rent, but there is also a pressure to move out after the money is used.  The concerns I am hearing from people on that is that they must almost take it or leave it, as far as the quality of the work done is concerned; they have no recourse in relation to it and find themselves in a difficult position.</p>  <p>  There are, therefore, a number of elements that must be resolved with the pyrite scheme and I encourage the Minister to look at them.  Deputy O'Reilly and others addressed the specific root cause of mica and pyrite all across the country.  That is still there and must be addressed.  I commend the motion and again thank the Deputies for bringing it forward.</p></speech>

I also commend the proposers of the motion, and Sinn F&eacute;in for dedicating their Private Members' time to this very important issue.  It strikes a chord with any Deputy who represents a constituency that has been affected by pyrite because there are many similarities to the that crisis.</p>  <p>  The housing crisis in general has many faces and casts many a long shadow.  In this Chamber and in committees we have been talking about affordability, homelessness, land prices, public housing, land use and social housing provision but there is another face of the housing crisis, namely, the issue of construction defects.  It has manifested itself in the pyrite crisis and with the work done by the Construction Defects Alliance, which works on behalf of apartment owners.  It is estimated up to 100,000 apartments suffer from defects in construction and it costs an average of maybe &euro;15,000 each to repair them.</p>  <p>  We also have this crisis, the mica crisis, which first came into view in 2013, the very year the pyrite remediation scheme got up and running.  I commend the work of a number of Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la, including my predecessor Brendan Ryan, who did an awful lot of work to ensure the pyrite remediation scheme got up and running early enough in the lifetime of that Government at a time when there was very little money around.  That scheme is still going.  This is not easy.  It is not easy for the homeowners to go through what they have to go through and they are still going through it.  However, it is working, it is getting homes remediated and it is getting people back into their homes.</p> <p> People will point out differences between the mica and pyrite crises.  There are two differences.  The first is a difference of geography because the pyrite crisis is mainly a greater Dublin region matter and that relating to mica affects Donegal, north-west Mayo and, perhaps, parts of Clare.  There is also a difference in scale, as the mica crisis is greater than the pyrite crisis in terms of number of homes affected and the structural damage evident.  The Minister and we, as Deputies, know from our work locally that there is such an invasive nature to remediating homes that have been affected by pyrite.  It is not an easy job.  You have to go in and rip out the centre of a house.  The house will remain standing, however, and can be redecorated to go back as it was before.  In the case of mica, the structural problem affects the entirety of the house and involves an entire rebuild.  The principles of these crises are the same, however, and, in the case of homes affected by pyrite, the State held up its hands when homeowners were let down with the biggest purchase they would make in their life.  It is not only the biggest financial commitment but one that involves such emotional investment.  People are buying homes in which they will live and in which they may raise families, create memories and grow old.  People invested in that but the State let them down because it did not have a sufficiently robust regulatory system for the standards of building equipment.  It is what was acknowledged by the State with the pyrite crisis and the same principle applies with homes affected by mica.  The State must acknowledge this and step in with a scheme.</p> <p> There are people who are responsible for the poor and substandard quality of the blocks and everything else, and they must play a part.  That will not come to the amount required to resolve the problem so the State will have to step in.  That will hurt but it is the reality.  Everything has a beginning.  In the late 1980s, the State absolved itself of a standards system for building equipment.  We had it up to 1988 but it was unwound and folded into Eolas and then Forbairt.  It was never really replaced and when it came to the early 2000s - the Celtic tiger era when we threw up houses and apartments all over the place - we had no robust and trusted standard for anything related to building, whether it was countertops, rolled steel joists, timber, blocks or infill.  That is how it happened.  The State is at fault and it must listen to the people outside today.  It must support a process of 100% redress.</p> <p> This is not about cost but the principle and justice.  What are we going to allow to happen?  Will we allow these people have their houses and homes fall down around them so they will have to rebuild them all over again?  There are financial and emotional considerations in this.  It is pretty clear so how many more cases like Priory Hall do we need?  How many cases of homes affected by pyrite and mica do we need?  We have a precedent in the pyrite remediation scheme and we can improve and learn from it.  We can get something up and running.  We had that scheme when the country had no money to fix the pyrite problem and now the country is in a much healthier state, the Covid-19 pandemic notwithstanding.  Our finances are in far ruder health.</p> <p> There is a housing crisis relating to affordability, the provision of public housing or even with this matter of the remediation of construction defects for apartment owners and in homes affected by pyrite or mica.  This must be covered by a solution.  The State has a role to play here.  I know the Minister and his Government are not opposing the motion but we need to see action.  The scheme currently in place for remediation does not meet the standard required.  The Government should look at the pyrite remediation scheme as a template and improve it so we can give these people some hope.  They have had nearly a decade with no hope or answers.</p> <p> Many of us have held a block in our hands and it seems like one of the strongest things one could ever hold.  Holding a block in your hands and having it crumble by just exerting the force of your fingers on it is frightening if the roof over your children's heads is supported by blocks of the same kind.  I hope we will see something from the Government that will provide comfort and some way out for the more than 5,000 homeowners affected by this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-15a.250" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="18:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021061500035#HH00200"><p>I appreciate the Government is looking at this matter and the Minister is working on it.  The fact it has taken this long to get to the point where we might have a 100% redress scheme is not in any way acceptable.  The Government supported the 90% scheme as an acceptable measure until this point and it demonstrates complete disregard for people and the stress and anxiety they are under.  We are talking about their homes.</p>  <p>  I will comment on what the T&aacute;naiste said about this recently.  He said we must ask ourselves if it is reasonable to ask the taxpayer to fund the reconstruction of what are quite large houses in some cases.  I say to the T&aacute;naiste that we must ask ourselves instead if is reasonable for people to live in homes that are falling apart and unsafe through no fault of their own whatever.  Is it reasonable that people are excluded from the redress scheme because they cannot afford to access it?  It is a key point, as people may not have been able to meet the 10% balance and additional costs of the scheme; these people are in most need of assistance from the State, as they are on lower to middle incomes.</p>  <p>  This scheme is unfair when compared with the pyrite remediation scheme.  Another great injustice of the scheme has been that the only people who could avail of it are those with some additional resources, and very few people in this position had such resources.  It is not just about the anxiety and stress caused by problems with mica but the fact that people have had to move from their homes.  A number of people are paying mortgages and rent at the same time, along with all the other costs.  When the T&aacute;naiste asks if it is reasonable to ask the taxpayer to step in, we must ask if it is reasonable for children to go to sleep at night afraid that the house might fall in on them?  Is it reasonable that people would put life savings and earnings into homes only to see them crumble?  Is it reasonable that after all the problems we have had with building defects, including pyrite and fire safety issues along with mica, we still do not have the kind of independent testing and inspection for building sites and materials that we should have to ensure this can never happen again?  Is it reasonable that the regulation of products from quarries has been so lax in the history of the State, leaving open the possibility of these kinds of building defects and defective materials?  That is what caused this problem and pushed families through such major stress, worry and anxiety.  Having this compounded by the financial difficulties because the redress scheme is insufficient is unacceptable.</p>  <p>  We must bear in mind that a house is not just bricks and mortar, it is the place where the members of a family forge their hopes and dreams.  It is where newborns are brought home and it is where the most important milestones for families are often celebrated.  It is often the last place people are before being laid to rest.</p> <p>As a councillor I dealt a lot with residents affected by pyrite and fire safety defects and heard their first-hand stories about how they were affected.  Initially, when people saw a crack they hoped it was just a settlement crack but then, over time, they realised their worst nightmares were coming into play.  At that point, people need full support rather than having to fight every step of the way to get support from the State.</p> <p> It is true that the State alone is not responsible.  The State should be pursuing vigorously the suppliers of materials and builders who are responsible for this.  It is also the case, however, that over the years the State has failed with regard to testing building materials and has a very lax regime in place.  Until we have the kinds of regimes in place in other countries for testing building materials and carrying out independent inspections of building sites at every stage of the process, and for as long as we continue to rely on the industry to regulate itself for the most part, these sorts of issues will continue to emerge.  They issues are devastating for individuals and families and create a massive financial burden for the State and taxpayer.  It will cost more than &euro;1 billion to address the mica issue and another &euro;1 billion to correct fire safety defects in some 100,000 apartments constructed during the Celtic tiger years.  The State has already paid out &euro;160 million for pyrite remediation.  This money would be much better spent elsewhere if we had proper regulation, testing and standards.</p> <p> After the issues caused by pyrite, mica and fire safety defects, the State has not fully learned lessons with regard to building materials, regulations, and independent inspection and testing.  One would have thought that after the terrible tragedy at Grenfell Tower and all the lives lost there, the State would at this point be very rigorous in its approach.  I do not know why the Government has not moved to introduce the kinds of regulation and independent inspection regimes that are in place in other countries.  Why at this point has the Government not learned these lessons?  Why maintain the position where the taxpayer and State could potentially pay out these sums again in future?  Why put families and individuals in that position, with the stress they suffer as a result?</p> <p> I fully support the motion and I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling it.  It is good that the Government, under pressure from the protests and the campaigners, has become more supportive than it was in the past.  If we do not bring inspections of building sites and the standards of building materials into line with those in other western European countries, we will continue to have these problems into the future.  That must happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-15a.252" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1486" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="18:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021061500036#JJ00200"><p>The protest today and the anger from the north west were really something to witness.  I saw a lot of politicians trying to curry favour at it but many of the protestors were not very comfortable with their presence.  This was mainly because these people have suffered under the legacy associated with the parties that oversaw the abuse of the system of building regulations in this country.</p>  <p>  The 5,000 families affected by defective building blocks that contained mica, many of which were supplied in County Donegal by Cassidy Brothers builder providers, showed a lot anger, much of which was directed at the supplier.  In a statement, the supplier has denied all wrongdoing and blames the issue entirely on the Government's lax regulations before 2013.  To some degree, the company is right that lax regulations were at fault.  However, that any supplier, builder or developer could claim it was not their responsibility is hilarious.  Anybody who produces or sells goods has a responsibility to the consumer to know what the goods contain, what properties are in them and whether they are up to standard.  The people I spoke to were also angry with Donegal County Council, which continues to use the same supplier, including for many of the council's social housing projects.</p>  <p>  In the case of homes affected by pyrite, 100% of the remediation costs were paid.  In the case of mica remediation, it is proposed to pay 90% of the costs.  There have been attempts to make this a Donegal versus Dublin issue.  We totally reject that.  We support 100% redress for all those affected.  We also support levying a tax on the profits of the building industry in the longer term.  The issue is wider than Donegal, Mayo or, indeed, Dublin.  It is estimated that 5,000 homes are affected in the north west from the use of mica.  More than 2,000 homes affected by pyrite in Dublin have already been dealt with, at an average cost of &euro;70,000.</p>  <p>  A much wider and more pervasive issue exists, namely, the estimated 100,000 defective apartments caused by cost-cutting building practices in the Celtic tiger boom.  A working group is looking at the wider problem with homes.  The group's only remit with regard to a solution is the option of setting up a low-interest or zero-interest loan scheme for owners to fix the properties.  It is estimated that the average cost could be &euro;15,000 for each apartment, and possibly more.  Interestingly, the group is chaired by Seamus Neely, who was the manager of Donegal County Council between 2010 and 2020 when many of these homes were built.  The defects in these apartments are varied but mainly involve the absence of fire walls between apartments and other fire safety elements, with water egress and water coming into apartments because of defective piping or drains.</p>  <p>  The root cause of all three sets of problems - pyrite, mica and apartment block issues - are the building regulations during the boom years.  Essentially it was a system of self-regulation, light-touch regulation and self-certification with no oversight by the State and no real recourse for those affected or penalties for those guilty of building defective apartments or using defective materials.  Builders and developers got certifiers to certify projects with no on-site inspections.  When problems arose the legal position was that neither the builders nor the developers or those they hired to certify the homes could be held responsible.  It is absolute lunacy.  Many of the developers and builders who were responsible have since changed their names but are still operating as companies in the building industry.  None faces punishments or actions as a result of the statute of limitations and their ability to blame the certification rules in place at the time.</p>  <p>  In 2017, a D&aacute;il committee recommended that "The mission statement of the Redress Scheme should be: 'Ordinary owners who purchased in good faith should not be liable for the costs of remediation caused by the incompetence, negligence or deliberate non-compliance of others'".  We support that statement.  Other demands included the establishment of a building standards and consumer protection agency to enforce building regulations, independent of developers and builders, and to make mandatory fire safety inspections of all building sites, and to extend the statute of limitations to run for years after the defects are first discovered.</p>  <p>  A D&aacute;il report from 2017 on this issue lists Priory Hall, Longboat Quay, Beacon South Quarter, Millfield Manor and Balgaddy as just some of the private and public housing developments affected.  Poor design, shoddy workmanship and improper products resulted in badly built homes that were in breach of building and fire safety standards.  Greed, dishonesty and incompetence left many homeowners and council tenants with poor quality homes and hefty repair bills.  This could apply to the people of Donegal and Mayo today.</p>  <p>  All of this was made possible by a weak regime of regulation and compliance in which self-certification and limited independent inspections were the order of the day.  We do not yet know the full extent of this legacy.  The key issue is that light-touch self-regulation is no regulation at all.  What is to be done?  It is not good enough for the Government not to oppose the Sinn F&eacute;in motion tonight.  It must commit to the responsibility it has to the families who are affected, commit to 100% redress and pay for the tests in full.  The Government should levy a tax on the profits of the building industry to pay for all of this, and it must learn lessons.</p>  <p>  Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result is the definition of insanity.  To date, the Minister has lifted specifications on apartment sizes, has gifted public land to private developers and is creating strategic housing developments.</p> <p>He has lifted height restrictions.  He is allowing non-stop build-to-let, student accommodation and co-living with no oversight on how these strategic developments impact on communities, the environment and wildlife.  Poor planning is turning a blind eye to the actions of the developers who frequently break rules and, I have heard, on occasion intimidate residents who oppose them.  Housing policies in this State must be determined by the needs of ordinary people and families for a decent safe home and not in the interests of builders, developers, suppliers, the Construction Industry Federation and the friends of the Galway tent.</p></speech>

I stood with the people of Donegal and the north west and I listened to their stories.  I listened to the speeches.  The loudest cheer was for a speaker who congratulated people for their organisation, discipline and politeness but made the point that if they were forced to return, they might not be so polite the next time.  That got the loudest cheer of the day.  It is significant that the first major protest to have taken place outside a sitting of the D&aacute;il in 15 months has been on the issue of housing.  I suspect it is the first of many protests we will see in the months and years ahead on the housing crisis.</p><p>When Paul Brady sang:</p> <blockquote> 	For there's no place on earth just like<br /><br />The homes of Donegal </blockquote>  <p>he was referring to the famous warmth and welcome offered by the people of Donegal.  He was not to know about the infamous mica and what it would do to destroy so many of the homes in Donegal.  Of course, it is not just mica.  It is a system that puts profit first and before people.  It is profits for the manufacturers of the concrete blocks, profits for the builders and profits for the insurance industry.  It is also about right-wing Governments.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments down through the years have championed light-touch regulation and the type of building regulation one would not see in the wild west.  To be frank, they opened the door to this type of scandal taking place.</p><p>In one report this morning, I read that there should not be more than 1% of mica in a block.  What was in some of the blocks in the homes of Donegal?  Was it 1.25%, 1.5% or 2%?  No.  In some cases it was 17%.  It is an absolute scandal.  The result is that people's homes are crumbling around them.  It is typical of capitalism.  We save money in the short term but it ends up costing a whole lot more in the end.</p><p>The Government is under real pressure on this issue and is supporting the motion.  I say to the people who travelled from Donegal today to put no trust in the Government.  They should not let up the pressure until they have it in writing, signed, sealed and delivered, that 100% redress plus ancillary costs will be covered, which is the same as with the case of pyrite.  If the Government states that others should be forced to pay, it should not be the people of Donegal.  They should get 100% redress.  If the Government goes after the building industry with a serious tax to help pay for this, it will have support from us.  The people in Donegal must get 100% redress and not one cent less.</p></speech>

I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for tabling the motion and I acknowledge the number of people who travelled from Donegal, Mayo and Clare to be here today to voice their opinions.  The biggest issue in all of what we are discussing is what went wrong.  It is my view that the key issue is the lack of independent building control.  Building control is under the remit of our local authorities but local authorities do not have the resources to deal effectively with building control.  There is still an over-reliance on self-certification.  We need a new model for building control.  This makes sense when we see what it costs us to put right the wrongs of the past.  We also see how unsuspecting families bought their homes in good faith and took out mortgages but have been left with a structurally defective home or a home that is not fit for habitation.  They are paying a mortgage for a structurally defective home.</p>  <p>  Another issue that comes to mind is the issue of mortgage protection and the insistence by the banks and mortgage providers that homeowners have structural defect insurance.  This is a very pertinent issue to raise this evening.  Where is the protection against structural defects in a new house where people have paid money for insurance?  It was a prerequisite to getting a loan.  It is still in place.  Even in the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme, people still need to have a structural guarantee on the building.  I have not heard much about this in the debate.  If mortgage holders are paying for an insurance policy, it should be fit for purpose.  It is very important that we get this sorted out as soon as possible, rather than people believing they have something that is of no use to them when they seek to get some protection from it.  Since 2013, we have had the construction products regulation.  Who monitors this, who controls it and who makes sure that what it says on the tin is activated and carried out properly?</p>  <p>  We have just spoken about the situation with mica.  There is also pyrite and issues with apartment blocks throughout the country and in the city which are defective and have to be put right.  If we are to do anything on this it would be important for the Government, with our support, to bring forward and invest in a proper building control policy and to make sure every local authority has the necessary resources, not just tokenism and visiting 10% of properties being built.  We must give building control to people who can control it independently.  The resources put in place would reap dividends for the taxpayer for years to come.</p>  <p>  It is very important that we do not continue in the same way.  We have to learn from the past and we have to learn from the costs.  This particular issue will cost a hell of lot of money and we should learn from this mistake.  It is high time we took it by the scruff of the neck and invested money in building control.  It is not spending money but investing money.  If we do this, we will reap the rewards.  We have self-regulation and everybody is providing a certificate but when that certificate is tested, it is found that nobody can stand behind it.  This is the important issue.  Whether someone is an architect, an engineer or a building control officer, it is very important that whatever is certified stands the test legally.  The only way to do this is to have it done independently by local authorities.</p></speech>

I pay respect to the people of Donegal and Mayo who have come up to Dublin in their thousands today.  It is a big thing for people to take a full day off work and travel hundreds of miles from their home towns to Dublin, spend the whole day here and head back.  I know this because I have been involved in various campaigns on hospitals.  It takes a massive amount of dedication.  The campaign has done an awful lot of work to make sure today has happened and I pay respect to it.  I understand why the frustration is there because people have been battling for years for justice with regard to their homes.</p><p>Families' lives have been absolutely destroyed in Donegal.</p> <p>It is incredible.  When you speak to the families, as I have done, the level of damage done to their lives is enormous.  Their life savings and everything they have in relation to their families is falling down around them.  Many of them have no options for the future.</p> <p> Also, we see that the local authorities will be hammered because the local authorities have some of these buildings.  Public houses, public buildings, farmyards and factories etc., are all likely to be affected here.  One of the big issues of this crisis is that its scale is still fairly unknown and people are only starting to find out that their buildings are defective.  The reason in part that the scale of the crisis is unknown is because families had to pay thousands of euro to get a survey done of their house to be able to apply for the current redress scheme.  I have spoken to many families who simply are trying their best to ignore the cracks in their walls because they cannot afford even to participate in the application process for this scheme.  We in Aont&uacute; will be calling for the Government to make sure that families can survey their homes without significant financial cost to them.</p> <p> In my view, there are two reasons why this happened.  The first is because of light-touch regulation.  Light-touch regulation is a legacy of decades of Fianna F&aacute;il Government.  It has cost these families in Donegal everything that they have but it has also cost the citizens of this country billions for everything from the banks to insurance companies etc.  Light-touch regulation or self-certification is no certification.  It is not worth the paper that it is written on and the fact that Fianna F&aacute;il allowed this to happen over decades was, in my view, in order that many of its cronies could get rich while doing so.  That is what happened from insurance companies to banks and to construction companies.  They facilitated a system where this happened and the country is paying for it now.</p> <p> This is also happening, in my view, because of the fact that we are a Dublin-centric State, we are a lob-sided country and we are becoming a city state.  I heard another Deputy state that this is not Dublin against the country.  It is not the people of Dublin against the country but it is the political establishment based in Dublin which does not give a tuppenny damn, typically, with regards counties such as Donegal, Mayo and Clare.  People say that the people of Donegal are different and that is because they are treated differently by this political establishment.  No doubt if it was south Dublin rather than Donegal, it would be 100% redress right away.</p> <p> It is frustrating to me and many people that one of the suppliers of these blocks is still a supplier to Donegal County Council.  If someone paints your house and does a terrible job of it, you do not keep employing them in the future to work on your house.  There is no reason a company should abide by the rules or proper functioning if it is guaranteed to have future business.  We are calling for 100% redress.  It has to be the only solution.</p> <p> We in Aont&uacute; have also submitted an amendment to the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.  We want there to be a proper full public investigation into what happened with regards mica.  If there is no investigation, nobody is held responsible.  If there is no accountability, there is no change.  There has to be a public investigation.  I would urge all the political parties and the Government to support the Aont&uacute; amendment that there would be an independent public investigation into the crisis in Donegal.  If there is not, I guarantee it will happen over and over again.</p></speech>

Thank you, Ceann Comhairle.</p>  <p>  Like many other Deputies here in the D&aacute;il, I have been inundated with emails and calls regarding this mica crisis.  I wish to add my support and say a few words on the horrific situation in which these homeowners find themselves.</p>  <p>  There is a misconception that builders should cover the cost.  The reality is that this is not a builders' problem.  The builders built the houses on the assumption that the blocks met the standards set out in SI 288 of 1949, as was certified by the manufacturers of the blocks, Cassidy Brothers.</p>  <p>  Another misconception is that it is up to the block manufacturer to sort out.  This is true, however it has proven impossible to sanction the manufacturer so far and no one has obtained any success from using legal recourse.</p>  <p>  Asking homeowners to pay 10% for something that is not their fault is grossly unfair.  The reality is that, through caps and inclusions, the homeowners will effectively pay much more than 10%.  Some suggest it could be in the region of &euro;100,000.  It is utterly shameful that these people, who have endured so much have been left with no choice but to bring their plight to the streets of Dublin.  For starters, they would have to obtain an engineer's report which would cost &euro;5,000 or more, and only after they are approved would they be reimbursed this money.  With a capped grant allowance for square footage, many homes will be smaller than what they were previously unless homeowners provide the additional funds themselves.  Furthermore, homeowners who have been in receipt of Covid payments, those whose companies have been in receipt of Covid payments and pensioners will not be able to obtain a mortgage, leaving them financially stranded.</p>  <p>  We all know the value of our homes and I am not talking about the financial value.  I refer to the heartbreak of these people seeing every day their homes crumble to nothing.  I certainly support them and the peaceful protest they had today in their thousands here in Dublin sent a very clear message.</p></speech>

"The Homes of Donegal" was Bridie Gallagher's lovely song.  I danced to her on my honeymoon in Jackson's Hotel in Ballybofey but they kept to their homes today.</p>  <p>  These people provided their own homes.  They are here to bring their plight to Government but the Government is not doing enough for them because looking after big business is the Government's priority.  We saw it with the banks.  We see it with insurance companies every day of the week.  We see it with the beef cartels.  When it comes to the daoine beaga or little people - I do not mean that in any bad way - they are cast aside.</p>  <p>  This is a racket.  There are big companies in this country.  They have more men in the quarries now.  You have CRH and others who could build the whole country.  This will cost &euro;5 billion or &euro;6 billion for the houses alone all over the country that are affected, for instance, in Limerick, Clare, Mayo and Donegal.  This will cost big money.</p>  <p>  There are companies that have taken over many of the small suppliers that were just hoovered up by vultures, and they need to pay.</p>  <p>  How come, with the light-touch regulation, there is no one held accountable?  Why should the people who see their homes crumbling in front of them, what they lived for and what they worked for when they married and raised a family, have to pay?  I met grannies today, and grandchildren.  Some of the grannies and grandparents could not come.  They should not have to come if this was a caring Government.  What did our people of 1916, 1921, 1922 and 1923 fight for?  Freedom.  For what?  Was it for cartels and big companies to rape and plunder our country and let people go to hell?</p>  <p>  I met people from the top of Donegal today who spent four and five hours travelling here to have to bring their case to Dublin.  They livened up Dublin.  It has been dead for long enough with the Covid lockdown.  They brought a spirit of energy and enthusiasm.  All they want is to live in their houses, live out their days and pass them on to their families but the big business cartels who have the big parties here - Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael and now the Greens - in their pockets are just laughing all the way to the bank.  There is no mercy for these people.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach stated today they would be paid.  Why do they have to get &euro;5,000 upfront for a report?  Why do they have to rent houses while they are being done?</p>  <p>  These houses should be demolished because you cannot fix them because it could reappear.  I know a little about it.  We need to pony up here and go after the big companies which supplied the faulty material.</p></speech>

Quarries supplied materials to these people that was certified.  There is amount of quarries that have pyrite on them that are owned by massive international companies that own 30 or 40 quarries in this country and they are responsible for pyrite and mica in this country.</p>  <p>  Pyrite is in Clare.  It is in Limerick.  At present, I have cases in Limerick with pyrite and they are only being investigated now.</p>  <p>  People should not have to pay one penny in Limerick.  They bought their houses.  They paid for their houses.  They paid for their material.  All the instruction was there given by Government on what they had to get certified.  The buck stops with the supplier of the material that caused this for houseowners and the buck stops with the Government.  Certify everything and you are covered.</p>  <p>  They should not have to pay one penny.  They have paid their mortgages, they have paid the interest on their mortgages and this country has bailed out the banks.  The banks certified the houses.  Now the banks should put them back exactly the way they were and compensate, with the Government and the quarries that gave the material to build these houses.</p>  <p>  We can see there is a problem with supply and demand for housing in this country at present.  Fix this and do not let one Limerick person or anyone else in this country pay a dime towards the Government's mistakes.</p></speech>

This is an important matter.</p>  <p>  The protestors today were an orderly and large crowd, but the anguish on their faces said it all.  This afternoon, the Taoiseach asked why people did not go after quarries or other entities, but the Government should give them 100% because they do not have the wherewithal to take anyone to court to get redress.  If the Government believes that someone is escaping the net but should be playing a role, let it go after him or her.  In the first instance, though, it must give the affected people 100%.  Giving 90% was only codding them.  They would end up paying 40% or 50% because of a loophole.  It was suggested that they should get an engineer's report.  We deal with engineers every day of the week and we know what they charge.  They would have to charge a hefty bill.  The people affected by this issue do not have that kind of money.  The Minister of State must realise that.</p>  <p>  When anything happens in Dublin, the Government sees to it right away.  There was one shower of rain here a few years back and the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, put on his wellingtons, went out and sorted out the situation, but a flood could be flowing in through our front door and out through the back door and no one would look at us.  We would have to fight flat on our backs to get flood relief for Glenflesk or anywhere else or to be allowed to cut a few bushes, which the Government would not let us do.</p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister of State now.  We all heard the songs of Bridie Gallagher in Jackie Healy-Rae's Bar in Kilgarvan 30 or 40 years ago.  She sang eloquently about the homes of Donegal.  It is a fright to God if we are going to let the homes of Donegal fall down on the ground around people now.  We have to play our part, as must the Government.</p></speech>

It is only right and proper that every Deputy should be present to tell the good people who came here today in order to highlight this issue that their homes are their castles.  When they might have nothing else, the most important thing in the whole world are their homes.  Little boys and girls came today with their parents and grandparents.  They are growing up in homes that are falling down around them.  That is sad.</p>  <p>  On the practical side, people are reaching out for help.  The redress scheme is not enough.  As has been stated, someone has to get an engineer's report in order to join the scheme, and the most someone can get from the scheme is 90%.</p>  <p>  I do not want another category of person to be forgotten.  I dealt with the case of a young man who had made friends with a young lady.  She had bought a house and he had his built and the pair were deep in mortgage debt.  They are now married but are faced with only being able to get into the scheme in respect of one of those houses.  The other house will be left to fall down to the ground because it will get no percentage.  Awful situations like theirs must be considered as well.  There are people who worked hard all their lives and built a holiday home only for that house to be falling down now.  They are equally entitled to our care and consideration.  Farm buildings, factories and even public buildings are falling down because of this problem.</p>  <p>  The Government must show compassion, sympathy and solidarity with the good people who came to Dublin today.  I compliment each and every one of them.  I thank the Garda, who never had as easy a job as they had today because the people who came were the salt of the earth and the soundest and nicest people one could have the pleasure of meeting.  They came to put our their hands and ask in an ordinary way for the Government to please help them.  I hope that we will all be there to help them.</p></speech>

It has been a great day for the campaigners from Donegal and the rest of the north west - a large turnout and support for the rally in Dublin, discussions during Leaders' Questions and now this motion.  However, the reality is that we should not be here.  We should not have had to force buses full of people to travel down to the Oireachtas to be heard.  We should not have families sharing their terror and trauma at watching their homes crumbling around them.  We should not have years of Government disinterest and disrespect for homeowners in the north west.</p><p>Homeowners, local authorities, schools and community halls should have been able to trust that they were not building with defective concrete blocks.  People should have been able to trust that the Government would provide an appropriate 100% redress scheme as per the precedent set in Leinster following the pyrite scandal.  Industry and insurance companies should have been held accountable from the first instances of the mica scandal.  That is &quot;Fianna F&aacute;ilness&quot; and &quot;Fine Gaelness&quot;, though - &quot;shoulda, coulda, woulda&quot;.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael would not listen until there was a national outcry.  They would not take action until affected voices got the ear of the national media.  They would not be shocked and angry until media outlets asked for quotes while they were milking photo ops.  It was shameful.</p><p>The people of Donegal, so often feeling like they live in the forgotten county, are making their voices heard now.  The Mica Action Group has been in existence since 2014.  Cassidy Brothers Limited, one of the manufacturers of the concrete blocks, was asked to provide a civil engineering company with the recipe for a typical block back in 2011.  At the time, the company said that there was a mix of 6.4% concrete.  Independent testing showed that the cement content was actually between 3.7% and 4.5%.  That is ten years ago now.  This is not a new issue.  It has not dropped out of the sky or happened overnight.  Families affected have been raising it for years, gathering their own evidence, analysis and testing and becoming experts on mica and defective blocks.  People affected are expected to continue repaying their mortgages and might also have to pay rent while their homes are demolished and rebuilt.  It is a national scandal.  I am delighted to see the country behind us in Donegal and our neighbours in the north west.</p><p>The Taoiseach stated today that this issue had not been highlighted in manifestos, yet I know of one manifesto that did highlight it.  That manifesto reads:</p> <blockquote> 	MY SOLUTION:  	- Deliver the long-awaited Mica Redress Scheme.<br /><br />- Address insurance cost issues for homeowners affected.<br /><br />- Ensure timely implementation of the scheme by Donegal County Council.<br /><br />- Provide 100% grants for mica-affected homeowners in line with North Leinster.<br /><br />- Meet the temporary accommodation needs of mica homeowners.<br /><br />- Amend the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act to relieve mica homeowners of property tax.  </blockquote>  <p>The report of the expert panel also contained the following observations: </p> <blockquote> 	Finally, it is not normal for concrete blocks to fail in the manner observed.  It is the Panel&rsquo;s opinion, which was supported by the laboratory reports provided, that the concrete blocks which deteriorated in the manner observed were not fit for purpose. </blockquote>  <p>It also stated: &quot;the Panel acknowledges that there has been reluctance by some key stakeholders to share information due to commercial sensitivities and for reasons of litigation&quot; and that it was &quot;clear to the Panel that the affected homeowners, through no fault of their own, are in a difficult position with very few, if any, realistic options available in order to obtain redress.&quot;  It is important that those responsible be held to account, but not at the expense of homeowners.</p></speech>

None of us in the Chamber can imagine the horror of looking at the walls of our homes as they split, as gaps appear between the walls and the floor and as holes open up beside doors and windows.  None of us can imagine that awful pain in the pit of our stomachs.</p>  <p>  I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for this timely and important motion and I recognise that the Government is not opposing it.  I will table an amendment to include homeowners in County Sligo.  I hope that it will be accepted by all.  I have written to the Minister of State about this issue.  I ask that he meet all four of the Deputies from the constituency.  Nearly two months ago, Sligo County Council also wrote to the Minister of State about this matter.  Blocks containing pyrite and mica do not respect county boundaries.  Homeowners in west Sligo suffer the same as those in Mayo and homeowners in north Sligo suffer the same as those in Donegal.</p>  <p>  The current schemes are inadequate.  People are being asked to spend large amounts of money on reports and assessments and there is no provision for renting accommodation, storage, etc.  I support the view that those who are responsible should be held responsible, but it is crucial that the Government provide a safety net for citizens and deal with those who bear the responsibility.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the approach that the Department has taken to the problem in Clare.  I raised the matter in the D&aacute;il at the end of last year.  The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, took that Topical Issue debate and invited an engineering report from Clare County Council.</p>  <p>I wish to acknowledge the work Clare County Council has done.  It is in the process of completing that report.  It did a study of five houses in County Clare and found pyrite, not mica, in all of them.  That report is near completion.  Through its investigations, it also discovered two estates in County Clare, which may have been built with blocks containing pyrite.  One may ask how that emerges out of nowhere.  Similarly to the houses, this has emerged after the insulation was carried out in the block cavity because when there is less air circulation, the problem manifests itself.  That is not to suggest the problem is caused by insulation.  Not at all, but it sometimes manifests after the houses are insulated.  It is estimated there are at least 50 private houses and there may be up to two council-built estates in County Clare in which pyrite blocks were used.</p> <p> From being a new problem, it is becoming a big problem.  I compliment Sinn F&eacute;in on bringing this motion and I ask the Minister of State to seriously consider fully compensating homeowners and then going after the manufacturers.  As Deputy O'Donoghue pointed out, some of these block manufacturers are large, multinational corporations.  It may well be the State is in a position to go after them but individual homeowners are, literally, putting their houses on the line in going after these huge corporations, because they will fight at every step of the way.  That is, unfortunately, how commercial litigation works.</p> <p> I ask the Minister of State to step in, carry out the works for the homeowners and then go after the quarry owners.</p></speech>

People power has spoken.  It needs to be addressed straight away.  Buying a house is probably one of the biggest investments in a person's life.  To be paying a mortgage and then having to pay rent because one's house is falling apart is intolerable.  There is an opportunity here for the Government, which should address the situation.  I have seen this figure of &euro;1 billion.  The Government is not afraid to spend &euro;3 billion in a hospital, where there does not seem to be any accountancy going on.  The same company will bring the Government to court again and pull another bill out of it, because that is the way the contract was done.</p>  <p>  However, these vulnerable people in these counties have been left high and dry.  I saw it in County Mayo a few years ago.  It is an intolerable situation.  There are companies out there, some of which I know in Dublin, which sold the product.  All of these companies are large operators which sold product.  They had to have product insurance whether they like it or not.  Some of them folded but there still had to be insurance there.  The State should go after them when all this is over.</p>  <p>  The State should look after ordinary people on the ground and make sure they are secure in their homes and that everything is sorted but should then go after these guys.  I have seen some of the guys, who have been involved in this pyrite situation, reporting others about tar plants and so on, because they are trying to have monopolies.  Monopolies should not be tolerated in this country.  These guys who are at that should not be.  The people of Ireland will not stand for what is going on.  There was insurance at the time, whether it is ten or 15 years ago.  The Government needs to go after them, to make sure it gets the money out of it because insurance companies are, once again, walking away scot-free.</p></speech>

I have listened closely to the comments and statements and I appreciate and acknowledge the level of anger and frustration felt by communities in counties Donegal and Mayo and beyond, as has been alluded to by other speakers in the House.</p>  <p>  Earlier today, I had the privilege of going outside to meet with the residents who were affected by this awful saga.  I received a submission from Savannah, a young girl out in the middle of the protest, in a respectful way.  For people who have travelled long journeys to be here in Dublin, adjacent to the convention centre this afternoon, the dignity and respect they carried in having their voice heard is commendable, considering the frustrations and nightmares they are going through.  As many allude to and speak about these nightmares, it is unbelievable what these families are going through, in terms of what is happening to their homes.</p>  <p>  I was outside, along with Deputies McHugh, Ring and Carey and Senator Burke, to engage with the residents and heard many of their personal stories throughout the afternoon and many of the speeches made by those involved in the campaign.  I also have been kept updated in all matters relating to the scheme, by my colleague, Deputy McHugh, and he has impressed on me and on the Government the need for change and the need to review this scheme.</p>  <p>  I met Fine Gael councillors, namely, Councillors Harley, Kavanagh, McGuinness and Sweeny in County Donegal, on the same issue a number of months ago.  I have heard loud and clear the voice of their community through them, its elected representatives from my party.  They were expressing their clear frustrations in terms of their community and what they are going through.  The Government has committed to providing solutions here.  I reiterate the statements made by and sentiments of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, earlier in that the scheme is now under active consideration by the Department and the Government, with a view to making it more accessible for the affected, defective concrete blocks in counties Mayo and Donegal.  The Taoiseach is already on record today in this House on the matter.</p>  <p>  Our homes are a place in which we seek refuge.  We go there for safety, security and to feel at ease and in comfort.  When one can no longer find refuge in one's home and when one is anxious and worried about the safety of oneself and one's family and the security of one's future, this has a lasting effect.  We must provide and assist homeowners and provide solutions for mica to enable them to again feel safe and plan their future in their homes.</p>  <p>  Members will be familiar with the scheme and the purpose for which it was set up, to deal with defective concrete blocks, cracks and fissures, which are affecting the structural integrity of people's homes.  The Department is engaging in ongoing dialogue with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, to provide clarity on whether eligible homeowners can access SEAI grant funding, while also availing of the defective concrete blocks grant scheme.  This would also help prevent a lock-in of carbon inefficiencies in their homes.</p>  <p>  Many comparisons have been made with the pyrite resolution scheme, which were well articulated by Members.  I accept the valid points made today and I reiterate discussions are ongoing between the Department, local authorities and the local action groups on the ground going through this issue.  We hear their frustration.  I acknowledge again the respectful way it was brought to us today.</p>  <p>  The Department and local authorities have engaged with local communities extensively, over the past decade, with a report of the expert panel on concrete blocks commissioned by the Government and published in 2017.  This report identified and investigated the issues and examined how best the Government could support affected homeowners.  The aim has always been to return dwellings to the conditions they were in before they were affected by excessive amounts of mica and pyrite.  I assure the House the Government is committed to improving supports for homeowners affected by defective blocks.</p>  <p>  We have heard the message carried out today by thousands of people who made the journey from counties Donegal and Mayo and beyond.  Work is under way to find a workable solution.</p></speech>

I also could mention Councillor Martin McDermott and Eamonn Jackson.  I also thank Deputy Mac Lochlainn and his colleagues for putting down this motion tonight and keeping this issue on the radar.  Today was an important day, as the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, pointed out, in meeting the people, listening to them and getting a good feel for where they are at.  I acknowledge Savannah Diver, as did the Minister of State, in presenting that letter to the Government.  We all talk about health and family and the importance of health and family in daily discourse, but what is health and family without a home?</p>  <p>   We have an opportunity, as a Government, to put the hand up and acknowledge the 90:10 scheme is not working, cannot work and will not work.  I had envisaged it working at its inception but when one really has a 70:30 scheme through the backdoor, it was never going to take off.  We have an opportunity.  The six-week period is important.  It is important we stick to that time period.</p>  <p>  It is also important not to get caught up in other parts of the plan of the working group over the coming weeks.  I refer to welcoming the extensive and potential reach and looking at the source of the problem and bringing insurance companies into the picture as well and seeing if there can be other sources of income.</p> <p>The Government cannot allow that to be used an excuse to delay the scheme.  People have waited long enough.  A decade is a long time in anyone's life.  It is longer than a life sentence in prison in many jurisdictions.  The Government cannot do this any more.  I am not just talking about us, as legislators, but about people at a very high level within the Civil Service, including those in the Attorney General's office, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or the Department of Finance today.  The Department of Finance is where the protest ended up.  Those people have to listen and understand that this is not just a monetary issue.  This is a life issue.  This is an issue of lives that have been on hold for too long.</p> <p> We all heard stories of people enhancing their houses during lockdown and doing work on their gardens, doing up their kitchens or buying new curtains.  Anybody who was living in a mica-affected house during Covid did not have that luxury.  All they had was an opportunity to spend more time in that isolation without hope.  I met a man today who said he has a digger at his disposal but he does not have the heart to even fix his lane because he knows his home is crumbling to pieces.  The Government has to make a big statement here and do the right thing.  Whatever it takes to rectify this issue and get it right, we have to do it.  This is an issue of paramount importance.  When we leave this place tonight or on Thursday and head up the road to our constituencies, we will do so in the full knowledge that we are going to homes that are safe and are not falling down.  The only difference between the houses that are crumbling at the moment and something like an earthquake is that in an earthquake, houses fall down immediately.  These houses are still falling down.  The difference is that they are falling down slowly and that has put trauma, heartache, anxiety, stress, pressure and strain on families and individuals.  The Government and the House have the opportunity to unite on this issue, to do the right thing and to honour these people whose lives have been on hold and who have had to endure such heartache for the past ten years.  We have the opportunity to do that and now is the time to do it.</p></speech>

The unity between Donegal and Mayo over the years has been extraordinary.  It has been many years since my colleague, Deputy Mac Lochlainn, and I raised this issue in the Seanad.  At that time, nobody would listen.  I commend the work of the action committees.  These are my neighbours, friends and people I know.  They are worn out by how they have been treated, by both the previous Government and this one.  The Minister name-checked all his colleagues and I want to name-check a few people as well.  Josephine Murphy and Dorothy Keane have fought for years to get this scheme in place.  When we first discovered pyrite in Mayo, the problem was, in the main, confined to the Erris area.  Those two people in particular, with others like Michael Healy, fought for years for a scheme to be put in place.  It is amazing that these people are not looking for compensation.  All they are looking for is their homes to be reinstated.  Laura Devers and Jaime-Lee Donnelly have taken up the case in Ballina, as have other members of the action group there, and I commend them as well.</p>  <p>  The other day, a man described to me how a bat came in through his house.  We have watched this happen over the years.  We have watched the cracks widen and the Government throw its hands in the air.  Then, it came along with a take-it-or-leave-it scheme.  That was the situation these homeowners were in with the so-called 90:10 scheme.  It was take it or leave it and it was almost as if the Government wanted people not to take it, so it could say it offered them something and then turn its back again.  What part of 100% does the Government not understand?  The people who were here today were very polite and mannerly, as the people in the north west are, but the Government should not mistake that for weakness.  Something has happened within the west.  There is unity within the west about not taking this any more.  We do not begrudge the people in the east the 100% scheme they received because they deserved it too, but why should we be treated differently just because we live on the west coast?  It happens time and again.  Enough is enough and we are not taking it anymore.</p>  <p>  Those responsible for what happened here, including the Government and light-touch regulators, have scarpered.  The insurance industry, the banks and the suppliers all disappeared because they are used to dealing with Governments that do not hold them to account.  They are used to dealing with Governments that are so close to them that they do not have to be held to account.  That has to stop now.  I saw this come up time and again in the finance committee, whether with the tracker mortgages, the insurance companies or whatever else.  It has to stop.  The Government is here to protect people and their livelihoods.</p>  <p>  Just because people have made applications to this scheme does not mean they have accepted that it is okay.  The scheme is clearly not fit for purpose.  We must look at the issues like the accommodation, windows, doors and energy.  I hear what the Minister and his Government colleagues are saying and that they empathise with people.  We need to go out of here this week and assure the people of Mayo, Donegal, Sligo, Clare and Limerick that they are going to get 100% redress.</p>  <p>  I am very proud to be from County Mayo and I am proud of the people who came here today.  We are fighting back and it is the Government's responsibility to end this nightmare for those people.  The Minister spoke about active consideration but that is not going to build any houses.  It is not going to put to right the wrongs that have been done here.  I ask the Minister to please not mince words.  He must ask the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste to come out and agree with the Deputies who have spoken here tonight.  They should instruct the local authorities on the changes to be made to the scheme in order that these houses can be reinstated.  It is not only the houses that are crumbling; it is people's lives.  I have witnessed it.  People's physical and mental health has deteriorated.  What has happened here is not right.  Did the people in 1916 die for citizens to be treated like this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-15a.274" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="19:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021061500041#OO00300"><p>I was very proud to stand today in full support of the people of Donegal, Sligo, Mayo and Clare, calling for justice.  They had many supporters here in Dublin who are also living in defective Celtic tiger-era apartments.  Many speakers have rightly noted that these families have been living with defective blocks for eight long years.  The expert panel on mica identified 2013 as the date pyritic and mica blocks were first discovered.  For eight long years, these families have been living with this scandal.  In 2017, the expert panel brought this issue to light and highlighted the action that should be taken.  Only a few months later, the Oireachtas housing committee unanimously endorsed the Safe as Houses? report calling for a redress scheme for all those affected by Celtic tiger latent defects.  Yet, it was not until 2020 that a scheme was even put in place, for which people would only be able to draw down money this year.  I am not going to repeat the comments of nearly everybody who has spoken today other than to emphasise that the scheme that is currently available to families in Donegal and Mayo, and, hopefully, in the future in Sligo, Clare and elsewhere, is simply not fit for purpose.  Anybody who would ask a family to pay &euro;7,000 for an engineer's report to get entry to a scheme did not understand the scale of the problem.  Whether it is a rate of 10%, 20% or 30%, these families should not have to pay for defects that they did not create.</p> <p>Equally, they should not have to pay for the storage and accommodation costs incurred while remediation is taking place.  Therefore, the one loud and clear demand from the streets of Dublin today and from this Chamber is for 100% redress and nothing less.  </p> <p> We must also understand that many council properties are affected.  That means that council tenants are living in defective properties.  Separate to the changes that I hope will emerge from the short review of this defective block scheme, local authorities - wherever they might be - must also be given the funding required to ensure that their tenants are not living in defective properties.  There has been some talk about whether we should compare different schemes.  Of course different schemes are different in detail but the core principle must be the same.  People living in properties with defects in the ground, in the blocks, in the fire safety set-up or in any other aspect of construction should not have to pay the associated costs.  One of the core principles on which the cross-party report, Safe as Houses?, was agreed was that ordinary owners who purchased in good faith should not be liable for the costs of remediation caused by the incompetence, negligence or deliberate non-compliance of others.  It is not their fault and they should not have to put their hands in their pockets.  </p> <p> I also have some concerns about a separate issue but one that runs in parallel with this topic.  The Minister set up a group to explore the issue of defective buildings.  It has met several times this year and the group is due to send a report to the Minister by the summer, in time for budget 2022, to feed into another remediation scheme for those in properties that have fire safety and structural defects.  My understanding is that the work of that group is very delayed.  It may not meet its target deadline of having a report with the Government by this summer, and, therefore, there may not be any redress of any kind for defects originating in construction undertaken during the Celtic tiger era, whether those buildings are in Dublin, Clare or elsewhere.  That would simply be unconscionable.  </p> <p> Therefore, I urge the Minister to not only complete the time-bound review in six weeks or less to ensure 100% redress but also to ensure that the separate working group on building defects concludes its work as a matter of urgency in time for budget 2022 to ensure that the thousands of homeowners living in apartments and duplexes with fire safety defects or water ingress or both are also given the right to 100% redress.  I wish to emphasise a point of all my colleagues, which is while today's demonstration was determined, there was also a clear underlying anger.  Eight years of a wait is too long.  It is not what people say in this Chamber tonight that matters, it is what they do in the days and the weeks to come.  If people think it will be possible to come out of that review with anything less provided for than 100% redress, then many more people will be marching in the streets of Dublin in the future and they will continue to have the support of Sinn F&eacute;in.  </p> <p> I am absolutely delighted, therefore, to support the initiative of my colleagues, Deputies Doherty, Mac Lochlainn, Conway-Walsh and others.  I urge all Deputies to not only support this motion, but to make 100% redress and nothing less a reality in the weeks ahead.</p></speech>

It is important to stress that the Government believes that it is in everyone&rsquo;s interest to achieve a sustainable, ambitious and equitable agreement on modernising the framework for international tax to reflect increasing globalisation and digitalisation.  Second, it is also important to highlight that reform of the international tax rules has now been part of a process since 2013.  Since 2018, Ireland has constructively engaged in the more recent discussions to find a solution at the OECD.  This is the subject of the current negotiations which are expected to conclude this year.  The OECD is proposing a two-pillar solution.  Pillar 1 concerns the allocation of a proportion of taxing rights, while pillar 2 is in regard to a minimum effective tax rate for larger companies.</p>  <p>  The Government noted the communiqu&eacute; of 5 June from the G7 finance ministers, which includes the desire for a global minimum effective tax rate of at least 15%.  Deputy Doherty asked a specific question about that meeting.  The only document which emerged from the G7 regarding that group's intent was the communiqu&eacute; to which the Deputy referred.  As important as that communiqu&eacute; is, and it is important, it is also important to stress that it now provides a large input into a process in which 139 countries are now participating.  The minimum rate does create challenges for Ireland and other small countries for good reasons.  It is my intention to continue to make the case for an agreement to accommodate Ireland&rsquo;s low but substantial 12.5% rate. </p></speech>

The announcement by the G7 of its intention to establish a global minimum effective corporation tax rate of 15% was the view of that group regarding where pillar 2 of that process should land, but there are other views.  Pillar 2 in any global minimum effective corporate tax rate will not be decided by the G7 alone, but will be subject to the agreement of 139 countries and jurisdictions under the OECD inclusive framework, including Ireland.  It is clear that this process has momentum and that the members of the G7 and the broader OECD are already seeking carve-outs and exemptions for strategic industries and economies under pillars 1 and 2.  It is also clear that they will doggedly pursue their own national interests in that process, as is the right of those countries.</p> <p>We must pursue an outcome that is fair and that works for all countries and jurisdictions party to the process, including Ireland.  It is our view in Sinn F&eacute;in that any agreement reached at the OECD should accommodate an effective corporation tax rate of 12.5%.  What strategy is the Minister going to adopt ahead of the G20 and OECD talks?  Does he believe that there is any support internationally for this approach?</p></speech>

First, in bilateral engagements with many Ministers, including the US Secretary of the Treasury, Ms Yellen, we will continue to make the case for legitimate tax competition within certain boundaries, with a recognition of the role that our rate plays for our country.  Second, inside the OECD process that will be intensifying, we will continue to make the case for that rate and will outline our broader views in relation to other elements of the OECD process.  We will do that across the coming three to four weeks.  There will be a further OECD meeting in July and another will take place in October.  In each of those engagements and in the preceding weeks, we will make the case for our rate and for the competitiveness of small countries.</p></speech>

Even if it is applied, it will not affect all companies or foreign direct investment, FDI, companies here in Ireland.  At this early stage, what is the Department's view of applying a minimum effective tax rate - whatever rate is agreed through the OECD process - across the board?  Is it the Department's view that there should be a rate specific to those companies that fall into the net of having annual turnover of &euro;750 million or more?  Is it now time to look at our competitiveness in other areas outside of tax?  The housing crisis, for example, has been called out by the National Competitiveness Council, NCC, repeatedly in this regard.  Education, research and development, infrastructure and quality of life issues such as childcare and housing are all crucial and will be even more important in the future, given the changes taking place internationally.  Is the Department considering committing extra resources and revenue to those areas?</p></speech>

That is a possibility but the case that we will be making is that regardless of where the rate ends up, if a rate is agreed at a global level, it should only apply to the very largest companies.  As Deputy Doherty has already noted, the communiqu&eacute; as it currently stands only applies to companies generating more than three quarters of a billion euro of global turnover.</p>  <p>  The Government has been increasing investment in other areas that are very important to our competitiveness.  Taxation is part of our competitive model but there are many different elements in that model.</p></speech>

Beyond that, there is no further detail agreed between the G7 economies.  That will happen within the OECD.  The detail will be determined within the OECD and that will then structure the way in which a reallocation of taxing rights will take place.  That is obviously something that is very important for Ireland.  I have already indicated that out of the two pillars that were up for negotiation, the one that Ireland was willing to initially support was the pillar that covered the reallocation of taxing rights but the direction in which this is now going is towards a potential agreement that will include both pillars.</p></speech>

Based on the formula proposed by the OECD, the Department of Finance estimated in January 2020 that this could reduce the State's corporation tax revenue by approximately &euro;2 billion annually.  However, the agreement announced by the G7 last Saturday arrived at a different formula, with market jurisdictions wielding taxing rights of over 20% of profits on earning margins above 10%.  That differs from the OECD proposal upon which the Department's estimations of tax revenue were based.  Can the Minister give us any projections regarding the impact of the G7 proposal on pillar 1, if it were to be implemented?  Can he give us further detail on the number or range of companies that would be impacted?  For example, under the other pillar, it is companies with an annual turnover of over &euro;750 million.  It has been reported that Amazon, with profit margins of 6% in 2020, could evade this measure.  What is the Department's view on that?</p></speech>

I am not in a position to comment on the tax affairs of any particular company.  Obviously what is driving the process overall is the understandable issue, namely, to address the gap between how tax structures are currently developed across the world and the increasingly digital nature of the global economy.  Deputy Doherty asked whether the Department has been able to update its revenue loss forecast from the G7 communiqu&eacute;.  We have not been able to do that because there is not enough detail in the G7 document to be able to form a view regarding how those policies would be executed.  That in turn would allow us to model it separately.  The second, more principled reason is that the G7 document is a communiqu&eacute; and is not yet an agreement.  We will develop our modelling as the OECD process continues to develop across the year.</p></speech>

While we know that developing countries will, in all likelihood, be pushing for stronger measures under pillar 2 to increase their own revenues, it is now clear that members of the G7 are seeking their own exemptions and carve-outs for strategic companies, industries and sectors in their own economies.  The British Government, for example, is reported to be seeking exemptions under pillar 1 for financial services in the City of London, with HSBC, its largest bank in terms of revenue generating more than half of its income in China.  Given that G7 members, like all countries and jurisdictions under the inclusive framework, will press for an agreement that serves national as well as international interests, it is only proper that we work on securing an agreement that serves the common, global good but also Ireland's national interests.  At this early stage, does the Minister have any views on what that would mean <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>this pillar?</p></speech>

I am talking about my views on the rates and on the need for an agreement that accommodates small and medium-sized economies and not just the larger ones.  In terms of what I believe an acceptable model could look like later on in the year, if agreement can be reached, it is one that will continue to be able to accommodate a low but substantial rate on a broad base of economic activity, as is the case in Ireland.  It would also be an agreement that would bring stability to issues that have been ongoing for some time.  An agreement brings challenges for Ireland but the lack of an agreement also brings challenges for Ireland.  A third feature of any agreement is that it is one that is balanced in the breadth of companies to which it applies, if agreement can be reached.  Obviously, our own domestic economy and the small and medium-sized enterprises within it are important and are a priority for the Government.</p></speech>

On 2 June, the European Commission published the 2021 European semester spring package.  As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, this exceptional semester cycle has been adapted to facilitate the implementation of the recovery and resilience facility, RRF, with the primary change being that for 2021 there are no country reports or country-specific recommendations, CSRs.  Instead, the spring package is focusing on providing budgetary guidance to member states.</p>  <p>  In that context, member states received three generalised budgetary CSRs.  For Ireland, these were: first, in 2022, to pursue a supportive budgetary stance; second, when economic conditions allow to pursue a budgetary policy aimed at achieving prudent medium-term budgetary positions and ensuring budgetary sustainability into the medium term; and, third, to pay particular attention to the composition of public finances, both on the revenue and expenditure sides of the balance, and to the quality of budgetary measures to ensure a sustainable and inclusive recovery.</p>  <p>  While the CSRs have yet to be discussed by finance ministers at ECOFIN, my Department has engaged with the Commission and other countries at the relevant Council committees and we have broadly welcomed the publication of this document in spring.  Once approved by ECOFIN, the CSRs will then be formally adopted by leaders at the European Council.</p></speech>

I imagine that when we get around to it again, if anything, that will be more so the case given the high levels of youth unemployment, so I want to focus on this for a moment.  The recent history in this State regarding training schemes has not been great.  I need only mention the infamous JobBridge scheme.  Participants in JobBridge at the time received &euro;188 per week plus a &euro;50 top-up, which was cheap labour.  Are we going to see a repeat of that?  What guarantees can the Minister give that we will not see a repeat of that?  Nearly 60% of people in JobBridge did not complete their internships and fewer than 20% were offered jobs in their host companies.  What guarantees can the Minister give the House that the next round of training, which the Government has in the pipeline, will not be of a similar ilk?</p></speech>

This is important in the context of this pandemic because young people have seen such a big change in their incomes and such a loss of jobs.  I assure the D&aacute;il that any plans we put together will be solely focused on how jobs can be created and young people can go into jobs where they will receive the training and support they need to accelerate their careers after the dreadful effects of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  I am aware of Deputy Barry's views on other schemes that have existed in the past.  He and I will differ on that.  Some of those schemes were effective in helping to create work and get young people into those jobs.</p></speech>

I have argued that a &euro;60, &euro;70 or &euro;80 top-up will not cut it and that there needs to be decent pay for trainees.  Will the Minister be more specific than the Minister for Social Protection and give us a broad outline of what the pay rates will be?  He mentioned that any plans will be solely focused on jobs.  What guarantees can be given that this will be real training and that there will be guaranteed jobs at the end of it?  At the very least, the percentage of job offers made should be well in excess of the 20% or less we saw with JobBridge.  Last but not least, we have been hearing about the training schemes in the pipeline for some time.  When will we get more information and detail about them?</p></speech>

For example, we have had good uptake in the apprenticeship and training programmes that have been put in place.  The Minister for Social Protection has said that as we get to the point where our economy is more safely and sustainably open, we will put in place additional training programmes through the Department of Social Protection to help young people get work.  Can I give the Deputy a guarantee that there will be jobs available to everybody at the end of them?  That will probably be a difficult guarantee to give because we cannot guarantee an outcome on behalf of an employer or somebody who was on a training programme.  However, I can guarantee the Deputy that we will do all we can to make sure programmes are in place that help young people to get back to work.  The Minister for Social Protection will outline the terms and conditions of those programmes when their design is finalised.</p></speech>

We know there is a problem with land hoarding which contributes to the high cost of housing and the lack of adequate supply.

The rate of the levy increased to 7% for sites listed on local authority vacant site registers from 2019 onwards, which site owners became liable to pay in January 2020.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage that it proactively engages with local authorities with a view to ensuring that the vacant site levy achieves its full potential in terms of bringing concerned sites into productive use.  In this regard, on 8 March 2021, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage requested the submission of a progress report on the collection of the levy by each local authority.  Responses have been received from each of the 31 local authorities.  The Department is assessing the responses received and intends to proactively engage with individual local authorities and identify any issues to be addressed.</p>  <p>  Each local authority has responsibility for the administration of the vacant site levy and register in its respective catchment area.  A change in Government policy would be required to reassign the responsibility for collection of the levy to another body.  The Deputy refers to the effectiveness of Revenue in collecting the local property tax, LPT, but it should be noted that the LPT is a self-assessed tax for which compliance is very high.  Collection of the vacant site levy involves a physical inspection regime which would not align well with how Revenue conducts operations in that area.  Careful consideration will be given by me to the role of local authority functions and to the capacity of the Revenue to take on further responsibilities.</p></speech>

Thanks to work being done by the <i>Business Post</i>, it has been reported that last year &euro;21.5 million was owed on vacant sites.  In that same year, &euro;21,000 was collected.  By any standards, the system is not working.</p> <p>The local authorities simply do not have the resources or personnel to do the follow-up work.  The figures speak for themselves.</p> <p> A solicitor and tax specialist who is experienced in this area has been in touch with the Minister's Department on several occasions with a proposal for how a new system might operate.  That system would be based on self-assessment but would include penalties unless people registered their properties.  Such people would have to produce a certificate at the point of sale of the property.  I ask the Minister to consider such a system.</p></speech>

They were liable at the 3% rate in 2019 in respect of their valuation for 2018.  For 2019, those 89 sites grew to 181 sites and, in 2020, grew further to 215 sites.  Demand letters were issued for 79 of those 215 sites and, as the Deputy has said, &euro;21,000 in payments was received in respect of 2020.</p>  <p>  It should be said this was never about revenue generation but was about the use of the land to see if a catalyst could be put in place for that land to be used more productively and efficiently.  I am going to give consideration to the future of this tax, its role and whether there is a case for it to be strengthened.</p></speech>

It proposes to put the onus on landowners to get themselves put on the register, for them to self-assess and to face a charge on their land when they sell it if they do not self-assess.  Minimal change to legislation, whereby the levy is turned into a charge on the land, would be needed to achieve that.  Such a system has a lot to recommend it because the present system is simply not working.  The purpose of the system is obviously not to generate revenue but it is to make hoarded land available for house building.  That is not happening at the moment.  If I send him further details of this proposal to put the onus on landowners to register their land, I would ask the Minister to look at them and learn from the success of other schemes in which Revenue has been involved, the non-principal private residence, NPPR, scheme, for example.  I am looking for a commitment that the Minister will consider that as a way of achieving what the levy is intended to achieve.</p></speech>

We ran a deficit last year of &euro;18.5 billion.  The deficit this year, expressed as a percentage of our GDP, will be larger than the deficit for last year.  I am well aware of the role of deficits and Government borrowing in stepping in to support our economy.  Over the past two years when the demands on our economy and society have been so great, I and the Government have run very large deficits for our country to enable a response to the health crisis we faced.  </p>  <p>  The ESRI commented on a particular issue relating to housing in its report.  Housing currently has a budget and funding allocation that is an all-time high for that Department in the amount of &euro;3.1 billion.  Total housing expenditure has now more than doubled since 2016 and capital expenditure for that Department has increased nearly fourfold over that period.  It is absolutely the case that we must reduce our deficit steadily and over time because of the level of high public debt that our country already has and because we also know that when a country is borrowing a lot of money during more normal times, it can be a source of vulnerability to the country.  We are already investing a significant amount of capital into addressing the urgent demands for housing for our citizens.  I will engage with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, regarding how we increase that investment further in the future.</p></speech>

We all accept that we are running an extraordinary deficit in an extraordinary time at the moment.  It would be remiss of all of us not to understand and accept that the Government has made a considerable investment to keep people safe, keep businesses open and keep people close to their employment at this unprecedentedly difficult time.  We acknowledge that, relatively speaking, the investment in housing is significant compared to previous years and situations.  However, it is nowhere near enough to deal with the underlying problems we have at the moment.  I agree with the ESRI that running a relatively small deficit on a mid-term and ongoing basis in order to allow us to invest in critical social infrastructure such as housing is going to be important not only from a social perspective but also from the point of view of productivity and competitiveness.  The Minister would acknowledge that the likes of IBEC and the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland have identified it as a key bottleneck and an issue we need to address.  If we need to borrow and can do it sustainably and sensibly, we should do it.</p></speech>

Has the Minister's attention been drawn to this report?  If so, has he read it?  If so, does he agree with the recommendation that the Government can afford to borrow and build the necessary housing?  That is the specific question, which I ask in the context of a severe housing crisis.  Telling me that we have doubled our housing budget has nothing to do with the question that is being asked.  If he could, I would ask him to address the question because we have a housing crisis.  I come from a city in Galway where people have been on the housing waiting list for 15 years.  Only one or two properties are available within the cap of the housing assistance payment, HAP.  That payment started off at a very low price when it was brought in by the Labour Party and Fine Gael in 2014 but it has now risen to &euro;1.4 billion.  That figure is taken from the ESRI report.  Will the Minister deal with the report?  There are some points in it that I do not agree with but I am asking for the Minister's viewpoint.  Is he aware of the report, what is his opinion on it and what is he going to do about it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-15a.335" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1462" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="20:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021061500045#SS01600"><p>Housing policy over the past decade has failed.  There has been an excessive reliance on developers and investment funds to deliver supply since the State withdrew from the housing market.  Today's housing crisis is causing serious social dislocation.  It is damaging the life prospects and chances of many workers and families in our communities.  It is also damaging for the competitiveness of the economy, as I mentioned earlier.  It is the natural outworking of an unnatural and damaging housing policy pursued by the Government.  The policy is shaped not only by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage but also by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  Professor McQuinn of the ESRI has demonstrated that even under conservative estimates, the Exchequer could raise &euro;4 billion each year in additional resources on a prudent and sustainable basis.  That would be enough to double the level of capital investment in housing from &euro;2 billion to &euro;4 billion in budget 2022.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been making that argument for years and the only reason for the Minister to oppose it would be on ideological grounds.  I ask him to commit to doing what the ESRI is calling for, that is, doubling the capital investment in housing and start to end the housing crisis that the Government's policies have caused and deepened over recent years.</p></speech>

In response to Deputy Nash, the answer is yes, I do.  I am well aware of all the challenges faced by so many with regard to housing.  We are putting in place a huge amount of additional investment to respond to it.</p>  <p>  I will say to Deputy Connolly that I am aware of it and I have read it.  I agree with some but not all of it.  Am I going to act on it?  I am facing many different demands to increase borrowing at the moment.  I cannot, therefore, commit to any particular action with regard to additional borrowing for one policy area.  That must and will be done in the context of the budget later in the year.  It is relevant to make a point about previous levels of capital investment when we are talking about how there might be a need to increase capital investment in the future.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Doherty, the State is not withdrawing from the building of homes in the country.  The State is currently the largest supplier and builder of homes in the country.  The reason we have increased capital investment for housing in the way we have is because of my acknowledgement of the need for the State to be a direct builder of homes.</p></speech>

The problem is that even when the Government has re-entered, it has not been up to scale.  Read what the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, said and stop dodging the question.  It said to double capital investment in housing.  Sinn F&eacute;in has been saying it year after year.  The Government has remained tone deaf to that message.  As a result of that, the Government has caused a housing crisis through its policies.  It did not happen by a national disaster.  It was a result of housing policies that the Minister and the Government have pursued.  Taking the politics out of it, the ESRI is saying that the capacity is there to double investment in housing from &euro;2 billion to &euro;4 billion.  That should be done in budget 2022 and that would start to end the housing crisis.</p>  <p>  The Minister might say he is going all in on investment funds and on developers and we will put this resource into social and affordable housing.  It is not cutting it, however, which the ESRI is saying.  The Government, therefore, needs to recognise that its policies have failed.  It needs to be humble enough to recognise that it has deepened the housing crisis.  It now needs to stop repeating the same mistakes over and over again.  Change direction, double investment in housing and start to end this crisis for so many families.</p></speech>

He might tell me what he disagrees with because I have highlighted some of the things said by the ESRI.  It said that without significant investment, another decade of inadequate housing supply, upward rents and upward costs of houses is looming.</p>  <p>  It sets out that one in three households that was not in receipt of housing supports was in trouble prior to the pandemic.  It was paying so much on rent, mortgages, etc.  It said that if we borrow at very low rates and build houses, it could reduce Government expenditure.  I want to correct something I said.  The ESRI told us that the HAP is &euro;1.4 billion in total.  That is the cumulative cost to date and rising.  Does the Minister disagree with any of that?  If he does, what is his solution to homelessness, which is costing a huge amount, to HAP, to the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and so forth?  What is his solution?  Are they just inevitable by-products of his ideology?</p></speech>

That is what I, this Government and the previous Government have been working so hard to do in responding to the many needs and challenges we know are there for our citizens in finding the homes they need at affordable prices and rents.  I acknowledge that we have much more to do.</p>  <p>  To answer Deputy Connolly's question regarding my views on the report, I believe things are missing in it.  The report does not make adequate recognition of the capacity constraints of our economy and the difficulties our construction sector has in growing in scale to deliver the housing output we need.</p>  <p>  Also missing from the report is an acknowledgement of the multiple other competing demands the Government and I face, and the need we will have, at the right point, to begin to change our level of borrowings.  In answer to the Deputy's question, I believe those issues are missing from the report.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Doherty, I am always humble in the face of meeting people who do not have a home or who cannot afford their rent or to buy a home.  I am, however, equally resolute in making the point that in face of that need, we have made huge increases in the amount of money available to respond to our great housing challenges.  This Government and I are determined to stick at it until we get the progress our country wants.</p></speech>

Given the extremely difficult year and a half we have been through, and the huge impact it had on many businesses as they have seen unprecedented restrictions on their ability to operate, what assurances can the Minister give to businesses and sole traders about their credit rating for the future?</p></reply>

The Government has announced a range of measures to assist companies to deal with the consequences of the Covid-19 restrictions and to ensure that they have access to sufficient liquidity.</p>  <p>  Lenders are obliged, under the Credit Reporting Act 2013, to submit information to the Central Credit Register, CCR.  Submissions of information to the CCR must be consistent with the arrangements agreed and in accordance with lenders' obligations under the Credit Reporting Act 2013.  The CCR does not produce credit scores.  Rather, the information on a credit report provided by the CCR is factual in nature and the information is provided to the CCR by lenders.  It contains no guidance, recommendation or prohibition for lenders on what decision they should make on an application for credit or repayment arrangements agreed with borrowers.  Subject to complying with applicable law and regulatory requirements, it is a matter for lenders, of course, to make their own lending decisions in accordance with their own credit policies and risk appetites.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank, as the regulator, has advised lenders that in their reporting to the CCR, they will need to apply judgment, for example, around whether a restructure has been agreed in response to an identification of financial distress and should be reported as such.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s SME regulations also set out the required treatment of SMEs by regulated entities with regard to the various aspects of business lending.  This includes detailed provisions around the credit application process, requirements regarding security, credit refusals and withdrawals, the handling of complaints, the managing of arrears and having in place policies for engaging with SMEs in financial difficulty.</p></speech>

I believe that misses the point a bit in terms of how extraordinary the situation is in which businesses found themselves.  When we were at the beginning of the pandemic, absolutely suddenly and without warning, revenue streams were cut off from businesses.  Yet, as the Minister knows, they had many fixed costs and bills they had to pay.  Many businesses could not pay those bills at the time in way that they normally would.  They found themselves, therefore, having to default on debt.</p>  <p>  What does the Minister have in place for those businesses?  I know and welcome the business supports that came thereafter for businesses at that particular time.  I do not want a situation where businesses now find that they are up and running, at last, but need an overdraft or a loan and find that they cannot get that because of the credit rating being downgraded, through no fault of their own, from what it was at the beginning.  They need assurances for that.  I know the Minister will agree that we need to save every possible viable but vulnerable business we can.</p></speech>

She asked me a question about credit scores.</p> <p>I made the point that we have credit records rather than credit scores and I outlined the way in which that would be dealt with by banks and by the regulator.  A point on which I agree with the Deputy is that we, of course, want to put in place the supports, and we have put them in place, to give every business that is viable but currently vulnerable every prospect of being able to survive this awful pandemic.</p> <p> In terms of the engagement I have had with the SME community on this matter, I have not, to date, seen the demand for additional borrowing one might expect.  The array of business supports we have put in place and the direct payments from the State have meant the demand for credit has not been as high as I would have expected.  I will keep the issue under review because I believe we will get to a point at which the demand for credit will grow.  I am confident we have a banking system that can recognise the difficulties SMEs were in during the pandemic and will still be in a place to lend to companies that are in a position to take on that additional debt.</p></speech>

However, I have been contacted by business owners to say that, when they looked at their credit rating, they found it had been impacted because of their inability to meet bills, particularly at the beginning of the pandemic.  This is something of which we need to be aware and on which we need a quick response to ensure every business that can will be able to stay open.  Given the employment those businesses create and their importance for towns, small and large, and rural areas, we need to keep them open.  I ask that the Minister take this point on board and recognise there are problems in respect of credit ratings.  We do not want those problems to increase if we are to support people in going forward to trade out of the horrific time they have been through.</p></speech>

In towns and villages throughout our country, there are small businesses that are even more important now than they normally would be.  That is why the Government has put in place so many supports to help them.  It is why we have the warehousing of tax liabilities and an employment wage subsidy scheme that is due to continue until the end of this year.  It is why, when small businesses leave the Covid restrictions support scheme, many of them will receive a significant payment to help them with their reopening.  It is for all these reasons that we are yet to see what the demand for borrowing might be.  My view is that demand will develop, if it does develop, later in the cycle of recovery.  Of course I will keep the issue under review but from the work the Central Bank is doing at the moment and from the work I see our banks doing, I believe all is being done to meet every credit need that is sustainable and affordable for businesses that are trying to reopen at the moment.  I expect the demand for credit is yet to come.</p></speech>

I assume the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage crafted this measure in the full knowledge of activities in the housing market.  Will the Minister indicate how many forward purchase agreements, which are exempt from the charge, were made prior to the introduction of this measure and in respect of which building completion and transactions have not yet occurred?  Will he further indicate how many units are involved under those agreements and how many agreements, involving how many units, have been made since the resolution was passed?</p></reply>

This new measure is triggered when a residential unit is acquired on or after 20 May 2021, with the look-back 12-month period commencing at that time on a rolling basis.  The units acquired during that period are aggregated.  When the tenth unit is acquired, it is chargeable at the 10% rate, and this rate also then applies to the other nine units and any other units acquired at the same time as the tenth unit.  However, while any units acquired before 20 May are taken into account in establishing whether the threshold of ten units has been reached, the 10% rate of stamp duty is not applied to those units but only to units acquired on or after that date.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, multiple purchases by local authorities, approved housing bodies and the Housing Agency are outside the scope of the higher stamp duty provision.  In this regard, he should also note that when putting this financial resolution on a permanent statutory footing, I propose providing an exemption from the 10% rate for the provision of the  mortgage to rent scheme by private sector participants.</p>  <p>  Finally, I am advised that the information sought by the Deputy in connection with forward purchase agreements is not collected by any Department.  However, I will explore with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage whether it is possible to put in place a reporting regime for agreements of this nature.</p></speech>

He has no idea how many forward purchase agreements are already in place, yet he exempted every single one of them from the 10% stamp duty charge.  He has no idea how many transactions have been completed since that date, yet he exempted them all from the increased stamp duty.  That speaks volumes about how the Government was dragged, kicking and screaming, to this point, where it did want to be in the first place.  The Minister did not want to tax the vulture funds and we know that from having this argument with him for the past number of years.  He resisted it at every single twist and turn.</p>  <p>  He has exempted some developments but he does not know how much is involved in that.  He does not know how many bulk purchases could happen over the next number of years because he has no knowledge of how many such agreements are in place.  As Minister for Finance, did he even look to find out that information?  Did he inquire about it at any stage or did he just say, "Ah well, let it be", when he exempted all of them?</p></speech>

I have information on the kinds of purchases, including forward purchases, that took place in recent years.  However, on the question the Deputy asked regarding forward purchases that are currently being completed or are under way, that information is not available to me.  This does not undermine the policy rationale for what I did.  The reason I excluded those forward purchases is that they will enable more apartments to be built and made available to rent and more homes to be made available to people in the future.  As the Deputy will be aware, taxation in regard to these investment funds occurs when income is returned to the investor who invests in the funds.</p></speech>

It is not about apartments.  He exempted every single apartment from this stamp duty charge.  This is about homes.  He exempted funds that are buying full housing estates if there was a forward purchase arrangement already in place.  That is the point.  It is nothing to do with apartments, every one of which is exempt in any case under his policy.  This is about people buying homes.  It is about what happened in Maynooth being allowed to happen again.</p>  <p>  The Minister has no idea how many such agreements are in place.  He could read the reports published online that would give him some detail in this regard.  His answer speaks volumes in that it shows he did not even look for that information or want to find it out.  He came before this House and said that every single forward purchase agreement for homes will be exempt where a contract has already been entered into, as will every such project that completes over the next few months.  This is being done because the reality is that Fine Gael did not want to go here in any case.  It was dragged, kicking and screaming to this place where it had to introduce a minimum stamp duty.  The provision in question will not make much of a difference because, if the rent yield is increased by approximately 10%, it will nullify the small stamp duty increase the Minister has imposed on only a certain section of homes.</p></speech>

It is many times higher than the standard rate of stamp duty because of the intention I have to deter these kinds of purchases in the future.  Of course, it must be seen in conjunction with the other aspect of that policy, namely, that it applies to ten or more houses that are purchased.  That is the other part of the policy that is put forward.  The only reason I put this policy in place is to get the balance right between trying to deal with an issue I accept needed to be dealt with, and allowing the supply in the future of more homes which will be apartments.  If we were to extend this practice to forward purchases as well, the net effect would be fewer homes built for people in the future.  I do not want to see that.  I want to see more homes available.  That is why the policy we have in place gets the balance right.</p></speech>

My officials, and officials in the Central Bank of Ireland, as our independent regulator, have been carefully monitoring developments to identify potential challenges in banking and financial services that could arise from Brexit and to take steps to prevent them occurring or, if that is not possible, to mitigate them.  Thus far Brexit has had limited impact on the industry in the short term, given the preparation and relocations already undertaken as part of contingency planning for a no-deal Brexit.</p>  <p>  A number of domestic legislative measures were introduced as part of contingency planning to mitigate some potential financial services risks, such as the insurance run-off regime and various legislative provisions to facilitate the successful migration of our settlement system from the UK CREST settlement system to Euroclear Bank Belgium.  The signed EU&ndash;UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement covers financial services in the same way that financial services are covered in the EU's other trade agreements with developed countries.  In addition to the few financial services provisions included in the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, both sides agreed to establish a memorandum of understanding on structured regulatory co-operation on financial services.  The memorandum will be an important measure to support continued co-operation between the EU and UK in financial services, given the integrated nature of our financial services systems.</p>  <p>  To conclude on that, many of the negative issues we were concerned about with regard to financial services and Brexit have not yet developed.  That is mostly due to the quality of planning put in place to deal with those risks.  We have also had some gains in financial services across that period.  In particular, I point to the success we have had with additional investment and employment from both Barclays and Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p></speech>

This is something the IDA is working very hard to deliver at the moment.  To date we have been successful in attracting additional investment into our country as a result of the efforts of the IDA and the Department of Finance.  The priorities I have at the moment are continued stability and safety, the protection of consumer rights with regard to financial services and ensuring the basic infrastructure of our financial services market continues to be secure with all of the change that is under way.  We have done really good work on that to date and we will of course continue to look at other opportunities that are there.  I point, for example, to some of the progress we have had with regard to rating agencies.  We have seen Standard &amp;amp; Poor's and Kroll Bond Rating Agency locate their European head offices here in Dublin.  We have done much but we do have more to do.</p></speech>

The opportunities really are there.  Our opportunities are more likely to relate to how we can increase the scale of the employers which are currently here, and how we can encourage them to have more operations and functions located here.  If one looks at where we stand from an employer point of view, the breadth of employer and the breadth of investor we have at the moment is almost as high as it could be.  As such, our focus should be on how we encourage and incentivise existing employers to locate more here.  We have done so well to date but there are more opportunities in the future.  As I have said, the IDA will lead in this, as will the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  We will help in any way we can while of course being mindful of our mandate in relation to financial stability and the need for proper and effective regulation.</p></speech>

As she will be aware, I am not in a position, nor indeed is the Central Bank, to intervene in the provision or pricing of insurance.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance, called the Solvency II Directive.  Consequently, companies cannot be directed as to how they price their policies or what terms and conditions they apply in relation to cover.</p>  <p>  It is my understanding that past claims history is one of the rating factors that insurers generally will use in making their individual decisions on whether to offer insurance, and what terms to apply.  However, I am firmly of the view that insurers need to take a longer-term perspective as regards their customers, particularly businesses that have been adversely affected by the pandemic and may have had to make a claim against their business interruption policies.  If insurers have experienced an overall reduction in claims costs during the pandemic period and expect savings to be made as a result of lower award levels arising from the personal injuries guidelines, they need to pass these savings on to consumers and in particular, businesses that may have been closed for much of the period.  This is particularly important as businesses start to reopen their doors and we work to restart the economy over the coming months.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, who has responsibility for insurance, recently met with individual insurers to press the need for premium reductions in this regard.  The Minister of State is taking this agenda and this issue very seriously.</p> <p>I know he intends to meet the providers later in the year to continue to monitor progress in this area and the impact of the overall reform agenda on both premium levels and risk appetites of insurers.</p></speech>

A business local to Belmullet has seen its insurance premium go from &euro;1,233 in 2020 to in excess of &euro;4,000 in 2021.  This is a small business with a small turnover.  Those kinds of extortionate increases would be crippling at the best of times but to try to find that kind of money after seeing such long periods of closure is impossible for many.  Insurance companies have not yet paid the business disruption claims and they are punishing customers for even making a claim.  We could potentially see a position where a business might see major hikes in premiums for making a claim that may or may not be successful.  Even if the claim is successful, the business should not be punished for making a claim.  This is the reality and it must be addressed.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, and I are very much aware of that reality and the challenge many small businesses face with the rising cost of insurance.  It is the reason this and the previous Government have had such a focus on this matter.  It is the reason the Minister of State has worked previously with the former Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, and the current Minister for Justice, Deputy Humphreys, on the implementation of guidance for claims settled in court precisely to create an environment in which we are seeing more reasonable claims.  That can lead to a change in the premiums that both the Deputy and this Government want to see.</p>  <p>  There are many different elements within our action plan for insurance reform that are being delivered.  So far, for example, we have made progress on the implementation of personal injuries guidelines and set up an office to promote competition.  There is also work under way on the role of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  There are many different elements on the way because we want to address the affordability of premiums and meet the needs of businesses that the Deputy raised.</p></speech>

It is already a scandal that insurance companies are trying to escape paying for business disruption, despite it being exactly the type of protection people in business pay for.  We have seen the industry resist passing on any savings to people's motor insurance resulting from the lockdown, and we have seen insurance companies trying to deduct State supports from insurance claims.  That is an outlandish attempt to turn business supports into insurance industry subsidies.</p>  <p>  There is clearly a view in the insurance industry that they can get away with what they want.  This attitude has been encouraged by successive governments that have failed to hold that insurance industry to account.  The Government must give a message to the business in Belmullet that has seen its insurance costs increase because it even made a claim, never mind whether it was successful.</p></speech>

I accept the point that the general matters I refer to may not be of solace to the specific company referred to by the Deputy, but it is the implementation of these policies by the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, along with the T&aacute;naiste, me and other Ministers that will make a difference in the coming months and beyond.  That is particularly true of the work done by the Minister for Justice and the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, on personal injuries guidelines that only came into effect on 24 April.  That is a very important moment in how we deliver the reform agenda this Government is committed to.</p>  <p>  As I indicated in my previous reply to the Deputy, the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, has already met representatives of the insurance sector on this very matter.  I know he and I will continue to meet them about this matter to ensure we can do all we can to see these changes beginning to be reflected in the premiums faced by businesses like the one referred to by the Deputy.</p></speech>

Following a review of the investment framework for credit unions in 2017, the Central Bank introduced amending investment and liquidity regulations for credit unions.  Since 1 March 2018, credit unions have been permitted to invest in regulated investment vehicles where the underlying investments are investments in tier 3 approved housing bodies, AHBs, for the provision of social housing.</p>  <p>  The regulations require that investments by credit unions in tier 3 AHBs must be made through a regulated investment vehicle.  The maximum permitted investment amount per credit union is 50% of a credit union's regulatory reserves where a credit union has total assets of at least &euro;100 million and 25% of a credit union's regulatory reserves for all other credit unions.  These limits may facilitate a combined sector investment in tier 3 AHBs of close to &euro;700 million.  It is a very substantial investment that can be facilitated.</p>  <p>  As such, the Government and the Central Bank have fulfilled their role and it is now up to both the credit union and social housing sectors themselves to progress and develop any specific funding mechanisms.  I understand three groups are seeking to establish special purpose vehicles, SPVs, to allow investment into tier 3 AHBs, including the two credit union representative bodies, the Irish League of Credit Unions and the Credit Union Development Association.  It should be noted that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has primary responsibility for the formulation and implementation of policy and for the preparation of legislation relating to housing.</p></speech>

Our credit unions are among our most trusted financial institutions and are uniquely placed to support the delivery of housing and many retrofitting schemes.  The Irish League of Credit Unions, representing approximately 226 credit unions with an estimated &euro;18 billion in assets, looks set to follow in the footsteps of the Credit Union Development Association by linking with investment partners, as the Minister of State mentions, to form a special purpose vehicle to invest in the sector.  Last summer, this association announced plans to launch a social and affordable housing fund, backed by more than 50 of its member unions.  In co-operation with Initiative Ireland it intends to lend up to &euro;300 million per year to deliver more than 1,000 homes annually.</p>  <p>  The credit union sector has demonstrated it has the capacity to contribute to lending in this sector, and given the precarious nature of banking in this country, it will provide an appropriate vehicle for certain future homeowners to borrow, especially for social and affordable housing.  Is there any permission for credit unions to engage in lending beyond the three AHBs mentioned by the Minister of State?</p></speech>

I mentioned already that there is what is called headroom of up to &euro;700 million that the credit union movement can invest in these housing projects.  It is a question of them agreeing the structure of the special purpose vehicle if they choose to go down that route and getting clearance from the Central Bank of Ireland when there is a detailed proposal.</p>  <p>  Today I met representatives of 30 credit unions in an organisation called Cultivate, which provides loans for the agri sector.  They mentioned restrictions on borrowing but the Central Bank has made it crystal clear that no credit union in Ireland has gone to it recently seeking to extend the limits they are allowed.  None of them has reached the individual lending limits to date.  I encourage credit unions to put proposals to the Central Bank as quickly as they can.  I hope the Central Bank can deal with those applications for special purpose vehicles and the associated regulatory matters in a very timely manner.</p></speech>

I have looked at previous parliamentary questions on this matter.</p> <p>It was noted, as was said, that the three credit union bodies have indicated that they are interested in pursuing this.  Is there any other institution or group of credit unions on the horizon that we were unaware of up to now?  Perhaps the Minister of State will expand on that, if it is the case.</p> <p> The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage ultimately has responsibility for formulating policy and proposing appropriate legislation, which is fine.  I take the point that credit unions are quite happy with the criteria as outlined by the Minister of State, but will he elaborate on whether he believes the criteria inhibit in any way the potential for credit unions to come together to pursue this?  Does he believe that the easing of any regulations to allow for the credit unions to come on board is necessary or appropriate?  I would just like some elaboration on that.</p></speech>

One way is through the SPV we have discussed, which is a complicated exercise.  The loan ultimately comes from the SPV in which the credit union has an investment, rather than coming through the credit union's own front door.  I would be much happier to see credit unions being able to lend through their own front door, in their own name, rather than through an SPV.  The most important thing that credit unions can do when they are beginning to work on it, and I gave the example of the agricultural sector, is to collaborate where they can to do a lot of their back-of-house work such as credit checking and financial modelling.  If they come together on a collaborative basis without having to form an SPV, this would be another option.  Finally, the major credit unions with substantial assets are in a position where a number of them are giving individual mortgages.  I would like to see more of that as time develops.</p></speech>

We are aware of the important role played by credit unions throughout society.   It is one of the most trusted brands by the people when it comes to dealing with their financial affairs.</p>  <p>  A number of commitments are set out in the programme for Government, including a review of the policy framework in which credit unions operate.  As part of the review, the Department has held extensive engagement with the credit union representative bodies since September 2020 to seek feedback on their key priorities for the sector.  I met with representatives of the sector and with different groups who made proposals.  I am examining each and every one of the proposals, with staff in the Department of Finance. </p>  <p>  On supporting and enabling the sector to grow, I will outline some recent developments in lending and investment regulations, SME, lending, access to finance for retrofit, current accounts and investment in approved housing bodies.  The Central Bank has in recent years completed reviews of both the lending and investment frameworks.  Since January 2020, credit unions have a combined capacity to provide up to &euro;1.1 billion in SME and mortgage loans, with additional lending capacity available for those that can comply with certain conditions, or on approval by the Central Bank.  As at December 2020, credit unions had combined mortgage and SME loans of &euro;344 million, an increase of 12% on the previous year.  There is tremendous scope for them to continue doing that.</p>  <p>  I welcome the announcements that 19 credit unions, supported by Irish League of Credit Unions, the Credit Union Development Association and Metamo, have been approved by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment for participation in the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme.  This is a tremendous opportunity for credit unions to obtain finance at low cost where the State guarantees 80% of the actual loan and the risk to the credit union is low.  They can give out unsecured loans up to &euro;200,000.  It is a fabulous scheme and I encourage as many credit unions as possible to take this up and participate in the scheme as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

In my area in Carlow they do so much good work.  I must, however, ask him about the levies on the credit unions, which is a concern.  Covid has been hard for people and they are trying to save an extra few euro.  The credit union now has funding.  It is important that the Minister of State would look at mortgages across all of the credit unions.  Some credit unions are able to give out mortgages, but others are not, which is a concern.  It is my understanding that 18 months ago the Government changed some of the loan criteria.  Originally, in Carlow the credit union had a loan term of 25 years.  This has now changed to ten years.  A person can borrow up to &euro;100,000 over ten years, not 25 years.  I also have concerns about this.  Even though we all know the great work done by the credit unions I ask the Minister and the Minister of State to examine these issues.  People depend very much on credit unions, which are very much community-based.  I ask that these issues be looked at.</p></speech>

She also mentioned the credit union in her own home town.  It is important to note that 51 credit unions, representing some 50% of the sector in financial terms, currently have approval to provide current accounts and debit cards.  This is the way forward.  They must be able to meet the modern day requirements.  I encourage the other credit unions in the sector to move into that area.  Some credit unions offer a current account and cards but only allow a credit union member to withdraw cash from certain ATMs.  I would like the credit union movement to have cards that can be used in any ATM of any financial institution.  Getting more people using credit union facilities will help them to grow.  I want to see the credit union system lending more money.  Credit unions have a surplus of savings and deposits.  It is important that they lend so they can earn a good rate on the loans, and earn income into the future.</p></speech>

The funding is there.  This must be looked at.  More than ever we are now seeing the housing crisis, and there are more people investing in their homes during Covid by decorating and so on.  This is what it is all about and this is what we need to encourage.  I ask that we would work with the credit unions a bit more on what we could do to give out more loans, and on what the criteria are, in particular the criteria under which can invest and what they can invest in.  This needs to be looked at.  Even though I welcome the good work being done on all sides, there are issues that need to be addressed.  We are all blessed with the number of credit unions in the State.  They do an excellent job but they have money and we must make sure that this money gets out to the communities.  We cannot have any barriers.  I ask that no barriers are put in front of any credit union.</p></speech>

They are definitely held in very high esteem.  She referred to levies earlier.  Last year the Minister signed an order that dramatically reduced the levies payable by credit unions from this year onwards.  It was one of the biggest single reductions they have ever achieved.  We have assisted the credit union sector with legislation to allow them to hold their AGMs virtually, which had not been provided for in legislation up to now.  Practically every credit union in the State has now held its AGM in a virtual manner, which had never happened previously.</p>  <p>  Following the closure of Bank of Ireland branches and Ulster Bank, the only financial institution left standing in many towns throughout the State will be the credit union.  There is a tremendous opportunity for them to increase their volume of business in the local communities now that other banks are closing their branches.  There is also a tremendous opportunity for them to meet with business people, especially from the SME and retail sector, to provide loans, which they need to do to earn interest and to continue to grow and prosper.</p></speech>

This scheme has made a massive difference to workers and employers throughout the country.

I hope we will be able to change it over time.  The scheme has played a role in the protection of many jobs in County Carlow and counties throughout the country.

It is great to know that this week 100,000 citizens from throughout the country will be getting either their first or second jab.  This will continue in the weeks and months of this year.  In any decision the Government will make regarding supports in future there must be a balance.  We cannot keep the supports we have in place in an unchanged format forever but I have never met an employer who wants to be on the scheme.  Employers who set up their own companies want to be standing on their own two feet, covering their own bills and covering their own wages and not reliant on the State for help to do it.  On the other hand, any change in the scheme that is too sudden or quick will run the risk of creating big challenges for employers and their viability.  We are trying to get the balance right and I believe we have done so to date.  We will continue to monitor closely how the scheme is operating and whether it offers us any guidance on the design of the scheme in future.</p></speech>

The reality is that this is a group of parents are often quite stigmatised and receive very little support.</p><p>Tusla will do its best to support a family to prevent a child coming into care but once a child comes into care, the child becomes the centre.  We are told children's welfare should be paramount.  The child becomes the centre and the parents are frequently left behind.  This causes several problems.</p><p>First, it undermines the parents fundamental rights.  We have seen in a recent study from UCC which looked at the use of voluntary care agreements how parents can be left confused, bewildered and unsupported and this ultimately undermines the free and informed consent required for a voluntary care agreement and their own fundamental rights.</p><p>Furthermore, when a child comes into care, this is a horrendous process.  It is often a necessary process but it is a process that engenders huge amounts of loss, anger, grief and bereavement, all of which is totally understandable.  My experience has been that parents are left sitting with those feelings and they are not given supports.  This creates hostility between them and the social workers which makes the social workers' job harder, which puts more stress on them and, ultimately, the children lose out because parents are less able to engage with access, are less able to engage with reunification and are less able to engage meaningfully with the social work department.</p><p>Ultimately, this is about children's rights.  By providing these supports, we can meet children's rights better.  A parent who is supported to engage with the family safety plan, reunification and access, and who is able to process that loss and grief so that the child does not get caught in the crossfire between a suffering parent and the social workers where access becomes a front in the battle, ultimately supports those children.</p><p>There are some local support projects doing this, for instance, Clarecare which provides excellent and wide-ranging support, but we need something at a national level.  I know this works for two reasons.  All one needs to do is look at Clarecare and the work it does, but also at Empowering People in Care, EPIC.  EPIC supports young people in care.  It is an independent advocacy service for young people in care which could do so much more with proper resourcing.  They support young people with a care history, some of whom are parents and some of whom are parents whose children are being taken into care.</p><p>I worked as a social worker taking a child into care from a parent who had a care history herself and she had an advocate from EPIC.  That was a significant benefit.  The case was not easy.  It still had its difficulties but we had somebody there who could help the parent engage in the process, who could provide counselling supports for them, who could link them in further with other supports, and who could help them engage meaningfully with those in the social work department to make the process less traumatic.  It helped them to engage in access after the fact that so that even though their child was in care, the trauma did not have to continue and they ultimately had a more stable placement supporting the rights of the child and supporting the child in care.</p><p>This is a much-needed service.  There have been<i>ad hoc</i>attempts within Tusla and the HSE over the years which often have been met, not with outright hostility but certainly with a slowness or reluctance because the focus has been on the child.  It is time we looked at the child in the context of his or her family even if that child is in care.</p></speech>

The Deputy posed this Topical Issue matter a while ago and he facilitated me by moving it to today.  I thank the Deputy for that.</p>  <p>  The issue the Deputy has brought to our attention is a very important one.  There are approximately 6,000 children in care in the State.  Of those, a very large proportion, 93%, are in foster care and a small number live in residential care.  The vast majority of children in care need to stay in contact with their parents, siblings and extended family.  Good relationships between parents, children and carers lead in the best outcomes for children in care.</p>  <p>  Placing a child in care and away from his or her birth family is a serious decision and it is only made after extensive social work intervention, assessment and consideration.  When a decision is reached that a child needs to come into care it is preferable if this can be done with the consent and agreement of the child's parents.  Such an agreement enables the parent or parents and the social worker to work more effectively to address difficulties within the family which led to the need for alternative care, and to work towards the safe return of the child to the care of the parent or parents.</p>  <p>  Sometimes it is not possible or feasible for such an agreement to be reached and in those circumstances Tusla will apply to the courts for a care order.  It is more common for children to enter care with the voluntary agreement of their parents.  Where the child's care plan identifies that a child should stay in care for a longer period, best practice is that Tusla applies to the courts for a care order.  From his professional background, Deputy Costello will be well familiar with all of these processes.  Providing a positive experience to children in alternative care is a key aim of the Irish care system and central to this is the provision of secure and stable placements.</p>  <p>  Data collected by Tusla indicate that a very small proportion of children in care have three or more placements within a year - 2% in 2019 - which is indicative of good overall placement stability within the care system.  Data also show that at year end the proportion of children in care who are on a care order is higher than when children are admitted to care.  At the end of 2019, almost three quarters of the children in care were on a care order.  This may mean that children are staying in care longer and as a consequence, his or her status has moved from a voluntary agreement to a legal order.  This is also indicative of good placement stability.</p> <p>Throughout lockdown, my Department has heard from many parents about their views on contact with their children over that difficult time.  Tusla issued guidance for parents, carers, staff and children on how best to manage visits and stay in touch.  Tusla's CEO emphasised that face-to-face visits were to happen if at all possible, even during the most stringent periods of lockdown.</p> <p> As we emerge from Covid, my Department and Tusla want to learn from that experience and hear the experiences of parents throughout the crisis, including their ability to continue engaging and having familial relationships with their children.  Mr. Bernard Gloster has met the Children's Rights Alliance on the issue of supporting parents whose children are in care.  There are plans for a scoping of potential services for parents affected by this issue.  That work is in its early stages, but there is a clear plan in Tusla to consider what supports can be provided to parents.</p> <p> Officials from my Department have met representatives of an existing service that has worked with parents of children in care over many years.  That organisation also produced supportive guides for parents during lockdown.  It is hoped initiatives like those, which were initially developed to address local needs, can be scaled nationally.</p> <p> I will look into the particular service that the Deputy mentioned, Clarecare.  I am happy to continue engaging with him to see how we can develop the research further.</p></speech>

If it has not already done so, it would be useful if the Department engaged with the team in UCC that conducted this research and suggested these reforms.</p><p>I sent the Minister's office some information.  These independent advocacy services are important, and they are commonplace in other jurisdictions.  In Ireland, they occasionally provide support for parents who are in care, but that is done on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis and if the parents happen to be part of those advocacy services already.</p><p>I am happy to engage with the Minister again.  I appreciate he is not in a position to micromanage Mr. Gloster and the operations of Tusla, but he is in a position to show leadership to and influence Tusla.  Strong support for parents' rights as well as for parents in their journey through their children's time in care ultimately supports the rights of their children as much as supporting the children while they are in care does.  Frequently, children are left with a conflict in loyalties between their placement by Tusla in a home in which they can grow up safely and their family of origin, to whom they are still deeply connected.  Anything that can support that connection while maintaining their safety supports children's rights.  It is a matter of parents' rights and children's rights.  We need to lead strongly.</p></speech>

We hope to make proposals for a significant amendment of that legislation in the near future.  I look forward to working with Deputy Costello and other Members on the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  There is a great deal of work to be done and we can significantly reform the law in that area.</p>  <p>  Regarding voluntary and representative groups that support children in the care process, I met Empowering People in Care, EPIC, early in my tenure as Minister and was impressed by its commitment to children and young people in care and by the structured way in which it sought to advocate for children.</p>  <p>  I take on board the Deputy's comments about the importance of parents having a voice in this process.  I am happy to engage with the Deputy further on understanding what that voice would look like and how it could be best amplified, for example, by directly representing parents in particular situations and, on a wider level, influencing policy.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is right about the conflict some children in care experience for a while.  The stresses and strains of time spent in care should be lessened as much as possible for the child, but also for the parent.  We will consider what we can do in that regard and I will continue to engage with Tusla.  Mr. Gloster has always shown leadership on these issues and is reform minded.  I am happy to continue engaging with the Deputy on the matter as well.</p></speech>

Cork County Council commissioned a report by Maynooth University to examine its funding streams, including the roads budget, the town and village renewal scheme, the rural regeneration fund and LEADER.  It is not getting a proportionate amount of funding.  The Department has to accept there is a funding shortfall for County Cork.</p><p>County Cork is not just Cork city.  It is a vast county.  I represent its Duhallow and Charleville regions right down to Dunmanway and from Ballydesmond to Ballincollig.  It is a huge area.  Our constituency is as large as some counties.  The geographical spread of the county needs to be reflected on by all Departments that are issuing funding.  While they can tick a box and say that so many projects are funded in each county, a proportionate amount of funding is not being given to the County Cork.</p><p>Down the years, the local authority has administered the county in three different regions: the north, the west and the south.  These areas could be three independent units for funding.  The Government and its Departments need to consider this matter seriously.  Despite the amount of CL&Aacute;R and rural regeneration funding that has come to Cork in recent years, some fantastic projects are still without funding.  Through LEADER companies or the local authority, they have made significant efforts to apply to, or make expressions of interest to, Departments for funding, but they have been shot down.</p><p>I would like to see a recognition that there is a lower amount of funding going to the county <i>per capita</i>.  The size of the county needs to be reflected on.  There are ways of ensuring more funding goes to the county.  Since it already has three administrative areas, legislative change is not required to ensure sufficient funding can be provided.  I could talk about the amount of funding coming through other schemes as well.  It does not reflect the county properly.</p><p>I am raising this matter because there is a significant opportunity.  We have fantastic communities across the county.  I am privileged to represent some that have proposed great and innovative ideas.  As we have seen in recent months, people are now looking at rural areas as a viable option.  Despite the crazy planning policies of the past 20 years, they view rural areas as the best places for them and their families to live.  We should follow them and enable that.</p><p>We should examine rural areas to ensure adequate funding is being provided to them under the various headings and schemes.  Those Government schemes are innovative, excellent and well thought out in terms of their aims and aspirations, but it is important County Cork get a fair and balanced amount of funding under each and every heading through which funding is provided by the Government to local councils.</p></speech>

It is a wide-ranging report which covers funding from a variety of different Departments for a range of issues and schemes.  Many of the funding lines are outside the remit of the Department.  The report has also been sent for consideration to other relevant Government Departments.</p> <p> The funding system for local authorities is complex with authorities deriving their income from a variety of sources, including local sources such as commercial rates, charges for goods and services and funding from central Government.  Most of the funding from central Government must be used for specified services.  These can be grouped into five broad programme categories: recreational, education, environment, housing and transport.</p> <p> On funding streams specifically from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Housing, &euro;135.3 million and &euro;167.5 million was provided to Cork County Council in 2019 and 2020, respectively.  The increase between 2019 and 2020 is due to an increase in housing funding, as well as funding in respect of the Covid-19 commercial rates and other Covid-19 related expenses which occurred in 2020.  It is a matter for each local authority to consider how it can maximise local income sources and manage its own spending in the context of the annual budgetary process.</p> <p> Local authority members may decide, as part of the process, to vary the annual rates on valuation, ARV, and local property tax, LPT, in order to increase the revenue available to them.  I note for 2020 and 2021, Cork County Council raised its LPT rate by 5% and 7.5%, respectively, forgoing the maximum 15% raise, or just over &euro;3 million in 2020 and &euro;2.4 million in 2021.</p> <p> I also refer to the recently announced plans to reform the local property tax.  These reforms will involve bringing new homes which are currently exempt from LPT, into the taxation system, as well as providing for all money collected locally to be retained within their county.  This will be done on the basis that those counties with a lower LPT base are adjusted via an annual national equalisation fund paid from the Exchequer, as is currently the case.</p> <p> The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, recently published the heads of the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Bill 2021.  The Bill will give effect to a package of measures, in line with the programme for Government, to address the future of the local property tax.  The legislation required to implement those changes falls under the remit of the Department of Finance, as a tax policy matter, and will be considered by the Houses of the Oireachtas in due course.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, also signalled the Government's intent to move to 100% local retention from 2023.  Any changes to the allocation process may be considered in that context.</p></speech>

The issue here is the findings of the report we are talking about.  The report stated that we are not getting our fair share of funding under various schemes.  The report has been independently verified.  The research was commissioned by the county council.</p>  <p>  The residual and persistent shortfall in financial allocations to Cork county is evident across several Departments and public bodies and these are associated with a failure to allocate it on the basis of three established administrative divisions and the persistence of a county basis or a branded tiered model.  That is the finding of the report.  The independent report states residual and persistent shortfalls in financial allocations to Cork county are evident across several Departments.</p>  <p>  It is as clear as that.  I can talk about all the schemes and communities which need funding.  They are all worthy of being mentioned here, but the reality is there is a residual and persistent shortfall.  I ask the Minister of State to take my concerns back to the Department, to the officials who are going through this.  We need clear political leadership to say County Cork has had shortfall across all Departments and that shortfall will be addressed, whether it is in the town and village renewal scheme, CL&Aacute;R, the rural regeneration programme or the roads programme.</p>  <p>  I plead with the Minister of State to take these concerns back.  I am raising this issue out of the most genuine concern for the communities I represent, because they need funding from the Government.  When we are not getting our fair share of Government funding, it is clearly an injustice to our people.</p></speech>

I will be relaying Deputy Moynihan's message to the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, and the Minister, Deputy O'Brien.  As I stated, the report has also been shared with other Departments.</p>  <p>  I refer to the unprecedented support for local authorities during the Covid-19 pandemic.  One of the earliest priorities of the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, was to secure funding to provide a waiver of commercial rates for businesses impacted by the pandemic, while supporting local authorities.  In 2020, Cork County Council applied a 100% commercial rates waiver to just over 9,000 businesses and recouped &euro;34.7 million from this Department.</p>  <p>  In recognition of Covid-19-related income losses and additional Covid-19-related expenditure incurred in 2020, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage provided funding of &euro;6.7 million to Cork County Council.  Given the ongoing impacts of Covid-19, the Government's support for local authorities continues.  The Government has introduced a commercial rates waiver for 2021, which has been extended to the end of September, at an estimated cost of &euro;480 million.  This waiver applies to businesses most seriously affected by ongoing restrictions.</p>  <p>  As with all public health measures and associated supports, the waiver of commercial rates will be kept under review, as has been the case since the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic.  The Department will continue to engage with the local government sector and individual local authorities on the financial impacts of the pandemic and provide them with the necessary financial supports.</p></speech>

I appreciate the opportunity given by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, coming to the Chamber to take this Topical Issue matter.  At the weekend, the world's eyes descended on a beautiful part of Cornwall, St. Ives, for the important G7 summit.  It was the first G7 summit since the onslaught of the Covid-19 pandemic and the change of administration in the United States.  It was an important change of administration which gave great hope to those of us who truly believe in multilateralism, international relations and common sense among liberal western democracies.</p>  <p>  Sadly, the entire summit was overshadowed by the continuing failure of the British Government to implement the basic elements of the Northern Irish protocol in the withdrawal agreement, an agreement signed, ratified and introduced mere months ago.  It was signed, ratified and introduced by this British Government.  This British Government negotiated and ratified this protocol.  This British Government won an 80-seat majority in its parliament on the back of this protocol.</p>  <p>  However, this British Government has utterly failed to approach this in a sensible way.  We approach another looming deadline.  This entire sorry Brexit process has been punctuated by looming deadlines and cliff-edge moments.  We see the British Government approaching the end of a grace period when it comes to chilled meats, among other things.</p>  <p>  The approach has not been one of conciliatory measures, being proactive and productive or meeting responsibilities in their most basic form.  Unfortunately, we have seen a British Government absolutely trash the protocol it negotiated, ratified and sought election on.  What is even sadder is seeing the British Government minister who negotiated these Brexit agreements continue to undermine them in his own press, at parliamentary committees and among other leading politicians.</p>  <p>  It is a worrying approach and it is a difficult approach for those of us in Ireland.  There is no such thing as a good Brexit, but at least with the protocol and the trade and co-operation agreement, TCA, we can limit the worst damage.</p>  <p>  However, the decision by this British Government to go for the hardest of Brexits has serious consequences for this island, North and South.  The impact of those consequences has been largely offset by the protocol, but that protocol needs to be implemented.  If there are difficulties in implementing it, we can address them.  I, in no way, underestimate the displeasure, especially among the unionist community in Northern Ireland, with aspects of the protocol.</p> <p>However, I also do not accept some of the exaggerated claims about the protocol.  The supermarket shelves in Northern Ireland are not lying empty and the protocol is not responsible for riots in the street.  It is, however, being used and abused by people across this island who should know better and who are responsible for dialling down the rhetoric.</p> <p> People ask where we go from here and what the most obvious solution is.  The obvious solution is, of course, a sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, veterinary agreement between the EU and the UK, which would remove 85% of the necessary checks under the protocol.  Brexit creates borders and checks and the protocol allows for very limited and minimal checks at the ports of entry into Northern Ireland.  It also provides Northern Ireland with a great deal of opportunities and it is sad that only a very small minority of politicians in Northern Ireland have a forward-thinking approach to realising those opportunities.  The question I am putting to the Minister of State this evening is how we ensure this protocol is implemented in a manner that protects Ireland, the European Union and the very fragile peace on this island.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-15a.442" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1503" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="22:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021061500056#DDD00200"><p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta Richmond as an &aacute;bhar t&aacute;bhachtach seo a ard&uacute; anocht.  The protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland is a joint solution by the United Kingdom and the European Union to the serious challenges raised by Brexit on the island of Ireland.  The agreement took more than four years of negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union, exploring all the other options and ruling them out.  The UK and the EU together found and agreed a solution, which was the protocol.  It was a joint effort by the EU and the UK and so its implementation must also be joint.  In that regard, the UK must show a commitment to delivery and to working alongside the EU.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the many challenges we face, large parts of the protocol are being implemented and the sky has not fallen in.  Last week, a meeting of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement Joint Committee took place, offering an opportunity for the EU and the UK, working together, to take stock of progress in the implementation of the protocol to date and to consider ongoing challenges.  Engagement at official level to try to find solutions to the outstanding issues is continuing and we fully support and encourage those efforts.  It is worth remembering that a majority of elected members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and a majority of the elected MPs in the House of Commons from Northern Ireland supported the protocol and continue to do so.  Quite frankly, that is not a narrative we hear in the British media.</p>  <p>  In recent days, G7 leaders made clear to the UK Government their concerns around the implementation of the protocol, the peace process and political stability in Northern Ireland.  A small country like Ireland was present at the G7 because the European Union, through the Presidents of the European Commission and the European Council, was there representing all of us.  That is the power the European Union gives to all of us, and to small member states in particular.  Further UK unilateral actions without consultation and agreement would be problematic and damaging to the technical efforts that are under way to agree further flexibilities.  We need to have genuine partnership and to work in problem-solving mode for the benefit of all the people of Northern Ireland, not just those of a particular viewpoint.  There has to be compromise and the protocol is the compromise.  The European Union has shown time and again that it is a willing partner.  The UK must show its willingness by honouring the commitments to which it has already signed up, which it negotiated, agreed and voted through its parliament, and it must solve challenges in good faith.</p>  <p>  An SPS agreement, as Deputy Richmond said, would be a pragmatic way forward, even on a temporary basis, and would create the space for longer-term arrangements to bed down.  This would immediately reduce the level of checks on agrifood products by up to 80%.  We have heard from people right across the political, business and farming sectors that they want such an agreement.  It would be simple, concrete and popular.  President Biden has been clear, as was I in my media engagements last week, that such an agreement would not stand in the way of a UK-US trade deal.</p>  <p>  The protocol has never disrupted the supply of medicines and the EU will ensure there will be no disruption to the supply of medicines in Northern Ireland.  We will continue to look for flexibility in order that the negative impacts of Brexit on the people of Northern Ireland are minimised.  That is what the protocol is about.  I had engagements last week in Slovenia and Austria and I saw the EU's solidarity and unity on this issue, which for so long has been a mark of the EU's approach to Brexit.  The same holds for this Oireachtas.  Across all parties we have been united in support of the protocol, the majority united on Northern Ireland, and we have engaged in detailed implementation.  We will be calm, measured and united in our approach.</p></speech>

Even though the G7 should have been talking about far weightier issues such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the climate emergency and vaccine solidarity across the world, I welcome the engagement of all G7 members on the legacy of Brexit and the importance of the Northern Ireland protocol.</p>  <p>  One thing that is very important and which always bears repeating is that the British Government has ownership over this protocol.  This is not a foreign construct or something being foisted upon the unionist community in Northern Ireland by the European Union or, indeed, by Irish Government Ministers here in Dublin.  Ultimately, the problem here is not the protocol.  The problem is Brexit.  Brexit is causing all these problems and the protocol offers the easiest set of solutions.  Every opportunity must be taken to engage North-South, east-west, across the European Union and across the global community, and to reiterate that there are solutions to the issues some people have with the protocol.  Crucially, there are also opportunities for everyone on this island in this protocol.  We need to dial down the rhetoric, engage with people and seriously address their realistic concerns.  Some of the language chosen by certain people in the United Kingdom, Great Britain and Northern Ireland to describe Ministers in this Government has been absolutely disgraceful.  I urge the Minister of State to use every effort to engage with our friends in London and clarify the very constructive and productive role the Irish Government has always played in this sorry Brexit process, as well as across the EU and across this island.</p></speech>

I reiterate that the protocol makes no change to the constitutional status of Northern Ireland.  That is set down in the Good Friday Agreement.  I want us to get to a place where the implementation of the protocol is fully realised in a way that works for Northern Ireland.  There is an onus on all of us leaders and politicians to engage openly with citizens, businesses, politicians and community leaders on the protocol.  We need to be clear and honest that the alternative to the protocol is not life as it was before Brexit but much deeper and more difficult disruption.  There is no agreed alternative to the problems caused by Brexit on the island of Ireland.  We spent four years going through those alternatives until we came to the protocol.  It was the best available solution to those challenges, to which the UK and the European Union agreed.</p>  <p>  Brexit has inevitably meant changes for businesses, sometimes difficult ones.  However, there are some businesses in Northern Ireland that have no issues whatsoever with the protocol.  Some major companies have examined its contents and adapted their business models.  There are significant potential opportunities for Northern Ireland through the protocol, with open access to the rest of the UK internal market and to the entire EU Single Market.  No industry is greater placed to avail of those opportunities than the Northern Ireland sausage industry because the biggest pork plant in Britain and Ireland is in Northern Ireland.  For all this nonsense about a sausage war, there is massive production of it in North of Ireland.  There is evidence of increased interest in Northern Ireland as an investment location but stability and certainty are needed to ensure this and realise that potential.  We know that unilateral action on sensitive issues in the North of Ireland never works.  The only sustainable approach to the current challenges requires the UK and the EU to work together to find pragmatic solutions.  I urge all parties in this House to remain resolute in their support for this measured and calm approach, and I know they will do so.  I also thank our EU colleagues for their continued engagement and solidarity on the detail of this issue.</p></speech>

Aer Lingus has stepped in to ensure the international routes are filled and we have now heard an Estonian airline has taken the Dublin to Kerry route but has left Donegal behind.  We must ask how the Department was not aware of a potential problem in the first place.  In addition, many people are now left without a service, and many of those were using Donegal airport to access connecting flights to get to work in England, for example.  The most difficult situations of all are perhaps those of the cancer patients who depend on these flights to get their treatment in Dublin.  The local cancer care committee had eight patients booked in for flights this week.  Members of the committee are now going to travel with patients to ensure they get their treatments and they are not left alone.  If only our Government had that kind of commitment to our citizens, we would not have been in this kind of situation in the first place.  However, it is vital this situation is addressed now and a new operator is found for Donegal Airport.</p></speech>

I pleaded with him to drop the idea of going for the tender process and to embark instead upon the emergency procurement process.  I am glad to say that has been announced this morning, and it could mean we can have these services up and running within what the Department estimates will be several weeks, by early next month.  I welcome that our concerns, which we put in writing, have been taken on board and that this approach has been adopted.</p>  <p>  However, I implore the Minister of State to recognise the importance of every day which passes.  As Deputy Pringle said, this service is of great importance and especially for cancer patients.  I spoke to Mary Coyle of Ionad Naomh P&aacute;draig who operates that community service.  Every cancer patient leaving west Donegal who cannot take a flight faces a nine-hour round trip.  Some of those people simply cannot make the journey by car.  They are not doing it and appointments are being cancelled.  Therefore, it is very important the Department fast-tracks this process.  The middle of July is too late.  I want to see this service back up and running in a few weeks and I implore the Department to bring this about.</p></speech>

However, staff and unions have been warning that jobs would be lost without a proper plan and appropriate supports.  The closure of Stobart Air brings this reality home and highlights the vulnerability of our airports.  In the past year, Cork and Shannon regional airports have been hit with losses.  Job losses in airports are being disproportionately felt by precarious workers such as cabin crew, which is also a disproportionately female workforce.  We saw the closure of the cabin crew base in Shannon and a temporary lay-off of staff in Cork has also been announced.  To add insult to injury, staff are also facing a 20% pay cut and the removal of sick pay.  Small employers in west Cork and everywhere are going above and beyond in their efforts to retain their staff with the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS.  Why is an international airline not doing the same?  How will the Minister of State respond to ensure the protection of these jobs, and especially the more precarious ones, such as cabin crew?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-15a.449" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="22:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021061500057#EEE00500"><p>The ongoing crisis in aviation has had a devastating impact in the mid-west.  When is the Minister of State's Department going to wake up to this crisis?  How many job losses and warnings will be needed before action is taken?  Shannon Airport is on its knees and we see no action being taken by the Minister responsible for aviation.  To be clear, commissioning yet another report is not acting.  It is pushing the solution further down the runway.  Sinn F&eacute;in's position has been absolutely clear.  We called for robust checks and controls at our ports and airports, including at the pre-departure stage, as well as post-arrival testing, 100% follow-up and a support package for workers in the industry to protect jobs and strategic connectivity.  In May, Sinn F&eacute;in called for temporary temperature screening at airports.  We again called for this in June and for a traffic light system.</p>  <p>  The recommendations of the aviation task force report have not been implemented and neither have those contained within the Oireachtas report.  Independent reviews were undertaken by the Limerick Chamber of Commerce and others, and yet nothing has been done.  A threat now hangs over 500 jobs at the Lufthansa Technik operation at Shannon, 81 cabin crew have already lost their jobs with Aer Lingus and no action has been forthcoming from the Minister.  The time for more reports is over.  It is time now for action.  We are potentially witnessing the collapse of an international airport, huge damage is being done to the mid-west economy and the Minister with responsibility seems devoid of any idea of how to respond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-15a.450" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="22:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021061500057#EEE00600"><p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to update the House on what the Government is doing regarding the sudden announcement by Stobart Air that it was ceasing operations.  I refer to the impact of this announcement on connectivity to Kerry and Donegal, Government support for the aviation sector and affected employees, and the current crisis in the aviation industry and its impact on the mid-west.</p>  <p>  As Deputies will be aware, Stobart Air contacted the Department in the early hours of Saturday morning to advise that it was terminating the franchise agreement with Aer Lingus and its wet lease agreement with British Airways, BA, with immediate effect.  This resulted in all Aer Lingus regional flights to the United Kingdom operated by Stobart Air also ceasing with immediate effect.  Regrettably, Stobart Air's plans to secure a new buyer failed over the weekend and this action resulted in Stobart Air commencing a process of voluntary liquidation.  The announcement is deeply regrettable in respect of the 480 Stobart Air workers directly impacted by this decision.</p>  <p>  The restoration of regional connectivity is of critical importance to the Government.  The market has already moved to fill some of the lost routes, with Aer Lingus and BA CityFlyer now operating temporary replacement services which will cover most of the affected routes operating out of Dublin and Belfast City airports.  Together with rerouting options, this will allow passengers impacted by the situation to return home.  Regarding the PSO air services from Dublin to Donegal and Kerry, work is under way in my Department to launch an emergency procurement process to try to restore air services on these vital regional routes as soon as possible.  My Department plans to issue a request for quotes directly to airlines in the coming days in accordance with applicable EU rules on air service public service obligations.  It is anticipated the emergency procurement process will be completed by early July with a view to services being recommenced by the new operator or operators as soon as possible thereafter.  The new contract will be subject to a maximum term of seven months and will operate according to EU law.</p>  <p>  To mitigate any further disruption to these services, my Department will also launch a procurement process, for a maximum of four years, for the continued provision of the services after the temporary contract has expired.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, and I will continue to engage closely with aviation stakeholders, including those in Kerry and Donegal airports, to keep them informed of plans in this regard.  I am happy to advise that several airlines have been in contact to indicate their interest in operating these routes.</p>  <p>  The Government is aware of the ongoing impact of the pandemic on the aviation sector and it has put in place a range of supports for businesses, including the aviation sector.  These supports include the wage subsidy scheme, the waiving of commercial rates, deferral of tax liabilities and the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS.  Liquidity funding is also available through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund for medium and large enterprises, and this is being availed of.  The Government also allocated funding of &euro;80 million for aviation-specific support in 2021 in recognition of the impact of Covid-19 on our smallest airports in Donegal, Kerry and Knock.  In addition to the &euro;21 million in funding under the regional airports programme, a further allocation of up to &euro;6 million to regional airports under a state aid compliant scheme will also be available in 2021.  Applications for funding under this scheme are being assessed by my Department and I hope to be able to allocate funding in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  In acknowledgement of the severe impacts on our two State regional airports and in recognition of the importance of these airports to the south west and mid-west regions they serve, an unprecedented &euro;32 million is also being provided in support to Cork and Shannon airports this year.  Additionally, my Department is assessing applications for funding of these airports and Dublin Airport under a &euro;20 million Covid-19 supplementary support scheme, and I expect to be able to provide funding under this scheme shortly.  This support will allow the airports the flexibility to provide route incentives and airport charge rebates to stimulate recovery and lost connectivity.</p></speech>

It is interesting that she noted that "the market has already moved to fill some of the lost routes".  If that is what we are depending on, then we are in bother straight away.  I also note the Minister of State said a move had been made to make the PSO service happen.  That is good, and I hope it will happen in weeks rather than anything else.  There is some foresight in seeking to run the tender for the next four years in tandem.  I hope that happens because, in reality, that is what is going to make the difference.  The last thing we want is to be back here in seven months' time facing another crisis.  Therefore, I wish that process will continue.</p></speech>

I also discussed with him the fact other airlines were interested in this lucrative PSO deal.</p> <p>I am pressing the Government tonight to see if this process can be shortened in any way.  The Minister for Transport said that the process would begin next week but the Minister of State has just said that it will begin in the next "number of days".  I must emphasise again that every single day counts, with patients being able to travel to Dublin by air for cancer treatment instead of having to make a nine-hour trip by road.  Can we shorten this by any amount of days so that we can get it up and running quicker than envisaged in the written response, which refers to early July?</p></speech>

Similar letters were sent to Shannon cabin crew before the permanent closure of the base.  The employment wage subsidy scheme is much more appropriate than pushing people onto social welfare.  It is worth noting that employees in the same sector such as pilots and engineers are not being temporarily laid off, only those in the more low-paid categories.  How is the Government going to address this specific issue?  Where is the plan and the supports for employees in a sector that was bound to be disproportionately affected by the pandemic?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-06-15a.455" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="22:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021061500058#FFF00300"><p>To maintain Shannon as a viable international airport, it is crucial that connectivity be maintained, especially the routes to London Heathrow, Boston and New York.  Having worked in the travel industry for 19 years, I have no doubt that travel restrictions were necessary to combat the pandemic.  What is also evident is that the lack of Government support for the industry has put us in a situation where we may lose an international airport and the associated jobs and connectivity.  Aviation workers need a recovery plan.  In fact, they needed such a plan months ago.  It is simply unacceptable that we do not have chairperson of the Shannon Group.  At a time of crisis, it is simply staggering that the position remains unfilled.  I appreciate and am sympathetic to the challenges posed by protecting an aviation industry when passenger flights have been grounded due to public health but dithering does not save jobs or airports.</p></speech>

There are also references in the national economic recovery plan to additional supports for the aviation sector, if required.  All of this is under consideration.  I am aware of the stresses and concerns for employees in the sector but the Government has acted quickly.  We have been watching the situation closely.  What we wanted to do straightaway when Covid struck was to protect our airports and infrastructure to make sure they were in a position to rebound through this.</p>  <p>  On the PSO and expediting that process, we engaged on that over the weekend.  Officials have been engaging with the European Commission on that process.  I assure Deputies that the process will happen as fast as possible.  This week the Department will write directly to airlines.  They will need a week to reply but every effort is being made to expedite the process.  I am hopeful that by the time we open up international travel on 19 July, we will have those routes in place, all going well.  </p>  <p>  On the issue of the market responding, it is a positive step that the market responds and is a good sign for Ireland.  We should look at that positively.  The fact that the market stepped in and that there are expressions of interest for the PSO routes is positive.  The Deputies can be assured that regional connectivity and restoring international travel in a safe way are priorities for Government.</p></speech>
