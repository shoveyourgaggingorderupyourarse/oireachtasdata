What actions is the Minister taking in terms of having that funding restored?  What actions is he taking to try to counter some of the false narratives being put forward by the Israeli authorities about these NGOs?</p></reply>

Ireland is fully committed to funding civil society organisations and human rights defenders in Palestine as a key part of our support for the Palestinian people.</p>  <p>  We are working closely with our EU partners on the issue and EU officials have engaged with Israeli authorities with regard to the basis for these designations.  I understand the European Commission's consideration of the information provided by the Israeli authorities is ongoing.  Irish officials at the permanent representation to the EU are in close contact with the Commission and Ireland&rsquo;s representative office in Ramallah and embassy in Tel Aviv are actively engaged with the EU and other stakeholders, locally.  Past allegations of the misuse of EU funds with regard to certain Palestinian civil society partners have not been substantiated.</p>  <p>  I made a statement on 27 October expressing concern at these designations and directly raised this matter with Israeli officials during my visit to the region between 1 November and 5 November.  Ireland supported the holding of a meeting of the UN Security Council on 8 November which addressed the NGO designations, as well as settlement announcements.  Ireland also highlighted concerns at the designations and their impact at Security Council meetings on 30 November and 21 December and recalled the importance of civil society at the most recent meeting on 19 January. </p>  <p>  Ireland funds Al-Haq, as well as Addameer, which are two of the designated organisations.  We, in co-operation and consultation with other donors, maintain a high level of oversight of our civil society partners.  My Department has robust controls in place to ensure that funds are used or distributed as agreed, in line with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s public spending code.  Ireland will continue to support Palestinian civil society organisations and human rights defenders and the critical role they play in promoting international law, peace, human rights and democratic values.</p></reply>

Indeed, the Commission launched its own investigation to some of these claims that had been reported by Israel and found absolutely no basis whatsoever in those allegations by Israel, yet the funding has still been suspended.  Will the Minister join me in calling on the Commission to reinstate that critical funding to those civil society organisations?</p></speech>

My Department and myself are satisfied that the relationship we have with both Al-Haq and Addameer gives us reassurance that these organisations are doing good work and should be supported in doing so.  My understanding from our engagement is that the Commission's consideration of the information provided by the Israeli authorities is ongoing.  I have not seen that information, but we will continue to talk to the Commission to understand why it is making those decisions.  Ireland is open, of course, to seeing any evidence that may be provided by the Israeli authorities, but, as of yet, I have not seen any evidence to suggest these organisations should be designated as terrorist organisations.</p></speech>

Following investigations and despite requests, including calls I have heard from the Minister in the past in this Chamber, for the Israeli authorities to hand over the information they have, if indeed they have it, the silence is deafening.  This confirms my belief there is no information and these are baseless allegations designed to undermine the excellent work these organisations do in exposing and highlighting the illegal actions by Israel.  The move by the European Commission to suspend this funding has had wide consequences.  Other parliaments and organisations are withholding and suspending funding based on the move by the Commission, which is based on these false allegations by Israel.  We need to send out a clear, strong, united message from this House that any attack on civil society organisations and human rights groups doing work to expose apartheid policies in Palestine must be opposed and the funding must be reinstated with immediate effect.</p></speech>

Since this debate began on the back of the announcement that was made by Israeli authorities, of course, we have been open to looking at any evidence that may be provided.  However, as of yet, I have seen no evidence to suggest that the organisation we fund or, indeed, the others that have been named should be designated as terrorist organisations.  That is my view.  Of course, we have to be open to hearing or seeing evidence, if it can be provided, but until we see that evidence and are convinced by it, we will continue to advocate for the funding of these organisations.</p> <p>Ireland has consistently been a strong voice for human rights defenders and for civil society groups across the world, and we continue to be, including in Palestine.  Of course, we have to be open to seeing evidence, if it is there, of wrongdoing but, as I say, I have seen no such evidence.  We will continue to interact with the European Commission on this issue.</p></speech>

EU member states are in agreement that there is no military solution to the conflict in Yemen and all parties should agree to an immediate ceasefire.</p>  <p>  In addition to significant diplomatic efforts, the EU has provided nearly &euro;1 billion to Yemen since 2015 in development, crisis response and humanitarian assistance.  At a national level, Ireland has contributed in excess of &euro;32 million in humanitarian funding to Yemen since 2015.</p>  <p>  As a member of the Security Council, Ireland has engaged extensively in support of the UN's efforts to end the conflict in Yemen.  I have held discussions with the UN special envoy for Yemen as well as Major General Michael Beary, who was recently appointed as head of the UN mission to support the Hudaydah Agreement.</p>  <p>  I have also engaged extensively with the countries of the region, including the foreign ministers of Yemen, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, stressing the need to work urgently towards a resolution of the conflict.  In fact, yesterday I spoke to my counterpart in the UAE on this issue.</p>  <p>  Sanctions are an important foreign policy tool for the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security.  To be effective and impactful, sanctions generally need to be agreed by a large number of countries.  For Ireland, this typically means aligning with sanctions regimes agreed at the EU or UN level.  There is not currently a consensus among either the EU or the UN Security Council members on the introduction of sanctions against Saudi Arabia.</p>  <p>  Ireland will continue to support all efforts to end the terrible conflict in Yemen, including in the context of our position on the UN Security Council and as an EU member state.</p></speech>

This has left tens of thousands of people dead, including 10,000 children either killed or maimed.  Some of the pictures that have consequently come out of Yemen are almost incomprehensible.  It is grotesque to watch how a country such as Saudi Arabia, which is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, basically inflict absolute terror on Yemen, which is one of the poorest countries in the world, and that juxtaposition of having one of the wealthiest countries in the world bomb Yemen into the Stone Age.  The world looks on because the bombs that are destroying Yemen are American made and American funded.  There has to be sanctions.  There has to be justice and some sort of accountability regarding Saudi Arabia.</p></speech>

I think it will be solved by political engagement across the region and at UN level.</p><p>Regarding Ireland's position on arms exports to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, Ireland does not supply military equipment to any of the parties to the conflict in Yemen.  Arms exports are a national competence in the EU but all EU member states are subject to the common position on arms exports.  Each arms export licence must be assessed against eight criteria, including that the recipient country must respect international humanitarian law, and it is for each state to make this assessment as a national competence.</p><p>Having been involved in many discussions with different parties in the region in trying to find a way forward on this issue, including Iran, which I visited last year, I believe that this issue will be resolved through politics and diplomacy rather than sanctions.</p></speech>

Did he speak to his counterpart in regards to not only the human rights violation in Saudi Arabia, but also the situation in Yemen?</p>  <p>  Has the Minister spoken to his counterparts in the EU about action against Saudi Arabia?  What is going on in Yemen is war crimes, not according to me but according to NGOs and civic bodies, on the basis of the ongoing bombing of civilian areas.  If there was ever a need for unity on violence against Yemen, it is in this situation.</p>  <p>  Obviously, people are angered by what is going on in Yemen.  On 26 March, people from Saudi Arabia and Yemen who live here are holding a day of action against the ongoing war crimes against Yemen.</p></speech>

When I visited Tehran last year, primarily focused on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA, discussions, I also had a discussion on Yemen and the influence that Iran has on the Houthis in that conflict and certainly made clear our desire for Iran to use its influence on Houthis in the context of that conflict.</p>  <p>  I also visited Saudi Arabia and had a long discussion regarding its involvement in the conflict in Yemen as well as, of course, speaking to the previous UN special envoy, Mr. Martin Griffiths.  I have met the current EU special envoy as well.</p>  <p>  Ireland will remain engaged on this, speaking to all sides.  We are also conscious of the recent terrorist attack that happened in UAE as well, linked to conflict in Yemen.  This is a regional issue that needs international intervention.  Ireland will continue to try to make a constructive contribution towards bringing about a ceasefire.</p></speech>

I am glad to have an opportunity to update the House on this issue.</p><p>Ireland's National Plan on Business and Human Rights 2017-2020 was launched towards the end of 2017.  Ireland was the 19th country in the world to publish such a plan in response to the endorsement of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights by the Human Rights Council in 2011.</p><p>The implementation of this whole-of-government plan was overseen by an implementation group comprised of representatives of Government, civil society and business.  Both the plan itself and the programme for Government committed to a review of implementation.  This review was undertaken by my Department in consultation with stakeholders during 2021.  A draft report was considered at the special session of the multi-stakeholder implementation group on 31 May.  This forum included participation by a member of the UN working group on business and human rights, a business and human rights expert from the Danish Institute for Human Rights, and officials from three EU member state Ministries.</p><p>The Government noted the finalised review at its meeting on 3 December 2021.  It is published on my Department's website:  (2017- 2020).</p> <p> On the proposed UN treaty on business and human rights, as I have previously stated, Ireland is open to examining options for progress on a legally binding instrument.  As the Deputy will be aware, the EU holds many of the competences in this policy area.  Accordingly, Ireland is engaged in the treaty process through the Union.  At the October negotiation session, the EU offered to work with the drafters to find a path forward.  Ireland supports this constructive approach.  I expect a further draft of the proposed instrument to be developed over the next six months or more.</p> <p>  Finally, I remind the House that the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy 2020-2024 contains a suite of commitments on business and human rights.  Together with other EU member states, Ireland is supporting and shaping the implementation of these commitments.</p></speech>

I am sure the Minister will agree Irish companies have a responsibility to respect human rights, workers' rights and environmental standards wherever they operate.  Unfortunately, however, this is currently done on a voluntary basis and that is simply not acceptable.  If we are serious about respecting human rights, that should be mandatory.  There are many delays in respect of the UN treaty, which is unhelpful.   We are going into the seventh round of talks and there is considerable foot-dragging in that regard.  We can follow other countries such as France, which in 2017 brought forward legislation, or Germany or Norway, which also brought forward binding legislation to ensure businesses would respect human rights.  That is a track we must follow.</p></speech>

The detail of this sustainable corporate governance proposal is expected in the near future.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is following this file closely in both Brussels and Dublin and, while my Department has no direct role in the transposition of any directive of this nature, we stand ready to assist colleagues in that Department in any way we can.  We are trying to work within an EU system that is in development to ensure what the Deputy is seeking, namely, to make adherence to human rights standards and sustainability standards mandatory as part of corporate governance.  That is something we can develop collectively as the EU.  The European Commission is giving good leadership on that issue and we certainly support that.</p></speech>

We can strengthen whatever comes from the EU and that work needs to start now.  For far too long, human rights have been impacted negatively by Irish companies such as the ESB, which imported coal for decades from the Cerraj&oacute;n mine in Colombia to create electricity in this State while indigenous people's rights were trampled on.  Similarly, Airbnb operates in occupied Palestinian territories, and because there is no mandatory binding legislation here, they were allowed to do that.</p>  <p>  The facts speak volumes; a voluntary treaty or system simply does not work.  If we are serious about human rights, this needs to be done on a mandatory basis.  I welcome some of the work going on within the EU but it should not tie us down.  We can supersede that and go further, in the same way as Germany, Norway and France.</p></speech>

We have made clear in Brussels and Geneva that Ireland favours constructive engagement in the treaty negotiations.  During the most recent negotiation session in Geneva, the EU offered to assist the chairperson and rapporteur of the working group to explore ideas for a consensus-based, legally binding instrument.  As the EU made clear in the negotiations in Geneva, if any proposed treaty is to be effective, it will need to attract wide, cross-regional support.  This is essential for the proposed legally binding instrument to ensure it will be effectively implemented in a way that protects victims of business-related human rights violations and creates a more global level playing field.  We are in the middle of that discussion and I hope it can produce positive results.</p></speech>

It concerns a topic that should get much more focus than it does.  Many questions focus on problems with the implementation of the protocol, and there are some, but of course there is also great benefit for Northern Ireland in getting uninterrupted access into both the rest of the UK internal market and the huge EU Single Market.  That is an extraordinary economic advantage for Northern Ireland, the benefits of which we are starting to see.</p>  <p>  The protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland was agreed by the EU and the British Government.  The result of more than four years of difficult negotiation with compromises on all sides, it is designed to safeguard the Good Friday Agreement, including avoiding a hard land border, to protect vital all-island supply chains and to ensure the integrity of the Single Market and Ireland&rsquo;s place in it.</p>  <p>  The protocol offers real benefits to Northern Ireland.  Goods produced in Northern Ireland have access to both the EU&rsquo;s Single Market of more than 450 million people, the world&rsquo;s largest and most powerful trading bloc, as well as the rest of the UK internal market of some 65 million people.  Nowhere else in the world can make this offer to local and international business.  It is an opportunity that can benefit all communities. </p>  <p>  The first year of the protocol&rsquo;s operation has seen historically high levels of investment interest in Northern Ireland and a series of jobs announcements and investment decisions clearly linked to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s dual market access.  However, stability, certainty, and predictability are needed to fully realise these opportunities.  The Government continues to engage closely with the business community, political leaders, and other stakeholders in Northern Ireland.  The Government and I, along with European Commission Vice-President Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič, have consistently highlighted the economic opportunities associated with the protocol as part of this engagement.  Recent polling shows a growing recognition throughout Northern Ireland that the protocol presents genuine economic opportunities.</p>  <p>   In October 2021, the European Commission presented a comprehensive and generous package of proposals to minimise disruption caused by Brexit for the people of Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, as we know, political and cultural differences exist there, and that is the reason for that.  The engagement of Liz Truss and Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič has certainly helped in the present discussions, leading to the relaxation of some of the agricultural issues at the Border, which has significantly helped Northern Ireland farmers, in stark contrast to what is happening to farming and agriculture in the wider UK.  There is much to be said for where things are, but the Department has a pre-eminent position in respect of driving a message.  Some in Northern Ireland politics do not wish it to be heard but we need to do a better job of getting that across.</p></speech>

Last year, Invest Northern Ireland reported that it was dealing with 50 firms interested in setting up in Northern Ireland, and Manufacturing Northern Ireland has noted a similar uptake in investment interest.  For example, the Almac group, the global pharmaceutical organisation headquartered in Craigavon, announced the creation of 1,000 new jobs in Northern Ireland.  Almac has consistently highlighted its unique, unfettered and flexible access to the UK, Europe and beyond under the protocol, referring to this as &ldquo;the Almac advantage&rdquo;.  Ardagh Metal Packaging announced plans to build a new state-of-the-art &euro;200 million beverage can plant in Belfast to service the growing needs of customers in Ireland, the UK and Europe.  Deli Lites, a Warrenpoint-based food producer, has reportedly won a number of accounts previously serviced by Great Britain competitors and, in October, announced 45 new jobs in its Milltown industrial estate factory as part of a Stg&pound;4.3 million investment.  There are real things happening, linked to the protocol and because of the opportunities it provides.</p></speech>

It is interesting, if we look at the Northern economy, that there is a significant number of people up there who are employed by the state and productivity would not reflect the numbers we have down here, although it is improving.  The case is that there is great opportunity and potential in the Northern Irish economy under the present trade agreement.  That suggests a question as to where Northern Irish politics is going and where those supporting the Brexiteers are going.  The issues that Mr. Johnson is having now, I would contend, are probably adding further fears on the possible future triggering of Article 16.  I know we are doing everything possible but we need to keep selling the economic message.  The shared island message is also very important for people in the North so they know they have a significant future tied to the Republic of Ireland.</p></speech>

The Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, and Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efcovic are building a good relationship as the two key negotiators on behalf of the UK and the EU in terms of trying to settle some of the outstanding issues on how we implement, with the maximum flexibility possible, the protocol into the future.  We certainly will be working with both sides, and I speak to Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efcovic on a weekly basis.  We want to try to find a way forward that can bring the certainty and stability that is needed in Northern Ireland so this extraordinary advantage that the protocol does actually provide can be fully utilised, instead of the protocol remaining a polarising issue in politics in Northern Ireland in the lead-up to elections.  We all have an obligation to try to move forward these issues.  I think the EU is playing its part in that in terms of offering real flexibility and I hope the UK will be able to respond positively to that in the weeks ahead.</p></speech>

I suspect there will be a lot of talk around passports in the weeks ahead as more and more people choose to travel again, and many, of course, have not even thought about travel for the last number of years.  We expect a significant increase in passport applications.  There are questions coming up that will allow me to address what we are doing in response, which is a dramatic increase in staff numbers in the Passport Office.</p>  <p>  Passport Service operations were severely disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic throughout 2020 and 2021, as were many Government services.  Despite necessary public health restrictions, the Passport Service maintained operations, with staff working onsite throughout the pandemic.</p>  <p>  The Passport Service has put in place several measures to meet the demand anticipated this year including the following.  First, there is the assignment of additional permanent and temporary officers on a continuous basis to the Passport Office.  My Department has conducted a major recruitment drive in recent months and I expect that, by the end of January, staffing numbers will be at approximately 777, which is a 70% increase on June of last year.  Additional staff will continue to be assigned to the Passport Office throughout February and March.  The new Passport Office in Swords is now operational and can accommodate 140 staff.  Second, the Passport Service is engaged in intensive training of staff to ensure they have adequate resources to process complex applications.  Third, the Passport Service is continually looking at ways to improve processing times.  A particular improvement that is currently being rolled out and will be of interest to the Deputy is a change to the document management process that reduces the turnaround time when additional documents need to be submitted by the applicant.</p>  <p>  With regard to the simplification of the process, the Passport Service continually works to streamline the application process.  Comprehensive information is available on all aspects of the application process on my Department&rsquo;s website and the Passport Service continually reviews these instructions in order to make them more accessible.  In addition, there are over 60 staff on the customer service team dedicated to answering applicants' questions by phone and webchat.  This number will increase as additional staff are assigned.</p></speech>

The current process still needs to be reviewed as I have been advised recently by the Minister's office that more than 40% of all children's passport applications are deemed to be incomplete.  The problem is that the extra or missing information is not sought until too near the date when the application was supposed to be granted.  That seems to be where the problem is.  The applications should be looked at from the start, when they are submitted, and the information should be asked for then.  There is something wrong.  The children's application part needs to be streamlined.  When we hear 40% of applications are not complete, there is something wrong.</p></speech>

The Passport Service reports that approximately 40% of first-time child applications are incomplete.  However, our records show that this is not due to issues with consent forms, which some people have raised a concern around.  In fact, 77% of all incomplete child applications occur when parents have not submitted any documentation to the Passport Service.  In these cases, parents apply online for their child's passport and can sometimes take weeks or even months to submit the required supporting documentation, such as a witness consent form, and the child's identity documents, such as their birth certificate.  We will be putting more resources into this to try to improve delivery times.</p></speech>

As we are talking here today, there is a backlog of 113,000 applications.  Can the Minister imagine that?  Something needs to be changed in regard to the parent consent form because that is where most of the difficulty is, and the application is being sent back due to a lack of information or because there is something wrong with that parent consent form.</p> <p>That needs to be streamlined or something needs to be done to change it in such a way that it will be more effective.  One poor man applied to renew his passport before Christmas.  His children bought him a ticket.  He had not travelled for more than ten years.  That is deemed to be a new application.  I cannot understand why it should be.  When he had a passport before, what is the difference between nine and 11 years?  I ask the Minister to address that issue too.</p></speech>

We will probably do 100,000 this month.  This year, we could end up doing 1.7 million passports.  We have never reached 1 million before, even at the height of travel before Covid.  That is the extent of the demand increase we are expecting.  By the end of March, we will probably have 900 people working in the Passport Service, which is just under double what we had last summer.  We are putting substantial resources into responding to this demand.  To put it into context, out of a total of 113,000 applications currently with the Passport Service, 73,000 are for first-time applications.  Some 32,000 of these are incomplete applications where the applicant has either not sent in any documentation after applying online or additional documentation has been requested.  We need to make sure the application process works, that the turnaround times at the Department happen more efficiently and that people who are making applications fully understand what they need to do.</p></speech>

Once agreed by member states, this policy document will serve not only to outline the EU&rsquo;s approach to the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, but also to reflect the increasingly complex security landscape faced by the EU, and believe me, it is complex.  Ireland has always engaged constructively in the development of the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy, guided by our traditional policy of military neutrality and our contribution to crisis management and peacekeeping.  For this reason, we are playing an active role in work to develop the strategic compass.</p>  <p>  I have had the opportunity to discuss the strategic compass with EU foreign and defence ministers on a number of occasions, most recently at our informal meeting in Brest on 13 January.  Following further engagement between all 27 member states over the coming months, it is expected the final document will be endorsed at the European Council in March.  As it currently stands, the draft document as presented to member states by High Representative Borrell opens with an analysis of the strategic environment and the challenges facing the EU, before outlining proposals in the areas of crisis management, resilience, capability development and the EU's work with key partners.</p>  <p>  Ireland welcomes the strategic compass as a means of setting out our shared strategic vision for CSDP and of enhancing the EU's role as a security provider and in contributing to international peace and security.  In our view, the strategic compass also offers an important opportunity for the EU to project the core values that underpin our approach to CSDP, including our commitment to effective multilateralism and the rules-based international order.  In this regard, the exercise offers an excellent opportunity to strengthen the EU's co-operation with the United Nations, including in the areas of peacekeeping and crisis management.</p></speech>

It has the strong backing of the French President, Emmanuel Macron, who stated, when France assumed the Presidency of the European Union, "we must move from a Europe of cooperation within our borders to a Europe that is powerful in the world, fully sovereign, free in its choices and master of its destiny".  We know security and defence no longer just involve military conflict and that hybrid warfare is now a real issue.  The cyberattack on the HSE brought this matter clearly home to us in Ireland.  What is the Minister's understanding of the strategic compass?  What role will Ireland play in it, given our tradition of peacekeeping around the world?  Will we bring our unique traditions to those negotiations?</p></speech>

With the strategic compass, member states are working to build a common assessment of the threats and challenges posed to the European Union.  In addition, the compass will help the EU to become a stronger security provider at a global level as well as a more responsible and reliable partner that can respond to external crises, work closely with the United Nations and other partners, and protect the Union and its citizens.  The challenge is to try to bring everybody's concerns and ambitions together in one document that all 27 countries of the European Union can support.  They bring different perspectives to this discussion.  We bring the perspective of a country that is militarily neutral and wants to focus on peacekeeping and peace support and on co-operation and partnership with the United Nations.  There are other neutral countries in the European Union that are not members of NATO which also bring perspectives, such as Austria, Malta, Finland and Sweden.  We have been very much active in this discussion and debate.  I hope that, by the end of March, we will be able to settle on a strategic compass that makes sense for all countries.</p></speech>

The evacuation from Kabul Airport last year highlighted the need for this in a real way.  We know there are proposals for a 5,000-strong rapid reaction force, greater investment in defence, and that Ireland has concerns about so-called Article 44 issues.  Will the Minister give an assurance that Ireland's approach to the strategic compass will be based on the need to contribute to international peace and security and stress again the importance of EU and United Nations co-operation and multilateralism generally?  In addition, does he agree the strategic compass should ensure the EU is able to deal with new types of threats, including cyberattacks and hybrid threats?</p></speech>

We have brought to this debate a desire to see collective co-ordination across the European Union to ensure the EU can intervene in crisis situations in a way that is seamless and interoperable and that countries are not pulled into conflicts in a way they are not comfortable with.  This is about trying to improve the EU's collective capacity to be able to respond to threats to the EU, but also to be able to make strategic interventions at appropriate and correct times to promote and support peacekeeping and stability, often in post-conflict situations, both in our neighbourhood and other parts of the world.  It is also about building our capacity to be able to respond to new threats, such as the cyber threat, which the Deputy raised and will feature strongly in the Commission on the Defence Forces report, which we will see in the next few weeks.  We are in a good space.</p></speech>

The embassy also provides consular assistance to Irish citizens and works closely with other EU member states in further developing the EU-Ukraine relationship.</p> <p> The decision to open an embassy in Kyiv was taken as part of the Government's Global Ireland 2025 initiative.  It is one of 14 missions that have been opened since the Global Ireland programme was launched in June 2018 and one of four opened in 2021, the others being Manchester, Rabat and Manila.  Global Ireland aims to see Ireland&rsquo;s global footprint and influence double in the period to 2025, including through an expanded and strengthened diplomatic presence.  In addition, the Government decided in 2021 to open a further five new missions in Toronto, Lyon, Miami, Dakar and Tehran, which will bring to 19 the number of new missions opened as a key deliverable of the Global Ireland programme.  Mission expansion has been complemented by the strengthening of existing and strategically important missions, including Brussels, London, Paris, Berlin, New York UN, Tokyo and Beijing, including the assignment of additional staff from several Departments.</p> <p> All missions, including the embassy in Kyiv, are located in regions where there are opportunities for Ireland to advance our national, political and economic priorities.  Missions work as part of Team Ireland in co-operation with State agencies, including Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland, the IDA, and other Departments, to strengthen Ireland's international reputation and drive the development of trade, tourism, investment, science, technology and innovation, culture and education.</p> <p> The expansion of the mission network is following the Ireland House model, where all Departments and agencies, where possible, work together in one building.  In addition, building on the advances in digital diplomacy made during the pandemic, work on an integrated digital Ireland House continues as a the key platform to deliver on the Global Ireland ambition.</p></speech>

I have a few general questions on the approach to embassies and consuls but I want to ask some supplementary questions specifically on the new embassy in Kyiv.  In light of current global events, that embassy is of particular interest to the House.  Will the Minister outline the extent of the Irish diaspora in Kyiv?  I appreciate that in recent days the Minister asked all Irish citizens to register with the embassy and to outline where they are based across the country.  Will the Minister also expand on the economic potential this embassy presents?  What are our key exports to and imports from Ukraine?  What is the basis for our economic relationship and what risk assessment has been done on that relationship, based on current very worrying events in the region?  Finally, what is the strength of the Irish diplomatic mission in Kyiv?</p></speech>

It was officially opened by me in August.  The embassy's remit is to deepen bilateral relations with Ukraine, provide consular assistance to Irish citizens and work closely with other EU member states in further developing EU-Ukraine relations.</p>  <p>  Ukraine is a strategically and economically important European country and a key partner for the EU under the eastern partnership.  The opening of the embassy will allow Ireland to take advantage of the opportunities arising from Ukraine's closer economic integration with the EU under the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area, DCFTA, agreement.  Ukraine is on a firm growth trajectory, and a key objective for the embassy will be to contribute to increasing our bilateral trade and economic links with Ukraine.  Trade with Ukraine has been growing rapidly in recent years.  In 2020, exports of services to Ukraine amounted to &euro;647 million, with imports amounting to &euro;29 million.  Exports of goods amounted to &euro;71 million and imports amounted to &euro;92.8 million.  The Global Ireland strategy is very much driving what we are doing here in a new, strategic part of Europe.</p></speech>

It is very important, in light of current events, that we continue to make the strong point that Ireland stands with Ukraine and that its sovereignty must be maintained.  Ukraine is a key ally, not just of Ireland but of our partners in the EU.  Should events unfold negatively in the coming days, the EU must not be slow to consider sanctions and other options.  That said, it is essential to stress that Ireland continues to support negotiation and every move towards a diplomatic resolution to tensions in that region, although some would argue there are no tensions there.</p>  <p>  The embassy in Kyiv and all of the other consulates and embassies the Minister has listed are vitally important and it is essential they are augmented in the coming years and that Ireland continues to grow this network.  It is vitally important in so many areas.</p></speech>

Our staff remain in Kyiv but we have contingency plans if people need to leave.  We do not regard it as appropriate at this time to bring people home.  We are committed to Ukraine.  We support its sovereignty, its developing bilateral relationship with Ireland and, of course, its developing and positive relationship with the EU.  Should Ukraine be invaded by Russia, the political and economic consequences would be enormous for the relationship between the EU and Russia and, of course, for Ukraine itself in terms of potential loss of life.  This is, understandably, the subject of an enormous amount of public commentary, given the concern and tension that has built up in recent days.  We will continue to advocate for a reduction in tension and a resolution through political dialogue, but through all of this, we will support Ukrainian sovereignty.</p></speech>

That proactivity might save an awful lot of trouble for many people down the line.</p></reply>

Many people in this House have come to me directly on individual cases.  We have also set up an Oireachtas support line that can help staff in Deputies' offices to deal with cases when they emerge.</p>  <p>  This month we will have more than 100,000 passport applications to deal with, and this year we are planning for a possible 1.7 million passport applications.  Just to put that into context, we have never hit 1 million applications before.  Even at the height of travel before Covid, it was less than 1 million per year.  Given that many families simply have not even thought about travel for the past two years and therefore may not have thought about passport renewal, we expect a dramatic increase.  That is why we are investing significantly in more staff.  By the end of March we will have approximately 1,000 people working in the Passport Office.  That compares with approximately 465 in the middle of last summer.  We also have extra footprint as well in terms of more office space.</p>  <p>  As of Wednesday of this week, the Passport Office is operating as normal, with Covid restrictions having been removed.  That will lead to a lot more opportunities for people who need urgent meetings with the Passport Office to get rapid turnaround times for passports.  We are working hard in anticipation of what is already happening, which is a significant increase in the demand for passport renewals and for first-time passports.  First-time applications, particularly for children, take longer to process because of security issues.  We must ensure we address fraud, especially for first-time applicants.  We have good systems in place in that regard but they do take a bit longer and the application process is more complicated in terms of the forms that must be provided with the online application.  We are working hard to try to improve turnaround times for first-time applications as well.</p></speech>

It is unfair for me to have to get somebody to travel to Dublin late on a Friday evening to collect a passport, as I had to do again last Friday.  Surely in the context of new office space, that should be considered.  We need an office somewhere central in the region.</p>  <p>  Second, I thank the people in the unit.  They have been incredibly helpful but they are under huge pressure.</p> <p>However, in anticipation of that demand and its management, is it not time the Department or the Passport Office would, for instance, buy advertising space on airline booking sites to remind people to check their passports?  We all know there are so many people who only check their passports when they go to check in online or maybe even when they are en route to the airport.</p> <p> On the turnaround time for first-time passports, I accept the need for security checks but there are cases where it is running to months.  That is not acceptable either.  Surely we can reach a medium where there is an agreed turnaround time and that is delivered on.</p></speech>

We have ads in newspapers and on radio to encourage people to check their passports early if they are planning to travel this year so that we can try to get as many applications in as early as we can for travel, predominantly over the summer months.  I am sure there will also be travel over the mid-term and Easter too.  We have an advertising campaign and I will feed back the Deputy's suggestion about airline sites.</p>  <p>  The official turnaround time for first-time passports is 40 working days.  We are going to try to bring that down significantly.  However, many of the first-time applications that get stuck in the system are not always stuck because of delays on the Department's side.  We are often waiting for forms, whether identity forms or security-based forms.  We are working on that.</p></speech>

People probably laugh about this until they have done it themselves.  I am sure it has happened to all of us.  If, when you book and you are putting in your card details, there was a prompt that said "Is your passport in date?", that would do it.  We need turnaround times people can see that are actually real.  Again, I ask the Minister to consider a passport centre in the west.  It is unfair we have to do those journeys.  The advertising campaign is welcome but it is particularly pushing the online service.  Let us get back to pushing the post office side of it again.</p></speech>

The office is very efficient.  Would it be possible to arrange a direct relationship for newborn infants to shorten the time families have to wait?  If the register of births certifies that somebody is a newborn infant, that should be enough and it should be able to fast-track the 40 days the Minister is talking about.  It is unfair on parents who have a newborn infant to face delays they cannot accept.</p></speech>

There are concerns, as others have said.  When someone applies for a passport, one wrong tick can mean the application goes right back to the start.  I know the staff are working very hard but I would ask that a system be put in place so that a small issue that can be addressed is addressed.</p>  <p>  There have been loads of delays in my own area, including people who were unable to attend funerals and one family where two people could travel and one could not.  I know that is being addressed.  I seek clarity on the 1,000 new staff the Minister mentioned.  How are they being recruited and what is happening?  The last time we were here the Minister said 80 additional staff had been recruited.  I want to know more.  I welcome the recruitment of 1,000 staff; I am delighted.  Can we have an update?

The context of that is we had about 467 in the middle of last summer, so the staff numbers are almost doubling.</p>  <p>  On first-time passports, I emphasise we have to make sure the integrity of the system is protected and we have robust processes in place to protect the integrity of the system against fraud, potential child abduction or any of the things we are expected to protect it against.  We have very good anti-fraud systems in the passport system.  However, as a result of that and the systems that are in place, we do need extra paperwork in terms of documentation from applicants who are applying online or offline for children.</p></speech>

The Irish protocol was a necessary mitigation.  Every apparent one step forward is two steps back.  We are dealing with cul-de-sac unionism and any threats it makes.  The Minister has already spoken about the unhelpful commentary from Boris Johnson, even if some of that may be diversionary.  We have heard from Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič that discussions with Liz Truss may be more cordial but they may not be going where they need to.  There are also issues around getting state aid and the European Court of Justice, ECJ, back on the agenda.</p></reply>

This process culminated on 13 October 2021 with the presentation of a comprehensive package of proposals aimed at providing a credible and durable solution to the genuine issues on the ground in Northern Ireland.  The package makes proposals around issues of customs checks and sanitary and phytosanitary issues designed to facilitate the flow of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  It also sets out proposals around strengthening Northern Irish involvement in the governance of the protocol.</p>  <p>  On 17 December 2021, the Commission followed up its October package with new legislative proposals that ensure the continued long-term supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland and that further support supply lines in Ireland, Cyprus and Malta.  These proposals are under discussion in the Council and the European Parliament.</p>  <p>  The Commission package is a generous one.  It respects the fine balance at the heart of the protocol: protecting the Good Friday Agreement, avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time protecting EU consumers and the integrity of the EU&rsquo;s Single Market.  The proposals form the basis of the Commission&rsquo;s discussions with the UK Government, an approach that has the strong support of all member states, confirmed again this week.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach and I, along with other Ministers, regularly discuss the protocol in contacts with UK counterparts, our EU partners, stakeholders across Northern Ireland and key figures in the US Administration and Congress.  I had a video call with the UK Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, on 13 October on a range of issues, including Brexit and the protocol on Ireland-Northern Ireland.  Following her taking responsibility for Brexit policy issues in December 2021, we spoke by phone on 21 December and met in person in London on 6 January for about four hours.  During these engagements, I emphasised that Ireland and the EU remain fully committed to providing certainty and stability for people and business in Northern Ireland.  I noted the protocol is the joint EU&ndash;UK solution to mitigate against the disruption Brexit causes for citizens and businesses on the island of Ireland and it can work if we allow it to.</p>  <p>  I also speak regularly to Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič.  Most recently, we met in Brussels earlier this week on 24 January, shortly after his latest meeting with UK Foreign Secretary.  I reiterated to him Ireland&rsquo;s strong support for his approach. </p>  <p>  The positive tone from the Foreign Secretary, Ms Truss, is welcome, as is her stated determination to find a solution.</p> <p>The decision to have a meeting of the joint committee next month along with a continuation of intensified technical talks is a positive development.  However, following the package of measures put forward by the European Commission, we need to see the UK Government demonstrate meaningfully its willingness to come to a deal on the key issues.</p></reply>

We all thought there might have been change when Liz Truss came into the role.  I had an opportunity in Strasbourg to talk to Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič about this.  In fairness, I did not intend ever to talk about what he said but it is all in the public domain.  I refer to the suggestion of more cordial relations.  The fact is Liz Truss has put the ECJ, state aid and some of the issues people thought were sorted back on the agenda.  We do not know what the outworkings are going to be in relation to where Boris Johnson finds himself at this time.  The leadership of the Tories and where Liz Truss stands relative to that could be impacted.  We all hope for the best.  In fairness to Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič, he said he stays at the table and that is the important thing.  We need to ensure solidarity is maintained because this is about ensuring there is no return to any hardening of any border in Ireland.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.105" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1552" speakername="Se&aacute;n Haughey" time="10:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700010#H00400"><p>The Minister mentioned he met British Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, on 6 January.  Did he notice a change in tone or attitude by the UK side on these negotiations?  Would he agree these negotiations must be brought to a conclusion as soon as possible given the proximity of the Northern Ireland Assembly elections in May and the political issue the protocol has become?</p>  <p>  The UK is now also dealing with the situation in Ukraine.  I assume that is a very big issue for the UK, as indeed it is for everybody else.  Does the Minister think the UK has an incentive to get this issue off the table because there are much bigger issues to be dealt with worldwide from its point of view?</p></speech>

I refer to the politics internally between the UK and the EU on the one hand and then separately, the politics in Northern Ireland.  It is to be hoped Brexit is a becoming less of a political issue in the UK, especially in Great Britain.  If that is so, much of the tension will go out of the talks about the protocol.  However, in respect of Northern Ireland, it obviously remains a very strong political issue represented by different views on different, polarised sides of that society.  Will the Minister consider trying to reach out to the business community in Northern Ireland?  When we look at what the protocol is doing for Northern Ireland on an objective and practical basis, we see it is improving its business capacity.  It gives it a great opportunity to access the EU market and the UK market.  I therefore ask that the Minister speak to business people there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.107" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700010#H00600"><p>First, I am speaking to businesses in Northern Ireland.  We speak to them regularly, through online forums or when we have an opportunity to meet directly with businesses in Northern Ireland.  Other colleagues do the same.</p>  <p>  On my meetings with the Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, I know her reasonably well from previous portfolios we would have been working on together.  When I was the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, she was my counterpart in the UK.  She is a very able minister.  She has held many portfolios.  She is someone who has a reputation for being a dealmaker and a can-do minister and she is now bringing that energy to this portfolio.  We met in early January and spoke at length about the need for an agreement.  I think she wants to find an agreement.  Certainly, the European side does as well.</p>  <p>  The issues around the protocol have been dragging on for far too long.  They are contributing to a very polarised atmosphere in Northern Ireland, which is both unwelcome and unhelpful in the build-up to elections in May.  Therefore, we all have an obligation to try to settle the outstanding issues.  The point I made very clearly, to Liz Truss and publicly, is the EU is not in the space of renegotiating the protocol and writing a new one.  However, it is in the space of trying to offer the maximum flexibility possible in terms of how the existing agreement, which is international law, can be implemented in a way that works for everybody.  That is what Vice-President &Scaron;efčovič and his team have been trying to do with their proposals before Christmas, which were very substantial proposals in the effort to reduce checks on goods coming from GB into Northern Ireland and remaining there in sense of being purchased and consumed there.  It is the belief of the EU that, by co-operation, we could reduce checks on those products from a sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, perspective by up to 80% and could halve the checks burden linked to customs.  The EU has said it would like that to be the basis now for further discussion with respect to how that could be achieved.</p>  <p>  I do not want to give an indication to the House that these issues will be easily resolved.  There is still a big gap between both sides.  Even though the conversations have been much more personal and warmer in many ways with Liz Truss now in charge on the British side, the issues themselves, in the sense of actual solutions on the table, are still very difficult.  She certainly has not softened the UK Government's position on the key issues, even though there is much more personal engagement now in an effort to try to find a way forward.</p>  <p>  As a final point, time is important here.  We should be slow to be setting cliff-edge timelines and so on but elections are on the way.  Between now and the end of February there is a key window to try to find a combination and agreement all sides could accept.</p></speech>

I welcome the clarity and the reiteration this is not for renegotiation.  That is the difficulty.  It is to be hoped Liz Truss is there as a dealmaker and other factors will not impact on that.</p>  <p>  I accept that sometimes with these questions we are asking the Minister to look into a crystal ball, which I assume he does not have.  I also reiterate some of what Deputy O'Callaghan said about both the Minister and Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič having said that, in dealing with stakeholders, business owners, farmers and other such people in the North, they see and recognise the benefits of the Irish protocol at this time but that political unionism is in a different place.  We all know politics in Britain is in an utterly dysfunctional place at this time.  We just need to hold the line.  We need to get a deal.  It is better it happens sooner but we need to ensure there is a deal and that it is the Irish protocol.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.110" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1598" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="10:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700010#H00900"><p>It seems to me the moderate opinion in both Britain and Ireland is outmanoeuvred by the extreme views in the Tory Party and its view on Brexit.  The traditional relationship that was there all along between Britain and Ireland is seriously affected by this.  That notwithstanding, given the links between the civil servants, the professional administrators in the UK and the business community, they need to show the benefits in a stronger way.  I accept and acknowledge businesses in the North clearly and absolutely acknowledge the benefit they have in working directly with and exporting and importing directly to and from the EU.  However, there is no acknowledgement from the unionists, certainly not from the DUP, on that issue.  I am concerned the outcome of all this will be extreme views in the ballot box and the moderate middle ground in the North, which was growing and which we very much support, could well be sundered by the continuing difficulties between the UK Government and the EU.</p></speech>

I know the Minister, the Department and various organisations are doing a lot, but we need to stress continually the benefits of the protocol for Northern Ireland business.  The Democratic Unionist Party threat to pull down the Northern Ireland institutions is still there as well.  We have all this factoring into the negotiations so I again stress it is important that these talks are concluded as soon as possible. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.113" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1553" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="10:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700011#J00200"><p>We need to look at the politics of this in which people in this House have great expertise.  If the relationship between the UK Government and the EU is resolved, that will end the dispute and internal politics in Northern Ireland.  The reason politics in Northern Ireland is being fuelled by the row in respect of the protocol is that messages are being given that the protocol will change.  The British Government is sending out messages that we can change the agreement we entered into and the protocol has to be ditched.  If Liz Truss turns around, however, says that the UK has got a new deal with the European Union and has provided some clarification in respect of the protocol but is bound by the original agreement, that will then provide no further room for the internal politics of Northern Ireland to keep going on about trying to remove the protocol.  They are both dependent upon each other.  That is an important message the Minister needs to bring to Foreign Secretary Truss, which is to let her know that if she, on behalf of the UK Government, says issues have been resolved, it will take the legs out of internal politics in Northern Ireland on the issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.114" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700011#J00300"><p>I agree with the comments that have been made by all sides in the House.  This is an issue that needs to be resolved politically.  It is helpful, by the way, that the Brexit negotiations are now back in the Foreign Office because Foreign Secretary Truss is very much aware of the broader issues.  We also spoke at length about Russia-Ukraine, for example, at that meeting on 6 January.  She is very conscious of the need for the EU and the UK to build a strong new relationship on global and European matters, in addition to the fact that outstanding issues and trust issues have also been impacted by protocol issues being unresolved, which impacts on the overall relationship in a way that is not helpful.</p>  <p>  There is a bigger picture here.  We need to find a way of ensuring the British Government and the EU find accommodation of each other on this issue.  Ireland has to ensure that its interests are protected in that; we are doing that very actively.  In addition, as I said earlier and as Deputy O'Dowd referenced, the polarising impact of this issue not being resolved is driving an electorate to perhaps have more hard line or extreme views than they otherwise might have, which is something that is also not welcome.  We have an obligation to work on this to try to find solutions.  Certainly, between now and the end of February, we will very actively be trying to do that.</p></speech>

On 14 January, we were joined by fellow EU defence ministers to discuss the EU&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, and more specifically the strategic compass, which I addressed earlier when the Deputy was not in the Chamber, and on which I have given an update to the House today.  The strategic compass provides for greater work in the area of capability development as well as further investment in innovative technologies.  From the Irish perspective, we consider effective capabilities as key to an effective CSDP.  In practical terms, the strengthening of our capabilities will help improve the EU&rsquo;s ability to undertake peacekeeping and crisis management tasks as outlined in the Treaty on European Union.</p>  <p>  Of course, different member states bring different perspectives to bear in discussions on security and defence.  Ireland&rsquo;s position continues to be recognised by our fellow member states and we remain clear that our active participation in CSDP does not prejudice the specific character of our security and defence policy or our obligations.  Within the EU, defence and security are a national competence and this includes national spending on defence and security.  This means that any decision, including any deepening of EU co-operation, any increase to national spending on defence and security or strengthening of the EU as a defence sector, will require unanimity.  For us, any new proposals in this regard will also have to be in accordance with Ireland&rsquo;s policy of military neutrality. </p></speech>

That is, frankly, laughable, when you consider we have allowed Shannon Airport to be used again and again by the US military to prosecute brutal, murderous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  I want to know what neutrality means when the Minister goes to a conference in Brest where we discuss the French project, which is a major European powers project to increase the militarisation of the European Union, including an absolutely open call for the establishment of a European army, and where NATO calls on the EU to increase military expenditure at the same time that NATO is expanding towards Russia.  Do not get me wrong, the Russians should be condemned for massing troops in Ukraine and having exercises off our waters, but NATO is doing exactly the same thing.  It is ratcheting it up and the EU is discussing more military expenditure.  Where is the voice of neutrality in saying we should be stepping back from this?  We should not be spending more on arms.  Is the Minister saying that?</p></speech>

Indeed, successive governments have not viewed Ireland's policy of neutrality as meaning that the country should stand aside and not get involved in peacekeeping or stability in other parts of the world, rather, they have considered that neutrality enhances Ireland&rsquo;s reputation internationally and enables more effective engagement in efforts to promote peace and security.  That is exactly the approach we are now bringing to these discussions on the strategic compass and the future of defence and security issues.  We will continue to advocate on that.  We are not the only militarily neutral country, by the way, in the European Union.  There are others too, such as Malta, Austria, Sweden and Finland.  We bring a perspective to these debates that I think Irish people expect me to bring, which is one that is focused on peacekeeping, co-operation with the UN and peace and security around the world.</p></speech>

Yesterday, the Minister expressed concern because the Chief of Staff met the Russian ambassador.  To me, neutral would mean that he would express similar concern if the Chief of Staff met the US ambassador or the head of NATO or at the fact that leading powers inside the European Union are looking for and, indeed, have achieved closer integration with NATO, which is a military and nuclear alliance.  It is not some sort of benign body.  It is the outworking of western, US-led expansion towards Russia, which is now provoking a dangerous escalation in Ukraine.  Against that background, the voice of neutrality is to say that we do not pour petrol on a fire by arming up, spending more on weapons and expanding NATO, but by doing the opposite and saying that we do not need militarisation, which is not the solution to these sorts of situations.</p></speech>

I do not think that is an argument that stands up to scrutiny.</p> <p>There has been an ongoing military conflict on the borders of Ukraine for some time.  We have seen a dramatic increase in military presence on multiple elements of the Ukrainian border, coming from the Russian side.  That is creating extraordinary tension.  NATO has responded to that tension and we now need to focus on trying to defuse it as best we can.  That is what Ireland has tried to bring to this debate.</p> <p> On the separate issue of the strategic compass, which the Deputy raised earlier, we want to have as much co-ordination as is appropriate within the European Union to ensure that the EU can focus on its own security issues but also can be an actor to support peace and security internationally and that Ireland can be involved in that.</p></speech>

NATO is not some sort of protective entity.  Its rationale, if it ever had any, disappeared at the end of the Cold War.  At that time, people like James Baker, Secretary of State of the US, said that there would not be an eastward expansion.  I reiterate that I believe Mr. Putin is thug.  He is dangerous.  He has done horrendous things in Chechnya and Kazakhstan.  The western powers were far less concerned about those things.  The idea that NATO is some sort of benign, innocent force in this instance is ridiculous.  It is actively recruiting states in the area and it has expanded dramatically in that area.  At the same time, it is urging the European Union to increase military expenditure, which the European Union is going along with, as part of a broader militarisation project and neutral Ireland is not speaking out against it when it should be.  This State was born in opposition to empire building.  Frankly, it is a betrayal of our tradition of opposition to imperialism and neutrality not to speak out loudly against both military political blocs and their militarist manoeuvrings.</p></speech>

NATO can speak for itself on these issues, but if one speaks to colleagues in other parts of Europe that are members of NATO, they will give a very different perspective from that just given by Deputy Boyd Barrett in terms of their own protection and security into the future given their historic relationship with other countries that they still regard as a potential threat.  Ireland is in the fortunate geographical position in the world where it does not feel threats externally from a conventional military attack.  That has allowed us to be militarily neutral.  That is the position we should sustain and maintain because it allows us to make interventions internationally that at times are helpful.  We need to focus less on name calling and more on trying to use a language of defusing tension in the context of the pressure and tension that is building between Russia and Ukraine, and indeed Russia and Europe and NATO.</p></speech>

The Chief of Staff is holding a number of <i>pro forma</i>meetings at the moment with members of the diplomatic corps, as a new Chief of Staff would be expected to do.  Those meetings have been set up over many weeks.  What I commented on last night in response to a question related to the timing of the meeting with the Russian ambassador and the subsequent tweet drawing attention to it.  I have, as Deputies would expect, been fully briefed by the Chief of Staff.  I spoke to him again last night.  I have absolutely no reservations or questions about his actions.  I want to put that on the record.  It is not welcome that the Chief of Staff has been brought into public commentary and political debate.  I recognise that I made a contribution to allowing that to happen.  I would like to correct that this morning, if the House would accept that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.136" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700012#K01200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92 and 93 together.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government committed to the establishment of an independent commission to undertake a comprehensive review of the Defence Forces.  The independent Commission on the Defence Forces was established by the Government in December 2020 and its terms of reference provide for it to examine and make recommendations regarding the structures and size of the Defence Forces, defence capabilities, HR polices and strategies, the Reserve Defence Force, governance and high level command and control in the Defence Forces, and pay structures.</p>  <p>  The commission has undertaken a broad consultative process and has also met with a wide stakeholder groups, including the Defence Forces representative associations, commissioned and enlisted members of the Defence Forces, senior officials and personnel from my Department and the Defence Forces as well as other groups.  Members of the commission also conducted site visits to military locations across the country, meeting nearly 1,000 military personnel.  In addition, the commission held two webinars, one in conjunction with the Royal Irish Academy and another in conjunction with the Institute of International and European Affairs.</p>  <p>  The commission is finalising its work with a view to completing its report as soon as possible.  At that point, the report will be fully considered.  Given the significant issues provided for in the commission's terms of reference, there will be a requirement to consult ministerial colleagues on any matters that fall within their remit and to consider the legal and governance implications of the commission's recommendations, where required.  I will also be seeking the views of my Department and the Defence Forces.  When these deliberations are completed, I intend to revert to the Government with a proposed plan of action.</p>  <p>  I would like to assure the Deputies that the Defence Forces representative associations will be consulted on all matters that fall within the scope of representation relating to the implementation of any approved plan.  As the Deputies will appreciate, in advance of the publication of the report and the subsequent consideration of its recommendations, it would be inappropriate for me to engage in speculation regarding any of the commission's potential recommendations or the response to those recommendations.</p>  <p>  We will need to have a very comprehensive debate in this House on the report of the commission.  I have not yet seen a final draft of the report.  I have met with the chair to get an update in terms of where the commission's work is at, and so I have a reasonable idea as to where it is going in terms of recommendations and approach, but I await the final draft of the report.  I hope that in the next couple of weeks this process will conclude.  I will need to bring the report to the Government, but I would like to have a significant amount of time set aside in this House and in the Seanad to debate the contents of the commission's report.  This is potentially a watershed moment in the context of the future of defence policy in Ireland, how the Defence Forces are resourced and structured and what we ask of them in the context of new and developing threats.</p>  <p>  I want to try to build all-party consensus, if possible, on how we respond to this report and the resources that will be required to respond to it comprehensively, which I believe may well be significant.  In my view, this is arguably the most important strategic report for defence and the Defence Forces that we have seen in a very long time.  </p> <p>We need to give it the time and attention it deserves when it is published which, as I said, it will be in February.  I suspect this will happen in the first half of that month.</p></speech>

We have an organisation that is on its knees.  There is a lot of hope around this commission and its final report.  The Minister's comments last night showed poor judgment.  They completely undermined the Chief of Staff and the difficult role and task he has at hand.  It showed extremely poor judgment on the Minister's behalf.</p>  <p>  The final report has been long anticipated.  There have been a number of leaks and a number of comments attributed to different people in senior positions.  I am not sure whether it is an attempt to undermine the report or an attempt to be helpful by ensuring the final report adheres to the terms of reference.  Some of the commentary around it has suggested it is a fudge and a missed opportunity.  Does the Minister believe the report is in line with the terms of reference?  Will it do everything that is hoped by giving clarity and addressing the serious failings within the Defence Forces?</p></speech>

It was important and timely.  The Minister is right to underscore the report of the commission as a watershed.  It is a pivotal moment.  For many years, morale in the Defence Forces has been poor.  Members of the Defence Forces feel badly done by, under-resourced, badly paid and in receipt of poor accommodation.  A lot of hope is now vested in this process and it must meet those aspirations and expectations.  I welcome the Minister setting out what he wants to do with it.</p>  <p>  On the timeline for the report, it was to be published in December and then in January.  I am concerned about the timeline now being referenced by the Minister to the effect that it will be some time before the final report is available to him, at which point he will have intergovernmental discussions about it.  When will we have the opportunity to see what the future of Defence Forces will look like and, more importantly, when will Defence Forces personnel see that?</p></speech>

The expectation was that this piece of work would have concluded by the end of last year but this is not a straightforward piece of work.  There are quite a lot of people on the commission who bring extraordinary expertise and experience and are anxious to get this right.  This is essentially a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reset and recalibrate.  In some ways, it will mark a new direction for the Defence Forces.  I have been clear to the chair of the commission that I want the right outcome rather than being overly demanding in setting deadlines or anything like that.  The report is not going to be delayed for long.  I hope it is being finalised as we speak.  As I said, I expect to be bringing the report to the Cabinet for noting in the first half of February.  I hope we will also be debating the commission report in February.  However, I also want to hold extensive consultations with the Defence Forces and their representative bodies in the context of this report once it has been published.  I will be making clear to the Cabinet that we cannot simply adopt an implementation plan for the commission's report immediately.  It will take a significant amount of consultation and work.  Significant resource allocation may well be required.  I will need to work with my colleagues and the Government to do that, and that will take some time.  As part of that consultation, I would certainly like this House to be central in the context of the debate and the response to it.  We are not going to have to wait much longer.  The report is a couple of weeks away at most.</p></speech>

I hope that timeline can be adhered to.  There is also concern over what may come about in terms of proposed reductions in the size of the Army, for example.  There are concerns in that regard.  The Minister's Cabinet colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, made comments yesterday about the potential closure of Cathal Brugha Barracks and a feasibility study, of which he already knows the outcome, that will see the closure of the barracks and the development of up to 1,000 residential units in their place.  That has sent out a negative message to the Defence Forces, which are on their knees and concerned about their future and viability at a time we are talking about the closure of barracks.  Does the Minister think the timing of that intervention by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, was helpful?  What kind of message did it send to the Defence Forces?  Was it appropriate for the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, to make those comments and announce a feasibility study before the final report has been produced, discussed and debated?</p></speech>

People will express concern and ambitions that they want accommodated in the commission's report.  There has been some such commentary and that is to be expected.  I ask people to be patient and wait for the content of the report.  My understanding is that this will be a substantial report with a lot of recommendations, some of which may relate to fundamental change.  Let us wait for the report and assess it.  My role will be to build as much as consensus as possible about the way forward as a result of the report.  It will create a new direction and not only for the length of one Government term but for a much longer period of time.  It is important to get it right.</p>  <p>  The comments that were made yesterday about Cathal Brugha Barracks were in the context of the Housing for All update report, which was launched and commented on yesterday.  What I have agreed to in the Department of Defence is a feasibility study to look at Cathal Brugha Barracks in the context of housing demand.  However, there is no predetermined outcome of that feasibility study.  Let me be clear about that.</p></speech>

I think the Minister will agree that some of the commentary about it is unhelpful.  Somebody has seen the report.  There have been suggestions that a draft of the report was submitted to the Minister's Department.  Commentary emerged that the draft is in part vague and in part contradictory.  We should not be having commentary on a report that has not been published.  It is important for the Minister to marshal and control the information before the report is finalised and published.</p>  <p>  I welcome what the Minister has said about the implementation strategy and that the report is not going to be rushed but will be thought about.  A pivotal part of the implementation strategy will be engagement with the representatives of Defence Forces personnel, who understand first-hand exactly what needs to be done.  Their understanding, commentary and in-depth knowledge of what needs to be done will be critical in the implementation of the recommendations of the report.</p> <p>I ask the Minister to respond on those two points - the need to marshal the information to ensure these things are not shot at before the report even becomes a public document, and the need for a clearly discussed implementation plan that is not presented to the Defence Forces representative bodies but negotiated with them in terms of how this transformational document is to be implemented over many years to come.</p></speech>

As I said, I have not seen any final draft.  I had a meeting with the chair, as one would expect, to get an update report in terms of where things are and the direction of travel and so on.  I understand various different amendments were still being considered this week in terms of the report being finalised and we must respect that process.</p>  <p>  It is not a surprise on something of this scale that there would be commentary and people outlining perspectives and so on.  That is what we have seen.  People will not have to wait much longer to get the detail of this report, however.  We will do what we can to try to protect the integrity of that process.</p>  <p>  In terms of the implementation strategy, which I do not want to say too much about because I need to bring a proposal to the Government and get it accepted, certainly I will not be in a position to simply accept the commission's report's recommendations and start implementing them on day one.  There may well be some early actions that we take on the back of that report, of course, but because this is such a substantial report, we will need to take some time and, as the Deputy said, talk to and work with representative organisations but also with other colleagues in government and with the Taoiseach's office to ensure we can actually put an implementation plan and timeline around that in place, which I can then bring back to the Government for approval.  I certainly believe that getting the input of all parties in this House as well as representative groups and other stakeholders will be helpful in this process.  That is certainly what I intend to do.</p></speech>

I thank the members of the review group for agreeing to undertake this significant piece of work.  The independent review is seen as a critical and vital next step to ensure the workplace for serving members of the Defence Forces is safe, where there is zero tolerance of unacceptable behaviour and where we learn from historical experiences.</p>  <p>  My Department and I have engaged extensively in recent months with the Women of Honour group and other stakeholders, including both serving and former members of the Defence Forces; the representative associations; PDFORRA; the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO; the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association, RDFRA; and a second group representing former members.  These engagements have brought serious issues to my attention, which indicate that it is not just an historic issue, unfortunately.  Incidents of alleged unacceptable behaviour are continuing to occur.  Current and former members of the Defence Forces have been clear that the culture that is pervading and the application of those policies, systems and procedures for dealing with unacceptable behaviour have not and are not serving all Defence Forces personnel as well as they should be.  A further round of engagement with stakeholders took place on Tuesday afternoon last when I provided an update to stakeholders on the Government decision to proceed with the independent review.  This was the seventh meeting at senior level that has been held with the Women of Honour group since last September, three of which I attended personally.</p>  <p>  Current and former members of the Defence Forces have welcomed the review.  While I acknowledge the disappointment expressed by the Women of Honour group, which has been seeking a commission of inquiry, I am strongly aware of the need for immediacy of action to ensure safety of serving Defence Forces personnel.  I want to be clear that this does not preclude the Government from considering further bodies of work that may be necessary.  The review group has been specifically asked to advise on whether further work is required to examine issues of an historic nature and to make any recommendations regarding how this might be pursued.</p></speech>

Following that documentary with Ms Katie Hannon - I will give credit where it is due - the Minister had a turn of heart at that point.  That was most welcome for those who had such negative experiences.  After that documentary, the Minister told me that "real change" would be delivered and that there were "too many stories in this space that are not historic but current".  With regard to the Women of Honour, he categorically said that he "absolutely" believed its members.  He acknowledged the women's "sincerity and courage" and expressed a "deep appreciation" to them.  He spoke, as he has done today, about the strong "culture [of abuse] that is pervading" and said that the systems in place "have not and are not serving" members of the Defence Forces.  He said that "significant efforts have been made .... but they have not worked", that "confidential reporting systems have been put in place but [have] not worked" and that the "first thing I want to do is to work with the women".  If these statements were true, and the Minister has repeated some of them today, why is it that his review seeks to primarily establish what he has acknowledged he already knows?</p></speech>

If the Deputy looks at the terms of reference, we are asking this review group to advise us on the changes that are necessary in the Defence Forces in terms of structures, legal underpinning, procedures and end-to-end complaints procedures.  There is, therefore, much work in that regard.  This is a difficult area in which efforts have been made to respond to and change structures to accommodate and so on in the past.  Clearly, that has not worked to the extent needed.  We have now asked an experienced group of people to look at this and report back independently to me.  We have discussed this with various different interested parties, including the Women of Honour, whose members' sincerity I absolutely acknowledge and whose role in raising this issue in a very public way has resulted in many of the actions that have subsequently taken place.</p></speech>

When the Minister mentioned dignity and equality issues in his press release the other day, essentially he undermined the seriousness of the allegations these women made because they are so much more than that.  When he mentioned the terms of reference of the review group he has put in place, he was effectively putting responsibility for any further action on a group of people he has tasked to do a job and who are doing so in the realm of the terms of reference in which those who brought us to this point - the Women of Honour - cannot engage and have faith.  Surely the Minister can acknowledge that one of the fundamental principles of healing after trauma or any kind of abuse is to feel not only that one has been heard but also that one's concerns have been taken on board.  I am very concerned that this will result in another failure and we will all be back here in a number of years having the same conversations again.</p></speech>

I remain open to talking to all groups, by the way, while this review is undertaken but I also encourage everybody to engage with the review group.</p>  <p>Ms Justice O'Hanlon is absolutely committed to this process, as is Jane Williams and the senior counsel who is working with both of them.  We are determined to bring about fundamental change on the back of the report that comes from this independent review, which needs to be independent of the Department of Defence.  The Department and the Minister&rsquo;s office are part of the review of how complaints are responded to by the Department, as well as the role of the Defence Forces.  It was an ask of the Women of Honour that we added to the terms of reference.  As well as this, historical cases, how we deal with those historical cases and the structures that are there to deal with them are also additions to the terms of reference, on the back of what the Women of Honour asked for in my meeting with them in December.  We remain focused on this discussion.  We would like now for this review group to get under way quickly, which I understand is going to happen so that we can get an interim report back in the summer and a final report before the end of the year with real recommendations around how we can bring practical change to the Defence Forces in this space to improve the safety of the workplace for everybody.</p></speech>

I say that in light of the development yesterday.  I have heard the Minister&rsquo;s comments today, in fairness, where he said he is looking at this in respect of Cathal Brugha Barracks.  If changes will be made there, there may be an opportunity for the likes of Custume Barracks to increase numbers.</p></reply>

The brief I have is that for operational security reasons, the details of the numbers of Defence Forces personnel that are currently stationed at Custume Barracks in Athlone, as well as those over the past five years, cannot, and should not, be disclosed.  It should be noted, however, that the number of personnel stationed at a particular location will frequently vary on an ongoing basis as it is a normal operational feature for there to be a constant flow-through of personnel into and out of military installations.</p>  <p>  The rolling Defence Forces build infrastructure programme provides a blueprint for investment in Defence Forces built infrastructure over a five-year timeframe and is designed to modernise and enhance the training, operational and accommodation facilities of the Defence Forces.  The completion of the new dining hall complex was an important project to upgrade the facility in Custume Barracks.  The main works contract, valued at &euro;4.1 million, was awarded in October 2018 and work was completed in 2020.</p>  <p>  Following a commitment given in the programme for Government, a commission on the future of the Defence Forces was established by the Government in December 2020.  Its report is expected soon.  The commission's terms of reference include the consideration of appropriate capabilities, structures and staffing for the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service.  Their report will be fully considered when it is received.  As I said earlier, I hope we will have a long debate in this House on it.  </p>  <p>  It would be inappropriate for me to engage in speculative discussion regarding the recommendations of the commission's report or the outcome of a subsequent deliberative process prior to the completion of that process, as well as prior to a Government consideration of any proposed plan of action.  However, I assure the Deputy that Custume Barracks is, and will continue to be, an important operational military barracks as part of our military structure.</p></speech>

I do not buy into it that "for operational reasons" they cannot tell us the number of Defence Forces personnel in any part of the country.  It is disgraceful and whoever wrote that answer should be ashamed of themselves.  Public representatives are not told, no matter where they are from, whether it is Cathal Brugha Barracks for someone in Dublin, or us in the west of Ireland.  I am not asking for the names of people and I am not asking about individual sections.  I asked a straight question about the number of personnel in an Army barracks.  Whoever is sidelining that is doing so for the simple reason that the numbers are down, and they are not prepared to say it.  I do not blame the Minister, but whoever wrote the answer, be it the civil servant or the person in the Army.  It is disgusting to think that they will not even write down or tell us the number of people.  I asked a simple question.  When the Minister was in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, if I asked him a question, for example, over the past five years the number of personnel in the Department right around this country, he always gave it.  Now we seem to be stifled by the Defence Forces.  It is disgraceful. </p></speech>

I assure the Deputy that there is no downgrading of Custume Barracks at all; in fact, the opposite is the case.  We continue to invest there, and we will continue to invest there.  However, the advice that I have is that for security and operational reasons, from a Defence Forces perspective, we do not talk about numbers in individual barracks.  I understand that because I asked the question before coming in.  I knew that the Deputy would say what he has just said.  I understand his frustration.  I understand that this has been a consistent approach to written parliamentary questions as well.  However, I will inquire as to whether I can come back to the Deputy with a more detailed answer.  That is all I can do.  I will try to be as helpful as I can, but obviously I will not release information if the advice is that it is sensitive from a security perspective.  I do not want to overplay that, however, and I will have a look at it again and see if I can come back to the Deputy with more detailed information.</p></speech>

It will not be to the detriment of our country or our line of defence if Members know how many different Defence Forces personnel are in each part of the country.  We are given a number right around the country.  That would have been given previously.  It would be interesting to see over the past number of years whether those figures have gone up or have gone down.  That is what I am trying to achieve.</p></speech>

We are about to have a debate on everything from overall Defence Forces numbers, the numbers within the Army, the Air Corps, the Naval Service, resources for cybersecurity, military intelligence, capacity issues to structures within the Defence Forces and how they interact with each other and so on.  It is my hope that this will allow us to have a broad, forward-looking debate on how we resource the Defence Forces appropriately into the future, as well as the capacity issues that need to be addressed, given what we ask of them.  I assure the Deputy that will include a discussion on Custume Barracks, the infrastructure and numbers there and so on.  In the context of the commission report, which we will see in the next few weeks, we will be able to pick up this conversation again.  However, I assure the Deputy that if I can come back to him with actual numbers, I will do that.  If I cannot, I will explain why.</p></speech>

I have raised questions about this many times over the years.  It relates to former or retired members of the Defence Forces who had been awarded damages in respect of injuries incurred during their service.  They are now having the awards recovered, in whole or in part, by a reduction in their pension entitlements.  I feel that this is wrong and I ask the Minister to address it.</p></reply>

The Army Pensions Acts provide for the grant of pensions and gratuities to former members of the primary Defence Forces in respect of permanent disablement due to a wound or injury attributable to military service, whether at home or abroad, or due to disease attributable to, or aggravated by, overseas service with the United Nations.  Section 13(2) of the Army Pensions Act,1923, as amended, provides that:</p> <blockquote> 	Any compensation which may be received from or on behalf of the person alleged to be responsible for the act which caused the wounding [&hellip;] may be taken into consideration in fixing the amount of any pension, allowance or gratuity which might be awarded under this Act to or in respect of such person.  If such compensation is received after the award of any such pension or allowance, the Minister may review the award and, having regard to the amount of such compensation, either terminate or reduce the amount thereof. </blockquote> <p>The underlying objective of section 13(2) is to prevent double compensation in respect of the same disablement.  Compensation of the kind in question would usually result from a civil action for damages against the Department of Defence but compensation received from any other source is not excluded.  The provisions do not apply to disability pension cases related solely to disablement due to disease attributable to or aggravated by overseas service with the UN.  They apply only to wound pension cases involving a wound or injury or where disease is secondary to the wound or injury.</p> <p> There are currently 1,011 disability pensions of all categories in payment, of which 275 relating to injury or wound pensions have had a reduction under section 13(2) applied.  There have been a number of key cases both at Supreme Court and High Court levels involving section 13(2) and the procedures in place relating to individual cases take account of these judgments.  The courts, in various judgments, have upheld the Minister&rsquo;s statutory right to take into consideration that part of the damages which can properly be regarded as general damages or that part which can properly be regarded as referable to loss of earnings, as he or she considers proper.  The reduction of these pensions-----</p></speech>

This practice is grossly unfair and arbitrary.  The fact that it has proceeded as it has for so long is unfortunate.  The question that arises immediately is whether the courts erred in the first stage.  To my mind, they could not have erred.  Even though cases have been referred back to the courts on the basis of the situation, this issue prevails.  It is totally outrageous that an award made by the courts is arbitrarily undermined, questioned and turned on its head by a decision, enabled by this Act, that part of the award made by the courts be recovered when the member of the Defence Forces is at a more vulnerable stage, that is, when in receipt of his or her military pension.  I ask the Minister for a thorough investigation into this matter with a view to changing the situation.</p></speech>

It is provided for under legislation and is done on foot of a bona fide decision by the Minister after careful consideration of the specific circumstances of the individual case.  The person or his or her solicitor is advised of the statutory provisions and of the potential implications of his or her application.  Representations are invited regarding the person's circumstances, details of the compensation actually received and whether there are any special or extenuating circumstances involved.  On receipt of representations, cases are submitted to the Minister for decision, setting out the relevant facts of the case, including details of the representations made and an actuarial assessment in pension cases.  The actuarial assessment, which is carried out by an actuary based in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, translates the compensation into an annuity value based upon various assumptions, including the date the money was received and the life expectancy of the individual.  Full account is then taken of representations made and the actuarial assessment before a final decision is made by the Minister.  There are no plans to discontinue the application of this statutory provision at this time.  There is a process where cases are looked at on an individual basis.  Extenuating circumstances are looked at and a recommendation is made to the Minister for his or her decision.</p></speech>

This section of the Act is repugnant to the Constitution.  Why are all awards made by the courts not challenged by whoever happens to be the payer of the pensions to the individuals concerned at a later stage?  It is totally wrong that this would continue.  It has caused severe hardship to an awful lot of people.  The Department is effectively stating again and again that these people should not really have had an award in the first place and that it has the right to second-guess the courts and decide of its own accord that it will take back the equivalent value through a reduced pension in the future.  I urge the Minister to undertake an urgent reappraisal with a view to changing this practice.  It is wrong, unfair and archaic.</p></speech>

The underlying objective of section 13(2) is to prevent double compensation in respect of the same disablement.  That is what it is specifically trying to do.  Compensation of the kind in question would usually result from a civil action for damages against the Department of Defence but compensation received from any other source is, of course, not excluded.  If somebody takes a civil case against the Department for injuries or disablement linked to their time in the Defence Forces, that is factored in in the context of compensation they may have been previously granted as part of a pension entitlement.  This provision is about trying to ensure there is not double compensation as a result of that.  That is the purpose of the section.  I understand the point the Deputy is making and that is why extenuating circumstances or individual circumstances linked to cases can be taken into account by the Minister when he or she has to make a final decision on the back of the actuarial recommendation and calculation that comes to his or her desk.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.190" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="11:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700016#O01700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97, 99, 103, 111 and 120 together.  There are several Deputies here so I hope the Acting Chairman will give me some latitude when answering these questions.</p>  <p>  As of 31 December 2021, the strength of the Permanent Defence Force was 8,468 personnel, or 89% of the agreed establishment of 9,500.  While the Government remains committed to returning to, and maintaining, the agreed strength of each branch of the Defence Forces, there are a number of factors, many of which are hard to predict, that will impact on the timeframe within which this will be achieved.  In addition to a range of measures already undertaken to address the staffing issues, the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces, which is currently being finalised, will also address this matter directly.</p>  <p>  As regards current recruitment initiatives, general service recruitment is ongoing and resulted in 576 personnel being inducted in 2021.  The level of turnover in the Defence Forces in 2021 was 7.89%, which includes those in training.  It is worth noting that the average turnover rate for general service recruits who do not complete training, for a variety of reasons, has been approximately 30% over the past number of years.  On the question raised by Deputy O'Callaghan, some 31% of commissioned officers have been inducted in the past five years.</p>  <p>  In addition to ongoing recruitment, the scope of direct entry competitions, along with the terms and conditions, continues to be expanded and revised to improve intake.  The re-entry campaign for former members of the Permanent Defence Force continues.  The service commitment schemes in both the Air Corps and Naval Service and a special Naval Service tax credit for seagoing personnel are examples of targeted retention measures that I have introduced.</p> <p>There has been significant progress on pay, arising out of increases due from recent pay agreements, the most recent of which was a 1% increase on annualised salaries or &euro;500, whichever is the greater, on 1 October last year, with further increases to follow.</p> <p> Additionally, the Public Service Pay Commission, PSPC, report on recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces made a range of recommendations with a view to addressing recruitment and retention issues.  These have been progressed through a series of projects.  While the 2022 recruitment plan is not yet finalised, the Defence Forces remain committed to optimising the number of personnel inducted.</p> <p> I am confident that along with all other initiatives under way, the pay benefits delivered by the public service pay agreements, in tandem with the implementation of the PSPC recommendations, will improve recruitment and retention challenges currently experienced by the Permanent Defence Force.</p> <p> Furthermore, the Commission on the Defence Forces is finalising its work with a view to completing the report as soon as possible.  The commission's report, when submitted, will be fully considered at that point.  There is, as one would expect, a very strong emphasis on recruitment, retention and HR within the Defence Forces in its terms of reference.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.192" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1553" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="11:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700017#P00200"><p>I thank the Minister for his answer.  Recruitment and retention are considerably important issues in the Defence Forces.  The focus of my question was to try to identify the proportion of commissioned officers who have more than five years' experience.  The Minister was at the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, conference last year and he probably heard its general secretary state that 24% of personnel in the Defence Forces had less than five years' experience but 35% of officers had less than five years' service.</p>  <p>  This is linked to the question of recruitment and retention and it is important we try to ensure that we retain experienced officers within the Defence Forces.  Experience matters a great deal, especially in areas such as defence of the country.  I am not suggesting that inexperienced people do not have an important role to play, but it is important to have that body of experience among commissioned officers in the ranks of the Defence Forces.  I ask the Minister whether any other options are available to ensure we can retain those commissioned officers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.193" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="11:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700017#P00300"><p>The Deputy highlighted an important area.  The way in which we solve the recruitment and retention issues in the Defence Forces will not simply be through a large intake in a very short space of time, because that has consequences from the perspective of training, command and control, experience and so on.  That is why we have an ongoing discussion with the Defence Forces and the Chief of Staff and his team, on how we can maximise the number of people coming in each year and, at the same time, ensure we have appropriate training procedures to ensure we maintain the skill sets and leadership we need within the Defence Forces to deliver on what is asked of them.</p>  <p>  The figure I gave was that 31%, rather than 35%, of commissioned officers have been inducted in the past five years.  Either way, it is approximately one in three officers and we need to make sure we hold on to the experience in the Defence Forces, where possible.  The direction of travel the commission report will provide in terms of certainty, ambition and resources may well, I hope, encourage many people to stay in the Defence Forces for longer and, in doing so, hold on to that very important experience.</p>  <p>  We have very significant skill sets within the Defence Forces.  Sometimes those skill sets are targeted from outside and people are headhunted out of the Defence Forces, be they pilots, engineers, cybersecurity experts or drivers.  We need to try to make sure that what drives people to join the Defence Forces remains burning in them in terms of their willingness to stay and serve their country.  A series of factors need to be taken into account for that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.194" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="11:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700017#P00400"><p>I am concerned there might be an intention, as has happened in the past, in some quarters to reduce the strength of the Defence Forces on the basis that we do not need them in a modern economy.  We do need them.  They provide a very important service.  They provide emergency services at all times, coastal surveillance and they also respond to natural disasters.  They are relied upon to do these jobs and be there for the citizens of this country.  Will the Minister ensure, notwithstanding the review currently under way, that there will be no attempt to reduce the strength of the Army, Naval Service or Air Corps in order that they will be in a position to provide services in the future, as they have done in the past?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.195" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="11:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700017#P00500"><p>All I can say to the Deputy on that is we will not have to wait for much longer to get recommendations from a very experience group of people, led by a very able former Secretary General of the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Justice and Equality.  I would be very surprised if they recommended a reduction in numbers in any of the services within the Defence Forces.  In fact, I expect it will be quite the opposite.</p>  <p>  We have capacity challenges and problems that need to be addressed throughout all three sectors of the Defence Forces - Naval Service, Air Corps and Army.  We are investing significantly at the moment but I look forward to a debate on the back of that report, which will outline the levels of ambition required for Ireland to respond in a comprehensive and necessary way to the defence challenges every sovereign country needs to face up to.  Historically, that discussion has sometimes been too confined in the context of the defence debate in Ireland and I hope the commission report will allow us to break out of that.</p></speech>

My question was on when we will meet 9,500 target strength in the Permanent Defence Force.  I completely agree with the Minister about the synergies in terms of private sector employment people can take up after serving in the Defence Forces.  People have an opportunity to serve their country, train and perhaps educate themselves and then go on into the private sector to contribute to their country in different ways.  That model always worked and it provides us with a strong skill set, especially in the tech and communications sectors.  However, the difficulty now is that what might have been a stint of ten or 15 years, or even longer, in the Defence Forces before going into a senior, management, engineering or technical role in one of those organisations has become a few years, with people being moved on before they have had the opportunity to contribute to the country.</p>  <p>  Members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence visited Haulbowline recently and heard first-hand the experience of many being recruited into the private sector and leaving, after having been trained up and invested in.  It is very demoralising for all involved and particularly in light of the threatened events off the coast, it is critical the Naval Service, along with all the others, has the resources it needs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.198" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="11:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700017#P00800"><p>I absolutely understand those arguments.  As someone who regularly visits the naval base and other military barracks, I am very familiar with the fact that talented people in the Defence Forces are being enticed all the time out of the Defence Forces and into other jobs.  If one looks at where the economy going and the prediction to create another 167,000 jobs, which I think was the estimate this week, there is considerable talent in the Defence Forces that the private sector may well look to target.  We have to make sure there is a very attractive proposition to stay in the Defence Forces in terms of personal development, training, certainty on income and, of course, the rewards of serving one's country.  The HR and management issues relating to that are addressed in the commission's report.</p> <p>As the Deputy has said, the issues that are currently being debated outside of this House, in terms of Russian military exercises off the Irish coast and the tension that has being building in the Russia-Ukraine situation, highlight the need for Ireland to have an honest and full debate in terms of capacity issues around defence and I look forward to having that discussion.</p></speech>

Part of the reason people are leaving the Defence Forces is because they know they will have to retire between the ages of 56 and 60.  At that age, many people are just getting into their prime - I think of Deputy Durkan here beside me.  Could the Minister imagine if there was a requirement in politics that people had to retire between the ages of 56 and 60?</p></speech>

We have had crises in the Defence Forces due to the shrinking of numbers and the failure to replace them for various reasons.  We must put in place whatever provisions are necessary to ensure we retain numbers in the Defence Forces.  This is a vital service.  In war or in peace, we rely upon the Defence Forces in emergencies.  We will continue to rely upon them in the future.  That means we must have people who are committed, people who have long-term service as well as new recruits.  Most important, if there are issues causing obstacles, we must identify them, deal with them, and try to ensure they are removed from the debate so that we continue to have a standing Army that is effective, efficient, modern and willing to continue to give the services it has given.</p></speech>

That is a discussion that is happening outside of the Defence Forces as well.  We must remind ourselves as well that serving in the Defence Forces is different from other modes of employment.  If you are stationed in Mali, UNIFIL in southern Lebanon, on the Golan Heights or in any other part of the world on a peacekeeping mission, physical fitness is linked to age as well.  We need to be cautious here, but, of course, we also work with the representative bodies in the Defence Forces to ensure the appropriate retirement age is being applied.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the Minister has given a detailed answer to Deputy Clarke already under priority questions.  My focus is on the independence of the measure the Minister proposes, whether the chair will be free to write about the scale of co-operation she has received in her work, and the speed with which that can be done.</p></reply>

This independent review is seen as a critical and vital next step to ensure the workplace for serving members of the Defence Forces is safe, where there is zero tolerance of unacceptable behaviour and where we learn from historical experience.</p>  <p>  My Department and I have engaged extensively in recent months with the Women of Honour group and with other stakeholders, including both serving and former members of the Defence Forces, the representative associations, PDFORRA, RACO, and the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association, RDFRA, and with a second group representing former members.</p>  <p>  These engagements have brought serious issues to my attention, which indicate it is not just an historic issue we are dealing with.  Incidents of alleged unacceptable behaviour are continuing to occur.  Current and former members of the Defence Forces have been clear that the culture that is pervading and the application of those policies, systems and procedures for dealing with unacceptable behaviour have not and are not serving all Defence Forces personnel well.</p>  <p>  The most recent engagement with stakeholders took place on Tuesday afternoon last where I provided an update to stakeholders on the Government decision to proceed with the independent review.  This was the seventh meeting, as I said earlier, at senior level that has been held with the Women of Honour group since last September, three of which I personally attended.</p>  <p>  Current and former members of the Defence Forces have welcomed the review, and while I acknowledge the disappointment expressed by the Women of Honour group, which has been seeking a commission of inquiry, I am strongly aware of the need for immediacy of action to ensure the safety of serving Defence Forces personnel.</p>  <p>  I want to be clear this does not preclude Government from considering further bodies of work that may be necessary.  The review group has been specifically asked to advise on whether further work is required to examine issues of an historical nature and to make any recommendations regarding how this might be pursued.</p>  <p>  The review group will provide me with an interim report in six months.  A final report is expected within nine months.  I will bring the final review report to Government, which may consider any further bodies of work that might be necessary, taking into account the findings of the independent review group.  Thereafter, I intend to make the final review report public.</p>  <p>  I wish to reiterate my commitment and that of the Secretary General and Chief of Staff to ensure every member of the Defence Forces can carry out his or her duties in a safe and respectful workplace based on dignity, equality and zero tolerance for any kind of unacceptable behaviour.</p>  <p>  Having spoken to the chair of this review group who is a former High Court judge, I can assure Deputy Carroll MacNeill she will be insisting on full co-operation and I expect that will very much be in the report if she is not getting that co-operation.  If there needs to be new structures that have compellability powers etc., I assure the Deputy she will have no hesitation in making those recommendations if so needed.</p></speech>

That is one of the key concerns around a statutory inquiry or otherwise.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to recognise, of course, in his capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence, that today is Holocaust Memorial Day.  It may have been marked by another Deputy in advance of me mentioning this.  It is an opportunity to commemorate this event solemnly and the 6 million Jewish victims and other communities who were persecuted by Nazis.  For the Minister for both Foreign Affairs and Defence, Deputy Coveney, with his European counterparts, it is an important part of preventing crimes against humanity and stopping antisemitism throughout Europe.  I invite the Minister to recognise Holocaust Memorial Day in the D&aacute;il today on such an important occasion.</p></speech>

That is the key process.</p><p>I regret very much the Women of Honour are not in negotiation with the Minister now and I urge him and the chair of the commission to engage with them.  It is important given the clear suffering and harassment they endured and the appalling treatment they got that they would have confidence in the process.</p><p>On compellability, if somebody is asked by the judge to come before her and if that person does not turn up, that should automatically trigger compellability.</p> <p>There can be no ands, ifs or buts about it.  If they are called, they must go.  I fully appreciate the efforts the Minister is making but I also appreciate the strong and determined resolution of the Women of Honour group to hold people to account, which is what he wants to do as well.</p></speech>

The Minister stated a review is being set up to examine &ldquo;whether the current legitimate frameworks, policies...are effective&rdquo;. Clearly, they are not, which is why the women had to appear on radio.  He stated it will &ldquo;independently assess whether the pervading culture in the workplace is fully aligned with...dignity&rdquo;.  Clearly, it was not.  Finally, the review will provide recommendations, and I have no difficulty with that.</p>  <p>  We are setting up a toothless tiger with no power to look at policies and procedures that clearly failed the women, about which they, the independent monitoring mechanism and I have all told the Minister.  Furthermore, I understand that last week, appearing before an Oireachtas committee, the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces, Mr. Justice Alan Mahon, asked for his remit to be extended in order that he could investigate harassment.  Something is seriously wrong with this independent review.</p></speech>

Does he agree that, one week after all the contributions in this House about a new culture of tackling sexism and misogyny, this is really not a good look for him or the Government?  The women did not just leave the meeting quietly; they said afterwards that they felt they had been blaggarded and disrespected.  They said they were not allowed to ask questions at the meeting or to have any input.  They said the meeting was a <i>fait accompli</i>and a waste of their time.  I want to hear the Minister's response to those points the women put forward.</p></speech>

Of course, I recognise Holocaust Memorial Day, and I will attend an event this afternoon, and another event on Sunday, to mark the Holocaust.  I look forward to attending those events to mark the horrors of the Holocaust and to ensure it will not be forgotten in any way.</p>  <p>  On the other questions that were asked, we are trying to get the balance right in respect of getting a report with recommendations that have teeth in order that I, along with the Chief of Staff and the Secretary General, can begin the process of implementing those recommendations on the ground before the end of the year.  I did take advice on whether I should set up a commission of inquiry and was advised against that by a number of people who are very credible in this space.  Many have endorsed the approach I am taking and I am being advised on the journey to get there.  Of course, I regret that women in the Women of Honour group have not welcomed the fact we are setting up a review and instead wanted a commission of inquiry.  I hope they will talk to Judge O'Hanlon and her review group and will get reassurance from that.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, I point out to those women and everyone in this House that, if the independent review makes a recommendation for setting up a commission of inquiry or some other structure to deal with historical cases, or for compellability to get answers in certain areas, we will act on that, and we will have those recommendations by the end of the year.  My fear was that, if we had set up a commission of inquiry, the process would have become a legal one very quickly and may well have gone on for two or three years, and I would not be back before this House with recommendations before the end of the year to act on.  My motivation and bona fides here are solely on the basis of listening to all the groups I have spoken to.  It is driven by a duty of care I have to the 600 women who are employed in the Defence Forces today, who are very anxious that I get on with this job of reform-----</p></speech>

I am available at any point to meet the group again, should they want to meet, and to answer any questions they may have.  I hope, as I said, that this new review group will be able to build a relationship with this group of women, who have shown extraordinary courage to be able to highlight these issues and drive change in the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

We all have the same objective.  We want change and accountability, sooner rather than later.  Obviously, I do not speak for the Women of Honour group, but we need to ensure they will be satisfied.  If there were a commitment at the meeting with the chairperson that the matter would be looked at objectively, which will be the case, there could be a parallel process.  Some of the issues the Minister raised are different from those a commission of inquiry could examine, particularly in the case of historical circumstances, individuals, processes or matters that were separate to changes that are needed now and into the future.  There is room for negotiation and action in that regard.</p></speech>

I have no concerns about the judge, and I ask the Minister not to waste my time telling me how good she is.  I know the judge, and that goes without saying.  My difficulty relates to setting up an independent review with no power and no terms of reference published, and the terms we know about from the Minister's press release beggar belief.  I refer to the suggestion the review will examine strategies and policies that have utterly failed.  That is an insult.</p>  <p>  The press release indicates that witnesses can come forward.  We saw how witnesses came forward to the formal commission of inquiry and all the problems that entailed.  How will witnesses' testimony be treated when they come forward?  Will their experiences be recorded?  Will they be quoted in the report and so on?  That was missing from the press release.  Where are the terms of reference and who has had an input into them?  Can we see what they are and return to them?  A review with no statutory authority is being set up and Deputies are standing up and saying we need urgent action, but the urgent action has never happened.  There is a litany of utter failure by the system and the governance that are there.  We want to know why that happened, not to look at idiotic policies that were never enforced.  Why and how did this happen?</p></speech>

For example, one woman with 31 years' service has stated that 27 of those years were stained with harassment, bullying and inappropriate remarks.  She has also said she suffered an attempted rape.  These women want a statutory inquiry.  They want the power to compel witnesses.  They want to see the men who did these things to them be made to answer questions.  They want an inquiry that can access documents.  I support their call 100%.  It is a shame the Minister is not doing that, not in the dim and distant future but now.</p>  <p>  Will he explain how he thinks he can organise an effective review that gets to the bottom of these issues and allegations given the victims have decided not to participate, because they have no faith in what he is doing?  Will he explain how the hell he thinks he can make that work?</p></speech>

This is not a review that is being undertaken by the Department of Defence.  It is a review being undertaken independently, with an independent chair, a former High Court judge, and a very experienced HR reform consultant, who has spent the last 12 months looking at some of these issues already through her work with the Commission on the Defence Forces.  The whole point is to take it out of the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces and, quite frankly, the political sphere and to ask an experienced group of people to consult widely having been given broad terms of reference with which they are happy.  We have learned from other countries in a context of those other countries responding to these issues in their defence forces to try to ensure we have terms of reference that are broad and based on international experience as well as our own.</p>  <p>  I know Deputy Connolly says we should not raise the issue of the competence of the judge.  I have spoken to the judge and she is satisfied from the terms of reference that she will be able to do a substantial piece of work.  Of course, if there are problems along the way, I will hear about that and we will have to make changes, and if she recommends new structures, then we will respond to that too.  The whole point is to try to get recommendations back to me and to Government so we can act on those as soon as possible.  We hope to be able to do that and to have an interim report in the summer and a final report before the end of the year, which is what we are trying to do.</p></speech>

This is to enable the Defence Forces to carry out the roles assigned by Government, as set out in the White Paper on defence.  Equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on defence as part of the capability development and equipment development planning, EDP, process.  Further additions to the equipment development plan are under consideration.</p><p>The Department of Defence has received a capital allocation under the national development plan of &euro;566 million over the 2022 to 2025 timeframe.  Within that capital allocation, the defence annual capital budget for 2022 is &euro;141 million.  Over recent years the capital budget has also been augmented through the reallocation of pay savings and, due to the numbers being below the establishment, we were effectively able to recommit that unspent money to the capital budget.</p><p>There are a number of defensive equipment acquisition and upgrade projects for which there will be capital expenditure in the coming years.  These include the midlife upgrade of the Army's fleet of 80 Mowag Piranha III armoured personnel carrier vehicles, which is well under way, as well as the completion of the delivery of an additional 30 armoured utility vehicles.  The Army's softskin fleet continues to be updated also, with more than 220 vehicles due for delivery in 2022.</p><p>In regard to air-based capability, the programme for the supply of two C295 maritime patrol aircraft is well under way, with delivery of the aircraft expected in 2023.  Alongside the recently acquired PC-12 aircraft, some &euro;276 million, including VAT, has been committed to the acquisition of all these enhanced capabilities.</p><p>With regard to the Naval Service, the programme of works has been under way and the midlife refit and upgrade of the <i>L&Eacute; R&oacute;is&iacute;n</i>has been completed, while works have commenced on <i>L&Eacute; Niamh</i>.  The replacement of the flagship <i>L&Eacute; Eithne</i>with a multi-role vessel, MRV, is an important element of the development investment programme.  Marine advisers have been appointed to support the procurement of the MRV, and the replacement of other vessels is also under consideration.</p><p>An independent Commission on the Defence Forces was established in December 2020, as I mentioned.  The work of the commission encompasses the consideration of appropriate military equipment capabilities, structures and staffing, and its report will inform decisions regarding the future development of the Defence Forces.</p><p>On the Deputy&rsquo;s question on radar, that is certainly an issue under consideration.  We have said that, subject to the availability of resources, we would look at that but it is not currently on the equipment enhancement plan.  I suspect we may well get recommendations on that from the commission report.</p></speech>

The mental health and well-being strategy for the Defence Forces, which was launched by me on 2 December 2020, recognises the unique nature of the experience of military life in Ireland.  The aim of the strategy is to provide a co-ordinated and effective mental health and support system for the personnel of the Defence Forces through the adoption of a series of measures between 2020 and 2023.  Eight supporting objectives - governance, resilience, suicide, stigma, critical incident stress management, a comprehensive approach, military families and a model for clinical support - have been identified as essential components of the strategy to support the principal aim.  It is intended that, at the end of 2023, mental health and well-being support within the Defence Forces will be delivered in a co-ordinated, multidisciplinary and directed manner that is designed to produce the best outcomes for the organisation and the military personnel and their families.</p></speech>

They should be troubling for all of us.  Anybody following this story will know how distressing the details are and how devastating this must be for those children and their families who were so let down by the State.  Not only were they let down by the State, but they were harmed by the State.  Forty-six young people suffered significant harm, with a further 200 put at significant risk.  This harm ranged from extreme tiredness to high blood pressure, excessive weight gain and the production of breast milk.  Hundreds of children were misdiagnosed.  They were put on a dangerous combination of medication.  They were left to their own devices with a serious lack of follow-ups or checks about their medications.  One family told a colleague of mine that they were so concerned about the changes in their child's behaviour and appearance that they challenged the doctor, only for the doctor to threaten to report them to Tusla.  That is disgraceful.</p>  <p>  Failures in clinical governance and oversight have had real consequences for the health and well-being of these children.  Those consequences will last for a long time.  There was no consultant psychiatrist to provide clinical oversight.  As soon as a locum consultant, Dr. Sharma, was appointed, he saw the problems immediately.  He must be credited for the fast, decisive action that he took as a whistleblower.  The treatment that he received as a whistleblower needs to be investigated.  He claims that he was asked to take time off and reassigned from his clinical role to administrative duties.  He resigned because he felt his position was undermined and that needs to be examined.</p>  <p>  I welcome that there will be audits of adherence to clinical guidelines and prescription practices.  My colleague Deputy Ward and Sinn F&eacute;in have called on the Government to do this since March of last year.  It has belatedly agreed to do this in the last week.  That is not enough.  It is only three years since three consultant psychiatrists resigned from CAMHS in Waterford and Wexford because of how poor and unsafe the conditions were due to understaffing.  Yesterday, we learned that more than 50 children were inappropriately placed in adult psychiatric units over the last two years.  They were units that were unfit and unsafe for young people.  It is not just one person or one area.  This is a systemic failure for our young people and patients in many areas across the State.  It goes back to understaffing and under-resourcing and substantial vacancies in consultant and nursing posts.  This is not the story of today or yesterday.  One in five consultant psychiatrist posts is either vacant or filled on a temporary basis.  Some of these posts have been vacant for years and years.</p>  <p>  This issue has plagued our mental health services for the best part of a decade.  In that time, the T&aacute;naiste has been Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, and Minister for Health, and throughout that time, he has sat at the Cabinet table.  There needs to be a step change from the Government, not more apologies.  We want action and for the system to be fixed.  What will the T&aacute;naiste do to ensure that child and adolescent mental health services are fit for purpose?  Will he ensure that the review that has been commissioned will look not only at the guidelines for prescription practices but also at the capacity and gaps in the service?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.258" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700021#T00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  Speaking as a public representative but also as a doctor, I am disturbed and worried by what I have read and heard about what happened with psychiatric services for children in Kerry.  I extend my sympathies to the children who have been affected and to their families.  What it appears has happened is very serious, including misdiagnosis and overdiagnosis of psychiatric conditions, with children being put on medicines inappropriately and those medicines not being monitored appropriately.  These are basic failures of medical care that simply cannot be defended.  They should not have happened and should have been identified and acted on much sooner than they were.  The most important thing that we can do as a State and health service is to make sure we put in place the services and supports that the children and families need so that we can, if at all possible, rectify and remedy the harm that was done.  That will range from good quality psychiatric care for the children who need it to other supports for families to help them manage and deal with what has happened.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the report has been sent to the garda&iacute;, who may have a role in this, and also to the Medical Council.  Ultimately, only the Medical Council has the authority to sanction medical practitioners, if that is appropriate.  As the Deputy knows as a Member of this D&aacute;il, having been part of many budget debates, the budget for mental health is now more than &euro;1 billion a year.  It has increased dramatically in recent years, by 20% or 30% in the last few years alone.  Money and resources do not always solve problems on their own.  It can be very difficult to fill consultant posts, even when we are willing to offer a contract worth over &euro;200,000 a year, which is the Sl&aacute;intecare contract.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's own party has been involved in running the health services in Northern Ireland for over 20 years.  He will be aware of the difficulties that arise with recruiting specialist staff, not just in this jurisdiction, but also in Northern Ireland and indeed globally.</p>  <p>  My thoughts are with the families and children affected by this.  To learn of the systemic failings in their care is devastating.  I can only imagine how distressing and upsetting it is for the families involved.  An integral part of this process was open disclosure in action.  Open disclosure has happened on this occasion in a way that is perhaps better than in the past.  One of the first things that was done was to provide 240 young people identified as having had deficits in their care, and their families, with meetings.  The HSE apologised to each individual at these meetings, and also in writing, for any harm caused.  It is clear from the review that there were significant failings in the care provided to children and young people at multiple levels of the system.  There were also failings of clinical oversight.</p> <p>The report has made findings in regard to these and there are recommendations to improve services.  The HSE has considered the report locally and nationally and has accepted all of its recommendations.  Work is under way to implement it.  That will be monitored by the Government.  Among the recommendations identified are an assessment of reconfiguration of the service and a full nationwide audit of compliance with CAMHS operational guidelines by all CAMHS teams to make sure that similar problems are not happening in other parts of the country, which I know people will be concerned about.  As Deputy Doherty mentioned, a prescribing audit will be conducted for each of the 72 CAMHS teams nationally.  There are 72 CAMHS teams across the country and there will be a prescribing audit in each case to see if similar issues might have arisen in other parts of the country.  We do not believe that is the case but we want to assure ourselves that it is not the case.</p></speech>

This has been going on for years now.  The T&aacute;naiste could be forgiven if he was just coming into office and he had an approach or a view on how to fix this but he has been in government for ten years.  He has been at the Cabinet table as Minister for Health, Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste.  He could have given the same script, speech or response three years ago when a psychiatrist resigned from the south east because it was unsafe and unsound in terms of CAMHS.  We have issues with capacity and that is why children are being put into adult services.  Children are being put into adult beds which are not fit for purpose.  This has been condemned by the Ombudsman for Children but there is no action.</p>  <p>  There is an issue in terms of the contract but the Government created a two-tier contract.  Pay cuts were made that have not been reversed.  Will the review include an examination of capacity issues?  There are capacity issues in the south east, in the north west and right across the State.  There are 3,065 children on CAMHS waiting lists.  More than 800 of those children have been waiting for six months and over 300 of them have been waiting for a year.  These are children with mental health problems that are not being supported by the State.  Will there be any step change from Government in how we treat young people with mental health problems?</p></speech>

I would remind him that while he may pretend to claim otherwise, Sinn F&eacute;in is very much an establishment party.  In the past 20 years, his party has been in government on this island as long as my party has been.  His party has co-chaired a government that is in charge of health services in Northern Ireland which consistently perform inferiorly to our health services here in terms of patient outcomes.  If Deputy Doherty is holding me responsible for any clinical failures in the past ten or 20 years here in this State, then surely his party is responsible for the failures that have occurred at a clinical level north of the Border.  Sinn F&eacute;in cannot have one standard for us but no standards for itself.</p>  <p>  In relation to capacity issues, it is accepted that we have capacity constraints, not just in our mental health services but in our health services generally.  Huge investment has gone into our health services in the last couple of years.  The Deputy may not be aware of this but we have 40% more doctors in the health service in Ireland now than we had ten years ago, including 40% more consultants.  We have more nurses and midwives than ever before, at 40,000, with more per head and more per bed than almost any country in the world.</p></speech>

It was heartbreaking to listen to.  The raw honesty meant it was something that one just had to listen to.  He spoke of how his son lost his personality and lost his smile.  It was one of those moments when one had to not just stop and listen, but also digest.  Collectively, we all have to digest what has happened here.  Imagine being in the room when Jason's father and sister were told this news and Jason's first response was to ask if it meant he was going to die.  We have to deal with this issue.</p>  <p>  What really shook me when Maurice O'Connell was telling his story was that there was an implication in the report that this was not catastrophic.  Sure, Jason did not lose a leg or an arm but I am sure the T&aacute;naiste will agree that this is catastrophic for these children.  We all have to accept that.  To say the community in south Kerry is shocked, appalled and worried is an understatement.  I know a little bit about that, as the T&aacute;naiste is well aware, because I have a lot of extended family down there.  Deputy Griffin, who is behind the T&aacute;naiste, knows that as well.  I have spoken to many people down there.  In fact, I raised this issue in here a significant period of time ago.  I am travelling down there later.  There is deep shock at what has happened and concern as to whether people can trust the service.</p>  <p>  The real issue, in the context of the audit that will be carried out, is that people who have the resources can go outside the public system and pay for second opinions but the majority of people cannot.  In my experience, CAMHS has been very much impenetrable and lacking in scrutiny.  There are some very good people in the service but there are silos in operation.  This is not due to just one rogue operator but to systemic failure over many years for which we are all guilty, every one of us.  We are going to have to deal with this in a certain way.  The T&aacute;naiste talked about the audit but we need to go further than that.</p></speech>

It is important to hear the voices of patients and parents.  It is the best way to understand the impact this has had on them.</p>  <p>  Let me not mince my words in any way.  I am a politician and a medical doctor.  I have come across, as have all of us in this House, a number of examples of failings in care and failures in our health service to provide the standard of care that we would expect for ourselves and our families.  This is very much at the more severe end, in my view.  What happened here is hard to accept.  It is hard to accept that it happened in our country, and that there were huge failures of this nature involving children, in particular.  Maybe it should it not, but it makes it feel worse that children who were supposed to be helped were harmed.  There was overdiagnosis and there were incorrect diagnoses.  Children were put on the wrong medicines and left on them for too long, and those medicines were not properly monitored.  That just should not happen and it should have been detected and identified much earlier.</p>  <p>  It is very disturbing that we find ourselves talking about this and more particularly, that those families are experiencing what they are experiencing at the moment.  I do not think any of us can begin to contemplate how they must feel and how worried they must be.  The most important thing that we must try to do is to put this right.  That means making sure the families and children affected receive the services and supports they need.  The HSE needs to be forthcoming and generous in that regard.  There will not be any financial barrier from the Government when it comes to providing them with the services and supports they need.  We have done that in previous instances, like with CervicalCheck, for example, where packages of support were put in place for families and patients and that needs to be done now.</p>  <p>  In terms of the detail of the review and how that is going to work, the Cabinet has not yet had a chance to discuss this.  We will discuss it on Tuesday and I know the Minister of State will provide more information on how that is going to operate as soon as she has it.  I am sure it is absolutely the case that it will be necessary to provide financial compensation to many of the families affected by this.  These are clear failings in care.  This was care that was clearly not up to basic professional standards.</p> <p>I have absolutely no doubt that families will bring cases forward, they will be assessed and compensation payments will need to be made.  The Deputy knows from his experiences, as I do from mine, that this is a lot more complicated than it seems because every case is individual.  We will need to find a mechanism to do that and we have had some initial discussions on how that can best be done and in a sensitive way.</p></speech>

The audit has to be based on the issue of resources around the country and the fact that CAMHS operates in silos.  Most of all, the checks and balances are not there from a clinical point of view.  According to the report, "The service has not implemented many of the recommendations of the CAMHS Standard Operating Procedure 2015 or the subsequent CAMHS Operational Guideline 2019."  Why?  Who is accountable for the fact that this was actually pointed out?  It was 2015 and 2019.  Why did somebody not ask what was going on there?</p>  <p>  In our day-to-day working lives as Deputies, we can see that it is not possible to get to the bottom of required information at critical times.  These services were operating as silos.  There was no clinical governance.  No consultant psychiatrist was appointed since 2016.  Did nobody shout "what the hell is going on here?"</p></speech>

It is intended that it will be nationwide.  It will be an audit of compliance with CAMHS operational guidelines by all CAMHS teams to ensure the other 71 teams have been prescribing appropriately.  This will include a random selection of files proportional to the medical caseload from a continuous six-month predefined time period in 2021.  Additional clinical resources have been made available to the team in Kerry including an additional doctor.  However, the HSE has not been successful in filling the consultant psychiatrist post and recruitment efforts continue.  In the meantime, a consultant psychiatrist post from another team attends on site two days per week and provides support through the rest of the week.  That is only an interim solution.  The Government is willing to offer a Sl&aacute;intecare contract to consultants with an annual salary of more than &euro;200,000 if they commit to public practice and public practice only.  We are working very hard to get agreement from the doctors' representatives to put that in place so that we can offer that contract and perhaps fill posts such as this.</p></speech>

The Stardust fire is embedded in the memories not only of the people of Dublin, but the collective memory of the nation.  There was no one untouched by the fire, from Cork to Donegal, from Sligo to Louth.  Everyone knew someone who was at the Stardust nightclub on that terrible Valentine&rsquo;s night in 1981.</p>  <p>  It is incredible that 41 years on from the disaster, the survivors and families are still waiting for justice to this day.  They are still waiting for the opening of a fair and transparent inquest into how their loved ones died.  It has been accepted that previous inquests and inquiries were flawed and left pertinent questions unanswered.  The likes of John and Christine Keegan are no longer with us and will never see justice.  They lost two daughters in the Stardust fire, but their daughter Antoinette, who survived the fire, continues to seek justice.</p>  <p>  Maurice and Phyllis McHugh, who lost their only daughter, are still waiting for justice, as are so many other families that lost loved ones.  It is a principle of law that justice delayed is justice denied.  After a wait of 41 years, there can be no doubt that justice continues to be denied to the survivors and families that lost loved ones in the Stardust fire.  One of the more recent delays relates to the State's inability to identify an appropriate setting for the inquest.  In a city with a multitude of venues to choose from, such a reason for delay is difficult to accept.  I am also led to believe that matters pertaining to the transparency of the process are also causing delays.</p>  <p>  I am led to believe there was a proposal that the Garda would choose the jury for the inquest.  This has been dropped after family objections.  The issue that now exists is that the members of the jury will not be paid for their service.  This is a major problem as the inquest is expected to last months.  I am asking the T&aacute;naiste to work with relevant Departments to identify funding to pay an inquest jury for a few months.  It is the least that the State can do considering the unnecessary trauma we have put the survivors and families of the victims through.</p>  <p>  On the night of 14 June 2017 in London, England, a horrific fire at a block of apartments killed 72 people.  Within two years of that date, a coroner&rsquo;s inquest had been completed, a Commons select committee hearing on the disaster was completed, the first phase of a two-phase inquiry was completed, and the second and final phase of the inquiry is under way despite delays as a result of Covid-19.  All these processes have found significant culpability by public bodies, and there is little criticism of the process.  Compare that to the Stardust fire inquiries here: there is no comparison.  There can be little doubt that the British Government's response to the Grenfell Tower fire was respectful and delivered truth and justice.  It did not shirk from seeking out those responsible.  They were not compromised by uncomfortable truths.  We all know that a proper and transparent inquest into the Stardust nightclub fire will reveal facts that will discomfort elements of the political establishment in this country.</p>  <p>  When the findings are compared to previous flawed inquiries, questions will be asked, but that is no reason to deny the survivors and families of the victims justice after 40 years.  This cannot continue any longer.</p>  <p>  I am asking the T&aacute;naiste for the sake of the survivors and families of victims of the Stardust nightclub fire, to make a commitment to the House that the inquiry into Stardust will be delayed no more.  Will the T&aacute;naiste assure both this House and the nation that the continued trauma caused to the survivors and families by delay after delay, excuse after excuse, will come to an end?  Will he do all in his power to bring about a just and timely commencement of the inquiry without further delay?</p></speech>

I wish to extend once again my sympathies and condolences to the families affected by the Stardust tragedy and all who have followed this issue down the years.  The decision to carry out these inquests was made by the Attorney General in the last Government, S&eacute;amus Woulfe, who acceded to the request by the families that the matter should be reopened and that inquests should be held.  I led that Government at the time and very much agreed with the decision he made.  That was the first time in a very long time that a Government had responded to the request by families that it be done.</p>  <p>  We are committed as a Government to ensuring that the Stardust inquest continues in a safe and suitable environment in 2022.  This might be made more simple in the coming weeks because of the easing of the public health restrictions.  There are plans to secure a new venue for the inquests to be continued by the Dublin coroner when the contract on the bespoke courtroom in the RDS expires in February.  The matter is actively being worked on with the assistance of the Office of Public Works, OPW, and the Government intends that the situation will be resolved as soon as possible.  To date, nine pre-inquest hearings have been completed and the tenth is expected to take place on 2 February.</p>  <p>  The Stardust fire was a national tragedy that has left a particular legacy of pain for many people in north Dublin.  I sympathise greatly with the families of the 48 young people tragically killed in the fire.  As the Deputy will be aware, the conduct of inquests is independent and has to be independent of the Government.  It is entirely a matter for the senior Dublin coroner, Dr. Myra Cullinane.  Her independence in relation to such matters is set out in the Coroners Acts and the Government cannot interfere with her work.  Dr. Cullinane has begun her work and nine pre-inquest hearings have been completed to date, the ninth having taken place on 19 January, and the tenth scheduled for 2 February.  The Department of Justice has also developed a website for the inquest, assigned additional staff to the office of the Dublin coroner and facilitated the appointment of legal and expert guidance to support the coroner in her work.</p>  <p>  During 2021, a bespoke courtroom was built in the RDS to facilitate the inquests.  That contract will expire soon.  We recognise that this is a very sensitive situation and want to assure the families that we are committed to ensuring a new venue is in place to permit the inquest to be continued by the coroner.  Families can be assured that the matter is being actively worked on with the assistance of the OPW.</p></speech>

It is true to say that our politics stem from humanity.  Before we are politicians we are human beings.  We feel love and pain, and we feel the love and pain felt by others.  Today I ask the T&aacute;naiste, as a caring man, to take a personal lead in bringing about an immediate and unhindered commencement of the inquest into the Stardust nightclub fire.</p>  <p>  Antoinette Keegan has asked me to say that her mother, on her deathbed, pleaded with her children never to give up until a proper and fair inquest is held into how she lost her two daughters, Mary and Martina.</p> <p>Antoinette said she would never give up.  She believes the inquest, with compassionate commitment from the T&aacute;naiste, will happen under his watch.  The problems that currently exist are easily surmounted, including the failure to identify an appropriate and secure location for the holding of the inquest.  The State has ownership of many buildings in the city that are appropriate.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to intervene personally by working with relevant Departments to ensure the simple task of identifying the venue is carried out within the next two weeks.  Finally, I am appealing with the T&aacute;naiste, with his considerable powers and obvious humanity, to follow the process to the commencement of an inquest with a personal interest to ensure no more obstacles cause further delays, mistrust and hurt.</p></speech>

The timing of the inquest is a matter for the senior Dublin coroner Dr. Myra Cullinane and it is not possible for Government to interfere in her work.  However, it is the wish of Government that these inquests should start as soon as possible.  I mentioned that pre-inquest hearings have already taken place.  The OPW, which is a branch of Government, is working with the coroner to try to find a suitable location when the RDS takes that space back next month.  We will work on that and I am sure it can be achieved.</p>  <p>  On the request from Phoenix Law Solicitors to pay the jurors serving on the inquest, that would be unusual.  Part of the idea behind a jury is they are a jury of your peers and not salaried or waged.  However, this is an unusual situation given the inquest will go on for so long.  Thus, the Minister for Justice is currently considering that and will make a response when she has a chance to do so.</p></speech>

I do not have a problem with it where gas is concerned.  However, the fact is we are relying on gas coming from Russia and it is like a tap at the moment, in that it can be turned up or down at any stage.  US President Joe Biden announced yesterday they were going to do all in their power to ensure Europe was going to be okay and bring in liquefied natural gas, LNG.  Ironically enough, Ireland as a country and the Government have decided that they are going to block a proposed LNG terminal.  Yesterday, I listened in astonishment to the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, speaking on the radio about offshore wind.  While I have no problem with offshore wind, at the moment it produces 1% of our energy.  With the best will in the world it is nine or ten years away.</p>  <p>  The reality is that in March 2020 a litre of green diesel for a tractor cost between 41 cent and 42 cent for the farming community, the contractors who do the work and indeed the builders around the country who work machines for building houses.  Yesterday, it cost between 92 cent and 94 cent in bulk.  For the people who drive to work every day, white diesel today costs &euro;1.68 and petrol &euro;1.78.  These are people who, as the T&aacute;naiste has said before, get up early in the morning and go to work.  I fully agree with looking after the people who are on low incomes, such as those on the fuel allowance, and there has been much talk of that.  However, what is this Government's plan?  I do not mean eight years down the line when we get the offshore turbines.  It is not going to happen tomorrow.  What is our plan for the next three to six months for the farmer whose fertiliser has now gone from &euro;350 or &euro;400 depending on the type to &euro;870 or &euro;970, again dependent on type?  What is going to happen the contractor who cuts the silage for the farmer with the Government putting in another carbon tax in May on green diesel?  Bear in mind white diesel in 2020 was &euro;1.20.  Green diesel is going to be &euro;1, from what we can see, over the coming weeks.  What is going to happen to the people who get up early in the mooring and drive to work, bearing in mind that we have not the facility for the LNG and that we basically brought in legislation in the previous D&aacute;il that said there would be no more exploration?  If the EU puts gas under the green energy banner, will there be exploration then?  Will the legislation be changed so Ireland can do that?  Are we going to put in the LNG stations so we can take it in?  What are we going to do for those people who get up early in the morning and are now paying exorbitant rates to produce food if they are farmers or to go to work if they are consumers?</p></speech>

Ireland does not use very much Russian gas.  Pretty much half our gas comes from our own supplies in the Corrib gas field and the other half comes from Britain.  Most of that either comes from Britain, Norway or Qatar.  The gas comes from Qatar on ships to LNG terminals in Britain and then comes across the pipelines into Ireland.  Thus, while we do not have an LNG terminal, we use LNG.  It just comes in from Britain rather than coming into one of our ports.  While any potential reduction or cut off in Russian gas would not directly hit supplies here, there would of course be a knock-on effect because if the supply goes down globally, the price will go up globally.</p>  <p>  On LNG, I understand there is a planning application in from a private company, New Fortress Energy, to build an LNG terminal in north Kerry.  The Government is not supporting that project because we believe the future is in renewable energy and hydrogen but we are not going to block it either.  There is a planning process and if the company gets planning permission and can finance its project then it will be able to proceed.  It is not the case the Government is blocking it but we have decided not to support it actively because we do not think long-term 30- or 40-year investments in fossil fuels of this nature make sense.  The same thing applies to exploration.  There are already many existing licences and those licences stand.  People can use them.  If more gas is discovered as a consequence of exploration on foot of those licences that gas will be brought ashore.  We do not think it makes sense to issue new licences that would not be acted on for decades, perhaps, because we do not want to be taking that gas out in 30 or 40 years' time when we will have the alternative sources of energy we aim to have.</p>  <p>  On the general issue of fuel prices and the cost of living, everyone in Government appreciates the cost of living is rising and that we are seeing levels of inflation at 5% and 6%, which we have not seen in 20 years.  We used to see them a lot but we have not for about 20 years and that is creating a real squeeze.  It is really affecting family budgets, creating a real squeeze for many families, increasing business costs and also having a significant impact on people on low incomes who, if they have to choose to spend more on petrol, diesel or energy, then have to choose to spend less on things like groceries, for example.  That has a real impact.  That is why I was an early advocate, as far back as last June, of ensuring we had a welfare, pensions and tax package in the last budget.  The best way to help people with the cost of living is to increase their incomes, increase their take-home pay and give them the discretion as to how they spend their money.  That is why I signed off on that increase in the minimum wage.  It is why pay is being increased in the public service.  It is why we had a welfare, pensions and tax package which many people actually opposed at the time.  We appreciate we need to do more.  One part of that is the energy credit that is being worked on at the moment.</p></speech>

Where is this going to come from?  What plan has the Government?  It is lovely to talk about what the T&aacute;naiste believes about the next 40 years.  I do not have a problem with him on that, in the context of exploration, having LNG terminals or whatever.  That is fine.</p> <p>What I am talking about is not 40 years, not the eight years referenced by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications yesterday or two years.  It is about the next six months and getting the people of this country over the torture they are going through with the cost of living and fuel prices.  What is the Government doing for those people?  What is the plan? </p></speech>

The budget also provided for reductions in income tax, increases in tax credits and widening of the tax bands so that people on middle incomes who are also struggling with the increased cost of living would get something.  In that way, we made sure that somebody who is not getting a pay increase from his or her employer at least got something.  That is why we were so determined to have an income tax package.</p>  <p>  I remind Members who are complaining about the high cost of living that they are the same people who voted against the budget and those income tax reductions in this House.  They complain about the fact that we have a high cost of living and yet would have middle income people earn less and take home less each day.  If the Opposition parties were in the Government, the average middle income family would have &euro;800 less a year in their pockets every year.</p></speech>

By God, if that is where he is, God help renters out there.</p>  <p>  I will ask him about an article by Darragh McDonagh published this morning that is based on records released under freedom of information.  It clearly debunks the line peddled by the T&aacute;naiste and other members of the Government that the event held in Iveagh House in June was an impromptu one.  We now know that departmental officials were told to gather "down the back of the...[office]" in an email from the Secretary General's office the day before the event.  Does the T&aacute;naiste now accept that there needs to be a proper investigation into what happened and not an internal review, given what we now know?  If so, when will that happen?

There was great shock among section 39 workers and disability service providers that they may be excluded from this.

At the height of the pandemic in March 2020, these staff donned personal protective equipment and worked in Covid-19 environments and family homes to provide continuity of services for the people they support.  The T&aacute;naiste stated last week that healthcare staff wearing gowns and masks and who are exposed to Covid-19 in clinical settings should receive special recognition.  Are section 39 workers being considered for this payment that is being discussed in government at the moment?</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, we included, in respect of private employment, people working in nursing homes and hospices.  The Department of Health is now drawing up the detailed guidelines.  There will certainly be some people working with section 39 organisations who are directly involved in healthcare provision.  We are looking in particular at the whole area of congregated settings because they are very similar in nature to nursing homes.  All those details are currently being worked out.</p></speech>

Like many others, I share the concerns about it not being a targeted approach.  I understand the administrative burden related to means testing something like that, but I cannot understand why this Government will also give 62,000 holiday homeowners that credit.  A person who is wealthy enough not only to own his or her own home but also a holiday home will get an additional &euro;100 credit on his or her electricity bills.  Will the T&aacute;naiste respond to that?</p></speech>

There will be a chance to debate and tease out these issues.  One issue that has come up is that if we start to exclude or exempt particular types of residences, it makes it much harder to do.  It seems it is quite straightforward to knock &euro;100 or &euro;113.50 off every domestic bill, but when we start to create different categories of people or residences it then becomes much slower and more expensive to administer.  We have to bear that in mind.</p></speech>

Last week, a crowd called Occu, acting on behalf of a group called Haliday, advertised build-to-rent apartments.  These are two blocks, Cualanor, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  One young woman I know, who is facing homelessness and is approved for the housing assistance payment, HAP, went there and was told by the person present to look around and that she could have whatever apartment she wanted.  They were advertised, by the way, at &euro;2,200.  She said she would have No. 11 and, having looked at it, then said she would need to sort this out with HAP.  She said she would have to overpay on the HAP homeless rate, which is only &euro;1,900, but many people do that.  As soon as she mentioned HAP, she was told: "Oh, I'm sorry, we are not set up to do HAP".  My office then phoned the same crowd to ask why they were not taking HAP.  We were told that it was not set up for it and anyway all the places had now been rented out.  That is outrageous.  What will the Government do about that kind of thing?  How can it defend that behaviour by estate agents and owners of apartment blocks?</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste will be aware that many students who submitted projects may have already suffered from Covid, been in isolation until 14 January and missed their deadlines.  They carry that dilemma with them right through to June.  It is fair to say that one more time is what is required.  Students have a legitimate expectation that legislators like us will provide for their educational future.  The disruption of Covid and what it has caused, whether it is teachers missing or students themselves, means they deserve to be able to avail of the hybrid option one more time.  I ask that this be given to them as soon as practically possible for the sake of their mental health and their families' well-being.</p></speech>

Workers in nursing homes and hospitals are rightly in line for this bonus.  It is glaringly obvious that one team of workers, home help workers and carers, have been omitted from this payment.  Thousands of home help workers carried out Trojan work during the pandemic.  They visited and cared for the elderly in their homes and, in many cases, had to work in a Covid environment.  During the pandemic, they were exposed to the risk of contracting Covid on a daily basis while working in uncontrolled environments and doing their best to keep patients safely in their homes, even in some cases where families were not allowed visit.</p> <p>Surely, given this workload, home help workers and carers in west Cork and beyond should be included in the &euro;1,000 recognition payment.  Last week, I met a home help worker in Dunmanway who said to me that it is not so much the money, it is the respect.  Can the T&aacute;naiste confirm today that home help workers and carers will be included in the &euro;1,000 recognition payment?</p></speech>

At that time, the pretender notification stated a minimum of three bases.  In his response he said: "I can say what we expect to be the outcome."  He also said that the outcome would be that there will continue to be four bases and he named Sligo as one of them but he also said that there is a contractual process under way.  Since then, things have changed and a Cabinet decision last Monday reported that there would now be four bases.

Thankfully, this happened a few minutes before the school finished for the day and no children were injured.  We are seeing motorist behaviour outside schools throughout the country that is putting children at risk.  Parents do not believe it is safe to let their children walk or cycle to school and as such it is compounding problem and a vicious cycle.  We can break the vicious cycle through the safe routes to school programme.  The challenge is the implementation, delivery and roll-out of this programme as quickly as possible.  If it is rolled out quickly, we will create better towns, cities and villages.  It is imperative that we get children walking and cycling to school.

This is not only being rolled out to specific or urban areas, but also to our towns and villages.

I had this experience myself recently.  For years, I have been using Internet banking and phone banking and using my card reader at home and so on, which I have found very good.  I had not been in a bank for a long time, but I recently visited a bank on Baggot Street because I had to change the PIN for my card.  I had to interact with this very strange large machine that looked like an ATM but was not an ATM.  It was very complicated.  All I needed was somebody to help me out but there was nobody there except for a security guard and some machines.  As it happened, I contacted the AIB helpline and the person who answered was extremely helpful and I was able to solve the problem, but it did remind me of the value every now and then of human contact and of having a person in the post office, the bank branch or wherever one may go.  While we do not have any legal powers around this matter, I do engage regularly with the banks on behalf of businesses and I will raise the issue with them.</p></speech>

That sum is chicken feed in the context of the HSE budget.  Experts such as Mr. Connor Green and Professor Damien McCormack appeared before the health committee and literally begged for this money so that they could put in place a plan to deal with these horrific waiting lists.  The mothers of these children, several of whom are from north Kildare, were expecting an announcement before Christmas and they were devastated when it was not made.  I am pleading with Government to provide the funding.

Will the Government ensure that every child and family affected by this situation will get the care and support they need right now?

We need to try to make things better for them in any way we can.  Where there have been other serious events where there were failings in our health services, the HSE has put in place packages for patients and families.  It is appropriate that that should be done on this occasion.</p>  <p>  The HSE has apologised verbally and in writing to all of the children and families affected.  That was done as part of the new open disclosure policy.  The matter of a State apology will have to be given consideration by Government and by the Taoiseach.

It is important we get an early decision.  Reports in the media suggest that school historical results may be used in the standardisation of accredited grades.  Two years ago, the Minister, Deputy Foley, correctly accepted that this would mean students in disadvantaged schools would lose out across the board.  It is an elitist approach.  There are viable alternatives in standardisation, including use of assessment tools as applied in the North, the use of rank order within a class to apply a percentage based average, and so on.  We need a hybrid model.  The use of historical data would be a mistake.  It is elitist.</p> <p>A solution based on those data might relieve stress on some people but it might also intensify the anxiety of students in schools in disadvantaged areas that previously had lower results.</p></speech>

The State has made considerable progress in the capacity of ASD units in primary schools, which is a good thing.  However, there is an acute shortage of ASD feeder schools, particularly for children who are leaving primary settings and moving to secondary education.</p>  <p>  I am sure these issues arise across the State.  A number of families in Clondalkin have contacted me in recent days to tell me there will be no places whatsoever for their children come September or the following September.  They have tried everywhere in the Clondalkin area and beyond but as of September, there will have no places available.  It is obviously causing anxiety for the children concerned and their families.  I understand this is an issue of resourcing and secondary schools are being resourced.  However, there needs to be extra capacity for these families.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding that, it is important that we work with the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and liaise on the transition between primary school and post-primary school.

I note the Central Statistics Office housing figures came out earlier today.  They showed that 20,000 new homes were built in Ireland last year.  That was not as many as we needed but it was a reasonable performance, given that construction was shut down for a long period last year.  We expect that figure will go well above 20,000 this year.</p>  <p>  We know that we need more homes of all types in Ireland.  We need large family homes, three-bed, two-bed and one-bed homes.  The greatest shortage and need is for one-bed homes.  That is why we need to make sure we build a decent proportion of them.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, there are huge numbers of objections to planning applications for new housing in this city and country, for almost any reason.  There are also a considerable number of judicial reviews.  The Attorney General and the relevant Minister are working on reforms to our planning legislation to ensure it is not so easy for people to hold up necessary housing developments for so long.</p></speech>

We contacted each of the 30 dentists in the county listed by the HSE on its website.  Of all the many dental practices throughout the county, only one said it was currently treating medical card patients and taking on new patients, and even then it was only doing so for specific treatments.  In a county the size of Mayo, with a population of 130,000, that is shocking.  Ten practices told us they are no longer providing any medical card dental services and only one practice is taking on new medical card patients.  It is not good enough.  This has happened because between 2017 and 2020, the allocation for medical card patients was cut by 30% from &euro;3.5 million.  There are two issues here.  We need to know what the Government is going to do as a matter of urgency.  We also need to know why the HSE is putting out false information around this issue.</p></speech>

I am not sure about the details in Mayo specifically but many dentists have withdrawn from the scheme in different parts of the country.  The budget for the scheme is being increased and discussions with the Irish Dental Association about getting the scheme working well again will soon be under way, if they are not under way already.  I will ask the Minister to give the Deputy a more detailed response because I am not as up to date on the matter as perhaps I should be.</p></speech>

I understand that inclusive of VAT, that amount will be &euro;113.  When will people get the rebate?  Are there any plans to increase this figure?  While we all welcome these kinds of announcements, it is unfair that people are not given clear information and timeframes.  We were delighted with the announcement that front-line workers are to get &euro;1,000.  That is good news.  However, there is confusion surrounding it.  People are ringing us and we have no clear information.  While these announcements are great, I suggest we put in place a timeframe to ensure we are absolutely clear in our information.  When people ring our offices, we need to be able to tell them where we are and what the timeframe is.</p></speech>

Some 50,000 people are on some form of health waiting list, the majority of whom are waiting to see a consultant.  What is obvious about the figure is that it is huge and affects people from across the region.  It is the equivalent of the population of Waterford city.  Patients from across the south east use the hospital.</p>  <p>  For years, many of us in this House, including some of the T&aacute;naiste's Government colleagues, have been pointing out that there are clear capacity deficits at University Hospital Waterford.  Five years ago, at a meeting of Oireachtas Members, we were promised a new eye clinic, a new orthopaedic centre of excellence and additional bed capacity.  None of those came on stream.  The cath lab, which has long been promised, is still being built and is not open.  While we are looking at additional capacity in healthcare, and I support every additional cent and bed that goes into the system, can we also look at regional inequalities?</p></speech>

That was the case before the pandemic and they have got considerably worse as a result of the pandemic and the cyberattack.  We need to turn the tide in that regard and ensure those waiting lists and waiting times improve over the next couple of years.  I absolutely agree that we need to look at the regional disparities.  There will always be regional disparities to a certain extent but there should not be gross regional disparities where people in one part of the country have to wait much longer than people in other parts.  We will have to take that into account.</p></speech>

Those jobs will be gone by January 2023.  What engagement has the Government had with the company?  This is not the first time we have been down this road.  Communications between National Pen and its workers have been dreadful over many years.  There is a fear around its promises and commitments.  The T&aacute;naiste also spoke of an attractive redundancy package.  There is a fear in that regard among many workers who have given long-term service to the company.  A top-tier management team is going up against individuals.  The workforce is not unionised.  We will finally have to address the issue of collective bargaining.  Will the T&aacute;naiste give me some information about the Government's engagement and the promises to ensure there is an attractive package for those who have done fine work for this company that has been in Dundalk since 1987?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, some jobs are going to be lost.  The operations are being outsourced to eastern Europe, to either the Czech Republic or Hungary.  These redundancies, unfortunately, cannot be prevented although there will be job increases in other parts of the company.  National Pen remains committed to Dundalk, which is welcome.</p> <p>We are advised that a decent or generous redundancy package will be offered to the staff.  I do not know the details of that but we are advised that will be the case.</p> <p> Obviously, from the Government side, we will make sure former employees and employees who are being made redundant get whatever help Government can give them in terms of help with job searches and information about welfare or other opportunities such as education, training and upskilling.</p></speech>

Quite simply, it is fair to say we are failing as a nation to address the scourge of human trafficking.</p><p>If we look at the Trafficking in Persons, TIP, Report produced by the US State Department,124 countries are ranked higher than us, that is, doing more than we are in this regard.  In June 2020, we fell to the tier 2 watchlist.  In June 2021, we were still on the tier 2 watchlist.  After two years on the tier 2 watchlist, there is an automatic falling to tier 3, which brings with it all sorts of consequences for our State with regard to our relationship with America.  Really, however, this is not about self-interest.  Behind the TIP Report are a huge number of vulnerable victims whom we are ultimately failing.</p><p>If we look at the expos&eacute; by both <i>The Guardian</i>and the International Transport Workers Federation of the fishing industry, we see the brutal conditions to which victims of trafficking and labour exploitation are often exposed.  There is a major issue of sexual exploitation and forced work in this country.</p><p>The Amnesty International report released the other day showed exactly the dangers to which those people in forced sex work positions are exposed.  The Global Slavery Index estimates there are 8,000 victims of trafficking in Ireland, but in 2020 we identified only 38.  It was the fourth year in a row where the number of victims of trafficking we identified had fallen.  Our response to trafficking and our ability to identify victims of it is getting worse.</p><p>Until 2021, there were no successful prosecutions with regard to human trafficking.  We need to change the way in which we engage with the recognition of victims and how we provide support to give them the safety to come out and be able to talk about their experiences.  We must support and make it easier for them to do that.</p><p>My Bill introduces an early identification system that is much broader than the current system, which only allows for the Garda.  It includes social workers, support workers, NGOs and trade unions.  These are people who will be dealing more directly with the victims of trafficking and who can contribute to their early identification.  It includes a system of supports for victims so they are not left abandoned and alone.  It includes issues around immunity from prosecution, which is an essential element, particularly if someone is being trafficked here and forced to engage in criminal behaviour.  The immunity is needed for such a person to be able to escape the situation he or she is in.  It also includes the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>to child victims so that our focus on the most vulnerable victims of trafficking is improved.</p><p>I have been working on this Bill for some time.  In recent months, the Government announced its intention to review the referral mechanism.  Since that intention was announced last year, we have had no further details.  It is not just about the referral mechanism.  It is about supports in and around that, for example, as I mentioned earlier, guardian <i>ad litem</i>supports for victims and the issue of immunity.  These are all the essential elements of responding to human trafficking and our better support of victims.</p><p>There have been efforts at awareness campaigns but we need more than awareness campaigns.  We need to review and reform the structure around the identification of victims and the supports they get so that it is easier for them to be identified and to seek and be given help.  That is the reason I move this Bill.</p></speech>

I have written to the Minister of State, so I have given him notice of many of my questions on the national broadband plan.  I thank him for the letter I received yesterday.  To put it on the record of the House, my questions to the Minister of State, which were in December and he may address them in his answers, were whether his Department had been notified about whether the principal investors or funders of the national broadband plan were about to exit the deal in December, whether replacement funding was being sought, whether there were change of control provisions in place that required the Minister of State&rsquo;s oversight if the principal investor were to exit the deal early, whether there were primary controls around milestone payments and the status of that from the Minister of State's perspective, whether the Minister of State was concerned about the ability of National Broadband Ireland, NBI, to continue if there was a cash flow issue, the visibility of the Minister of State and the Department over National Broadband Ireland&rsquo;s finances, as well as its ability to sustain the cost of deployment, and the impact of Covid-19 on the national broadband plan in terms of the proportion delivered and what that was relative to expectations.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State is aware of my questions.  I thank him for the reply and I just wanted to make the House aware.  Perhaps the Minister of State will acknowledge those questions and then I will have two or three more short questions for him.</p></speech>

Within the contract, there is provision for early termination on both sides, and there are details around that.  At this stage, we have no reason to expect that NBI will do anything other than continue to deliver the contract in full within the seven years for the maximum amount of money that was agreed.  The figure of &euro;2.1 billion is a maximum payment rather than a fixed payment.</p>  <p>  There are milestone payments.  The structure of the payments within this contract has been carefully detailed.  The contractor is paid for the work that is done as we go along.  For each number of homes connected, it receives a particular bonus.  If it does not connect the homes, it does not receive any money.  That is the structure of the contract.  It is not such that the contractor will continue to receive payments month on month or year on year without delivering on its contract.  Its payments are strictly linked.</p>  <p>  There has been an impact from Covid-19.  It has slowed the contractor down.  It has made it several months later than it should be.  However, that is not the entire story.  Part of the problem is the contractor's fault.  Part of the delay comes simply from the natural things that happen within the roll-out of a large contract, whereby there will be a period of time where you are developing momentum and becoming more skilled.  I would expect that at least a portion of the delays are the fault of NBI.  It may believe it is the fault of its subcontractors and may try to attribute blame, but that does not excuse it because it is not in a position to abdicate its responsibility.  It must take responsibility, even in a situation where it has delegated authority for some of its functions.  That is my answer to that.</p></speech>

I saw yesterday in the Seanad that a number of 54,000 connections was mentioned.  I think the milestone was set at 60,000 homes being ready for connection by the end of January, although I am open to correction on that.  Is that correct?  I am told that there are 34,000 and that the Minister of State can forward order another 20,000 that are not yet ready for connection.  Is that accurate?  What is the Minister of State&rsquo;s own role in calling out the milestones?</p> <p>What are the specific targets for 2022 at this point?</p></speech>

We will continue to update them on progress as we go along.  The figure of 54,000 relates to homes that can order or pre-order.  Homes that can order will get their fibre connected within ten days and those that can pre-order will get it within 90 days.  That means that if all 54,000 homes ordered or pre-ordered today, they would have their connection within 90 days.  That is where we are at.  I expect the number available for order will be at 60,000 by March.</p></speech>

My concerns are slightly more micro than the business model.  There is a community in east Mayo that is very entrepreneurial but also has many families living in it.  Within this community there are three home-grown companies that export internationally.  We have been working with NBI for some time to try to get a sense of when a fibre connection will go into these companies and into the community.  This community recently lost all its banking services so we are told to do that online as well as access all Government services through <i>gov.ie</i>.  NBI came back and told us it will be done between January 2025 and December 2026.  That is not a window; that is a conservatory.  That shows a lack of ambition.</p><p>I am concerned we are coming up to the last week of January and we do not have a sense of what connections will happen in 2022.  The Covid excuse has to finish now.  NBI keeps telling us it is working on the ground and we keep getting emails saying it is in our area, but the reality for this community is that jobs could be lost.  One company wants to invest in an enterprise resource planning, ERP, system, which is a state-of-the-art technical system, and has a major investment plan but cannot do that because it cannot even get an interaction with National Broadband Ireland about its service.  The complaint of this community is replicated across Mayo.  Businesses are struggling nationwide.  There is also an issue whereby, because this community is in an NBI area, even though there is an Eir cable going through the community and along the road, it cannot be connected because NBI might get to it in a two-year window between 2025 and 2026.  What urgency is there?  In the context of the Government's plans around remote broadband hubs and remote working, has the Minister of State engaged with NBI about putting more urgency into this delivery?  Instead of getting so much spin and so much material, can we start to challenge NBI on what it is delivering on the ground?</p></speech>

Everybody would like it tomorrow.  It is a seven-year contract to connect 540,000 homes.  We are two years in so there are five years left.  A proportion of those homes are due to be connected in years 6 and 7, that is, 2025 and 2026.  I can understand that people will be disappointed if they are in an area that is due in 2025 or 2026.  That is not true of the whole of Mayo.  A total of 11,373 homes have been surveyed in Mayo already and 4,033 are under construction, so they will have their service within a matter of months.  Mayo is not one single deployment area but multiple deployment areas.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked what I can do to liaise with NBI.  I am taking a very hands-on approach.  I have been in nearly every county in Ireland in the past year.  I have met the chief executive of NBI, Peter Hendrick, on many occasions.  I also attended the two most recent board meetings of NBI.  I facilitated a meeting between NBI and Eir's chief executive and chair to ensure I understood what communications there were between the main subcontractor and the contractor itself.  I am examining everything we can do to accelerate the project.  My absolute focus is on getting the volume of connections up to a point where the project is back on track.  It is not okay that we were six months behind after the pandemic and then more months behind because of other delays, or that we announced a number at one point and then had to announce a smaller number within two months.  That is going to inspire pessimism in people but I am optimistic.  This happens with projects.  There is sometimes a valley of doom period where you are very optimistic at the start but then people start to lose faith because they come across all the real-world problems, such as blocked ducts, phone lines that are down, and rivers and railway lines that have to be crossed.  We will overcome that, we will accelerate, rejoin and get every home in Ireland connected to fibre-optic broadband.  It is an incredibly optimistic and ambitious project but it is not over-ambitious.  We are going to bring fibre-optic broadband to every house, premises and farm in Ireland.</p></speech>

I will deal with two major questions.  We have all seen the commentary, particularly in the <i>Business Post</i>, on the financial structures involved here.  David McCourt has spoken about looking at different corporate structures or investors and there will be an element of communication with the Government on that.  We need to ensure we can deliver the project, that the vehicle is fit for purpose and that this will not impact on NBI's ability to deliver.  At this time, it looks like the person who was awarded the contract was awarded it despite the emperor having no clothes.  He was able to put up huge expensive debt as equity.  I ask the Minister of State to address that matter and the structure and then we will get onto the issue of the roll-out.</p></speech>

Finally, there was only one bidder because the other bidders dropped out and the contract was awarded to NBI.  The terms of that contract stated NBI had to provide &euro;100 million of investment as part of its investment in the project and a total of &euro;175 million would be required over time.  That &euro;100 million did come in, plus another &euro;20 million in the last two months.  We are now at &euro;120 million of investment from the investors and another &euro;55 million is to be delivered.  All of that has come in on time.  There has been discussion of whether that &euro;100 million is debt or equity.  The vast majority of it - 99% - is in the form of a hybrid investment, which has characteristics of debt and characteristics of equity.  In other words, it is a shareholder loan.  At the end of the day, the investors had to come up with that money and they had to put it into the-----</p></speech>

Some 34,417 premises have now been passed.  NBI says it will pass 60,000 by the end of March, although that was meant to have happened by now.  I asked about the Covid delays and the acceleration.  NBI has suddenly got rapid response teams and it can be done with them but there is a difficulty in dealing with Eir's "make ready" process.  NBI says it will need Eir to be able to deliver quicker, or else it needs a self-install product whereby it could do the business itself and not have to call Eir back out to clear a blockage, because that is madness.  It is saying it will now be six years rather than five, in the best-case scenario.  What have the Department and the Minister of State done to ensure we can provide what NBI needs to deliver that acceleration?</p></speech>

NBI says it wants more autonomy in how it works.  If it puts cable through a duct which is blocked, it does not want to have to ask Eir for permission to unblock that duct.  The irony NBI points out is that the company dealing with the blocking of the ducts is often the same as the subcontractor being used by Eir at the same time.  Some paperwork goes back and forth and the same crew carries out the works.  It has found that the duct network----</p></speech>

The Minister of State gave some details which seemed to contradict some of the information in the public domain.  I ask the Minister of State why NBI's investors were permitted to fund the company through high-cost loans on which they will earn significant interest, instead of through the purchase of shares.  It is reported that there was a &euro;223 million investors' contribution and that it would be made by way of equity investment.  In fact, it is reported that it was almost exclusively debt; some &euro;221 million of debt.  Those are the figures in the public domain.  I ask the Minister of State whether they are accurate and what is the current state of affairs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.365" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="13:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700031#GG00800"><p>The sums of money are accurate.  There is some misunderstanding on the description of the investment.  A private-equity investor considers all of his or her investments are equity, whether they are pure shareholding or pure debt.  In the case of the funding model for NBI or the investment model, this was agreed in the contract.  It is funded with 12% interest loans, but they are shareholder loans.  They are not the type of loans one might imagine.</p>  <p>  If one was to lend money to somebody, one would expect to see a repayment schedule, start date and maturity date and might expect to see some kind of security.  However, this loan is only repayable when half the network has been delivered or, in other words, when half the houses have been connected.  It is only repayable after 2024 and if NBI is in profit.  In other words, this is the kind of loan one makes to somebody which is repayable when one has it.  That is a very different kind of proposition from being made a loan and needing to make repayments on certain dates.</p>  <p>  When a shareholder loan is tied to the performance of a company, its characteristics are more like a shareholder.  That is why it is sometimes called a participating loan.  It is a form of hybrid investment and very commonly used in infrastructure.  This type of investment was specified and delineated in the contract, along with the interest rate.  It is not an incredibly profitable investment for the investors in that they get this 12%, whereas they can only get a much smaller amount.  There is a risk profile here, which is very similar to the risk profile for a shared investment.</p></speech>

That is reported.  I ask the Minister whether that is the case and if so, whether it runs contrary to the project information memo, which clearly states on page 110 that bidders had to foot their own costs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.367" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="13:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700031#GG01000"><p>I am happy to clear this up.  The project information memo for any Government contracts says that the investors pay their own bid costs.  Indeed, the process of the bid went on for a number of years.  It would have involved many millions of euro of investment and when the company won the bid and set up, it repaid the costs of the bid from the investors' own capital back to those same investors again, in proportion to the amounts of money they had spent.  It is the repayment of expenses.  It comes out of money put in by the investors.  It is not in contradiction with the information note, which says the State does not pay the costs of the bidders.  The investors pay their own costs back.  Those costs have to be audited.  It is a company that has audited accounts.  There would be receipts for every piece of expenditure and that is the whole story.</p></speech>

That is not acceptable.  This contract is costing Irish taxpayers &euro;3 billion.  There should be no scope for failure, especially when one considers the price of failure for so many families, workers and communities waiting in anticipation of being connected to this network.</p>  <p>  I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure we do not accept what I would consider in some instances to be fairly dubious excuses as to why those targets have not been met.  The key question that has not been answered on the issue of the distinction between loans and investments equity and debt is why the investors would have chosen the loan route, if it is the exact same principle, which is, in essence, what the Minister of State said.  Why did those people who were investing do so in the form of loans rather than equity?</p></speech>

This was the agreed investment structure from 2019.  If they are international investors, it may suit their tax treatment in the jurisdictions in which they live.  I do not know.  Certainly, we got Ernst &amp;amp; Young to examine the investments and comment on the risk profile, which was similar to the investors having bought shares.  It was acceptable at the time to people who signed the contract in 2019 and now my job as Minister of State is to ensure the terms of the contract are met and that the participants are doing all the things they have agreed to do in their contract.  What they have agreed to do in their contract is to fund it in that way and that is how that is working.  I cannot go back in time to change the contract or rewrite it.</p></speech>

I will return briefly to the fees that were paid to the investors.  According to the public reports that have been referenced, of the &euro;38 million in fees to investors, some &euro;32.7 million was paid to a company, NBI Bidco LLC, which we are told is controlled by David McCourt and was set up about one week before the contract was signed.  How could a company that was set up seven day's prior be entitled to that sort of money?</p></speech>

David McCourt-controlled companies were the ones that led during the bid.  The other investors were putting up the money at a later stage, so it is natural that many of the costs of the bid were attributable to a company controlled by him.  I understand the Deputy's question on how a company set up recently before the bid was awarded can be due to recover the costs.  I would have to consult with the lawyers and see about that.</p><p>The movement of money in and out of the company is an audited process.  It is an audited company and to break any of those rules would be a criminal offence.  It is under great scrutiny and it is right that the Deputy asks these questions and the <i>Business Post</i>asks questions about it.  That is the process of transparency and I am happy to answer any questions.  If I do not have the detail on that one, I am happy to supply it to the Deputy from my office.</p></speech>

With regard to NBI now, is the Minister of State satisfied he knows who controls the shareholdings, has the voting rights, holds the necessary investment and who is entitled to the necessary percentage of the dividends?</p> <p>That, in particular, is the important question.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that the Department is aware of the individuals and entities that control every percentage point of what is a substantial piece of infrastructure running across the country?</p></speech>

Ownership is defined there and control is defined there.  NBI, if the Deputy is wondering about the dividends, is not a profitable company.  It starts to make money when it connects a lot of people.  Until a lot of homes are being connected, it will not be in profit.  Metallah Limited is the holding company.  NBI Infrastructure DAC, which is party to the project agreement with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, is the entity responsible for the overall national broadband project.  Finally, NBI Deployment DAC is the party to a subcontract with NBI Infrastructure DAC under which it is responsible for the design and build of the national broadband network.</p></speech>

The difficulty is that up until this point the Department has essentially accepted the new so-called "milestones".  How robust will the Department be in ensuring that there is a penalty applied for the failure to deliver on the substantial contract?</p></speech>

The previous Deputy mentioned this and I would like a specific answer on it.  If the Minister of State cannot provide it in the Chamber now, he can provide it in writing.</p>  <p>  Granahan McCourt Dublin (Ireland) Limited was made the preferred bidder on 7 May 2019.  Four days before they signed the contract, the name was changed to Granahan McCourt Dublin Limited and "(Ireland)" was dropped.  The new company's directors were appointed on the same day.  Deputy Ossian Smyth was not Minister or Minister of State at the time, but has he ever been given an explanation as to why that change in the structure of the preferred bidder took place?  This was before we knew anything about Metallah or any of the background investors, or the pure investment structures.  This was purely on the preferred bidder.  At the inception point of this, there was a change four days out which may seem small - the dropping of a word.  Maybe there is a simple explanation for it, but we need that explanation.  Everything that has happened since would indicate that maybe there is not a simple explanation and that this was maybe the first move in what has become a Byzantine investment structure that is now running a &euro;2.97 billion investment project - the biggest investment project in the history of the State.  If the Minister of State could answer that first, I would appreciate it.</p></speech>

I do not know if the Deputy is wondering whether there is something untoward about that or there was something wrong, or that the bidder should have been of exactly the same name as the company that signed the contract at the end.

The membership of the board of NBI is not published on its website.  I accept it is not a semi-State agency, but it is the practice in big semi-State agencies for us to know who is on the boards.  We know who is on the board of almost every organisation that has any interest in the public good or public services in this country.  In this case, we do not.  Instead, we have another biography of Mr. David McCourt, as the chair of the board.  Given the size of this investment and given how important it is, this is something I have asked the company.  They just said that they would take my comments on board.  It is not easy for anybody to go and check who the board of directors of this important company are.  It does not help with the transparency.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.386" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1564" speakername="Duncan Smith" time="13:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700032#HH01400"><p>They do.  I will double-check if that is the case because I checked it a couple of hours ago in advance of this and I did not see it.  I will check again.</p>  <p>  I would rather be here talking about the many local issues that I and my party colleagues have in relation to the roll-out and how far behind it is but we are not there with this.  There are too many questions.</p>  <p>  The &euro;50 million that was paid in fees and interest payments last year has prompted the Department to ask William Fry and EY to examine the funding structure of NBI at a time when, at committee and in response to parliamentary questions, etc., we are being told how far behind the roll-out is.  I accept Covid had an impact but, on further interrogation in committee meetings, it does not tally that Covid is responsible for all of the level of delays and problems.</p>  <p>  We are very concerned about Ireland being on the hook with an investment and corporate structure that has the potential to fleece the public purse.  That is what it does, if they are not to deliver.</p>  <p>  I believe the Minister of State's commitment in delivering this and making sure it is delivered, but we were talking all week about flexible work, about people working from home and, in a committee yesterday, about regenerating rural towns and villages and having people being able to live and work there.  This is the lifeblood of any of that being a success.  With this being so far behind and so far delayed and with the many questions that are popping up on a near monthly basis in relation to the finances, who or what investment firms are behind these companies and where those investment firms are based, is the Minister of State confident that the investment firms that are backing up NBI are in it for the long haul?  This has been compared to landmarks in progression such as the ESB rural electrification programme and getting a telephone into every house but all those companies, be it ESB or Telecom &Eacute;ireann, were State companies in it for the long haul at the time.  I do not in my gut feel that this crowd are in it for the long haul.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.387" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="13:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700032#HH01500"><p>In his first question, the Deputy talked about the State, the taxpayer or the Government being on the hook for large payments, and said that the service not being delivered was the fear.  That is absolutely a fear with any infrastructure project.  That is probably the idea that those who drafted or agreed the contract had in mind to use a private company to subcontract it out so that the risk would be transferred.  The company only receives money when it does things.  There were some subsidy payments for setting up the network originally and for various milestones met and now they only get money when they connect homes.  That is how the risk is reduced.  They have a big incentive to connect as many homes as possible.  When they connect a home they get a subsidy payment but they also get payment for anybody who connects to the network - they get a revenue stream.  They have an incentive, not only to get the fibre to go past people's homes but also to get them to take up the service.</p>  <p>  We have paid out &euro;177.5 million in subsidy so far.  The maximum subsidy we have agreed to pay out is &euro;2.1 billion.  The Deputy can see that is the proportion spent so far.  We have another &euro;480 million in contingency funds, which was in the budget but not in the contract.  The company has no entitlement to that but the Government has that in its budget if it needs to find some other way if it comes across unforeseen problems or for some reason it needs extra money on the project.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also asked whether the investors are in this for the long haul.  NBI can decide that it wants to bring in new investors with the consent of the Minister.  It can come back to the Department stating that it wants to fund itself with longer term investment and it wants to go for lower interest longer term investors.</p> <p>If it wants to do that, we will examine that and give it consent if it thinks it is a good idea.  That is certainly possible but it has not yet come to us with anything.</p></speech>

It relates to my constituency and those of the Minister of State and Deputy Duncan Smith, and to all those quasi-rural parts of Dublin that have not been covered.  Will the Minister of State identify where they are being brought up to speed to ensure they will be included in the wider roll-out of the scheme?  He will know the areas I am talking about, such as Rathmichael in his constituency, and Glencullen, Ballybetagh and Kiltiernan in my constituency.  The Minister of State might address that question before I follow up with a further set of questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.390" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="13:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700033#JJ00300"><p>Dublin is not excluded from the NBP.  The NBP applies to anyone who cannot get 30 Mbps of broadband from a commercial provider, and that certainly applies to places such as Glencullen and Stepaside, and even more so in Fingal, north County Dublin.  According to the figures in front of me, 3,604 premises in Dublin are under construction at the moment as part of the national broadband plan.  Moreover, SIRO is quite active in those areas, working with the ESB and Vodafone.  It has passed 400,000 homes and will connect a further 320,000 homes.  Virgin Media is upgrading all 900,000 of its customers to fibre, while Eir has committed to upgrading hundreds of thousands more of its customers to fibre as well.  The commercial area is expanding all the time at the edges of the city and, at the same time, the national broadband plan is open to anybody who cannot obtain a commercial service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.391" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1473" speakername="Neale Richmond" time="13:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700033#JJ00400"><p>With regard to that commercial service and how it overlaps with the national broadband plan, this is an increasing phenomenon, particularly over recent years with so many people working remotely.  The Minister of State mentioned Stepaside, which, as he will be aware, is where I live.  In the cul-de-sac where I live, there are 40 homes and, during the pandemic, only two of us, namely, a nurse and I, were going into work.  The rest all worked from home.  Many of them will continue doing so, and rightly so because it is a great option for them.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, we have seen the impact on the strength of the connection.  When between 60 and 80 people in a small cul-de-sac are all online at the same time, there will be a drain.  This is an area with nominally strong coverage but the issue will become a phenomenon.  We want people to work remotely and from home, not just outside Dublin but in suburban Dublin in particular.  What efforts can be made to partner more effectively with the commercial providers to ensure those gaps will be filled?  There is a cul-de-sac in Ballinteer where the connection is perfectly fine for houses on one side of the road, while on the other side, there is zero chance of making any calls with video and so on, something that is increasingly important to so many people working in a range of areas for global employers.  That is a great concern as we come out and, I hope, stay out of this pandemic.</p>  <p>  Where can the national broadband plan work with commercial partners not just to identify those gaps but to fast-track their resolution?  This is an immediate problem and, indeed, an historical one for many people over the past 18 months.  The Minister of State talked about efficiency and it is great to hear announcements that broadband has arrived in X or Y but, in the places that have connectivity, if that connectivity is not fit for purpose, it will cause much more damage and do so more immediately.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.392" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="13:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700033#JJ00500"><p>The Deputy spoke about the differences between people's nominal broadband speeds and what they actually get, and the fact that, if many people suddenly start to work from home, the service will degrade for everybody because they are sharing a pipe at some point upstream.  That is a real concern and we are working on it.  Any Deputy who wants to meet the head of the national broadband plan in the Department can do so and can go through any issues he or she has.  That offer always stands.</p>  <p>  The Deputy went on to speak about the possibility of having a link-up between NBI and commercial providers.  There are many black spots in urban areas, and where that happens, I expect it would make more sense for NBI not to bring in its own fibre but to pay one of the commercial providers to extend from next door to cover the black spot.  NBI is in negotiations with more than one provider about that.  There are three commercial providers, so I expect those black spots will be filled.</p>  <p>  The ambition is to get gigabit fibre to everybody and to get away from copper.  Fibre to the cabinet was good enough until two years ago but now it is not and people want to have fibre to their homes.  The ambition is to get fibre to everybody's home, whether in an urban or rural area.  Only 22% live in a national broadband plan area, while 78% live in the commercial areas.</p></speech>

Some of us have spent weeks of our lives on this issue over the years as members of both the line committee and the Committee of Public Accounts, forensically examining this and going through the process, which was flawed.  Indeed, the Green Party was on this side of the House at the time.  One bidder remained at the end of the process but we could not even figure out on the eve of the signing of the contract what the entitles of that bidder were.  We got commitments that the contract would be published but it has not been published in full.  There was only one bidder, so I cannot see why there would be any commercial issues.  Will the Minister of State publish the contract in full?  We need to be able to evaluate it for ourselves.</p></speech>

I am sure she was deeply involved in the process and knows a lot about what was involved and what the arguments were regarding what kind of contract there should have been.  As I said, however, the contract has been signed and I have to execute it.</p>  <p>  The major investors in NBI are Granahan McCourt, the Tetra Corporation, Oak Hill Advisors and Twin Point Capital, along with members of the senior management team of NBI and some smaller investors.  They constitute the major investors-----</p></speech>

It is a huge contract, running to 2,200 pages or so, and there are legal constraints.  A large portion of the contract was published before I assumed office, and I have asked the Department to review with the lawyers how much more of it they can publish within the law.  The Deputy will appreciate that I am constrained by the law.  We have a system of law and I have to comply with the laws that exist.</p></speech>

The Currency produced the corporate structure, the names of which the Minister of State listed, and it has been described as Byzantine.  It does not fill us with confidence, given we did not have any in the first instance, about the ability of the company to deliver broadband to the extent that was required and within the terms of the contract and how it was going to be funded.</p>  <p>  Eir has passed about 45,000 premises in the intervention area.  The providers are, potentially, in competition with one another and compensation can be paid where duplication occurs.  Has that compensation yet arisen and is the Minister of State concerned about it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.398" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="13:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700033#JJ01100"><p>This issue is sometimes described as encroachment, where we have defined and agreed an intervention area.  A commercial provider is allowed; it is not an exclusion area.  A commercial provider is allowed to connect homes in the area if it wants to and thinks it makes sense.  The Deputy stated 45,000 homes in the intervention area have been connected by Eir, and while I cannot validate that number, that is 45,000 homes that now have fibre broadband.  I understand it is also the intention of NBI to bring fibre to those homes.  It has the option under the contract to seek a compensation payment where encroachment happens if it can show it has lost money as a result, although the provider has told me that is not its intention in that case.  Moreover, there is a limit to how much money can be paid out under that compensation scheme for encroachment.</p>  <p>  I would prefer homes to receive two options of broadband.  If a commercial provider provides fibre access within the intervention area and later goes bust, NBI will still have to continue to provide a service for 25 years.</p> <p>It is contractually obliged to provide fibre-optic broadband to 540,000 homes in the intervention area, whether or not there is a commercial company providing it.  If I were a homeowner in that area, I would be happy if there was more than one provider.</p></speech>

Eir was one of the entities in the process and, from memory, it had spent about &euro;7 million by the time it dropped out.  The key issue is that we get everybody connected that needs to be and wants to be connected.  However, within the plan, there is the encroachment area and compensation can be paid.  It is absolutely valid for us to keep an eye on that and to ask questions on it.</p></speech>

Where is the Minister of State on that?  When are we going to know the numbers that are going to be delivered?  The Minister of State talked about negotiating.  I get worried when I hear that.  This is not a two-way thing.  Given this terribly complicated way of doing things, the Department should be dictating the process.  The capacity to deliver should have been predetermined because it is a contract over seven years, although there was some time lost.  What kind of figures has the Minister of State in mind and when are they going to be published?  We need to be able to track that.</p></speech>

As to whether it is a negotiation, I am saying that from my mindset.  Everything in my life is a negotiation, even right now.  The Deputy is right.  The Government has this contract, which is a &euro;2.1 billion contract, and it only pays out the money when the company meets the terms.  That is where we are at the moment.  The company is required to meet its contractual obligations, no matter what and whether we have a conversation with it or not.  If it does not meet them----</p></speech>

Terminology is very important.  We were very conscious of that when we were debating for a very long period of time, backwards and forwards, the number of houses or premises passed and the number connected, which is very different.  The number connected is actually very low in comparison to the numbers passed.  We need to stop talking in circles on this kind of thing.  We need to have monthly figures to give us clarity on what exactly is being delivered.  There is a difference between the two of those.  We need constant updates and I do not see why it would not be routinely put on the website so we can see it.</p>  <p>  Who signed the contract?  Were the Department and the then Minister aware of the method of funding this initiative by the investors?  Was the Minister aware it was going to be as convoluted in terms of the means for these expensive loans, for example?  I cannot get my head around how anyone would take out a loan for 12.5% when they are looking at Europe-wide interest rates being so low.  How would that make a contract like this competitive?  It just does not make sense to me.  If people are really invested in something, they will invest their money in it, but this does not read like that, given the structure and funding are so convoluted and byzantine.  In fact, what it is doing is undermining the limited confidence that was there in the first instance.</p></speech>

I will start with the construction.  The Deputy talked about the different statuses.  The first one is where people are being surveyed.  The second is where their connection is under construction.  The third is where it is available for pre-order and, in other words, people can be connected to the Internet within 90 days.  The fourth is where it is available for order and people can be connected within ten days.  The fifth is when they are actually connected and they have taken up the service.  The target is to have 540,000 homes passed or, in other words, all available for order.  That is the 540,000.  It is not 540,000 homes that have taken up the offer of broadband but 540,000 homes that have fibre-optic cable outside at their kerb, available for them to connect within ten days.  That is the time it takes for NBI to get from the kerb and tunnel under a person's driveway, or whatever it is, and put it into their home.  Those are the five statuses.</p>  <p>  All of those numbers should be published on the website every month.  Most of them are published, and we send around monthly updates.  If there is anything missing, there is no reluctance to provide any of that information on as regular a basis as possible.  It is very important to do that because, otherwise, how can we measure how the roll-out is going?  I absolutely agree with that.</p></speech>

I wish to raise two items, one in regard to the deployment areas and the second in regard to delivery of service.  There is a situation just outside Castlebar where some premises are in a precarious position, with some townlands ready to go live, whereas, just across the road, there are house owners who have been informed it will be 2025 or 2026 before they get connected.  My understanding is that the roll-out would be very much based on a hub and spoke model, with the roll-out progressing outwards from the urban areas.  In this case, it certainly does not feel like a hub and spoke model.</p>  <p>  In Breaffy, which is on the outskirts of Castlebar, there are 77 premises ready for pre-order and another 27 premises which have surveys pending, along with another segment of 118 premises.  It appears there are three separate deployment areas in the one townland and all moving at different paces.  One can imagine the frustration when people talk to their neighbours in regard to who is connected and who is not.  It is similar in other villages and townlands.  In Manulla, for example, there are 257 premises where it seems nothing will happen any time soon and surveys are still pending.</p>  <p>  I would like to get the Minister of State's understanding on this issue because we constantly hear the beat of the drum about the NBI website in terms of people entering their Eircode and looking for more information.  It infuriates people when they cannot even get access to the website.  I ask that we address the issue around the deployment areas, which is an important one.</p>  <p>  Second, on the delivery element, there is the issue of annoyance for people around the pace and the resistance of NBI to either provide information or even to engage with public representatives.  I put in a request to NBI on 7 December in regard to County Mayo and it was 27 January before I got a response, even excluding the two weeks at Christmas.  However, I did get the information eventually and I want to put that on the record of the House.</p>  <p>  The information related to the 37,758 premises covered under the contract.  It is a significant amount of work and it is the third-largest customer base for NBI after Cork and Galway.  Of that, 3,348 are currently available for pre-order, which is roughly 9% of the plan.  They are located on the outskirts of Ballina and Castlebar, with 1,464 for Ballina and 1,884 for Castlebar.  In Mayo, there are 696 with the network built or in progress, which is 1.8% overall.  There are 3,726 premises that have their engineering surveys under way, which is 10.1% of the planned intervention.  Over 6,442 premises have their engineering survey planned, which is 17% of the planned interventions.  Although I am running out of speaking time, I want to put this information on the record of the House.  That leaves over 22,564 premises out of the 36,758 with the engineering survey pending.</p> <p>How will efforts be significantly ramped up to get a large proportion of premises surveyed?  What are the Department and NBI doing to get more people on the ground to implement the ramp-up strategy?</p></speech>

They do not match the boundaries of townlands.  They split across many administrative boundaries.  There is a situation where at the border of a deployment area, one house will be connected and another house is in a later phase.  That is frustrating for anybody in that situation.  That is a consequence of the design.  Part of the design is that construction happens in every county simultaneously.  That was a political decision at the start.  From an engineering point of view, one might have started in one place and gone outwards, but it was decided that construction would happen everywhere for equity.  How do we speed it up?  Do we need more resources?  I visited the headquarters of KN Network Services and asked if it wanted the Government to be involved in training more people for installation.  I have spoken to all the different commercial providers, to the subcontractors of NBI, and to NBI.  There are problems getting staff and training people in every sector of the economy.  I want to make sure that there is a pipeline of people available so that if, in a year, we want to deploy twice as many crews, those crews and vehicles will be available, as will machines such as poling machines for telegraph poles, of which only so many are available in the country.</p>  <p>  I am doing everything that I can to accelerate the broadband plan, first, to get it back on track and then to move it faster.  A year ago, I was one of the only people in the country who was very optimistic about the roll-out of the vaccination programme.  At that time, everybody felt it was going to take years.  In fact, it was very successful.</p></speech>

He compared the roll-out of the vaccination programme to the debacle that we are talking about today.  The goals of the NBP are laudable, but on every level, it fails at every metric.  It is a disgrace.  Most citizens feel that they are being bled, as if they are some kind of gombeens, for more than &euro;3 billion of taxpayers' money through a series of convoluted company and corporate structures that hoodwink us into believing that, somehow, this will be done quickly and efficiently.  In 2010, the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, announced the roll-out of a broadband plan with great aplomb.  It is 2022 and we are witnessing a debacle with the roll-out of that plan.</p>  <p>  In 2019, when the Government announced that it would go down the path it took, it met with fierce resistance from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, on the basis of cost, affordability, value for money and Exchequer risks.  It expressed concern that the State would not own the infrastructure after this &euro;3 billion investment and the work is completed.  How can the Minister of State stand over this politically?  I am not asking him to answer with legal niceties.  I am asking a political question about how he, as a Green Party Minister of State, can stand over the robbery of taxpayers' money to this extent without delivering a service.</p></speech>

It is not a &euro;3 billion contract; it is a &euro;2.1 billion contract.  I have read many estimates of what the cost is or is predicted to be and many different numbers are thrown around.  The maximum expenditure on this contract will be &euro;2.1 billion.  That is what is in the contract.  The contract was agreed in 2019, a year before I took office, and it is my role as Minister of State to implement what is in the contract.  The benefits of the contract are huge and very ambitious.  They are no less than to bring fibre-optic broadband to every home, farm and business premises in the entire country.  We know from the past two years that this is like providing an extremely basic utility that allows rural villages and towns to be revitalised, to become vibrant again and to bring jobs into them in a way that we had never considered previously.  In the past, if we wanted to bring jobs or study places into a village or a town, we had to think about building a factory.  Now, people are returning to their home towns, working there, bringing money there, and returning to their family locations because of fibre-optic broadband.</p>  <p>  Some 55,000 families in Ireland can now apply for fibre-optic broadband in the intervention area.  Deputy Catherine Murphy tells me that another 45,000 can get fibre-optic broadband from Eir in that area too.  We will reach all 540,000 premises, including homes, farms and business premises, across Ireland, and provide them with a level of service that is unimaginable across Europe.  The rest of Europe is not doing this.  It is providing wireless access for the remotest parts of rural areas.  We are providing a service that will allow people to study, work, conduct their commercial and social lives, and obtain Government services no matter where they live in the country.  It is balanced regional development.  It is a social, high-tech project.  I am proud of it and I am delighted to be in charge of it.  I am using all of my energy and enthusiasm to make sure that it is delivered.</p></speech>

Not all of it is necessarily contracted, but there is extra spending, such as on competitive outsourcing, which costs millions of euro.  Millions of euro more will probably trip us up.  It is interesting that much of the information about corporate structures of this project was not known to us.  We now know that there is a network of at least 13 companies across Ireland, Luxembourg and the US.  We know that David McCourt's firm only owns approximately 10% of NBI despite all these convoluted corporate structures.  The map of the structures for the plan and the companies that are in it puts the London Underground in the ha'penny place.  I do not see how the Minister of State can understand it or grasp it.  We now know that a vulture fund has invested heavily in it.  In its regulatory documents in the US, the vulture fund describes itself as specialising in leveraged loans, high-yield bonds, private credit, distressed investment and collateral loan obligations.  This is shameful for the Government.</p>  <p>  That is why I am asking the Minister of State the political question again.  How can he stand over this?  Given that the commercial terms of the contract have been redacted, how can he give any guarantee that the 500,000 premises, including homes and businesses, will have this delivered to them?  He just spoke eloquently about the freedom that it will give them and the good future that they will have.  How can he guarantee that this will be delivered in ten, 15 or 20 years?  The pace is appallingly slow.  It is tied up in corporate knots and legalities that would confuse any Minister.  The Minister of State should not tell me that he is not confused by it.</p></speech>

I can politically stand over it because it will bring huge, tangible benefits all around the country.  It is a fantastic project and it is comparable with rural electrification.  If people want a home in Ireland nowadays, they want to know that they have home heating, running water, electricity and broadband.  All of those will be available.  It is a basic service that allows for a better quality of life.  That is why I am happy to stand over it.  Regarding investors and the complex structure, the financial structure of the company has not changed since the contract was signed.  It is a matter of public record.  It is right that people examine it and ask questions and query it, but the main investors continue to be Granahan McCourt, Tetrad Corporation, Oak Hill Advisors, Twin Point Capital and shareholders from the management team of NBI.  Consent from the Department needs to be requested to make changes to that structure.  That structure was put in place in 2019 and it has not changed.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has said that these companies are capitalists, investors in short-term debt, that they are linked with hedge funds and so on, and I am sure that is all true.  That is what the system is when a private company does work for the State.  It has private investors that are trying to make a profit.  At the same time, it cannot make that profit unless it connects everybody to rural broadband in Ireland.  That is what the terms of the contract state.</p></speech>

A former Minister had to resign from his position because of an alleged scandal around it.</p> <p>The key difference is the one he just quoted, which is that we did not rely on private, competitive, for-profit enterprise to electrify this country.  The State built a State-owned, State-run company called the ESB, which built Ardnacrusha and Table Mountain and turned the lights on up and down this country.  If we were waiting for this kind of model, we would all be still sitting in the dark and this Chamber would be lit by candles.  That is my point about the broadband plan.  I have asked how the Minister of State can stand over it and he still has not answered.  It is disgraceful that he is not answering me and explaining how a Green Party Minister can stand over this rip-off of taxpayer's money where, at the end of the process, we will still not own the infrastructure.  I ask him to please address that point.</p></speech>

My grandfather worked on the Shannon electrification scheme, the massive hydropower project of the 1920s.  It was his first job and he was employed by Siemens because it was Siemens that did the work.  That company was brought in to do it.  The work was not carried out by civil servants or even by a private Irish company.  It was built by Siemens and that is the reality of what happened.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has asked me again but I have twice told her how I can stand over this project.  I can stand over it because of the benefits that it brings.  It is a hugely beneficial project that every Deputy in this House knows is essential.  Anybody who lives outside a major urban centres know that broadband is essential to people's quality of life and that is why I can stand over it.</p></speech>

I was in the Department in the previous Government when the contract was signed and I supported it wholeheartedly because it is going to be a game changer for Ireland in the context of regional development.  I still stand over the fact that if we had not signed the contract then, there are 55,000 connections that would not have been made now.</p>  <p>  There are issues with the project.  It is large, seven-year contract but it is my understanding that the majority of connections will be made within the first five years.  The contract was signed in 2019 but we have had Covid for the past two years, which has been very disruptive.  That said, a lot of people realised during Covid how important it is to have a proper broadband connection in their homes.  They could see it first-hand when they could not work from home because they did not have broadband.  It created huge problems.  However, the broadband connection points and the hubs that have been set up with the help of the Western Development Commission and the Department of Rural and Community Development were asset-building exercises that have provided some relief for people.</p>  <p>  The frustration for people now is that the project is not moving as fast as they would like.  I make inquiries on behalf of constituents as to when broadband will be available in their area and often the reply I get back is that it will be some time in 2024 or 2025.  We need to be sharper in our plans and in the targets we are setting.  We also need to accelerate the work, now that restrictions have been lifted.  In that regard, I am concerned about the relationship between Eir and NBI.  Is the existing Eir network as bad as people say?  If so, is this a factor in the delay in rolling out broadband to houses?  What is being done by Eir to rectify this problem, if it is a problem?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.422" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="14:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700036#MM00400"><p>First, I will answer the Deputy's question about the communication of connection times to people, which is of great interest to them.  When I was appointed last year, the website for NBI only contained timelines for those people who would be connected within the next 18 months.  After that, people were only told that it would be "some time" in the future.  I ask for detailed information to be provided, even if that meant that people were being told they would be connected in 2024, 2025 or 2026.  I wanted people to be provided with that information so that they could plan, so that they could know that they would need something else in the meantime or that they would not be able work from home during that period.  It is a seven-year project so if people are told that their connection will be in year six or year seven, they are going to be disappointed, naturally, unless we can accelerate it.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also asked about the relationship between Eir and NBI and about the quality of Eir's existing network.  The company does not really know what is going to be in a duct underground until it opens it up.  NBI has said that it has found that the ducts are in worse condition than expected, based on its initial survey of sections of the network and that many ducts are blocked.  Eir has had a large number of owners over a relatively short period.  Some of those owners were short term and they did not invest for the long term and as a result, the Eir network requires a lot of investment.  The company is committed to that.  A new chief executive will be appointed in the coming weeks and I look forward to meeting him.  I will speak to him in the same way that I spoke to his predecessor.  The current chairman will remain in place and I will continue to speak to him too.  There will be a lot of dialogue between me and Eir, between NBI and Eir and between me and NBI and we will do everything we can to make sure that Eir and NBI deliver on what they are required to do and that they accelerate that delivery.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.423" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1482" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="14:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700036#MM00500"><p>It is a source of concern that the infrastructure is not to the required standard.  I understand that as part of this contract, nearly &euro;1 billion will be given to Eir for the use of its infrastructure.  The contract is for &euro;2.1 billion, plus a contingency that brings it closer to &euro;3 billion and of that, more than &euro;900 million is going to Eir for the use of its existing infrastructure.  Let us call a spade a spade here.  It is time for Eir to wake up and smell the roses.  It must come to the table because it is getting a hell of a lot of money out of this contract.  It must make sure that it does not put any impediments in the way of progress and, indeed, remove any impediments that do exist.</p>  <p>  When Eir was setting out to provide broadband connections to houses in rural Ireland, it connected in circles but left large pockets unconnected, where 100 m would have made the difference between connecting houses and not connecting them.  That is the way Eir left it and that is why we have a national broadband plan.  That is why the State has to do this.  We need to be a bit more forthright and rather than just talking to Eir, we need to point out that it has a responsibility to the people of Ireland to make sure that its infrastructure is right.  It is getting a hell of a lot of money out of this contract.  As the Minister of State said, there have been a lot of short-term owners who took their money and ran but the people will not tolerate that anymore.  It is very important that people in rural Ireland are given assurances that there will be no impediments to progress.  If ducts have collapsed, they must be fixed.  Surveys were done two years ago.  NBI personnel were out in their vans, assessing the quality of the infrastructure.  We need to move fast to remove any impediments that exist.  There must also be a better working arrangement between Eir and NBI to relieve any blockages.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.424" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1479" speakername="Ossian Smyth" time="14:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700036#MM00600"><p>The Deputy has identified a key difference between the national broadband plan and the commercial delivery of connectivity, which is the reason the NBP was developed.  When commercial providers such as Siro, Eir, or Virgin, for example, go around the country to connect homes, they connect the low-hanging fruit, the commercially-viable and easy-to-access homes.  Once they meet something that makes connection not worth it such as a railway line, a river or some other obstacle, they just go up another road instead.  As the Deputy said, this has meant that lots of people all over the country were left out.  NBI does not have that option.  This is a universal service and NBI has to connect every home in the deployment area to get the payment.  The threshold is 100%, which makes it much harder.  The cost is much higher than the cost per home of the delivery of the previous commercial providers.  That is the essential difference between commercial and non-commercial provision.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy pointed out that a large proportion of the subvention money is to go to Eir as a subcontractor but that money will go out over 25 years.  NBI will take in revenue by way of charges on people who have connected to the network.</p>  <p>The major part of the income from NBI will not be from the State but from the people who are being provided with a service.  The company will use that money to pay Eir for the rental of its poles and ducts over a period of 25 years.  It is giving Eir a long-term future for its rural broadband network.  All the unblocking of ducts, putting up new poles and replacing old ones is investment and strengthening its network.  From Eir's perspective, this also makes sense.  We need to ensure that these incentives are properly aligned.  Eir gets a long-term future for its rural network and, at the same, time people living in rural Ireland are able to get fibre-optic broadband through NBI.  That is the alignment of the two.</p></speech>

I can vouch for that.  In my town of Tuam a company came in and put in fibre-optic broadband.  It did housing estates and so on but the centre of the town has not been done because the company encountered a few problems and decided it would not do it.  I am six months trying to even get them to communicate with me.  The centre of the town has no fibre-optic connection but we have it on the housing estates.  That is great for the housing estates but it is laughable for the businesses in the centre of the town.  It is a private company, which will tell us that it can provide something for everybody.  The advertising of it leaves me frothing at the mouth at times.</p>  <p>  Eir and the private companies will benefit from this national broadband plan as well as customers throughout the country.  As the Minister of State said, there has to be a massive realignment of the thinking within these corporations to ensure that this is not a pastime for them.  It is real and we need to get on with it.</p></speech>

I would like the Minister of State to examine this issue,</p>  <p>  Has an independent study into the potential role of next-generation low-earth orbit satellites to deliver high-speed broadband to rural Ireland been conducted?  In the past 18 months, enormous strides have been made in the provision of global satellite-based high-speed broadband.  Is the Government actively encouraging and supporting the provision of high-speed broadband via low-earth orbit satellites to premises in the intervention area, especially where the NBP spans and waiting times for services are likely to be significant?</p></speech>

As she said, there are more than 400.  Most of the points are funded through the Department of Rural and Community Development under the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, who has a lot of enthusiasm for the connection of broadband connection points.  They provide an option for someone who needs broadband.  It is a fill-in measure while they wait for the fibre to reach their home.  It means there is an office in the village that they can work from whether in a GAA or church hall or community centre.  The BCPs are very valuable and I will get back to the Deputy with numbers for Carlow.</p>  <p>   Low-earth orbit satellites are a rather new technology.  We had Iridium and now we have Starlink.  We are certainly considering where it fits into our overall broadband strategy.  Is it something we should use widely or as a backup when cable is not available?  I understand that the Starlink service is able to operate without a licence at the moment and is now deploying, and that people can opt for it.  It is expensive.  It is many times the cost of getting a fibre-optic broadband connection, which is typically &euro;100 for connection and then &euro;35 a month whereas a low-earth orbit satellite might cost &euro;500 upfront and &euro;100 a month.  That is much more expensive but it might suit some people.  It is certainly not a technology that we are ignoring.  We consider it all the time.  If the Deputy wants to ask more detailed questions, my office will be happy to answer.</p></speech>

I will contact the office.  In my home town of Carlow, and in Kilkenny, there have been huge issues around businesses getting broadband connections.  As previous speakers said, there are connections in one part of a town but across the road there might not be.  I know the Minister of State is committed as is the Minister for Rural and Community Development.  However, Covid has totally changed the concept of working from home.  These issues need to be addressed.  I know that there is a commitment and the funding is there but the timescale needs to be examined.  When will Carlow-Kilkenny be fully connected to the broadband network?</p></speech>

There are areas within the cities, such as Kilkenny city where broadband cannot be accessed.  That applies everywhere.  With the roll-out of high-speed fibre across rural Ireland someone who is not getting that connection and is in a broadband blackspot in the city will naturally be aggrieved.  I am not only the Minister of State with responsibility for rural broadband but for all broadband.  Some 78% are living outside in the urban areas and I have to make sure that everyone is provided with functional working broadband whether they are in the rural NBP area.  I am committed to doing that.</p><p>The Deputy asked when everyone in Carlow and Kilkenny will have high-speed broadband.  It is on the map on <i>nbi.ie</i>.  She will see the different intervention areas.  She can put in a particular eircode but also click on the different areas and see what dates they are due to connect.  She can find all that information.</p></speech>

It is something that I became interested in from a community and voluntary perspective before I entered politics.  We brought wireless-operated broadband to Goleen in Mizen Head, the last parish in Ireland, 15 or 16 years ago.  We know some little thing about it; I am not trying to say that I am an expert.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State said that it is moving quickly.  I think it is moving at snail's pace.  The delivery of broadband in west Cork in places such as Innishannon, which is very close to Cork city, as is Kilmacsimon, Bandon, Bantry, Coomhola, Clonakilty, Timoleague; I could go on naming them forever.  People are coming to me from areas where there are maybe 20 or 25 houses who cannot get connected to the fibre-optic cable that is there.</p>  <p>  The issue I want to focus on is the wireless operators.  The Minister of State said he was very optimistic; I said I am not.  He said he was looking at every solution.  Has he sat down and spoken to the wireless operators who can immediately provide broadband to the areas that he might be looking to provide broadband to in five years?  He should forget about five years.  I have been asking for people to get broadband for ten years.  It is not happening.  We hear four years, five or six years and I feel like it the time is getting longer every time we sit down around the table.  These are the same communities that were promised this eight years ago.  Let me take Baltimore.  DigitalForge, Fasttrack Broadband and similar companies in west Cork were able to provide wireless broadband to places such as Baltimore.  When Eir came to town with fibre, no one wanted to leave DigitalForge.  They had a private operator and if there was ever a problem, they could pick up the phone and it was resolved straight away.  It can offer something between 70 or 100 Mbs or maybe for a business it can offer more on a wireless setting.  That can be offered anywhere in rural Ireland but they need to be funded.  </p>  <p>  Has the Minister of State opened communication with them?  From what I can tell, we will be left with 5% of houses in rural Ireland that will not get a fibre connection.  Who is going to connect them?  The other problem is that the wireless operator is out there working his butt off trying to survive.  He is providing the service to the town so that he can give broadband to the rural communities.  The wireless operators are coming in and taking the rich pickings in the town.  They are pulling all the town customers away from them.  My worry is that they will pull the plug and in a year or two, many rural communities that had broadband will no longer have it because the wireless operator has been taken out.</p> <p>Has the Minister of State put in protections to ensure those rural communities will continue to be connected?  Has he sat down with the wireless operators since he came into office?  What solutions does he have at present that he can tell us about?  I have only two minutes left so I would appreciate it if he could answer those questions.</p></speech>

I take his point about wireless operators.  I have spoken to some such operators, but now that he says it, I could speak to more.  It is a good point.  Typically in rural Ireland, broadband is provided by a fixed wireless operator.  Somebody erects a mast and it covers the valley.  When I stayed in Ballydehob, I was able to get a perfectly good service from a wireless operator, so I understand.  The idea with NBI is that when fibre comes to the area, the wireless operator can write to all their customers and say it is switching them over to fibre and it can take a payment as a reseller for the fibre in that area.  Any of the wireless operator's customers who want to switch can do so and anyone who wants to continue can do that.  I think the point the Deputy is making is that somebody might turn off their wireless service.  Is that what he was saying?</p></speech>

I respect that since he has plenty of time to do that in the days and hours ahead.  The bottom line is we need to support the existing wireless operators.  It was the same with previous Ministers.  Nobody seems to care about this.  The existing wireless operator can offer broadband down in the valley that nobody else will be able to offer for the next five years.  He can put a base station at the top of the hill and it will reflect.  That is why the Minister of State got broadband when he was in Ballydehob.  I live in Schull, which is the town next to it.  This is what DigitalForge and others have been doing out there.  They have been providing broadband years and years ahead.  What are we doing?  We will tell the rest of the country to hang on for five years because the fibre will be coming and if it does they can tie into the fibre.  Forget the fibre.  For many people wireless is the way forward at present.</p>  <p>  I need the Minister of State to talk to the wireless operators and find that solution.  He needs to find that solution for the people who, five years down the line, are not going to be connected and who cannot come home and work and cannot come home and live.  That is all I ask the Minister of State to do because nobody is talking about the wireless operator.  They are all dreaming about five years down the line.  I am not.  I want the solution to today's problem.</p></speech>

[That was said to me by a teenager recently.]  Like it, love it, hate it.  It is our window to the world of work, of education, of health, of leisure and just general family catch-up. </blockquote>  <p>Unfortunately, this highlights again the big urban-rural divide.  We have parts of Ireland that still have no broadband connection.  A recent survey conducted by <i>switcher.ie</i>found towns and cities have broadband speeds up to 36 times faster than some rural parts of Ireland.  We are currently waiting for 2 million premises to be connected to the NBI network and 18% of Irish homes still have no network.  If we can look at broadband as a way of dispersing masses to less-populated areas, this would make many rural towns and villages more sustainable.</p><p>I am just going to roll back to when we were talking about front-line workers and providers who protected us through Covid-19.  I received another email during the week from concerned businesses based in a business park in Kilmallock.  Among these is Irema, which supplied masks to the health service throughout Ireland.  It supplied masks to everyone to try to protect us.  Irema does not have broadband.  It is a massive employer in Kilmallock yet it does not have broadband.  When we asked the company to step up to the plate to help and protect us, it did so.  It asked the Government to give it broadband.  There are other firms in that area.  An Post is in the same business park.  Dansko Foods has invested in the same business park and it does not have broadband.  If you go to the other side of Kilmallock, Keltec Engineering does not have broadband.  I can see that within 100 yards there is broadband.  When these firms enquire about it, they are given phone numbers and told they will have it by 2025 or 2026.  It is 100 yards away.  I am in construction all my life.  If you gave a person a shovel he or she would have it dug in a month, so I could do it in a digger within a day.  The Government cannot give broadband to businesses that are ratepayers and are helping feed families throughout this country.</p><p>I have Eir in my office in Kilmallock.  I have BBnet in my home in Granagh.  I look up at the mast every day.  I have had to contact the likes of Imagine and Virgin to try to help people with wireless connections.  Deputy Collins just mentioned, and the Minister of State has said himself, that he has not really engaged with the wireless operators.  It is the only hope we have for people to get connected.  I want a commitment from the Minister of State that he will get in contact with me about the areas in Limerick where we need immediate broadband because there are jobs on the line and families are being supported through businesses.  Houlihan Engineering in Athlacca has no broadband.  The broadband has come to the end of the road but it will not be brought up an extra 100 yards to provide it to businesses.  I therefore want a commitment from the Minister of State that he will look at Limerick and at the areas I am going to give him so we can get broadband into houses and businesses in the county.</p></speech>

I was there because we were connecting the first set of 2,366 homes and I wanted to see how it is done physically, where the cables go in and how it is working.  I understand there are another 4,812 homes in Limerick that are being connected by cable.  The national broadband plan is not just for residential use.  It is for every premises, whether it is a business or a farm.  It should reach everybody, including the company in Kilmallock the Deputy described.  If the Deputy has a particular issue with broadband in his area and wants to discuss it with me or have a one-to-one meeting with the civil servants in charge of the broadband plan, then he can do that and they will engage with him.  I am happy to go anywhere in the country to see with my own eyes how things are going.</p>  <p>  I have engaged with wireless providers, but as I said, I can always do more.  If the Deputy has a wireless provider in his area who can tell me the practicalities of having its service replaced by fibre, I am happy to do that as well.</p></speech>

The intervention area is defined.  If a commercial provider provides a service in there, NBI can say it does not want to provide a service in there anymore, that it is not commercially viable, that it is costing the company money as a result and it can apply for a compensation payment.  If it is interrupting NBI's plan, such as if that area was in between two areas it was trying to connect, then it could apply for a compensation payment.  However, it can also opt to connect the customer itself and give him or her a second connection.  NBI has indicated to me it will not opt for compensation payments in any case and so far it has just installed a second connection for anybody in the encroachment area.</p></speech>

As with any roll-out, there are developments and changes and people's dates move.  At the start, I asked that people be told honestly what year we were planning to connect them, even if it disappoints them to find out that they will be in the sixth or seventh year.  It means that as things change and the roll-out progresses, if it is found that something will be later or earlier, that person will get an email stating that his or her connection date has changed, been revised and the revised connection date.  It is better to tell people the truth and tell people as things change as we go along, rather than just giving them an open-ended promise that they will get their broadband sometime in the next seven years.</p></speech>

I know many of the contractors - not the main contractors or the subcontractor - but a lot of the ordinary hedge-cutting contractors that do the different types of work related to broadband provision.  I can tell the Minister of State what is going on out there because seemingly people do not realise it.  When it comes to hedge cutting, the minimum is being done and there will be problems in a year or two.  The way it was measured with Eir, which will not throw money at you, the surveying that was done was unbelievable.  I do not know where it got some of the engineers that did the surveying, but the hedge cutting that is going on and the way it is being priced means that contractors are walking away from it.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State does not see this, but for the ordinary people who are doing the work out there on the ground there are savage problems that are not being recognised.  It is about time that the Department officials went out to talk to the ordinary Joe Soap, not the guys in the suits who are going around bluffing, and some other word I would use - BS - to people, but the guys who are out there doing the work.  They have done it for years with the likes of Eir and, as I said, Eir would not throw money at you, no way.  I would never say that, but as bad as it was, it was cutting.  There are certain heights even under the line now; that is the way it has gone.  If a hedge-cutting contractor misses a piece, or if he or she only does a certain piece, then that contractor does not get paid for that.  The way it is being done is absolutely horrendous because down the road a machine will have to be put in again to cut it.</p>  <p>  I am taking up Deputy Harkin's time, but I ask the Minister of State to try to get someone to talk to the ordinary people who are doing the work on the ground.  I understand about the blockages and everything.  Contractors should be permitted by councils - they should not have to get licences and all that.  I ask the Minister of State to go out to look at that.  If people only knew what was going on with this broadband, they would be frightened.</p></speech>

That would be mid-2024.  If we talk about 90%, Leitrim County Council has confirmed that more than 90% of Leitrim properties requiring intervention in the national broadband plan will not be connected until 2025 or 2026.  I looked at the figures for Sligo and saw that by the end of this year it will be approximately 16% and at the end of 2023 it will be about one third, but for 2025 to 2026, 60% of all premises will still not be connected.  I have listened to the debate and I heard the Minister of State saying that people would like broadband tomorrow.  He is correct and that is fine, but for 90% of Leitrim and 60% of Sligo it is not tomorrow, it is not the day after tomorrow, it is not the year after tomorrow and it is not the year after the year after tomorrow.  That is what businesses and families in those counties are facing.</p>  <p>  I understand the Minister of State's intent and I have heard it clearly today.  He said that he was examining everything he could do.  Will he specify what he is examining that will make a difference to those people who are waiting in Sligo and Leitrim? </p></speech>

Maybe that is providing confusion.  Some 22% of homes are in the intervention area.  The intention was to reach, or that we would have done, 60% of them by the end of 2024.  In other words, 60% of the intervention area homes would be done.  That, added to the number of homes that were passed in the urban area, would give a figure of 90% of people with broadband above 30 MB.  That is out of date at this stage.  A speed of 30 MB per second is not a very high-speed connection any more.  We will be revising our targets on that.  In fact, our new national digital strategy will come out next week, which will include revised targets for how fast we expect home connections to be.  Overall, the target for Ireland and Europe will be gigabit connection within a few years.  There will more details on that at the start of next week.  What was the Deputy's other question?</p></speech>

While I am on my feet, the Minister might answer both together.  I looked at the figures for Donegal.  We are looking at 80% of homes in Donegal not being connected until 2024 or 2026.  To revise, 90% of homes in Leitrim will not be connected until 2025 or 2026, 60% of homes in Sligo will not be connected until 2025 or 2026, while the figure for Donegal is 80% by 2024 or 2026.  The Minister of State spoke earlier about balanced regional development; he brought it up.  There is no balance in all of this.  Are we at the end of the queue again?</p>  <p>  Next week, we will debate the right to work from home.  That legislation will be meaningless for all those people who are waiting until 2025 or 2026.  If we are talking about balanced regional development, how does the Minister of State intend to deliver it? </p></speech>

I thank the D&aacute;il for the invitation to address it on the roll-out of the historic national broadband plan.  I reaffirm to the House that this plan remains a top priority for the Government.  I am sure that this House strongly supports the overarching objective of the programme to deliver a high-speed broadband fibre network to more than 554,000 premises, 1.1 million people, over 100,000 farms and non-farm businesses and some 679 schools.  The national broadband plan high-speed broadband map is available on the Department's website at <i>broadband.gov.ie</i>.  The amber area represents the area to be served by the network to be deployed under the NBP, State-led intervention.</p><p>The NBP contract was signed with National Broadband Ireland in November 2019 to ensure that 100% of the premises in the State have access to reliable, high-quality, high-speed broadband.</p> <p>It will offer users a high-speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500 Mbps from the outset, and with higher speeds available to businesses.  This plan is the largest infrastructure project in rural Ireland since rural electrification.  It spans 96% of Ireland's land mass and it will bring high-speed broadband to 69% of Ireland's total number of farms.  It will deliver fast reliable broadband through laying 140,000 km of fibre cable, utilising more than 1.5 million poles and more than 15,000 km of underground duct networks.<br/><br/>I recognise how vital telecommunications services are to citizens for so many aspects of their daily lives, including remote working, studying and e-health and, more recently, staying in touch with family members during the Covid-19 pandemic.  The pandemic has caused profound socioeconomic change and has brought to the fore the central role digital connectivity and technology can play in transforming the way we work and connect with each other.  The pandemic has highlighted, now more than ever, the importance of current and future connectivity needs, not only in city centres but also across our suburbs, towns and rural communities.  Ireland will be a world leader in fibre broadband roll-out by 2026.<br/><br/>A key principle of the national broadband plan is to support and stimulate commercial investment.  Since the publication of the NBP strategy in 2012, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested in excess of &euro;3.3 billion in upgrading and modernising networks that support the provision of high-speed broadband and mobile telecommunications services.  Extensive investment plans are in place by a range of operators in commercial areas.  Eir has stated it will roll out fibre to the home to a further 1.6 million premises in urban areas, bringing its overall fibre to the home deployment to approximately 1.9 million premises.  Meanwhile, SIRO is completing the first phase of its fibre deployment and to date has passed more than 400,000 premises with gigabit services.  It has recently announced plans to extend that network to an additional 320,000 premises.  Virgin Media Ireland has also recently announced a &euro;200 million upgrade of its network to full fibre to the more than 1 million premises the company covers over the next three years.  Many other network operators and telecommunications service providers across the State also continue to invest in their networks.<br/><br/>Today, more than 2.4 million or 77% of premises in Ireland can access commercially available high-speed broadband services of more than 30 Mbps.  In the 2021 digital economy and society index, DESI, for the 27 EU countries, Ireland performed well.  It ranked fifth with a score of 60.3, which is well above the EU average of 50.7.  NBI will address the remaining premises through the national broadband plan State intervention.  As recently as six years ago, Ireland had a fibre to the home, FTTH, network of less than 1% of the 1.7 million broadband subscriptions.  Latest figures from the ComReg report for quarter 3 of 2021 show that fibre to the home subscriptions are now at 340,000 or 20% of the 1.7 million subscriptions, and growing.  This upward trajectory has been achieved through a combination of commercial investment and State intervention.<br/><br/>Despite the unprecedented challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic, National Broadband Ireland has made steady progress on the delivery of the new high-speed fibre broadband network under the national broadband plan.  NBI commenced connections to the new fibre network in January 2021, which is just 12 months ago.  As of today, more than 54,000 premises are available for order and pre-order for high-speed fibre broadband across 21 counties, including Carlow, Clare, Cavan, Cork, Galway, Kerry, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Leitrim, Limerick, Louth, Mayo, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary, Waterford, Westmeath, Wexford and Wicklow.  NBI has advised that in excess of 154,000 premises are constructed or under construction, demonstrating that the project is reaching scale.  More than 5,400 premises have been connected as of 14 January and this figure is increasing weekly.  To date, the level of connections is in line with projections and in some areas it is exceeding expectations.<br/><br/>While substantial progress has been made to date, the Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on the delivery of the fibre network, resulting in delays in the delivery of aspects of the programme.  Impacts include challenges with the mobilisation of key contractors, restrictions on operations and supply chain, as well as logistical delays, both nationally and internationally.  In addition, there have been challenges with the recruitment of key personnel as NBI and its contractors scale up, including challenges associated with onboarding and training people.  Like all of us, NBI and contractor staff are at risk of contracting Covid-19 or may have had to restrict their movements as a result of being a close contact.  This impact continues to be felt due to the current more contagious Omicron variant.<br/><br/>With a project of the scale of the NBP, it can be difficult for media commentary to communicate fully the scale of activity or work completed in terms of delivery of the NBP.  I will share with Deputies some details of what has been achieved against the backdrop of challenging circumstances brought about by the pandemic to date.  Some 6 million metres of cable have been installed; 25,000 telegraph poles have been remediated or newly installed; 152,000 premises have been submitted to Open Eir for the &quot;make ready&quot; programme; 250 section 254 applications have been submitted across all 31 local authorities, with 154 approved; 38 deployment area designs have been approved by the Department; more than 150,000 premises in 45 deployment areas are either under build or build-completed across 26 counties; six deployment areas are now fully build-completed, with four more deployment areas nearing completion; three island deployment areas with build are under way; 26 local exchanges with Nokia equipment have been installed and are ready for network connectivity; 54,000 premises are available to order or pre-order across 21 counties, as well as three islands off the coast of Donegal; 34,417 premises are available to order by 31 January 2022; 7,355 orders have been received by retail service providers; 5,477 connections have been completed across 11 counties, with 1,300 connections made in December 2021 alone; 453 broadband connection points have been installed; and 50 retail service providers, RSPs, have been contracted, with 34 of those onboarded.  The ongoing investment in the roll-out is also creating employment opportunities.  Some 292 direct employees and 911 indirect employees working with build and design contractors are now employed on foot of the NBP investment, with this number rising weekly as construction activity ramps up.<br/><br/>Broadband connection points, BCPs, are a key element of the NBP.  They are located in areas of community importance, allowing local residents to quickly get free public access to high-speed broadband in advance of fibre deployment under the national broadband plan.  BCPs are a key support for promoting balanced regional development as part of a sustainable and equitable post-pandemic recovery and will enable rural communities to avail of the opportunities presented by the digital economy.  BCPs have been developed to become digitally enabled community assets.  Activities currently under way include the establishment of remote working facilities at a significant number of locations, remote e-health consultation booth pilot projects, digital skills training for children and young people, and a national BCP film festival that will be screened at BCPs.<br/><br/>As of 14 January, some 453 BCP sites in total have been installed by NBI and 255 of the publicly available sites are now connected with high-speed broadband service through a service provider contract with Vodafone.  As part of this initiative, primary school BCPs are also being provided with high-speed broadband for educational use through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Education.  To date, 185 schools have been installed, out of the total of 453 BCP sites, with high-speed broadband for educational access and 99 schools are now connected.  An acceleration of this aspect of the national broadband plan will see some 679 schools connected to high-speed broadband well ahead of the original target delivery timeframe of 2026.  That is every primary school in the country.<br/><br/>The House will be aware of recent commentary on the ownership structure of NBI and parliamentary questions answered by me on this issue in the D&aacute;il in December.  I can confirm the ownership structure of NBI remains as advised to the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications at contract award in November 2019 and at the effective date of the contract on 9 January 2020.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, has rights of consent under the project agreement in respect of changes in ownership, and NBI must notify the Minister in advance of any such event arising.  There have been no subsequent notifications of changes to ownership or control.<br/><br/>It is usual with large-scale projects of this nature that the investors' investment in the project is structured through tiered holding companies.  NBI applies the highest standards to its corporate governance and the structures adopted by it are typical of investments in critical infrastructure not only in Ireland but globally where investors of international reach and scale are involved.  As the roll-out progresses, I will ensure Members of the House are kept up to date.  The Department will continue to arrange Oireachtas stakeholder information sessions for Deputies and Senators, of which, I am pleased to note, 21 sessions were facilitated in the past six months.<br/><br/>Citizens can also obtain information on specific areas in the intervention area through the NBI website.  This site provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register its interest in being provided with deployment updates through its website, .  Individuals who register with this facility will receive regular updates on progress by NBI on delivering the network and specific updates relating to their own premises as works commence.  Furthermore, NBI has a dedicated email address, <i>reps@nbi.ie</i>, which can be used by Oireachtas Members for specific queries.  NBI has recently published details of its full deployment schedule on its website, which enables all premises within the intervention area to have an anticipated service activation date range.<br/><br/>The national broadband plan will deliver high-speed broadband to every premises in Ireland.  The Government remains committed to the speedy and effective roll-out of high-speed broadband that is future-proofed for the next 25 years and beyond.</p> <p>It is frustrating for everyone that the early stages of the network build have faced challenges.  I am disappointed that the programme is behind schedule but I assure my colleagues that I am determined, as is everyone working on this in the Department, to continue to drive an acceleration of the network build programme with the aim of getting it back on track.  </p> <p> The ambition of Ireland's NBP is an exemplar.  The Government investment in the NBP, along with the investment by commercial operators in their fibre build programmes, will mean that before the end of this decade Ireland will be the leader in the EU in fibre to the home connectivity.  The NBP will ensure that every home, business and farm in the State has access to high-speed broadband connectivity.  The NBP will transform where people choose to live and how we work.  The short-term challenges of the network build will be overcome and the long-term impact of this programme will be truly life-changing.</p></speech>

Broadband is one of the key pieces of infrastructure, particularly for all of rural Ireland and indeed for a lot of urban Ireland as well.  We always come across people who tell us this is not just a rural problem.  There are many areas of the country, even in towns and larger towns, that have difficulties getting stable broadband connection.</p>  <p>  The reality is that the pandemic has brought challenges for all of us.  I respect and understand the effect it has had on getting work done, delivery times and all of that.  However, most of us would also accept that there were delays to the roll-out anyway, even without Covid-19.  There were serious issues and problems there anyway.  The national broadband roll-out has been slow and difficult.  It has not been delivered to the standard the vast majority of the public expected up to now.  That is something we need to acknowledge.  We need to do something about it to ensure people get the broadband delivery they require.</p>  <p>  If one has adequate broadband, particularly fibre broadband, one is in the centre of the commercial world no matter where one is.  That is the difference it makes for an awful lot of people, particularly those who have become accustomed to the concept of working from home or a hybrid model of work.  Adequate broadband is essential for that.  I live in a rural area in the rural constituency of Sligo-Leitrim.  I could mention multiple areas where there are issues.  The previous question-and-answer session included Deputies referring to their little towns and areas and the problems they have had.  There are many small issues in small areas.  Consider a company that employs eight people in a town where the broadband comes to a certain point, 200 m away from where the company is based, and it cannot find anyone to bring it that extra couple of hundred yards up the road.  The owners of that company would feel frustrated, annoyed and betrayed by a system that cannot do that for them.  When that is multiplied by the hundreds of people around the country who have had similar experiences, it creates a problem for the Government.  The impression people have is that the Government is letting them down and not delivering for them.  That needs to be acknowledged.</p>  <p>  I also took note of what Deputy Michael Collins said about the many providers, including satellite providers and providers putting up a mast on a hill and delivering a service.  Without those providers, an awful lot of rural areas would be completely lost.  One of the fears of many rural communities is that as fibre broadband is rolled out to the more populated areas, those companies that were providing services to both more populated and less populated areas will simply withdraw the service and the less populated areas will be left without any service at all.  That needs to be examined closely.  I heard the comments the Minister of State made earlier to the effect that he will engage with those providers.  That engagement needs to happen as quickly as possible to ensure we now have full delivery of broadband to every house we can possibly reach in the country.  In areas that have access now, we must ensure they maintain it.</p></speech>

As a Deputy who represents a rural constituency, I know the lack of broadband connectivity is having negative impacts on the ability of rural communities to remain sustainable.  The work of NBI is vital.  It was reported recently that NBI is once again going to miss its target for access to high-speed Internet for homes and businesses.  The target was 60,000.  It had been revised down from an original target of 115,000.  The likely output is going to be in the region of 35,000 to 40,000, which is approximately one third of the original target.  There are perhaps multiple reasons for that.  What is more important is what is planned to bring the roll-out back on track, including a timeframe for when it will be back on track.</p>  <p>  On the most recent occasion representatives of NBI appeared before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications in September last year, they reported they were six months behind in their work.  Has that been extended?  It will have a knock-on effect on targets for the coming year.  What is the plan to tackle that?  NBI also reported it was having licensing issues with a number of local authorities.  Is that still causing problems and delays?</p>  <p>  The NBI website now has a portal which maps out the different stages each area is at in the process of rolling out high-speed Internet across each county, including roll-out to houses and businesses that can now order or pre-order broadband and areas that are survey pending.  Roll-out to some areas will only happen in 2025 or 2026.  Quite a lot of my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, which includes north Meath, is survey pending.</p></speech>

There are a number of small gaps in rural areas around Shercock and Virginia, to name but two.  An extremely large part of west Cavan is not covered by the map.  I was recently contacted by a man from Ballyconnell who told me he has two daughters who were doing college exams in the first week of January.  They were doing those exams online and when they were submitting their papers, the Internet dropped for one of the daughters.  She got it back up and running and submitted her paper with three minutes to spare.  That sort of thing is putting considerable stress on people.</p>  <p>  There is also massive frustration and, at times, anger in rural Ireland when people see that their neighbour across the road or a short distance up the road has broadband and they do not.  People have told me there is high-speed fibre broadband a quarter of a mile up the road from their home and a quarter of a mile down the road from their home and the two or three houses in the middle are left with none.  Those people have no reception whatsoever.  They are annoyed.  The frustration and anger is worse when such people see that according to the NDP, there is nothing planned for the area in which they live.  It is worrying for the residents and an explanation of what is planned to rectify the issue would be much appreciated.</p></speech>

I recently contacted Eir about River Towers, an apartment block on Lee Road in Cork city that is waiting for a fibre to the home connection.  Eir informed me it could not give me a date for delivery but that it will be done by 2026, which is four years from now.  That is astounding.  In Cork city, the second city in this State, there is an apartment block without fibre high-speed broadband.  Eir could not give me a date for connection because of ComReg's decision D10/18.  I think it is fair to say that when ComReg came up with these decisions, we were not in the same space or time as we are now.  We are now reliant on broadband to allow people to work from home or engage in education, as my colleague, Deputy Tully, said.  Will the Minister of State instruct ComReg to look at that and review it, given the impact the lack of broadband has on jobs and people's ability to work from home and move employment?  There also needs to be an investigation into whether a compromise can be found to allow people to get a timeline for delivery so they know they will be waiting for six months or a year.  Four years is not good enough.</p>  <p>  Not having access to high-speed broadband has a considerable impact on people's lives.  It limits job opportunities, isolates people from family members who are abroad and reduces their entertainment possibilities.  In particular, during the pandemic, we found out how important broadband is for students, whether in primary school, secondary school or third level.  That is why broadband is vital and needs to be delivered.</p>  <p>  From household security systems to baby monitors, so much technology now relies on a high-speed Internet connection and yet many of my constituents are being told they are going to have to wait until 2026 to have proper Internet in their homes.  It is 2022.  People cannot use Zoom for work, education or involvement in community groups and services.  The NBP is failing people.  They are so frustrated.  I have heard other Deputies talking about the lack of high-speed Internet in their own constituencies.</p> <p>This is not just a rural Ireland problem; it is a national problem.  We can have an apartment block in the city without broadband.  There are many other areas.  In Clogheen and Kerry Pike, which are 2 km from Apple, one of the biggest computer companies in the world, there are areas with no Internet coverage or limited coverage.  The town of Blarney, which is 6 km from Cork city, is the same, as are Watergrasshill, Donoughmore, upper Glanmire and Whitechurch.  I have a list of areas in my constituency that either have no broadband connection, or parts of those areas have no broadband connection.</p> <p> I am asking the Minister of State about this because the current system for the provision of broadband and Internet connections is failing people.  Something needs to be done.  I ask him to speak to ComReg to see whether we can give people proper timelines.  It is all about information.  This is the information age and we cannot give people the information they need.  I ask the Minister of State to pass that on.</p></speech>

There are huge challenges, however.  Like my colleague from Cork North-Central, I want to convey my concerns about the constituency.  Cork is the second biggest city in the country and huge areas now are on the schedule for 2025-26.  That is not good enough.</p>  <p>  We also have a problem whereby Eir is providing broadband on one side of the road and people on the other side cannot get access to it.  I know of one case - one of many - where the pole that the cable is attached to is on the entrance to a particular house.  Eir will not provide the broadband to that house yet it will take it 200 yards down the road and provide it to another house.  That is not good enough.</p>  <p>  The other issue I wish to raise relates to area hubs.  We have rolled out these hubs in quite a number of places in my area, including Courtbrack and Whitechurch.  We need hubs in other areas, in particular where there will be a delay in the roll-out of broadband from house to house.  We need hubs in communities.  I have raised three specific areas with Cork County Council and the various authorities: Glenville, Inniscarra community centre and Mourneabbey.  These are areas in which a huge number of houses do not have access to broadband.  In Inniscarra, for instance, there are more than 900 children in primary school yet huge sections of that parish do not have access to broadband.  If 900 children are in primary school, another 900 children from that area are either in college or secondary school.  We have no broadband in quite a number of parts of that parish.</p>  <p>  We need to be far more proactive with the providers where broadband is in the boundary zone.  Why are we applying the rules strictly to the boundary when houses are within a very short distance of where the supply is going?  It is something we need to resolve very fast.  Many things have changed over the Covid-19 period.  It has created huge problems for people and huge difficulties for families.  It is now accepted that more people will be working from home.</p>  <p>  The final issue I wish to raise is in relation to new housing estates.  We are not applying adequate pressure with regard to new housing estates being built.  One cannot build an estate unless one has a road, a water supply and a sewerage connection yet we will not make it a condition that an estate must also have a broadband connection.  The delay in getting broadband into new housing estates is not good enough.  We should have it far faster.  It should be there the day the keys are handed over to the purchaser.  People should not have to wait 12, 18 or 24 months to get a broadband connection.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.495" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1456" speakername="Michael Moynihan" time="15:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700042#SS00300"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on broadband.  The issue is that broadband is the great enabler for rural Ireland.  In many of the debates we had a number of years ago, we looked at broadband to try to have connectivity within rural Ireland.  In the intervening two years, Covid-19 has shown us what rural Ireland can do.  Despite the protests of the policymakers that we should all be living centrally in smaller units, Covid-19 has shown us the benefits of our rural communities.  We should take that on board.  That has been a great lesson for us over the last two years.  By taking it on board, we must make sure the broadband issue is taken more seriously.</p>  <p>  In his opening remarks, the Minister of State lamented the delays that are taking place with regard to the roll-out of broadband.  It is hugely frustrating in one instance but it also hugely wrongs the entire island and all parts of this State to say that we are not taking this plan by the scruff of the neck and making sure it is happening and will happen on time.  There is nothing more fundamental than the broadband plan.</p>  <p>  Over the last two years, we have seen that whether people are working for State companies, employed by the State directly, employed by multinationals or working for any other number of companies, they have been working from home from the most remote areas.  In the earlier period of the lockdown in March, April and May 2020, connectivity and wireless broadband was being looked at, particularly in my area, which is a very rural community.  People were making alternative arrangements to the NBP.  It is almost as if the providers of wireless broadband have gone beyond and filled a vacancy the State has been neglecting by not rolling it out fast enough.</p>  <p>  We are where we are now.  We have a delay in the system but we also need to look at the challenges.  Previous speakers spoke about the inflexibility within the contracts both to Eir and the NBP.  Flexibility needs to be brought in it.  Many contributors have asked for that, not only in this debate today but in debates going back over time.  I have certainly asked for it in terms of being able to name a raft of places right across my constituency.</p>  <p>  We have seen it with the development of community organisations and groups.  Even as late as yesterday, somebody spoke to me about accessing broadband in Aubane, Ballydaly and Glash.  In Glash and Aubane, schoolhouses that were closed in the late 1960s and early 1970s have become community hubs but they also have broadband connectivity.  People are using them because they are for the community but they also have the broadband that is necessary for people to carry out their work.  We must also make sure that is one step.  We must make sure that any new hubs that are going to be developed in villages and towns where funding is going to come from various government organisations to do the physical construction have top-quality fibre broadband and everything going for them.</p>  <p>  While Covid-19 has shown us what can be done in rural communities, broadband is the great enabler or leveller to ensure we have everything.  As I have said in many debates, broadband is as crucial as electricity, running water or the telephone in the late 1970s or early 1980s.  It is not being taken with the same seriousness as I would like it to be, however.  We should not be debating this again.  We should be saying that the broadband plan has started and is happening rather than saying there are delays in it.  It is totally unacceptable that there are delays.  What are the delays in the plan doing?  They are affecting decisions families are making in terms of working from home and engaging with their employers.  We will be debating the new working from home Bill in a week or so but the great enabler is broadband.</p> <p>We should not be saying "well, if we had a proper broadband service".  It should be there regardless of whether one is in the most remote part of Ireland or in the city centres.  Like water, telephone connections and electricity, broadband should be an essential part of our living today in every place.  We have debated mobile phone coverage many times.  Mobile phone coverage has been disappearing, rather than improving, over the years.  I do not see the powers that be, such as ComReg and others, that are charged with making the necessary interventions on behalf of the State, taking it as urgently as they should.  They should do so as a matter of grave urgency.</p></speech>

We all agree that it should be in new housing estates, but the Government needs to start building those houses first.</p>  <p>  This week, the T&aacute;naiste outlined the 13 reasons employers will be able to refuse requests to work from home.  A company will be able to do so if it has concerns regarding the Internet connectivity of the proposed remote working location.  Maybe the T&aacute;naiste should reword this to reflect the reality of the situation for a number of people who have been in contact with me.  Maybe he should include a proviso that employees should refer their requests for home working to NBI, given that the slow pace of the NBI roll-out is leaving many people without options for their work.  One man who was offered a job opportunity had to meet a requirement that his Internet connection must have a minimum 20 Mbps download speed and a minimum 10 Mbps upload speed.  When he checked his connection, he found he had nowhere near this level.  When he checked with his provider, he was told that the infrastructure was not in place.  When I inquired on his behalf, I was told that while there is no high-speed broadband at his premises at the minute, as it stands it should be connected up with a full fibre to the home connection by NBI at some stage between May and July of this year.  That is real good for him.  If the T&aacute;naiste is happy to put job prospects into the hands of NBI, he will encounter some very real problems.</p>  <p>  There are also issues of crossover with companies such as Eir.  A constituent contacted Eir at the end of last year when a salesman told him that fibre broadband under the NBI scheme was available to his home.  When he contacted Eir, they signed him up for an installation.  When the day arrived, they advised the customer that there was a porting issue at their end and that it got cancelled in error.  They therefore arranged another date.  The day before that date, he was told that they could not install it because the infrastructure is not in place for fibre broadband in his area.  Since then, Eir and NBI have been telling the customer that it is the fault of the other.  While this kind of problem with Eir is no surprise, it is an unacceptable way to deal with a customer and with the roll-out of a service.  </p>  <p>  I also have concerns for our farming community.  More and more farmers are reliant on broadband to effectively manage and resource their farms.  Indeed, at the agriculture committee, we heard of the importance of data collection and analysis, which will help to vastly improve environmental management, such as fertiliser spreading, organic manure management and crop harvesting.  There is a bit of a road to go in relation to this at the moment.  There has been a lack of clarity on the number of farms that have been connected, apart from NBI saying its ambition is to connect 54,000 farms to high-speed broadband.  If our farmers are being required to adhere to increasingly technical demands, and if we are to have the capacity to use the technological advances that have been made in recent times, the roll-out of high-speed broadband is crucial for them.  While I appreciate that some progress has been made in Tipperary, there are entire counties that have been left out altogether.  In the last six months, 28 national schools have gone live and 168 schools are now ready to connect through a retail service provider.  Some 99 of those are live out a total of 679 national schools in the intervention area.</p>  <p>  Last year, the Government agreed to a remedial plan that involved reducing the number of houses and businesses passed by the end of the year to 60,000.  I understand that the number achieved was well below that.  Given the significant amount of public money that has been pumped into the NBP, as well as all we have heard about the contract concerns - my colleague Deputy Stanley had warned about this - there needs to be greater regulation of public procurement spending on a range of capital projects about which there are questions regarding spiralling costs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.499" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="15:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700043#TT00300"><p>There has been quite a bit of media coverage around the NBP in recent months, particularly before Christmas.  It has mainly focused on missed targets, on how very little of the investors&rsquo; own money has gone into the NBP, on how it is funded, on the complicated corporate structure and so on.  The big takeaway was about the expectation that &euro;175 million in equity was to be put in by those who won the tender.  We were told that this had been promised.  The expectation was that this equity would be put in but in fact, there has been an equity investment of just &euro;98 million so far.  That usually means the purchase of shares.  In effect, this boils down to the fact that just &euro;2 million of their own money has been put into what is the largest contract in the history of the State.  That was not my expectation.  I do not think that anybody else had that expectation either.  In essence, the money in entails lots of high-cost loans and at best no equity, while the money out entails fees and interest from those loans.  The Minister of State has just confirmed that was exactly what was expected by those who signed the contract.  It is certainly not what was conveyed here in the D&aacute;il.  A contribution of &euro;223 million, which was the total amount via loans and not share purchase, was touted prior to the contract being awarded.  The figure so far is &euro;98 million.</p>  <p>  I want to move on.  Of the &euro;38 million in fees paid to investors - and this has to do with when the contract was awarded - &euro;32.7 million was paid to NBI Bidco LLC, which was controlled by Granahan McCourt.  It was set up just a week before the contract was signed.  Even if it had been permitted to recoup the cost of the bid, how was it that a company which was set up a week beforehand got to claim that money?  They clearly had not incurred such a cost.  I would like a response to that, even if it is later on in writing.</p>  <p>  The Department and NBI insist that Granahan McCourt controls NBI and that control is determined by voting rights.  This may be true, but the contract itself states that control is determined according to who has the necessary voting rights, holds the necessary investment or is entitled to the necessary percentage of dividends.  The threshold for control is set at 30% of the contract.  While Mr. McCourt may well have 30% of the voting rights of NBI, as the Department claims, he certainly does not own 30% of the shares.  That has been clearly demonstrated by the way this is funded.  Does he actually control NBI?  If so, and if it is only based on voting rights, why does the contract suggest otherwise?  I refer the Minister of State to page 42 of the definitions in relation to that.  Why was a multimillion euro State contract given to Mr. McCourt, whose private investment firm, Granahan McCourt Capital LLC, owns just 2.7% of NBI?  Just &euro;54,674 of the money Granahan McCourt Capital LLC invested was by way of buying shares, whereas 99.1% was via debt.  I am still not satisfied with the responses that we have heard in that regard today.</p>  <p>  What does the contract say about the investors' obligations when it comes to capitalising NBI?  Does it allow shareholders to provide capital in the form of loans at 12% compound interest?  Is that the kind of thing that is specified?  I have asked for it to be published to the greatest degree possible, and ideally the whole lot of it.  The Minister of State has said he is looking into that at the moment.  However, it is important that we can see just exactly what was signed up to, so that we can evaluate that ourselves.</p>  <p>  Finally, the key issue is whether the consortium can crash out at any time.  If so, what does that look like?  What do they take with them?</p> <p>What is the potential risk to the State?  We need a response to that.  I would be very happy to get that answer in writing because there are a lot of things to be caught up on after this debate.</p></speech>

As a previous speaker said, people in Mayo are taxpayers as well.  They have been promised broadband and they are not getting it and they look at screens telling them it will happen in 2025 or 2026.  Not one home has been connected yet.  We have asked for details about the contract, such as whether there will be penalties for targets not being met or what will happen.  It reminds me of the JobPath situation and the sell-off of Eircom.  People want to know that they and their money are protected but they also want to know when they will be connected.  That is not happening at the moment.</p>  <p>  Third level students are trying to study from home.  We are creating such inequality through all of this and it is so unjust, particularly in rural Ireland and the west, which needs investment.  We are continuously promised jam tomorrow and told that everything will be alright next month or the month after but we are not getting anything.  I have a leaving certificate student in my house and when he switches one thing on I have to switch off another.  We cannot work like that.  So many Government essential services are delivered online at the moment, and rightly so because efficiencies can be achieved there, but the inequality that is built in by not having proper broadband connectivity is just not right.  There is a lack of transparency around what is going to happen and this House deserves to know what is happening.</p>  <p>  On the issue of the equity, we were told in the first instance what the company that was granted the contract would be investing in it and then we found out that was not true at all.  We do not know what to believe at this stage but we want broadband.  There are people with disabilities who are at home and who need connectivity because they are socially and economically excluded from society.  Target after target is not being met and we are not given an explanation for that.  We were told for a while, as we were with many other services, that this was because of Covid but I do not accept that.  This should not have been delayed with Covid because it was considered an essential service.  We in Mayo have absolutely no confidence that the targets will be reached and we are running out of patience and out of road.  We have certainly run out of broadband and connectivity.  The Minister of State informed us that the investors have already extracted millions to cover their own costs incurred during the bidding phase.  That is just not right.  There is still not a single home connected in Mayo.  I talk about Mayo but this affects so many other counties as well.  It is disingenuous for the Government to claim that the equity investment that was to be put in by the investors can mean equity or debt financing.  People want a return for the money.  They want fairness, justice and value for money.  They are certainly not getting this with regard to broadband in Mayo.  They want the truth at this stage.</p></speech>

Subsequent to some further information that was brought to our attention today, there are some issues I want to highlight.  The Government put a strong focus on rolling out broadband services to areas of the country that had a severe lack of any type of infrastructure around broadband.  Community centres, with which the Minister of State would be familiar, primary schools and even some parish halls have been chosen as suitable locations for these facilities.  An issue with these facilities was brought to my attention recently.  I found it quite entertaining but it is a very valid point.  In order to access these services people must receive a text message from a mobile phone provider but not only do many of these areas not have high-speed broadband access, they also do not have phone reception.  It makes it impossible to access those services.  I said this to the representatives from NBI.  It is important that it looks at incorporating this into the national broadband plan.  That is something I would like the Minister of State to look at.  Multiple millions of euro have been invested to make this happen and it was supported by many Ministers.  The former Minister, Deputy Naughten, who is in the Chamber, did a lot of work in this area, as did the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys.  I compliment her on her very hard and diligent work to make this happen.  That is welcome.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could take that point away.  There are so many potential solutions that could be brought forward to deal with that area but all of this work is fruitless unless that reception issue can be addressed and solved.  It would be a very poor investment from the State's point of view if people could not access these services.</p>  <p>  My other point relates to rural businesses, such as those outside towns in rural constituencies like my own in Cork East.  The M9 and the Cork to Dublin motorway are vital links for these businesses.  They have attracted a lot of logistics companies into the area that require heavy goods transfers and other services so it is optimal for them to be located beside a motorway.  Another problem we have is that we cannot get high-speed broadband in areas like Rathcormac.  I do not mean to be too parochial in the House but that issue needs to be identified.  We are very lucky that we have these sources of employment.  In some cases the employers are hiring in excess of 100 employees.  I come from Youghal.  There is no private employer or business in Youghal town with over 100 people working in it at the moment and that is an issue we need to address.  There are rural villages near the motorway with large businesses operating in them but they cannot get Internet and there is a two or three year wait.  I do not need to harp on about how important access to high-speed broadband is but this is a State-led emergency intervention.  In 2022, we need to look at ramping up that intervention and if private businesses of a sizeable scale want to sit down and consult NBI on the matter, that is something we as a Government should facilitate.</p>  <p>  We all know how important high-speed broadband has been throughout the pandemic.  I live in a secluded rural area and, unfortunately, we do not yet have a high-speed connection to our own home.  We are in the same boat as many others and are relying on satellite broadband connections.  The Government should also explore the expansion of that solution as part of NBI's work.  While satellites do not provide the most stable connection, they are a short-term solution that provide additional high-speed broadband.  That is one area that has to be incorporated into the plan.  Satellites could also address phone connectivity issues.  The ESB networks have a role to play in that regard and that is not being looked at as strongly as it could be.  We could lose our electric line network for the provision of limited facilities to improve rural 4G services.  There are swathes of the countryside where there is no coverage, no matter where you go in Ireland.  Even driving on the motorways between our major cities, there are serious blackspots where there is no phone reception.  That is a very important part of any business in today's world and its importance will continue to grow.</p>  <p>  Deputy Conway-Walsh said something that hit home for me.  She stated that there will be a significant wait, well into the mid 2020s, before a lot of rural areas receive any degree of connection.  What concerns me, and I am right to be concerned about this, is what new technologies will be available when we reach that stage and whether this represents value for the State.  It is important that we have an honest and frank conversation in a year's time with regard to that issue.  I will leave the rest of my time to my colleague.</p></speech>

What is important to point out is that it is a massive &euro;2.1 billion project, but what it delivers will be massive in terms of opportunity throughout the country.  We have often had an urban-rural divide in much of our infrastructure.  What we are doing here is bringing equity to communications and fantastic opportunities to every rural home, business and school.  There has also been quite a roll-out of the BCPs, which has made a huge difference.  I brought it up with NBI at committee earlier.  It looks at the impact that has on the schools and public areas where those BCPs have been rolled out.</p>  <p>  I stressed to NBI that it was a massive plan.  It has been described as akin to the rural electrification system and what that brought to rural Ireland.  It will hit hiccups and bumps, but what I have had from interaction with NBI, on-site and in committee, is that there has been significant learning from the difficulties it has experienced in the first two years of the roll-out in terms of infrastructure, the problems with ducts and following drawings and network plans and what is on the ground not reflecting what it may have seen in the original drawings and I understand that.</p>  <p>  What I have taken from it is that NBI has learned much from that and we will see an acceleration and improvement in its designs and future works.  It will come in on target and deliver for rural Ireland.  We should all support it and get it rolled out as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I was struggling to make it here in time when the Government missed the last slot.  I mentioned some of this earlier, but another Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, is present.  The goals of the national broadband plan are laudable and, we in People Before Profit believe, essential for rural Ireland.</p>  <p>  The provision of the services to more than 500,000 addresses is not only vital for businesses; it is vital for ordinary households and schools, etc.,  in an evermore online world where high-speed internet access is not some kind of a luxury but a bare minimum needed to participate fully in this society.  It becomes even more essential for access to State services and more essential still in a coronavirus-ridden world for remote learning and working.  There is no doubt about its importance.</p>  <p>  However laudable the goals, the current plan, for historical reasons, falls on every metric.  We have been repeatedly told this is essential infrastructure and must be provided by means of massive taxpayer subsidies of &euro;3 billion, but even the most risky gambler probably would not bet that the figure will not rise, as has happened in other outsourced national projects.  The primary justification is the lack of State telecommunications infrastructure, but that is the result of a Government decision.  Fianna F&aacute;il and the Progressive Democrats, in 1999, committed to privatising Telecom &Eacute;ireann and the absolutely disastrous outcome of that decision is well known in this House.</p>  <p>  Our national communications infrastructure was repeatedly bought and sold, including by many of the big business names in Ireland.  At every stage, the company was loaded with debt and sweated for every cent that could be extracted, starving the company of needed infrastructural investment and leaving it incapable of anything like the services required, because it simply could not generate the necessary profits for whomever or whatever entity happened to own it at the time.  Fintan O'Toole famously said at the time that the assets and equity funds of that company were "passed around [from Billy to Jack] like a joint at a student party".  However, the decision to privatise Telecom &Eacute;ireann did not happen in a vacuum.  It has been part of a deep ideology of outsourcing essential services for State functions to the private sector and it always has dire outcomes for those of us who rely on those services and for every person and taxpayer in the country, as the costs always spiral.  Private entities involved must have their profits protected, regardless of the cost to the State, or the level of service provided.</p>  <p>  The list of failures is probably too long to go into here, but I will mention a few: public-private partnerships on toll roads; school buildings that are faulty and on which we pay more and more to have them sorted out; the national convention centre; the national children's hospital; and the cervical check programme.  Even with the history of a great number of observers of this plan having very serious concerns about it from the outset, it has developed in an even worse fashion than most of us had feared.  We now have a &euro;3 billion plan over 25 years, the infrastructure of which we will not own at the end.</p>  <p>  As if all of this was not bad enough, recent revelations on the financial structures and entities behind the NBI show us the company created a plan with a network of at least 13 different companies throughout Ireland, Luxembourg and America.  In fact, we now know that David McCourt's firm only owns approximately 10% of NBI, despite contrived corporate structures that seem to indicate he has a controlling stake.</p>  <p>  Anyone paying attention to the housing crisis, which all of us have been, knows the Oak Hill Advisors vulture fund has specialised in discounting bad loans to sweat borrowers and underline assets for cash.  In the previous D&aacute;il, Fianna F&aacute;il famously called for the nationalisation of the broadband plan, but it is silent on that issue now.  However, I echo that call, on behalf of People Before Profit, for any essential infrastructure in this State not to be outsourced like the list of those I have mentioned, and this outsourcing programme is a disaster.  Not only is it a disaster, but those who are given the responsibility to oversee the funding, ownership and control of the company is Ernst &amp;amp; Young.  It did a great job on the banks when it audited Anglo Irish Bank and if that is what we are relying on, then God help Ireland, because we are heading down a disastrous road.</p></speech>

Almost 300,000 premises have been surveyed; 250,000 completed; more than 150,000 premises are under construction or constructed; and 55,000 premises are available for order.  Apparently, 450 BCPs have been installed.  However, we have learned from "Prime Time" in the past month or so that there are just 3,335 homes connected throughout the State.  Progress has been painfully slow.</p>  <p>  I spoke to a lady last week who had been searching for months for a rental property in the south Kildare area within her budget, which is a hard find.  She finally found a home in the Lackagh area, but was unable to move in because the Internet speed was measured at 1.9 Mbps.  The lady works from home for a large multinational company and needs a good connection to save a 90-mile round-trip commute to Dublin.  The expected connection date for the premises is - wait for it - December 2026.</p>  <p>  Rural dwellers cannot put their lives on hold for the next five years.  The Government needs to get the finger out and take urgent action.  Decent Internet speed is not just about streaming movies, although in many parts of County Kildare and Portarlington, County Laois, where trips to the cinema are difficult to make if one does not drive, entertainment is a relevant factor.</p>  <p>  Businesses struggle to complete payroll, students struggle to submit assignments and community groups struggle to connect with their members due to poor broadband speeds.  I had an email from a rural school last week that had recently taken delivery of a number of Chromebooks, due to its own fundraising, which is another story in itself.  However, it is unable to use them due to the poor Internet speed in the area.  Staff have also undertaken considerable upskilling to ensure the pupils' development of digital skills and literacy are enhanced and the school sourced Internet safety books for staff, parents and pupils from Barnardos.</p>  <p>  It has done everything possible to ensure its pupils are supported.  Unfortunately, it is let down time and again by its poor quality Internet connection.  I have written to the Minister for Education on this and I am still waiting on a reply.  The maximum speed available for the connection appears to be approximately 7 Mbps.  If one teacher streams video content to his or her classroom, this has a detrimental impact on the ability of other classes to use the Internet.  This is not acceptable in this day and age.</p>  <p>  Schools must be prioritised for connection to high-speed broadband.</p> <p>There is an increased use of Google Classroom and Apps such as Aladdin and Seesaw in our schools.  This is a welcome development but can cause untold heartbreak for rural families who struggle to go online.  In many parts of south Kildare, as the Ceann Comhairle will be aware, and Portarlington, we have a digital divide where rural dwellers are left behind and the Government is washing its hands of them.  Sinn F&eacute;in did not favour the current set-up with the national broadband roll-out.  At the time, we proposed using ESB Networks or another State agency with a track record in delivering large-scale infrastructure projects.  Instead the Government, not surprisingly, chose the privatisation route, which is not delivering on its targets, will not be in public ownership and is removed from accountability that would have existed if Sinn F&eacute;in was in government.  It is not good enough and it needs to change now.</p></speech>

I also called for it in the House before Christmas, as Members are genuinely concerned by what the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, called earlier, "a complex corporate structure".  We have heard of references to holding companies, entities and subcontractors.  It is mesmerising.</p>  <p>  I reiterate that the Minister of the day was kept at arm's length from the procurement process, which meant that the Minister had no knowledge of this structure.  The Department itself was responsible for the governance of the national broadband plan and departmental officials need to be brought before the relevant committees to answer questions on these particular issues.</p>  <p>  As Minister, it was always my intention to publish the contract and only exclude the bare minimum and I believe that has not yet been fulfilled.  While all of this is important, the primary focus of questions that I have been receiving as a public representative is when people will get access to the broadband network.</p>  <p>  While I was blamed for being too attentive to the project, the present Government ignored this project for the past two years.  It has, at least in part, contributed to the current slippage with the project now running 12 months behind target despite the commitments in the programme for Government to fast-track the project.  The Government made that promise to fast-track the project and then it sat on its hands.  The Government has tried to pass off these delays as due to Covid  In September, the Oireachtas was given a revised target of passing 60,000 premises by the end of the year and instead they passed only 35,000 by 1 January, a slippage of 25,000 premises in only 107 days.  In reality, this means that 100,000 fewer homes will have access to the high-speed broadband at the end of this year than was planned when the contract was signed in November 2019.</p>  <p>  I have put on the D&aacute;il and the committee record where, I believe, the Government has failed but, to the credit of the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, he has been prepared to listen to suggestions and to act upon them.  I want to acknowledge that and put forward some constructive suggestions.  I was on the ground in Blessington looking at the build-out and it was clear that there were substantial challenges with the condition of the existing network.  This was known for many months.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State, before Christmas, sat down with the chief executives of both Eir and NBI to help address these delays but with the clear issues on the condition of the existing network, one has to ask the question as to why we had to wait 25 months into the contract for that meeting to take place.  I want to know, on foot of this particular meeting, what is now being done by Eir to resolve these particular issues.  I also want to know if the issue of the quality of the surveying came up in those discussions because I understand that some of the drawings that the NBI build contractors received had no bearing whatsoever to the existing infrastructure that was on the ground.</p>  <p>  We also need to be honest with people.  Everyone cannot be connected at the start of the build programme.  That is why, as Minister, I insisted on the roll-out of the broadband connection points providing high-speed BCPs in rural communities, which has now morphed into digital hubs providing hot-desking facilities across this country.  The vast majority of the population today now have access to one of these within 30 minutes of them and that is a positive development.  This project has now been expanded to include all primary schools and several marts, which is also very welcome.</p>  <p>  I ask the Government to ensure that everyone has access to a provisional date for connection to this network right across the 227 deployment areas.  Even if at this stage it is only a list of how NBI will progress through each of those 227 deployment areas, it at least gives an indication to people.  This would not only bring clarity to families and business, but also to alternative wireless providers who can focus their marketing and deployment on those homes that are later in the build programmes.</p>  <p>  As NBI delivers fibre broadband to homes, families will come off these wireless services.  Companies, such as Eurona Brisknet in County Roscommon, are pre-selling fibre connections.  When people are connected, they are moving that equipment to more isolated homes providing them with a broadband service allowing them to work from home and gain some of the benefit of the connections that have taken place.  The reality is there will be only a short window for a return on this supplementary deployment and we need the local authorities and State bodies to provide temporary sites free of charge to allow them to expand their reach.  This is a cost-effective way to extend the benefit of the early deployment areas to homes that will be waiting a number of years for a fibre connection.  There is no point spending another 25 months thinking about this.  There are proactive wireless companies, such as Eurona Brisknet, that are willing to embrace this model if the State meets them halfway.  It should not be forgotten that I released the 5G network specifically to support the roll-out by companies, such as Imagine, of their next generation wireless service.  These companies need to be supported in expanding their reach to more isolated rural homes, especially as capacity and existing equipment becomes available, and they need access to the NBI backhaul.  Let us at least have one constructive outcome from today's debate.</p></speech>

I thank the Ceann Comhairle.  I appreciate the opportunity to address this.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, probably will not mind me making this point that this is not the national rural broadband plan; it is the national broadband plan.  I say that because 13,000 homes in Dublin are to be included in the roll-out by NBI.  It is important to say that, as a representative of the largest of those constituencies in Dublin, the vast majority of those 13,000 are probably in my constituency.  On that basis, it is important to talk about what this is rather than what it is not and about the fact that we are here because of what I submit to be a disastrous policy decision made more than 20 years ago to privatise the entire telecommunications network, including the lines.  That policy, of course, has had disastrous consequences in the sense that it was left to private enterprise to invest and it did not invest in the more difficult areas, particularly in my constituency where people live in rural environments west of the M1 motorway but also in some of the suburban towns in the northern end of the constituency.  For instance, I got an email only this week from NBI outlining 2,400 homes that will be provided with high-speed broadband up to 500 Mbps in the next year or two.  This is real progress.  While, of course, I am a little upset by the fact that there has been significant delays to the development of the NBI plan because of Covid, I am also a realist.  I appreciate that people were in lockdown and, therefore, there was automatic slippage.</p> <p>This is not an opportunity to ask a question of the Minister of State but it is something for the officials to note.  Can we make up time, and if so, how much can we make up in the coming years?  There is significant work, not limited to communities such as those in Skerries, Balbriggan, Balrothery and Man O'War.  There has been significant progress in regard to connections to local sporting organisations such as Man O'War GFC, some of our cultural sites such as Newbridge House and Farm, and a number of other GAA clubs such as Fingal Ravens GFC.  That is an opportunity for us to ensure the digital hubs are there for people who might be waiting a little longer to get themselves connected to high-speed broadband.</p> <p> Of course, as has been mentioned by many Deputies, there are obvious societal benefits, in respect not just of education but also of working from home, which we are encouraging and now legislating for and which is a welcome development.  The more people who have high-speed broadband, the more services that can be provided, such as e-health, which is another reasonable way for people to cut their carbon emissions along with working from home, whereby they do not have to travel or take up space, whether on a commuter train, a bus or in their car, emitting unnecessary carbon emissions.  That they can work from home has a real benefit.  It also has an economic benefit because those who stay in the rural community will shop there.  Rather than buy a roll in the city, they stay local, which is good.</p> <p> I am encouraged by the gathering of pace of the national broadband plan, Covid delays notwithstanding.  Communities throughout the country will benefit from this.  I mentioned the fact we are here because of a disastrous policy decision, but we have undone that policy decision by bringing forward the national broadband plan and ensuring communities are connected both in rural Ireland and in my constituency, which I do not think any of my rural colleagues would accept is rural Ireland.  That is the most important aspect of this.</p></speech>

NBI contractors have been on the ground throughout the country for more than 22 months and more than 291,000 premises nationwide have been surveyed.  A total of 3,500 premises were surveyed in September last year.  When my constituent checks on the NBI website and enters his Eircode postcode to see what stage it is at, his status is stuck.  It is stuck on "survey pending" and that has been going on for the past year.  When he rings me, he tells me he is always told the same, namely, that it is stuck on pending and it has been like that for the past year.  This means he cannot contact service providers of broadband to arrange a date to connect his house to be ready to receive the router from the service provider.</p>  <p>  At the same time, the status of his next-door neighbour, 100 m down the road on the same fibre line, is described on the NBI website as being ready to connect service providers.  I hear this all the time, whereby neighbours have been left short compared with other neighbours.  That is the biggest issue.  I have been contacted by people who say there could be two houses on a road that have a connection, five that do not and then a further ten that do.  It just does not make sense.</p>  <p>  One thousand homes in Ireland were connected in December.  A total of 29% and 38% of all premises in counties Carlow and Kilkenny, respectively, are within the intervention area but there remain broadband-poor areas, which we have to address.  That is the issue that is coming across my desk all the time.</p>  <p>  Under Our Rural Future, we gave a commitment to developing a national network of 400 remote working hubs over the next five years.  There is nationwide coverage, with more than 177 hubs already using the connect hub platform, but the other 223 are not up and running.  These hubs are great but there are constituents of mine who live outside of easy commuting distance to them and they need broadband.  It is these people who are losing out.  We all want the national broadband plan to move as quickly as possible because broadband plays a significant part in people's lives and work, in businesses and so on.</p>  <p>  These issues have to be addressed.  How can two houses on a road not have broadband and yet five houses beside them have it?  It just does not make sense.  Will the Minister of State look into that for me?  It is important we move on this.  Broadband is so important to everyone and Covid has shown us its importance for working from home and for businesses.</p></speech>

Is tubaiste mh&oacute;r &iacute; agus t&aacute; a fhios ag gach Ball nach bhfuil na moilleanna seo go maith. T&aacute; s&eacute; dochreidte go bhfuil daoine ag feithimh ar feadh na blianta chun an t-infreastrucht&uacute;r seo a fh&aacute;il, agus is infreastrucht&uacute;r bun&uacute;sach &eacute; ag deireadh an lae.</p>  <p>  The following comments were made by a Minister regarding the roll-out of the national broadband plan, "The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services ... are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible."  That was the then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Pat Rabbitte.  It was 2013, one year after the national broadband plan was originally published, in August 2012, and two years after the publication of the next generation broadband task force report in 2011, yet he we are, at the start of 2022, more than one decade after that report was published, and many parts of both rural and urban Ireland are still without access to basic infrastructure, namely, high-speed fibre connections.  That is incredible.</p>  <p>  Several Government Deputies have argued this project is gathering pace.  What do they mean exactly by "gathering pace"?  I quoted an announcement as far back as 2013, and here we are in 2022.  It is shameful and there is no excuse for such a delay.  It has certainly hampered businesses.  I have heard directly from many small employers, one of which, in Rosenallis, County Laois, has 30 employees.  He cannot get high-speed broadband in the area and was told it will take a number of years.  If that is how employers are treated, it is no wonder we do not have enough jobs or enough job creation in rural Ireland.  We are being let down by this so-called plan.  It is not a good plan and it is not credible.  It is not credible to leave people waiting years for such basic infrastructure.</p>  <p>  We in the Rural Independent Group have sought a briefing with National Broadband Ireland to discuss the many issues and to ask the questions that need to be asked because we need proper constructive engagement and firm commitments we can stand over.  To expect Deputies to tell their constituents they must wait until 2025 or 2026 for basic infrastructure such as national broadband just does not cut it.  It is not acceptable in the least.  So much for gathering pace.  I do not call it "gathering pace" if we have to wait that long.  Surely something can be done here, given that in all our communities, areas and employers are affected.  Businesses throughout the country are affected.  It will hamper our chances of bringing in foreign direct investment or of encouraging local enterprises to set up in a particular area or community.  Not having this infrastructure in place is holding back our local economy and holding back potential.  There is something radically wrong, and we all need to ask questions about the national broadband plan.</p>  <p>  In respect of my constituency, Laois-Offaly, National Broadband Ireland has confirmed to me that, while areas in Offaly such as those in and around Clonygowan are within its intervention area, the anticipated connection date is between January 2025 and December 2026.</p> <p>As I said before, that is totally unacceptable, particularly when the Government is talking about legislation allowing people to work from home and we are hearing this sort of spin.  How can people work from home if they do not have basic broadband?  It is certainly going to put paid to that notion for many families, who will just not be able to do it and will have no option but to commute.  Even if their employer is willing to let them work from home, it cannot happen unless the infrastructure is there.</p> <p> There is too much delay and there is acceptance around that from the Government, which is very concerning.  I would have thought the Government would be more critically evaluating the whole process and asking the questions, as elected representatives.  I believe that is the proper way to pursue the issue.</p> <p> It is a long time since the report of the task force I mentioned, some 15 years.  I have serious concerns with regard to the cost of the project.  This is comparable to the National Children's Hospital, given it is &euro;2.1 billion.  That is very concerning and we need to ask questions, as public representatives.</p></speech>

The cost of the NBI programme is made up of a base subsidy of &euro;2.1 billion and &euro;480 million of a contingency subsidy plus VAT.  According to NBI, it is very early in the build phase but the indications are it will be able to keep as close to the &euro; 2.1 billion base subsidy as possible.  If this does not happen, does the Minister anticipate increasing the existing &euro;480 million contingency fund and, if so, at what level?  As I said, I have serious concerns around the cost of the project.  Indeed, I have very little confidence that a project of this scale can be delivered.  It is certainly not being delivered in a timely manner.</p></speech>

I am not sure how I can do justice to this topic in five minutes.   I welcome it.  However, in a sense, we are putting the cart before the horse.  At the moment, there is a committee meeting going on, or it has just finished, where the CEO and the committee are teasing out very important issues, and the Committee of Public Accounts is due to have an appearance by the CEO on 10 February.  I would have thought that, rather than speaking in a vacuum today, some of the issues we highlighted would be crystallised and we would have a better chance at that stage.</p>  <p>  On this page I have in front of me, I have a list of various places ar fud Conamara, inar cuireadh in i&uacute;l dom nach bhfuil an c&oacute;ras ag feidhmi&uacute; agus go bhfuil muintir na h&aacute;ite th&iacute;os &oacute; thaobh easpa leathanbhanda.  While I will not read out personal things, I want to refer to the information on the page.  At Pairc L&aacute;ir, An Spide&aacute;l, four people are trying to work from home in an amber area, the time spent will be two to four years and Sky does not provide a service.  At Loch&aacute;n Beag, it is in an amber area situated on a link road between two complete access fibre ribbons, but they cannot get it.  At Knock South, Inverin, five people are working from there, just off the R336, where fibre runs.  I could go on.</p>  <p>  We spend our time taking these representations.  I appreciate the Minister of State who was present earlier, Deputy Ossian Smyth, has taken a hands-on approach, as I am sure has the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon.  This begs questions as to why a busy Minister has to take such a hands-on approach when there are all of the officials to run what should be an open and accountable contract without all of this extra effort.  I would love to know the price of that.  We spend our time putting in representations and fighting to move people along the colour board from blue to amber, and then fighting within that amber to see what year it will be.  I will leave that point and use my time to deal with other issues.</p>  <p>  I never thought I would stand here and agree with Deputy Alan Farrell.  I absolutely agree with him when he belatedly said that, unfortunately, it was an absolute disaster when Telecom &Eacute;ireann was privatised by flotation back in 1999, given what happened after that.  It was a major mistake.  We are now investing somewhere between &euro;2.1 billion and &euro;3 billion and, even in itself, that uncertainty is unhelpful.  While it was clarified as &euro;2.1 billion in a contract, it is a lot more than that.  There is a huge effort from the Department to monitor a contract that we have not seen because, despite the fact the former Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, said it would be published almost in full, we have not seen it.  We are here getting reassurances and talking around in circles, trying to find out how this contract is being implemented and find out about the person fronting it, who appears to have only a 10% share, and all of the other myriad companies behind it.  However, let us not bother our little minds about that because it is all too complex for us.  It is ironic we are talking about communications and broadband, and facilitating easier communication, while all of the time we are obfuscating, confusing and hiding communication, and making it impossible for ourselves, because we are just ordinary Deputies, to read stuff and ask appropriate questions.  It is not possible and the Minister of State knows that.  Over and over again, we see various examples of different organisations where the governance has utterly failed - everything from the children's hospital, which had an outside board attached to it to monitor what was going on, to yesterday's terrible report on CAMHS in County Kerry.  All of the time, it is governance failing.  What do we do?  We sign a contract that is too complex for the ordinary Deputy to understand.</p>  <p>  Belatedly, we then put in a public service director, or whatever the correct title is.  She was put in almost a year later.  What is the role of that woman?  Has she come back and reported to the Government in regard to various issues?  What issues have arisen?  I understand the problem with a public director is that his or her duty is to the company, so what is the point of having a public director?  I happened to be at one or two meetings initially, when my colleague Deputy Pringle was not available.  I asked this very question in regard to the role of a public director and what was going to happen but we have heard nothing since in that regard.</p>  <p>  We are here today, looking at something like this, without any connection to the other companies on the ground.  We have all met them.  We have been overwhelmed with representations from companies on the ground, so we can do it but we are not being facilitated.  We have an awful lot of complaints about Eir and we have to continuously pressurise it so that people come off the amber because Eir has finally facilitated them.</p>  <p>  My time is up and I have not even approached the issue.  While I am not complaining, this is no way to bring openness and accountability to a contract like this.</p></speech>

I thank the House on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, for the invitation to address the House on the roll-out of the national broadband plan and for the views expressed by the various Members throughout this discussion on the matter, which is one of absolute national importance.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State's earlier contribution made a reference that I have made myself on a number of occasions, and many in this House have also acknowledged that the scale of what we are doing here has never been reached in terms of infrastructure roll-out since the electrification of Ireland.  There are a lot of good analogies in that space.  Obviously, it is a mammoth undertaking and, in that regard, it was always going to face challenges, some of them unforeseen, such as Covid, which I will touch on shortly regarding the steps that are being taken to respond to that.  In terms of the net benefit for companies, individuals, farms, schools and all the other premises that have been connected, during the electrification of Ireland at that time, people thought that was simply to bring light into a house and no one could ever have envisaged all the different uses and different appliances we would end up plugging in and using electricity for now.</p> <p>Similarly, we cannot even envisage the myriad uses there will be for a high-speed network and the smart lives we will be able to live in our homes in the future.  That is why this is the right thing to do.  Questions have been raised about the cost of this.  Fine Gael was criticised in the previous Government for driving on with this.  We have been vindicated by the fact the overall NBP is critical.  It is the right thing to do.  It is a very ambitious approach by this Government and the previous Government to be world leaders in the reach we will have throughout our country.</p> <p> As the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, said earlier, I confirm to the House the NBP remains a top priority of the Government for those reasons.  At the centre of this plan is the delivery of high-speed broadband for the citizens of Ireland, both from a value for money and a delivery of critical infrastructure perspective.  It is a vital utility necessary for the continued economic and social development of our country.  Balanced regional development is so important to us.  That is why no home has been left behind and everybody in all parts will be covered, both urban and rural, and those in between on the edges of places who do not have that access.  We will not have any digital divide in this country because of the NBP.  That is an important result that will be achieved by the end of this.</p> <p> It is clear from the contributions Deputies have made today that this House shares the Government's strong desire to ensure high-speed broadband and a future-proofed network are delivered throughout Ireland as soon as possible.  While substantial progress has been made to date, complications such as Covid have impacted on the delivery of the fibre network, resulting in delays to the delivery of aspects of the programme.</p> <p> The Department of Environment, Climate and Communications has worked closely with NBI to put in place a remedial plan under the contract.  The focus for 2022 is to continue to develop momentum in the build, to catch up on the delays experienced, and to plan for acceleration, which everybody in this House wants.  We know that from our individual roles in each of our constituencies.  I am all too aware that we in Kildare we are inundated, as much as everyone in this House is, with calls about frustrations.  The point was raised earlier that a person can be just down the road from somebody, that the infrastructure is so close, and they ask if they cannot get it connected quicker.  We all want this to happen as quickly as possible.  The Government is working in a co-ordinated fashion.  The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is leading the charge in its engagement with NBI to do that, to develop momentum in the build, to catch up on delays that were experienced last year, and to plan for acceleration.  Final targets for 2022 will be agreed shortly.  Transparency and openness have been raised.  Those targets will be clear to everybody.  That will give us a real sense of the momentum we are looking to build.</p> <p> Both the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, are equally keen to see broadband delivered to all citizens as soon as possible, as are all of us in government and in this House.  The progression of the roll-out by NBI, in tandem with increased commercial investment by operators such as Eir, SIRO and Virgin Media, is the best means of achieving this.  We will continue to work together to deliver for the people of Ireland a broadband plan that will future-proof our country, both economically and societally.  It is critical to balanced regional development and to all aspects of our lives.  It continues to be a top priority of the Government.</p></speech>

I believe this is important legislation for reforming and modernising how we govern the higher education sector.  It needs to be seen alongside a broader programme of reform of the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, student grant scheme, reducing the cost of education, making sure there is education for all, and creating a unified, integrated third level system across apprenticeships, further education and training, and higher education.  As we invest more and more in higher education, it is important we have modern governance structures in place and oversight and accountability mechanisms that recognise the autonomy of institutions but also the public policy concerns and views this House and the people will have in ensuring we have a modern, fit for purpose, agile, flexible, higher education system that can deliver educationally and deliver the skills our country requires now and in the future.</p>  <p>  I began last night to outline the sections of the Bill.  I got as far as section 34.  Sections 35 and 36 provide for the preparation by the Higher Education Authority, HEA, in consultation with the Minister, of a performance framework for the higher education and research system and the agreement by the HEA of performance agreements with designated institutions of higher education that are in accordance with the performance framework.</p>  <p>  Sections 37 to 42, inclusive, provide that grants may be issued by the HEA to higher education institutions or other bodies or persons which provide services consistent with the functions of the HEA.  The HEA shall prepare and establish a framework, with the approval of the Minister, for the allocation of funding.  Funding to bodies shall be made in accordance with such conditions of funding as specified by the chief executive officer of the HEA.  The chief executive officer of the HEA may request and use the information provided by other bodies to establish if an education provider meets the criteria, terms and conditions of the funding framework and ensure a funded body is compliant on an ongoing basis with the conditions of funding.  The chief executive officer may review compliance with conditions of funding by a funded body and may, following this review and consultation with the funded body, issue appropriate directions in writing regarding continued compliance with the conditions of funding.  The chief executive officer may impose remedial or other measures on the funded body for non-compliance with conditions of funding.  The body may appeal against the decision of the chief executive officer to impose remedial or other measures.</p>  <p>  Sections 43 to 45, inclusive, provide for formal engagement between students and designated institutions of higher education, including the provision of training for students participating as members of the governing body of a designated institution of higher education.  There is also provision for the HEA to engage with and seek views from representatives of students, including representatives of students in priority groups, on issues of relevance at a national level to the experience of students participating in higher education.  These sections also provide for the HEA to undertake, in partnership with other bodies, a student survey at least every two years in respect of undergraduate students and postgraduate students.</p>  <p>  Section 46 provides that the HEA shall prepare and submit to the Minister for approval a draft strategic action plan providing for equity of access, participation and promotion of success for a period of up to seven years.  Each designated institution of higher education is required to report annually to the HEA on the implementation of the plan.</p> <p>Section 47 provides that the HEA will promote and support designated institutions of higher education in the development and provision of lifelong and flexible learning.  Sections 48 to 52 provide for the collection and sharing of personal and non-personal data from designated institutions of higher education and funded bodies subject to the data protection regulation, the Data Protection Act 2018 and the Data Sharing and Governance Act 2019.  There is also provision for the HEA to carry out studies and research on any issue related to its functions.</p> <p> Sections 53 to 60 provide for the designation of higher education providers as designated institutions of higher education.  Universities, institutes of technology, technological universities, the National College of Art and Design, NCAD, and education providers which have received a university authorisation order under the Universities Act 1997 are automatically classified as designated institutions of higher education for the purposes of this Bill.  Other higher education providers may be designated by ministerial order as designated institutions of higher education under the Act if, following an application for designation, they meet certain conditions following an assessment process undertaken by the HEA.  The conditions of designation will be made by regulation by the Minister in consultation with the HEA and the designated institutions of higher education will be required to comply on an ongoing basis with these conditions.  The HEA may undertake reviews of compliance and the Minister may make an order revoking the designation if a designated institution of higher education is not complying with the conditions for designation or where a designated institution of higher education has made an application for the revoking of the designation order itself.  A designated institution of higher education may use the title "Designated Institution of Higher Education" to describe itself and it precludes a body which is not a designated institution of higher education from using that title.</p> <p> Sections 61 to 63 provide that a designated institution which is not already obligated by sectoral legislation to do so, shall prepare a strategic development plan and an equality statement and provide them to the HEA and shall keep all proper and usual accounts.  Sections 64 to 69 provide that the chief executive officer, CEO, may request the governing body of a designated institution of higher education to undertake a review where there are concerns about the governance or performance of a designated institution of its functions or responsibilities and to provide a report of the matter to the CEO.  The CEO may make a determination for action following consideration of a report under section 64 if he or she is not satisfied that concerns regarding the performance by the designated institution of higher education have been adequately addressed and resolved, or if the designated institution of higher education concerned does not undertake a review or prepare and submit a report to the CEO.  The determination may include all or any of the following actions: the provision of assistance to the institution concerned; the imposition of remedial measures as respects the institution concerned; the provision of information to such other bodies as the CEO considers appropriate; or the undertaking of a review of the institution concerned with the approval of the board.</p> <p> Sections 70 to 72 provides for an appeals process.  Appeals can be made under sections: 42(6) in relation to the imposition of remedial measures following review of compliance with conditions of funding; 54(12) regarding a refusal to make a designation order in respect of a higher education provider; 59(13) in relation to the revocation of a designation order in respect of a higher education provider; or 65(4) regarding the imposition of remedial measures following the review and report by a designated institution of higher education.</p> <p> Sections 73 to 118 relate to amendments to the sectoral legislation including the Universities Act 1997, the Technological Universities Act 2018, the Regional Technical Colleges Act 1992, the Regional Technical Colleges (Amendment) Act 1994 and the National College of Art and Design Act 1971.  These amendments include the reform of the governing authorities or bodies of universities, technological universities and institutes of technology to provide that they shall consist of 17 members appointed by the governing authority or body, comprising one external chairperson, two students, one chief officer, five internal members other than the chief officer, three external members nominated by the Minister, and five external members, other than the chairperson.  These sections also contain a provision that the governing authority of Trinity College Dublin shall comprise of 17 members and up to an additional five fellows and the amendment of the Trinity College Supplemental Letters Patent of 1911, as amended by the Trinity College Dublin (Charters and Letters Patent Amendment) Act 2000, to be in accordance with the provisions of the Universities Act 1997.  Other amendments provide that the chairperson of the governing authority of a university shall be appointed by a majority vote of not less than two-thirds and that the chairperson is an external member of the governing authority.  That is an important change.  These sections also provide for additional functions for the governing authorities or bodies to ensure good governance practice and the insertion of new sections to provide that the governing authority or body can carry out a review of a matter if it has concerns regarding the governance or performance of the functions or responsibilities of the higher education institutions.  Another important provision is that the governing authority or body shall, with the approval of the Minister, determine the transitional arrangements and procedures to be put in place to ensure that the new governing authorities or bodies comply with the new provisions for governing authorities or bodies within 12 months.  The Bill provides for consultation by the governing authority or body on the preparation of the strategic development plan.  It also includes provisions for consultation by the governing authority or body on the preparation of the equality policy and provisions for members of the governing authority or body other than an ex officio member who is an employee of the higher education institutions to receive remuneration subject to the approval of the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Other amendments to the National College of Art and Design Act 1971 to modernise the legislation include the provision of an academic council and academic freedom of the governing authority and the academic staff of the college.</p> <p> Sections 119 to 124 provide for minor amendments to the Student Support Act 2011, the Industrial Training Act 1967, the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 and the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014.  Sections 125 to 128 provide for the publication by the HEA of the names of the designated institutions of higher education, the preparation or adoption and issuing of guidelines, codes or policies to designated institutions of higher education by the HEA, the methods of sending a notice and consequential amendments of enactments in Schedule 4.</p> <p> Schedule 1 provides the enactments to be repealed by this Act including the entirety of the Higher Education Authority Act 1971.  Schedule 2 provides detailed regulations regarding the operation of the board of the HEA.  Schedule 3 provides the detail regarding the making of a scheme amending the existing superannuation schemes of the HEA made under Section 15 of the Higher Education Authority Act 1971 while schedule 4 provides a detailed list of amendments to other enactments, primarily definitions to ensure compatibility with this legislation.</p> <p> To summarise, this is genuinely the most significant legislative reform of the third level education system since the 1971 Act establishing the HEA.  The world has changed an awful lot since 1971, as has higher education.  As far as I remember, when these Houses passed the Higher Education Authority Bill in 1971 there were around 20,000 students in full-time higher education in Ireland.  Thanks to huge societal progress in our country, economic progress and policies pursued by this Oireachtas through successive Governments, we now have a student population that is well above 200,000 and approaching 250,000.  The world has changed, the education system has changed and the level of funding and investment from the taxpayer has changed.  Education in and of itself has changed and it is important that the legislative framework changes as well.  The aim of this Bill is to set up a modern system for future students, staff and governing authorities of higher education institutions and with this we will drive forward higher performance, accountability and overall improvements in our higher education system.  This education tries to ensure that we absolutely respect the autonomy of our higher education institutions but that we also help them to make sure that their own internal governance is fit for purpose.  It is not acceptable in the twenty first century, and I am not sure it was acceptable in the twentieth century, to have boards that are not chaired by external members.  We cannot have a scenario where the chief executive is also the chair of the board.  We have to get real here and modernise.  We must recognise that we need boards based on competencies and skill sets.  I pay huge tribute to all who have served and who currently serve on governing authorities.  They do so without remuneration and they do so driven by the public good.  I thank them all for their service.  This legislation is about recognising that we need smaller boards, with more external appointees and an external chairperson and that the HEA, the Minister and the Department must be clear in relation to the setting of overall higher education policy in our country.  </p> <p> There is no doubt that higher education system is a key plank of our country's future, our people's prosperity.  It is also a driver of equality and cultural change and integral to our national economic and social sustainability.  It is essential that we bring a clear, specific and respectful definition to the relationship between higher education institutions and the State.  This legislation is a crucial part of the Government's reform agenda for the higher education system but it is just one part.  Others include a sustainable funding model, changes around student accommodation, reform of the SUSI grant, the delivery of the technological universities and the expansion of the apprenticeship programme.  This is a jigsaw and these are all important parts of forming that picture.  As we look to drive our ambitions forward, we are seeking to ensure that the fundamental building blocks of governance and funding are firmly in place.  I genuinely look forward to working with Members on all sides of this House on this legislation as it goes through the various stages.  I hope we can work together to tease through issues and to make sure we produce the best possible law.  I look forward to engaging in that spirit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.539" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1501" speakername="Rose Conway-Walsh" time="16:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700050#AAA00200"><p>I thank the Minister.  As he knows, Sinn F&eacute;in supports legislative reform in higher education to clarify the role of the HEA, to increase inclusion and access and to ensure proper governance and accountability.  I acknowledge that the Minister and his Department have taken on board a number of recommendations - some, but not all - that Sinn F&eacute;in put forward during pre-legislative scrutiny.</p> <p>They included issues around the role of the HEA in promoting the Irish language, increasing North-South co-operation, increasing the number of board members and the removal of the limit on the number of members on the academic councils.  I welcome the inclusion of student representation on the board of the HEA.  I call on the Minister to take on board the committee recommendation that trade union representation should be included on the board of the HEA.  </p> <p> Similarly, I welcome the inclusion of the specific role of the HEA in promoting cross-border co-operation in higher education.  The education committee also specifically called for a role for the HEA in promoting cross-border student enrolment.  I welcome that the Bill now makes specific reference to the role of the HEA in promoting the Irish language.  I assume that was an oversight in the general scheme and I am glad it is now included.  That said, the role given to the HEA in promoting the Irish language is weaker in this Bill than in the 1971 Act that it will replace and in the Universities Act 1997.  I believe it should be strengthened.</p> <p> Despite these changes in the general scheme, there is still substantial room for improvement in the Bill.  We will continue to work constructively with the Minister to try to get the Bill where it needs to be.  As things stand, I am not satisfied that the Minister has struck the right balance between the autonomy for the institutions of higher education and the governing oversight.  I have engaged extensively with the sector over recent months and the management of every institution accepts the need for the highest standards and for transparency and accountability of public finances.  That is without exception and it is beyond question.  The Minister will always have my support and Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s support for any policy that achieves that.  However, there are many proposals in the Bill which reduce the autonomy of institutions of higher education without any clear relationship with transparency and accountability.  I have yet to see or hear a convincing justification for dictating such rigid governance structures such as the mandatory 17-member limit on the governing bodies.  These are all unpaid positions.  Every governing body has its own unique make-up and tradition.  Slashing the numbers allowed on the board seems mistaken.  It is a decision that colleges are more than capable of making, as long as they meet certain standards of competency and external representation.  The substantial reduction in size will put more strain on members and will reduce representation on the board of different institutions and the wider communities.  The removal of the broader representation on the governing bodies will be a real loss.  It is unfair to say that the legislation will move the sector to a competency-based governance model.  Governing bodies are currently made up of members of academic and non-academic staff, undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate students, alumni, local authority nominees, trade union representatives, employers organisations and others.  As recently as 2018, a Fine Gael Government passed legislation on technological universities that stipulated a 22-person governing body or 26 in certain cases.  A few short years later, that has been reduced even further without any clear explanation of its merits.  We need to have further discussions on that</p> <p> It is claimed that this Bill will promote a student-focused system.  However it seems that because of the reforms to governing bodies, students will have less representation on governing bodies in all higher education institutions.  The Minister needs to clarify the potential impact this could have on the representation of undergraduate and postgraduate students on the governing bodies, on the representation of academic and non-academic staff and on trade union representation.</p> <p> Governing boards benefit and are strengthened by external membership.  However, this legislation mandates a majority of external members without clear justification or explanation.  How strong could the justification possibly be given that board exemptions have been granted for Trinity College Dublin?  I have no issue with TCD being shown flexibility to reflect its unique governance structure but I believe that different models can be equally successfully provided for.  Certain safeguards are in place to ensure good governance, transparency and accountability.  TCD is not the only college with its own unique history and governance structure.  I think of the newly formed Atlantic technological university that will soon make Castlebar a university town and I look forward to that.  This multi-campus technological university involves thousands of students spread across locations in Castlebar, Galway city, Killybegs, Letterfrack, Letterkenny, Mountbellew and Sligo.  The geographical spread and multi-campus nature of this university will mean it is very distinct from most other colleges, yet it is being given no flexibility to anyone, whether student, parent, academic, staff or otherwise.  This looks unfair and elitist.  The Minister should look again at the rigid and overly prescriptive governance structures and find a fair approach that can be applied to everyone without damaging the unique characteristics, and the differentiated missions of the different institutions.</p> <p> A stated purpose of the Bill is to clarify the role of the HEA.  The Bill seems to strengthen the HEA in some ways, yet in others it seems to be reduced to a regulator rather than a strong independent authority capable of advocating for the needs of the sector.  The HEA should have a role in ensuring that the sector is adequately resourced.  Under the Bill as it stands, I believe it is not possible to do that.  As it currently stands, the  HEA no longer has any role as a voice for the sector.  A clear example of this is the fact that the CEO of the HEA will be specifically prohibited from commenting on policy.  The Bill states that the director "shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy".  I know this is not the first Bill to put this limit on this CEO of a State agency but that does not mean we should just accept it as the right way to go.  I would like the Minister to explain why this is necessary.  This fundamentally means that the HEA will be incapable of advocating for the sector and challenging the Government.</p> <p> The Bill grants sole powers of review to the HEA CEO and empowers the CEO to make a determination whether further action is necessary following a review.  The right of the HEA to appeal decisions must be robust enough to provide higher education institutions with assurances that they can challenge decisions.  In the heads of the Bill published last summer, all determinations of actions could be appealed whereas the Bill now allows only for a right of appeal against remedial measures.  On top of this, an appeal does not put a stay on the implementation of the measure determined by the CEO.  An appeals framework of this nature was not contemplated by the heads of the Bill.  I hope the Minister will be prepared to work with the Opposition and the sector to amend this section.</p> <p> I have met with most third level colleges in the State over the last 12 months and all of them were more than happy to be held to the highest standards of accountability as recipients of public funding.  That said, there was also a great deal of concern about the watering down of institutional autonomy.  Good governance and accountability can be ensured without sacrificing the autonomy of our third level institutions.  The greatest testament to the governance of higher education is that these institutions have managed to maintain the performance of the system over the last ten years.  We have seen over a decade of austerity in the higher education sector.  Fundamentally governance is not the main issue facing the sector.  Legislative reform will be of limited value unless it is accompanied by a sustainable funding model.  The Minister acknowledges that.  He did so when he acknowledged that even though the numbers have increased, that has not been underpinned by funding in the way it needs to be.  During that time, there has been a piecemeal privatisation and deep commercialisation of public third level education.  Today, most universities have a majority of revenue coming from sources other than the State.  Some of that is positive, such as winning competitive research funding or attracting more international students.  However, it has been driven out of necessity due to what the Irish Universities Association has labelled as state divestment from third level education.  That should concern us all.  The ethos and the focus of these centres of education and research have been shifted towards commercial considerations and huge amounts of time and energy are spent operating on a commercial basis.  This is energy that would be better spent on education and research.  I do not blame the individual institutions.  This has been explicit policy of successive Governments.</p> <p> I will work with the Minister on this legislation.  We want to make it as good as we possibly can.  We are rectifying legislation that is 50 years old.   We have a duty and responsibility to do that and I look forward to working with him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.541" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1615" speakername="David Cullinane" time="17:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700052#CCC00100"><p>I welcome the Minister.  It is very welcome to have a Bill that overhauls the higher education system.  I support many of the provisions in the Bill.  I wish to raise a number of issues in relation to the south east.  I am sure the Minister expects that from colleagues across the State where new institutes of technology are being put in place.</p>  <p>  I begin with a number of points on the autonomy piece, which is really important.  I sat on the Committee of Public Accounts for several years and I fully agree we need to have real transparency and accountability regarding the higher education system and higher education institutions.  In my time on that committee I saw that there are many areas where that is not in place.  One of those areas is intellectual property rights when spin-out companies emerge from institutes of technology and universities, and conflicts of interest may have to be managed.  It is a really important area because I support innovation and spin-out companies, but it is about getting the process right and we need to see reform there.  I have a concern about autonomy and the limitation of the board of either a university or an institute of technology.  I refer to the fact that even if a higher education institution wants to increase the membership of the board, it will not be able to do so.  That seems problematic to me but maybe the Minister will be able to set out the rationale.</p>  <p>  I have a number of questions.  I would love to be able to give the Minister time to respond from my own time but I do not think it is possible.  I will pose the questions anyway and he might be able to come back to me.  First of all, there is obviously much excitement about the possibility that on 1 May this year, the south east will have a university for the first time, if that designation date happens.  I have a question on the process and whether any additional clarity is being sought by the institutions in Carlow or Waterford on that process and criteria.  Is it the case that the process is still on track?  Are we still looking at 1 May for designation?  I see the Minister is in agreement.  If that is the case, it is really good news.</p>  <p>  The second question relates to clarity on the funding commitments for Waterford specifically.  The Minister might remember there was a meeting of Oireachtas Members from across the south east.  One of the commitments that was given was there would be very substantial funding committed to the south east.  This applied especially to Waterford in order that the footprint of the campus be expanded.  We have not seen that yet.  There has not been any announcement.  There has been discussion and dialogue with developers, landowners and so on but that has been going on for a long time now and we need to bring clarity to it.  As we approach 1 May, the goodwill demonstrated by the Minister needs to be translated into real action.  There is also the appointment of a new chairperson.  When is that likely to happen?  Unfortunately, the Minister cannot come back in as the rules do not allow it.  If they did I would certainly give him the minute and a half I have left to respond.  He might come back to me in writing, if he can, on those matters.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, it might be no harm and a good opportunity for the Minister if he were to brief Oireachtas Members from the south east again over the next of weeks on where we are with this process, to assure us we are on track for 1 May and to update us on the financial commitments that were given.  This will ensure we can hit the ground running and have a first-class university for the south east.  It is timely that this Bill is happening now and we are going to see a new legal framework put in place for higher education institutions at a time when the south east is going to see, we hope, a university on 1 May.</p></speech>

Higher education matters to all of us.  It is encouraging to see the Minister has taken on board some of the suggestions from pre-legislative scrutiny, including ramping up North-South co-operation and a role for the HEA in promoting an Ghaeilge.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in feel the Bill could be a bit stronger on that, as Deputy Conway-Walsh has outlined.  It is welcome and positive, however.  On the North-South issue, we still want to see specific roles for the HEA in student enrolment.  It is absolutely vital.  We are also glad to see the Minister will no longer appoint the majority of board members to higher education institutions.  That is very welcome.</p>  <p>  However, despite all the talk and all the Bills, we will never get to where we really need to be without adequate funding.  I tell the Minister funding is where it is at.  I am asking him to put the Government's money where its mouth is by publishing the Cassells report's economic findings and removing higher education from the brutality of austerity.  We have now had at least two generations of students go through the system with it in the grip of austerity.  We really need to do much better for them and by them.  It goes without saying that Sinn F&eacute;in is hugely ambitious in higher education, for all our people and what they can achieve within it.  That is very much on display in the North.  I know there was a lot of chagrin from some of the sectarian Northern commentariat but we see the importance of higher education.  We want and need to see many more places available to prospective students so we can have more thinkers, more professionals and more well-paid jobs for all our workers across society.  As a new Deputy, I often find that we are delighted when a new post is created but then we cannot find a qualified person to fill it.  Therefore, we really must make more spaces available.  We are very glad to see that the Bill provides for structured student engagement and for lifelong and flexible learning.  Free secondary education revolutionised life and opportunity in this State for our people and now we need an equal freedom and opportunity when it comes to higher education here.</p>  <p>  On freedom and opportunity, I hope the Minister does not mind if I take advantage of this opportunity to ask about the situation at Maynooth University where students have been notified that courses with over 250 students are still to be taught online even though college catering and hospitality are open, as they indeed are across the town.  All the pubs are open in Maynooth.  There are students who have only had a whiff of a lecture hall since they started college and they really need to know why their lectures are online while society has reopened.  I will put down a question to the Minister on that.  It is not just me who is anxious as many of the Maynooth students who have been contacting me are very anxious for a reply as well.</p>  <p>  For us in Sinn F&eacute;in, another critical part of higher education is apprenticeships.  While I note there will be an apprenticeship office, it really must deliver.  We will be keeping a close eye on that so it does not become a vehicle to dismantle the craft apprentice model because it is very important.  I know from my constituents in Kildare North that there are many bright, talented young people in secondary school and some of them are bored stiff with it.  Sometimes they are made to feel kind of useless because they think in a different way and have a different kind of talent.  School is not for everybody and nor is third level, in the form of the traditional college.  For some of these kids, every day is torture.  They are dying to get out and start an apprenticeship that reflects their talent and career ambition.  They have so much to offer their community and our economy and when it comes to higher education it is important they are not left behind.</p>  <p>  Before I finish, I am also anxious that there be more trade union representation on the HEA board.  Equally, I would like to see the Bill give the HEA an explicit mandate to protect the public nature of public education, especially as it provides such a clear pathway for private colleges to become designated as higher education institutions and potentially be funded in the same way as public colleges.  Like housing, education is a civil right.  It is not a privilege, a commodity for profit or just something to be consumed.  It is therefore critical that the public nature of third level education be considered sacrosanct.  I ask that those points be taken on board.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.545" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1698" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="17:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700052#CCC00500"><p>I am glad to speak for the Labour Party on this important Bill.  I am grateful to my colleague Senator Hoey, who is our spokesperson on higher education, for giving me the benefit of her insights.  Obviously, I too have a strong interest in this area, having served a number of terms as a Senator for Dublin University.</p> <p>I am also very proud of my long association with the law school in Trinity College where for many years I taught and carried out research and administration, which is an important part of any academic job.  I am passionate about higher education and teaching.  I miss my students and the role of an academic.  It is a job that many people go to with a real vocation for teaching and engaging with students.</p> <p> It was very appropriate that the Minister started his speech on the Bill by acknowledging the enormous adaptability and significant work that has been put in by staff, students and administrators in third level institutions over the past 22 months in adapting to Covid-19.  We all acknowledge that it has not been easy.  It has been a major burden, especially on students.  All of us have heard from parents and students who have been distressed at the lack of face-to-face interaction, the lack of ability to be present on campuses, the lack of capacity to mix with peers and lecturers, and the major disadvantage they have been placed at as a result.  There has been a detrimental impact on their studies, but also on their personal and social development.  Any of us who are parents, or who know young people who are students, will be well aware of the huge difficulties and problems that has caused for many students and their families.  We also acknowledge and commend the staff who have done their very best in very difficult circumstances to provide high-quality teaching, albeit not face to face but remotely.  It has been very difficult for everyone so it was appropriate that the Minister acknowledged that.  I also want to join him in commending all those engaged in college communities at every level of further and higher education, including universities, colleges and institutes of further education, where we have seen such enormous effort put in to adapt to Covid-19.  It is so good to see campuses coming alive again and to see staff, students, administrators and all the communities on college campuses being able to engage face to face and be present again.</p> <p> I will also refer briefly to the gendered impacts of Covid-19 at third level.  This is something many of us will be very conscious of.  I should say that I have had engagement through the Athena Swan programme.  It is a great programme that we have seen being rolled out across the university sector in this country, as it has been elsewhere, which seeks to ensure that women have equal opportunities to men on campuses for promotion, in particular.  We know that Athena Swan has now gone beyond gender.  It is also looking at equality, diversity and inclusion programmes more broadly.  We knew even before Covid-19 that there were real problems with discrimination against women at third level.  Micheline Sheehy Skeffington, who brought a case against the National University of Ireland, Galway, highlighted inbuilt difficulties for women seeking promotion.  I again pay tribute to the Minister's predecessor, former Minister of State, Mary Mitchell O'Connor, who brought forward women-only professorships, somewhat controversially, although I defended her very strongly.  The evidence of the need for such professorships was so clear as was the provision of positive action measures at third level to address the inbuilt obstacles facing women in career progression.</p> <p> That brings me back to the point about Covid-19.  While gains have been made through those professorships and the Athena Swan programme, with Covid we have unfortunately seen a particularly detrimental impact on women academics whose research output - numerous studies have shown this - has suffered more than that of male colleagues.  Across all professions and careers, women have borne the disproportionate burden of home schooling to the detriment of career progression.  In any debate on third level and the updating of its governance models, let us focus on the need to ensure we have not rowed back on progress made in addressing gender inequality.  Figures on women in professorship positions at higher levels are still very skewed against them.  We have seen, very happily, a woman provost elected in Trinity College Dublin and women are now heading up other higher education institutions.  It is great to see that progress being made, but we are all very conscious that there is still a lot to be done to ensure we do not have gender inequality in third level.</p> <p> There are clearly other issues around diversity, especially in respect of economic disadvantage and class bias, which is something I have worked on in Trinity's law school scholarship programme.  We have got a very strong model with the Trinity access programme, as have other universities and colleges, in trying to address the problem of inbuilt lower levels of progression to third level from students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds.  That is something that has to be addressed.  I do not think any debate on third level governance should take place without reference to that.  There are some specific provisions in the Bill where more could be done on diversity.</p> <p> A debate is needed on third level governance.  As the Minister said, this legislation seeks to bring the statutory framework for the HEA up to date, given that the current legislation is 50 years old and has been in place since 1971.  We need to acknowledge that despite the need to update that legislation, the higher education sector has played a major role in the development of our society and country.  The contribution made by academics from all colleges and universities to civic engagement and public service has been immense.  We have seen that throughout the pandemic but also long before it.  For that reason, it is critical that this legislation must emphasise the principles of autonomy and academic freedom that have served us so well.  We need to be very clear that in bringing our statutory framework for higher education governance up to date we are not creating more problems, in particular by creating a one-size-fits-all model that is overly bureaucratic and treats all higher education institutions as alike when they are patently not.  It is very good and very positive that the differences are acknowledged in the legislation.</p> <p> The Minister referred to the different sectoral Acts.  The universities Act is very different from the legislation under the 2018 Act that set up what are now the technological universities.  Even within the university sector, Trinity College has a very unique governance structure that is acknowledged by the Minister and the legislation.  Concerns around preserving autonomy of institutions must be addressed and brought into the legislation.  There are very legitimate concerns among many of the higher education institutions, universities and colleges about a lack of regard for autonomy and difference and too much centralising of power with the Minister.  Consequently, that could have a detrimental effect on academic freedom and creativity and could see a stifling of the kind of creative endeavour that has brought so much value, not just monetary but social, to our country.  That is very important.</p> <p> There is much to welcome in the legislation.  Clearly, the greater emphasis on the role of apprenticeships, and the need to update and modernise governance structures for apprenticeships and training, is very important.  We would all acknowledge that, but it is also valid to speak of particular concerns.  I might go through a few specific ones.  I know we will speak more about them on Committee Stage.  Conradh na Gaeilge has raised concerns about an insufficient emphasis on the Irish language, which is one particular point.  While the provisions in sections 15 and 16 for the composition of the board of the HEA to be gender balanced are welcome, there is still a missed opportunity to create more provisions around recognition of diversity other than gender diversity.  For example, if only one board member has direct experience of conditions for students, that may not be sufficient to represent the experiences of perhaps the most important stakeholders in this sector.  That is crucial.</p> <p> We also need to ensure the legislation provides adequately for the views of academic staff, research staff and others to be heard.  Trade union representation is crucial too.  There is a frustration for many in the sector who feel they might be demoted to poorly defined stakeholders and that their concerns might not carry the same weight as others at the table whose voices are more clearly enshrined in the law.  Having due consideration to equality, diversity and inclusion should come through and underlie all the provisions in the legislation, especially those around board membership for the HEA.</p> <p> There are also issues around the tone of the legislation.</p> <p>Section 9 enshrines as a function of the HEA that it should provide value for money for funding provided to third level institutions.  There is concern among many of those in third level with regard to placing undue emphasis on monetary values of degrees and of outputs.  The word "output" has a terribly bureaucratic connotation.  It is often very hard to measure the output from universities or colleges in monetary terms.  Some of the most important discoveries by researchers in history were made as a result of what would have been seen as intrinsically less monetarily valuable projects.  Insulin, penicillin and Viagra are three products of immense value to Ireland's economy and the biopharmaceutical sector.  These products, as we know, were all discovered by accident, as was quinine, which many of us enjoy in an occasional gin and tonic.  There are lots of examples throughout history of products that were discovered as by-products of unrelated research and experimentation.  I refer to the pacemaker, artificial sweeteners, Velcro, the X-ray and Play-Doh, which are all examples of discoveries that were made often as a result of projects that were being funded for completely different purposes or that were not seen as fundable.  We need to be careful in this legislation that we are again giving due cognisance to the idea of creativity at academic level.</p> <p> President Michael D. Higgins has, given his background, spoken extensively about academic freedom  Last year, he delivered a particularly good speech at the Scholars at Risk conference on academic freedom and the value placed on education.  He stated: "Academic courses are now viewed as economic units whose success is too often judged in terms of arbitrary quantitative outputs of graduates, as opposed to the quality of the courses and the standards of academic excellence achieved by those participating in them."  He also wondered if, in future, tourists would tramp through universities and be told tales of where lectures were once given and of disputations, brilliant expositions encountered or books consulted, and if all of this would be consigned to history with the new model of more bureaucratic corporate language that many people see as underpinning this Bill.  In the explanatory memorandum, there is extensive reference to economic utility of universities and further and higher education institutions.  We need to be clear that we are also talking about much more intangible and less easily quantifiable benefits to our third level sector.</p> <p> The Labour Party had a successful programme in education under former Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach.  Nobody knows better than us how the provision of high-quality third level education can usher in economic prosperity.  It can raise the standard of living.  I remember Ruair&iacute; Quinn, as Minister for Education, speaking glowingly about the growth in numbers referenced by the Minister and the enormous benefit to society.  We can be so proud of the proportion of our population who now go on third level or further and higher education.  It is really outstanding in Europe.  We need to make more of that.  It is such a huge benefit to society that so many of our young people now have the opportunity to go to third level.  That is important.  It is beyond a monetary value.  To define education purely in economic terms places in peril courses which are not seen to attract foreign direct investment or which do not neatly fall into the provision of economic benefit to industries which might form our most lucrative exports.  Typically, courses in the arts and humanities are seen as less intrinsically or economically valuable in this way, and yet they have enormous benefit to us as a society.  It is important to emphasise that.</p> <p> I want to refer to general funding concerns.  Again, any debate about governance in higher education must take seriously the issue of funding.  The Labour Party welcomes increases in and changes to the SUSI grant scheme for undergraduate and postgraduate students, but we still are anxious to see more done.  We are conscious in particular of the extremely high, in many cases impossible, cost of accommodation for students.  It costs between &euro;7,000 and &euro;11,000 per annum for accommodation on campus for those lucky enough to get it in UCD and Trinity College.  These are exorbitant costs for students.  All of us have heard stories of students sharing unsuitable cramped spaces due to unaffordable rents and competing with paid professionals for scarce rental accommodation in cities.  Developments designated as so-called student accommodation are often still too costly.  Again, this is a crucial issue because this cost on top of the &euro;3,000 annual student contribution charge means students are paying very highly for their education.</p> <p> I have spoken with the Minister previously about the Cassells report and the need for the nettle to be finally grasped with regard to the big question of funding for third level.  The Cassells report is now nearly six years old.  The Labour Party has called for the key option of State funding to be adopted by the Government rather than either of the other two options set out.  The Minister said he is against the loan option, which is a welcome announcement.  I do not think anyone could argue in favour the loan option.  It is crucial that we move now to a situation where students do have access to free third level education.  We can be very proud of the numbers who go on to third level, but the high cost of accommodation and the &euro;3,000 charge clearly constitute a deeply off-putting deterrent for many.</p> <p> My final comment is in regard to an issue that has been very much topical in universities and third level, namely, the issue of non-disclosure agreements, NDAs.  My colleague, Senator Ruane, has conducted a survey on the prevalence of non-disclosure agreements and confidence agreements and her concern that they are being used to suppress the sharing of information about harassment and bullying across third level.  I have spoken with constituents in Dublin Bay South and with those I served when I was a Trinity Senator.  These people told me of their experience of non-disclosure agreement in different institutions.  I will not name any institution.  There is a concern that NDAs may protect those who have engaged in unacceptable behaviour.  I have submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister on how the HEA will address the practice relating to NDAs, as well as addressing concerns around incidents of bullying and harassment across third level.</p> <p> The Labour Party will support this legislation, but we have concerns about the tone of it and around the need to ensure adequate protection for autonomy of institutions and for academic freedoms within all third level institutions.  We believe these are critical points to be considered in our debates on the Bill.</p></speech>

I will be parochial in my comments and I make no apology for that.  My home town of Thurles has an ever-growing reputation as an academic centre.  There are four excellent second level schools in the town, two of the very few boarding girls' schools in the country, namely, Presentation Secondary School and Ursuline Secondary School, the Christian Brothers Secondary School, Thurles, where I was educated, and Col&aacute;iste Mhuire Co-Ed.  We have ever-expanding academic activities and, having achieved technological university status last year, Thurles has huge potential for an ever-growing academic centre.  I would like to make a few proposals to the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, as to how that potential can be advanced and exploited.</p>  <p>  Thurles town is a prime location for a second home economics teacher training course for this country.  Last summer, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, accepted my invitation to my home town, where he met senior Mary Immaculate College management, including the college's president, Professor Eugene Wall, and the head of St. Patrick's Campus, Dr. Finn &Oacute; Murch&uacute;.  There is a massive demand for home economics teachers in this country, with schools struggling to fill the posts and the need to train more teachers obvious.  Currently, the only four-year home economics teacher training course in the country is based in Sligo.  There is a clear opening for a second option in the southern part of the country.  We have an opportunity to establish Thurles as the educational hub for the midlands and mid-west.  We have the rail and road infrastructure and top-class post-primary education in our town.  We also have the national apprenticeship centre in Archerstown, training close to 300 apprentices at any one time.</p>  <p>  As stated, we have the two university campuses in the town, Mary Immaculate College and the Technological University of the Shannon.  Tipperary education and training board, ETB, and Mary Immaculate College Thurles have worked closely on this new course.  With the support of the Government, they believe they are in a position to offer home economics in Thurles in September 2023.  More important, this major benefit to higher education in the region will come with very little cost to the Exchequer.  Tipperary ETB can furnish the relevant resources such as the kitchens needed.</p> <p>Mary Immaculate College, in turn, is anxious that further education students can continue to access their teacher preparation programmes through the programme for access to higher education, PATH.  Mary Immaculate College in Thurles currently has 475 students at undergraduate level studying to be post-primary teachers in Gaeilge, mathematics, business, religion and accounting.  The addition of home economics would consolidate its position in the educational landscape and meet a clear need in our educational system.</p> <p> We have made great progress to date in securing a potential home economics teacher training course for Thurles, and indeed the entire region, since the Minister's initial meeting with the university management.  Now we need to find the political will and push to make this a reality from September 2023.  I am asking for this final political push to get this welcome boost to education in the southern region over the line.  Let us deliver a home economics teacher training course in Thurles for September 2023.</p> <p> As the Minister of State is well aware, one of Ireland's new technological universities has a campus based in Thurles.  The Technological University of the Shannon: Midlands Midwest, TUS, formerly the Limerick Institute of Technology, has ambitious and welcome plans for the development of a campus and for a future at the heart of education in Thurles.  Central to any and all development of our further and higher education institutions in Thurles must be the provision of purpose-built student accommodation.  There is massive demand in Thurles every August and September when students are rushing to secure accommodation for the coming academic year.  This is placing an even greater strain on the private rental market in the town.  Thurles needs purpose-built student accommodation to meet the demand of the rising numbers of students who now see the town as an attractive location to further their education.  Whether it is the apprentice in the national apprentice centre in Archerstown, students availing of further education through the education and training board, ETB, or students in higher education in Mary Immaculate College or TUS, education in Thurles is going from strength to strength.  We desperately need the student accommodation to match.</p> <p> Tipperary ETB and TUS intend to further enhance the co-operation between the two educational institutes in Thurles town.  This is an important step as it will provide a clear pathway for students who wish to continue from further education into higher education, which I know is a priority for the Department.  As such, I am asking for a commitment from the Minister of State that his Department will engage further with Tipperary ETB and TUS to ensure people in Tipperary and the larger region can avail of these pathways from further to higher education.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in is in support of this legislation.  Nobody would be against good governance, particularly in higher education.  There are obviously issues of accessibility and Deputy Conway-Walsh has already spoken about some of the proposals that were made by Sinn F&eacute;in during pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, particularly relating to the cross-Border aspects.  As much as we welcome the increase in board sizes and so on, there is still a need to deal with the issue of trained union representation.</p>  <p>  I do not think it will come as a shock that I am going to raise the issue of Dundalk Institute of Technology, DkIT.  A significant proportion of the Deputies who spoke previously in this debate have welcomed the moves that have been made on the status of technical universities in the south east, TUS and the Atlantic Technological University.  DkIT is, unfortunately, not in that bracket.  We are, unfortunately, now at a stage where there is an impact on people who are making determinations about whether to go to DkIT.  People looking at their CAO forms can see they can apply to a technical university.  It is the case that a rose by another name will not work.  There is a need for the benefits that come from technical university status but beyond that, even at its simplest, DkIT is now hurting because it has not been made a technical university.</p>  <p>  I know that DkIT was slow to the dance.  I think the Minister has used that terminology.  The difficulty is that even if a conversation were to begin with some of these technical university consortia, it would take a considerable amount of time before they are willing or able to operate a section 38 to allow DkIT in.  The difficulty with that is there might be a significant number of decisions to be made which might not suit Dundalk in their outworking.  That is something that needs to be done.</p>  <p>  A considerable amount of work is being done in DkIT, which is a vital entity.  I know the Minister spoke about visiting DkIT in January.  He said he would deal with the Oireachtas Members for the area.  That is an absolute necessity and I will be following up on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.551" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1560" speakername="Gary Gannon" time="17:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700055#FFF00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for bringing forward this Bill which seeks to modernise our higher education sector and brings significant changes to the governance of higher education.  This must be balanced with autonomy and, critically, sustained funding of our higher education institutions, which I intend to address later.  I will begin by speaking about other aspects the Bill makes reference to, including educational access for those who historically have been under-represented in higher education.  The Bill uses the term &quot;priority groups&quot; and states that:</p> <blockquote> 	&quot;priority groups&quot;, in relation to students in higher education or, as may be appropriate, persons who are seeking to become students in higher education, includes persons who are economically or socially disadvantaged, persons who have a disability or persons from sections of society that are under-represented in the student body in higher education. </blockquote>  <p>Previously, the language proposed in the Bill referred to disadvantaged learners, persons or groups but that was changed following a recommendation from the joint committee, highlighting the need for consistency and clear definitions.  I am not opposing this change in language use but I do not believe that disadvantage is of itself a dirty word.  I was a student who slotted into that term and I have studied alongside, worked with and, hopefully, represented many other students who also fall within the scope of disadvantage.  However, and this is crucial, students are not disadvantaged but rather they are placed at a disadvantage by the system.  Students from certain circumstances are not under-represented because of a lack of interest or ability but because the systems which grant access to further and higher education are not as open to them as to others.  Students who have made it to higher education from these groups are resilient, have ambition and display leadership in their communities and families.  It should be our number one priority to ensure there is a critical mass of students, not just a few, who succeed from what are now being termed &quot;priority groups&quot; and enter into higher education if that is what they choose to do.</p><p>If we choose to call students with disabilities, students who come from poorer areas and other students who are under-represented in higher education &quot;priority groups&quot;, we need to prioritise their entry and progression through higher education.  We also need to prioritise the resources in higher education as well as looking at the system of education prior to higher education and have access work that starts in primary schools or earlier.  Otherwise we are just sanitising language and making it more palatable for ourselves rather than for those we seek to represent in this change of wording.  These groups of students or potential students will know if they are being prioritised.  No matter how many times they are referenced in the Bill, only they will be able to attest to whether the terminology in the Bill is achieved in reality.</p><p>The Bill should enhance the voice of students and in that regard, it could go further.  While I welcome the fact that all college boards will have student representation, two student representatives on a board of 17 is not sufficient, especially when considering the different cohorts of students, including undergraduates, postgraduates, international students, mature students, part-time students and the students we are now to refer to as &quot;priority groups&quot;.  We know that college can be a vastly experience for different student cohorts.  If we look at one particularly hard example, sexual assault and harassment affect every campus but it is disproportionately certain student cohorts who are assaulted and harassed.  The findings of survey conducted by the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, and the National University of Ireland Galway in 2020, which had over 6,00 responses from 21 third level campuses in Ireland, were harrowing.  They included that 29% of females and 28% of non-binary students reported non-consensual penetration by incapacitation, force or threat of force during their time in college.  Over half the students with a disability, 56%, reported an experience of sexual misconduct by any tactic.</p><p>Only today, the findings of the national survey of student and staff experiences of sexual violence and sexual harassment in higher education were released.  They, too, were harrowing.  Over 1,100 female students reported non-consensual vaginal penetration by incapacitation, coercion, force or threat of force during their time in college.</p> <p>Less than half, that is, 45% of students, said it was likely that the HEI would take action to address factors that may have led to sexual violence and-or harassment, and 27% said it was likely that their HEI would have a hard time supporting the person who made the report.<br/><br/>We need to change the culture in our colleges and for that, it is essential that all students have a voice that can be heard at all levels of the HEIs.  A tokenistic seat or two at the table will not be enough to ensure that our campuses make the changes necessary that are safe and responsive to the needs of students from diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>Trinity College Dublin, TCD, for example, has four student representatives on its board as it stands.  The Bill cut its existing student representation in half.  Instead of such a threat, the Bill could follow the positive example of TCD and seek to increase student representation to four or above across the board.  As the president of TCD student union and my cousin, Leah Kehoe, put it, if there are no students, there will be no college and no board to govern it.<br/><br/>I would also urge caution on external representations.  There could be some recommendation of what type of organisations would have particular value to reduce the risk of external representation being only businesses or those from corporate governance backgrounds.  I also believe that there should be a stronger and clearer commitment to engage with students.  Section 44(1) on national student engagement states: &quot;An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s shall, from time to time, at a national level, engage with and seek views from representatives of students (including representatives of students in priority groups).&quot;If this Bill is going to modernise HEIs and set practice, we can do better than &quot;from time to time&quot; being enshrined in the Bill in laying the foundation of student engagement.<br/><br/>There is a great phrase contained in the Bill, which is to &quot;promote, support and fund excellent research in the higher education system across all disciplines ...&quot;  I very much welcome that.  The Bill, however, misses out in terms of mentioning who those people are who support, contribute and conduct the excellent research.<br/><br/>Postgraduate and PhD students are faced with extremely low pay, and precarious working conditions in higher education are, by nature, omitted from the Bill.  This issue is also stifling diversity within research.  We need to diversify in order to be  excellent.<br/><br/>In 2013, the Irish Research Council's, IRC, PhD scholarship annual stipend was &euro;16,000.  Rent in Dublin at that time was &euro;1,050 per month - difficult but manageable in the extreme.  Last year brought the first increase to the IRC's PhD scholarship in many years to the sum of &euro;18,050 per annum.  It is still wholly inadequate for the cost of living, particularly when one considers the average rent in the capital will set a person back &euro;2,030.  It is little wonder that HEA data looking at the socio-economic profile of students found that the PhD cohort in 2018-19 was the most affluent cohort among all types of enrolment.  This seems to happen by necessity, not by fate.  A person would need to be extremely wealthy to engage in a PhD at this time.<br/><br/>This is not to detail the issue with short-term contracts or staff paid by the hour who do not have access to sick leave or maternity leave.  We cannot fund and expect excellent research if we do not recognise that behind the research are human beings with rights and basic needs that must be met.  I am very conscious of how we diversify those who have access to the highest level of education in our society.  We have made some significant strides in increasing the numbers of those who get to go on to university at third level but when it comes to master's degree and PhD students, we still have a way to go.  It now seems that master's degrees and, in particular, PhDs have become the exclusive reserve of those who afford them.  That needs to be challenged.  Who gets to set exactly what research is in this country?  It cannot only be one particular cohort of students.  We will miss out on the excellence and diversity required to set credible parameters of research moving forward.  We cannot fund and expect excellent research if we do not recognise that it is human beings behind the research, who have basic rights and needs.  We also cannot continue to only be concerned by access and equality at the point of entry into higher and further education and ignore it at a postgraduate level and above.  This is also something we ignore at Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, and Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, levels of progression.<br/><br/>I will give the Minister of State a particular example.  Earlier this year, a constituent got in touch with me.  She had ambitions of becoming a nurse.  When she did not get the points, she decided to do a QQI level 5 course in nursing and did very well in it, achieving top results.  When she started to try to apply for entry into a degree, however, she found out how unlikely she was to get a place because of the few places dedicated to entry from QQI routes in nursing.<br/><br/>Research conducted by my office last year found there were between 1,168 and 1,296 places, depending on level of interest, for level 5 nursing studies run by 27 organisations, yet there were only 152 places among 13 colleges and universities that were offering entry into degrees from these courses from QQI level 5.  That is a failure of our system.  We are telling young people there are alternative entries into courses, particularly a course such as nursing that attracts people from a wealth of different backgrounds who view it as a vocation.  They want to enter it through FETAC and colleges of further education.  There are a multitude of great institutions but the entry routes into third level do not exist.  We are missing out on a large cohort of people who would be fantastic in that chosen profession by limiting access to third-level degrees.  That constituent is no closer to becoming a nurse almost two years on and in truth, as she conveyed to us, it feels to her that she may have wasted a year and a lot of money along the way.  There is a huge wealth of alternative entry routes.  The previous speaker mentioned some of them, including Trinity Access Programmes and Liberties College.  I specifically know a few more in Dublin, for example, Technological University Dublin, formerly Dublin Institute of Technology,  DIT.  They have great access programmes.  We need to look what they have done to foster the model and bring it into a wider national context.<br/><br/>Of course, part of the issue with access to further and higher education lies in the unfairness of the leaving certificate.  I fully accept that this Bill cannot factor in the idea of the leaving certificate but it often operates as the entry examination into universities.  I do not, therefore, think we can omit talking about it.  The Minister of State has no control over that system but the admission method for most courses into HEIs facilitated by the CEO and points system reinforces the inequity of the leaving certificate.<br/><br/>Admission routes and entry into all levels of study need to be examined and most HEIs have done fantastic work here on an individual basis.  If their learnings could be captured and replicated, it could be transformative.  We need to hold ambition, however, and not safeguard the old ways for the sake of tradition.  We are having an interesting conversation about the type of leaving certificate this year's cohort will sit.  We need to talk about how we can transform that across the board and see it on a spectrum of not only the leaving certificate but entry routes into college as a whole to see if this current system is suitable for the purposes intended.  I do not believe we should design a model now with that in mind if we are to start from scratch.<br/><br/>I welcome sections 37 and 42, which deal with funding frameworks.  They allow the HEA to set criteria for funding frameworks and a mechanism for withholding funding if those criteria have not been met.  With this, however, there needs to be a promise that HEIs are funded adequately in order that they can address issues such as the mental health and well-being of their students.<br/><br/>There are two references to value for money in the Bill, that is, value for money in public expenditure allocated to funding bodies in higher education under sections 8(1) and 9(1).  Here, we need to be careful.  Marketisation has dominated the higher education landscape for too long and the underfunding of the sector has been well documented and widely accepted, whish was particularly highlighted in the 2016 Cassells report.  I will quote part of the executive summary by Mr. Peter Cassells:</p><blockquote>	We have the opportunity to set out a new level of ambition for the system and restore it as key enabler of our future development.  As a country, we need to be willing to make bold decisions that will ultimately pay dividends for all of us - families, businesses, taxpayers, society. </blockquote> <p>The ambition of the Bill should be that it pays out dividends for all of us and does not become a stringent value for money exercise.  We need to be cognisant of the language we use and the context of underinvestment the sector has had to stomach for years when discussions continue about the funding model of higher education in the State.  There is a fear that the Bill will only give power in one direction.  The HEIs may be faced with the naughty step or punitive measures from the Minister of State or HEA but by taking on this work to modernise higher education, the Minister of State and HEA are taking responsibility to ensure stainable funding models are provided for higher education.  We await and welcome that.  Above all, the Bill should seek to ensure our investment in and value of education because we see the inherent value of education at all times and for all people.  I thank both the Minister and Minister of State for bring the Bill to the House.  We will support it and we believe we can radicalise the matter of higher education in this country.</p></speech>

There have been a number of references to the 1971 Act.  We will all agree it is long overdue and in need of an overhaul.  It demonstrates the value of having a senior ministry devoted to the area of higher education and research to bring that focus and energy to the issue.</p>  <p>  It is comprehensive in its scope, modern in its approach to governance and inclusive with regard to the student voice.</p> <p>It rightly emphasises access for all and diversity and it takes a broad view in its definition of education and its place in today's world.  This Bill has at its core the idea that education is a public good, that universities are primarily public institutions operating with major investment of public money.  To that end, we have a duty as a Government and as an Oireachtas to oversee that expenditure in the public interest.  I agree with some of the points raised by Deputy Gannon around marketisation and how that is not a road we want to travel.  We have to ensure, however, that the co-governance model contained in the Bill does not mean that this oversight will come at the expense of the autonomy of individual institutions, as has been referred to by a number of Deputies.  We need to make sure that it strikes the right balance between the relative roles of the Minister, the HEA and the institutions themselves.  While aware of the contribution of education to national competitiveness and keeping pace with technological advantages, this Bill is clear that education is for individual discovery, for the good of wider society and not simply, as some would have it, as subservient to the needs of the market.<br/><br/>C&eacute; go bhf&aacute;ilt&iacute;m go bhfuil an Ghaeilge luaite sa Bhille, n&iacute; leor &eacute; nach luaitear ach uair amh&aacute;in &iacute; agus sna cusp&oacute;ir&iacute; idir l&uacute;ib&iacute;n&iacute; in aice na tagartha do chult&uacute;r.

T&aacute; m&eacute; ag s&uacute;il go mbeidh an tAire St&aacute;it s&aacute;sta breathn&uacute; ar leasuithe i dtaobh na laig&iacute; sin ar Ch&eacute;im an Choiste.<br/><br/>Refreshingly, the legislation places teaching, learning and research on an equal footing and it does not make the mistake of artificial distinctions in this regard.  Teaching, learning and research intersect, overlap and enhance one another.  There can be an artificial distinction between knowledge creation and knowledge dissemination, that is to say between research and teaching.  We need to afford our higher education professionals the space to be able to do both of those things effectively.  Our universities must be places where knowledge and ideas are generated and where knowledge and ideas are shared.  That balance is important.  If we go too far down the road of publish or perish, teaching will suffer.  If the teaching workload is too high, research will suffer.<br/><br/>The importance of the voice of the student is represented in this legislation, but there is scope to strengthen that further.  The ongoing review of an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s is explicit on the need for data around inclusion.  That is a welcome provision.  I note that the board of an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s will have at least one student or student representative and governing bodies are to have at least two student representatives.  I would say that this the very minimum required in order for students to always have a seat at the table. <br/><br/>Part IV makes specific provision for engagement with students, including formal engagement and training.  This, along with the student survey every two years, are positive developments.  There are, however, some elements that might diminish the chance of the student voice being heard in a meaningful way at these governing board meetings.  First there is the issue of tenure.  Non-student board members can serve for up to eight years, while we can expect that students will serve for a year and no longer.  There is a skills issue here.  It can take time to learn not just the ropes of how a board operates, but also how to navigate the personalities on any given board.  I acknowledge that there is an effort to provide for this upskilling, but I also have a nagging worry that a board could just wait a student out.  They could frustrate and delay change until a student&rsquo;s tenure lapses.  I wonder if we can address this going forward.  The Minister might say that this is taken care of in section 43(3), where each institution must report on the issues raised by students and how they were addressed, via the annual report or through another method.  Again, here in reality, we have no guarantee that what is published in that report will have been agreed to by what will be a student minority on the board.  Perhaps the Minister might consider stating that this annual report has to be explicitly and demonstrably approved by the student cohort on the board.  That would help strengthen that student voice.  <br/><br/>I warmly welcome the definition in section 108 of academic freedom.  The European University Association ranked the autonomy of universities.  Ireland´s highest placing in this research was third for academic autonomy.  This is a prized position and we need to continue to value that and to try to improve it again.  This recalls Edward Said's definition of a public intellectual as someone who not just displays freedom of thought, but who is brave enough to say this loud and clear for all of us to hear.  He states: </p><blockquote>	At bottom, the intellectual, in my sense of the word, is neither a pacifier nor a consensus-builder, but someone whose whole being is staked on a critical sense, a sense of being unwilling to accept easy formulas, or ready-made clich&eacute;s, or the smooth, ever-so-accommodating confirmations of what the powerful or conventional have to say, and what they do.  Not just passively unwillingly, but actively willing to say so in public. </blockquote> <p>We need our academics who are ready to criticise us when we put a foot wrong.  We need our students to keep agitating and to keep us uncomfortable.  We need academic staff to be both free and, in some sense, duty-bound to help steer us on the right path, as well as being wary of easy acceptance or false consensus.  We have learned to value experts over the last two years in managing Covid-19.  We should do that in other areas.  Climate jumps out to me as an obvious example.  We need our universities to feel that their institutions are of us and for all of us.  This legislation goes a good distance towards achieving that goal.  </p></speech>

Unfortunately, this Bill is a missed opportunity to take the necessary action.  It is welcome that this legislation will revoke the existing Higher Education Authority Act 1971, which is now over 50 years old.  The legislation is an opportunity to reform the law in this area and to include progressive policies within the objectives of the Higher Education Authority and individual higher education institutes.  The Bill contains positive elements but leaves room for improvement.  The positives of this Bill include student representation on the board of the HEA and structured student engagement and provisions for lifelong and flexible learning.  The introduction of equality statements and gender-balanced measures on governing bodies is also to be welcomed.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, there are more negatives than positives and the legislation is overly prescriptive on governance structures.  It reduces the representative nature of governance structures.  It provides for selective exemptions for Trinity College Dublin only.  Other institutes must also have room for exemptions.  The law does not provide for trade union representation on boards.  It does not explicitly commit to protecting the public ownership of higher education.  Improvements were made to the Bill during prelegislative scrutiny, when a number of Sinn F&eacute;in recommendations were taken on board.  These include the specific reference to the HEA having a role in the promotion of the Irish language, but this needs to be strengthened.</p>  <p>  The HEA role in promoting cross-Border co-operation in higher education is to be welcomed.  The legislation addresses some governance concerns in higher education, but this is not the main problem facing the sector.  Legislative reform will be of limited value unless it is accompanied by a sustainable funding model.  We urge the Minister to publish the economic evaluation of the Cassells report and to bring forward a plan for taking higher education out of austerity mode.  The Bill provides a clear pathway for private colleges to become designated higher education institutes and to be potentially funded in the same manner as public colleges.  The HEA should be given an explicit mandate to protect the public nature of third level education.  We have seen too much privatisation and pandering to private interests.  The public good must be prioritised.  </p></speech>

Therefore, insofar as the Bill states as its objective a desire to improve the quality of further and higher education, one could not quibble much with its aspirations.</p> <p>It aims to do the following: promote the interests of students; advance equality, diversity and inclusion; achieve excellence in teaching, learning, etc.; and maximise the contributions of higher education to social, economic, cultural, Irish language and environmental development and sustainability.  Those are all very worthy aspirations but I am not sure how the Bill achieves any of those things.  I just do not see the connection between the aspirations that are set out in the Bill's own description of itself and what the Bill actually does.</p> <p> I am somewhat baffled as to what this Bill sets out to achieve.  We have another new acronym now with the introduction of designated institutions of higher education, DIHEs.  I do not see, for example, how reducing the governance bodies or boards of universities and these designated institutions from 40 to 17 improves things.  I do not really understand that.  I was just chatting to a student union representative about this.  Currently, on those boards of 40 there are about four students, between four and six trade union representatives, some councillors and other appointees.  With this new board of 17, there will be fewer students and there may not be any trade union representatives.  There will certainly be fewer of them and there will be more ministerial appointees and appointees that the body itself selects based on expertise.  I am not saying these boards function brilliantly at the moment but I do not see what this reduction achieves.</p> <p> This new Higher Education Authority, an t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s um Ard-Oideachas, is to have 12 board members.  If I understand it correctly, that board must be gender balanced, which is good.  It has to respect diversity and so on and it has to have one student representative, but these are all appointees.  Again, I just do not see how this guarantees any of the reforms or aspirations the Bill sets out.  There are no radical departures in the Bill to address the problems in further and higher education.  I just do not see it.  In fact, I am a little worried about this matter because these are all external appointees and I wonder who they will be.</p> <p> One of the biggest problems with further and higher education is its corporatisation and corporate takeover over recent years.  Due to the underfunding of further and higher education over many decades, higher and further education institutes, universities, colleges and so on have been pushed towards trying to get more and more sponsorship from the private sector and from business.  It appals me, as someone who was in UCD, that there are monuments to Tony O'Reilly and all sorts of other people up there.  There is probably a Denis O'Brien building somewhere, or will be soon if there is not already.  That horrifies me, quite honestly.  The idea that our universities, colleges and higher education institutes will have to depend on the patronage of billionaires and the super-wealthy to get buildings and fund courses and research worries me deeply.</p> <p> There are many statistics about the mental health problems experienced by first year students.  For example, NUIG did a survey about the extraordinarily high number of students who are suffering with mental health issues, as well as the high level of dropouts and so on.  I did not see that when I was in college.  I can see the difference when I go up to UCD, which happens to be where I went.  The whole place has become almost terrifying because it looks so corporate.  The pressure on students is exponentially greater than it was when I was there.  It has become much more dehumanised and based on everything I hear from students and students' unions, that is where it is at.</p> <p> Lots of students feel incredible stress and pressure, including financial pressures.  They face huge problems sourcing affordable accommodation as the accommodation built on campus is incredibly expensive.  Colleges have a massive overreliance on non-EU students.  I do not have any problems with non-EU students but they have to pay full fees and that is a big problem for many of them.  Colleges want to get people who pay full fees because they are not getting enough of a subsidy from central government to fund further and higher level education.</p> <p> There have been some improvements but one of the most terrible facts, which we discussed as part of our motion on open access to further and higher education last March, is that 99% of people from Dublin 6 go to university and college whereas the figure for predominantly working class areas is about 15%.  That is a shameful fact about the inequity that exists in access to universities and further and higher education.  I know it has improved somewhat but we have a long way to go in terms of unequal access.  Those pressures carry on once people get into college or university because of the extraordinary difficulty in getting accommodation if they need it and the extortionate rents.  People who have to work their way through college could work all the hours God sent and they still would not be able to pay some of the rents being charged in on-campus accommodation, never mind all the private student accommodation that is being built by investment funds charging &euro;1,000 a month.  How are these students supposed to study when they are working like a dog to pay these rents, if they can even manage to pay them?  Many just cannot do it.</p> <p> Student poverty and mental health issues are rampant.  I have highlighted this again and again.  It is very relevant in the week we are in with the scandal in south Kerry but it is part of a wider problem of chronically deficient mental health services for young people, whether they are adolescents or young adults, and many of them are students.  I have highlighted this huge irony, prompted by some of the people who are studying subjects in areas such as psychology, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy, where there is a chronic shortage.  The T&aacute;naiste said again today that there is great difficulty in recruiting people to fill these posts.  The irony is that we need counselling services but we make it virtually impossible, or extraordinarily difficult, for the people who actually want to fill those posts, study those subjects and do those jobs in psychology, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and so on to qualify.  That is because of the extortionate postgraduate fees and the lack of funding for many of those doctorate courses in psychology.</p> <p> As I pointed out, there is no funding whatsoever for doctorates in counselling and education psychology, which is precisely the sort of thing we need in our schools and colleges to help our young people.  There is no funding whatsoever.  I talked to some young people trying to get qualified in psychology and they said they are in a dire situation.  They are landed with these fees and are trying to work at the same time while also being on placement and trying to study.</p> <p>We are putting every barrier we possibly can in the way of them getting qualified, when there is a desperate need for these people to deal with the waiting lists for child and adolescent mental health services.</p> <p> That is a slight tangent.  The point is that our further and higher education institutions should be helping us solve these problems, but we are making it very difficult for people to get into these institutions and then do the things they want to do when they are there.  We need radical change in that regard.  It is because the institutions are not funded properly that they are increasingly being pushed towards trying to become more like corporate outfits and raising their own money, which means a rise in or over-reliance on fees or extortionately expensive accommodation.</p> <p> I apologise for going on about counselling services, but I spoke to a student representative today about them.  I know that this Bill has a governance framework for accountability around expenditure in terms of central government funding and provides that there should be accountability.  However, what does that mean when in UCD, for example, there are some internal counselling services, but the number of people outsourced to private external counselling services has shot up twentyfold in recent years?  This Bill does not say anything about stopping that.  The college will probably say it is cheaper to outsource.  I doubt that is the case, but that is often what is said, probably because the college does not want direct employees.  It does not want the hassle of having to employ people and have obligations towards them. Therefore, it outsources the counselling services to the detriment of the students.</p> <p> Many of the academic staff, including postgraduate students who are doing master's degrees, PhDs and so on, are on crappy hourly contracts and part-time hours.  Approximately 50% of academic staff are in precarious working conditions.  What will this Bill do to address that?  We very much need to increase the capacity of our third level institutions to meet the demands and aspirations of young people coming out of school who want to progress their education in the things they want to do.  It is very hard for them to do those things because of the stupid, unnecessary and anachronistic leaving certificate system.  Even if people get in, we do not have half enough places to meet the demand for what they want to do.  When I told the T&aacute;naiste that we should have open access, he said we do not have the staff or the capacity, but of course we do because we have all these academic staff on precarious part-time contracts who would love permanent jobs working in our educational institutions.  However, we do not want to force the universities and colleges to employ more people and increase that capacity by giving them proper jobs and job security.</p> <p> I do not see what this Bill does to change any of that.  Those are the big issues.  I listened to the Minister of State earlier on and I read through the stuff, but I do not see what this Bill achieves.  I would like to see it being much more specific and tied down in terms of the objective to ensure absolutely open access for everybody to the further and higher education of their choice.  It would be far better for the students, for the staff, for our society and ultimately for the economy, although I hate reducing education down to the economy, if people were able to access the higher education they want.  If resources were put into making sure a state-of-the-art education is provided, if all the financial and other barriers to people doing what they want to do were removed and if we resourced our further and higher education institutions to support students in providing that kind of education, it would be better for the students, the staff and our society.  I do not see precisely where this Bill will help achieve that.</p> <p> I do not have much more to say.  Maybe the Government spokespeople will respond by saying that I am completely wrong, that it is all in the Bill, that this will revolutionise further and higher education and that it will achieve all of these things, but I do not see where the Bill provides for that.  There is nothing particularly objectionable in the Bill, but I do not see what in the Bill will change things.  I am specifically concerned by the reduction in the numbers and the changes in the make-up of the governance bodies of our colleges and universities.  I would like to hear the argument for how this Bill will make things better in that regard.  The alternative in terms of governance would involve the students and the academic and non-academic staff, rather than appointees and overly paid executives and administrators, being the dominant group in the governance of these institutions.  It would be best if democratically elected representatives of the students and the academic and non-academic staff, including the porters, the caterers and everybody else who works in these institutions, elected the majority.  Of course experts in finance and others will be needed, but the dominant force in running our institutions of education should be the people who study in them, the academic staff who deliver the education and the other workers who make these institutions function.  That is what I would like to see.  It would be a real revolution in the governance of our further and higher education institutions.  All of that will be no more than the moving around of deckchairs unless we put in the resources to ensure we have open access to further and higher education and all of the financial and other barriers to people realising their full creative and intellectual potential are removed.  At present, those multiple barriers fundamentally distort and damage the ability of our higher and further education institutions to do the job they should be doing, which is now more important than ever when one looks at the skills shortages we have in so many areas.  It makes absolutely no sense that we allow those barriers to persist.  We need to overhaul radically our approach to further and higher education.</p></speech>

This important Bill will bring about important changes to the delivery of higher education.  It will help to modernise our higher education system by bringing it into the 21st century and, in turn, allowing it to meet the demands of our society.</p>  <p>  It is relevant in this debate to consider where we have come from with regard to higher education and access to higher education.  At the time of the introduction of the HEA, Ireland had 20,000 students in higher education.  Today, we have more than 200,000.  This remarkable growth has helped to unlock the talent and potential of millions of people over the years.</p> <p>Our success in expanding the accessibility to higher education in Ireland has contributed to building our economy, attracting foreign investment, providing new possibilities for our people and sending a message to everyone on this island that should you have the drive and passion, opportunities will be presented in this country.  Such an increase in this sector demands reform and in such a scenario, it is important that legislation keeps pace with the real-world implications facing the higher education sector and, indeed, students in Ireland.</p> <p> As our society changes, so do the demands within our society.  A thriving higher education sector allows for the sector to deliver people with the skills that this country requires so that we can continue to grow, both as a people and as an economy.  I am, therefore, pleased that a long overdue review of how we as a country approach higher education is now under way, and credit must be given to the Ministers for driving this agenda.</p> <p> A key component of that change is with regard to apprenticeships.  For too long and to our detriment as a country, a stigma has been attached to those engaging with apprenticeships or alternative routes in higher education.  This has limited our progress and limited the choice of people emerging from our schools or seeking to retrain.  Indeed, we only have to look toward our partners in the EU to recognise the lost opportunity resulting from us too long ignoring the role of apprenticeships.  Germany, for example, has a long history of successful apprenticeship programmes and, indeed, many business leaders in Germany have come through such programmes.</p> <p> By engaging with and developing this area of higher education in Ireland, we can harness a yet untapped skill set in our economy which, in turn, will contribute to the development of well-paid jobs and help the nation reach our goals, including but not limited to retrofitting, which will help tackle our carbon emissions and help in efforts to deliver on the construction of badly-needed homes across Ireland.  To that end, and to be a little parochial about it, I represent the fastest growing community in the country yet, while Fingal has TU Dublin Blanchardstown and DCU south of the airport, when it comes to further education and training facilities we are the poor cousins of the south side of the city.  That is why Swords would be an eminently sensible location for such a facility, with expected growth to 100,000 people by the mid-2030s.  I encourage the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins, as I have in the past at the committee, to conduct research into the demands of north Dublin versus the offering currently available.</p> <p> A vital component of this Bill will be significant and momentous change to the governance of higher education institutions.  This Bill will put the Higher Education Authority, HEA, on a regulator footing, allowing it the powers and authority to seek information, distribute funding and respond when such funding is misused.  This is a major and important change to the current system in which the higher education system operates.</p> <p> When funding is provided, the HEA will issue conditions of funding which must be complied with for the receipt of those public funds.  Here, again, we can see a significant change to the system.</p> <p> The reform of the structures for the governing authorities will ensure that boards are competency-based and smaller in size.  By doing so, we will move away from the archaic and non-transparent approaches that have been used too long within our higher education institutes and in the process, make them fairer and more equitable.</p> <p> The result of these changes will put students at the centre of the higher education system, more so than ever before.  This will provide higher quality in our education sector, providing necessary accountability, delivering excellence in teaching, providing for the skill demands of our society and increase diversity, equality and inclusion.  Putting students at the heart of our higher education system will, I believe, result in better education and options for students in Ireland and this, in turn, will benefit our country as a whole.</p> <p> The contents of this Bill will also increase our international reputation within higher education institutions.  We in Ireland have been rightly proud for our ability to attract an increasing number of international students to our institutions and this Bill will only serve to enhance our reputation abroad by bringing new talent to our shores, both through the student body and academic professionals and administrators.  Such changes in a society can unlock new areas of life for our people, giving us the freedom to find the right fit that can lead to the ideas and creativity that ricochets across our society from the cultural to the economic.  We can only benefit from such developments driving our society forward with greater inclusion and participation by allowing everyone to engage in the country around them with new ideas which I hope will lead to them flourishing as students.</p> <p> It is also noteworthy in the context of this debate to highlight the important changes that will occur with regard to Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI.  The Minister has been passionate about delivering reform in SUSI since taking office.  Indeed, in budget 2022, we saw significant increases in student supports, some of which have not seen an increase in many years.  By expanding the accessibility of SUSI, we encourage yet more people to pursue their ambitions and passion within the higher education sector.</p> <p> The Bill sets out a roadmap for the future of higher education and, I believe, marks the most fundamental changes of governance in our institutions in a generation.  It will be looked back on in time as a positive and ambitious step forward in our efforts to deliver a broad, high quality, accessible and inclusive education system that provides options and choices for individuals to find their path or, indeed, their passion.</p> <p> As a member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education, I look forward to working with the Ministers in the passage of this Bill but also to achieving our collective goals of making the Irish education system as robust and as transparent as possible.</p></speech>

It is past time that we saw positive developments such as this for my county.</p>  <p>  Now that such changes and reforms are being made, the Bill is of extreme importance.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that all colleges should be given a greater degree of flexibility in terms of governance structures so long as necessary criteria, in terms of functioning and accountability, are met.  I believe this to be of particular importance to the Technological University of the Shannon, given the large geographical area it covers.</p>  <p>  Since Monday, 22 January, the Technological University of the Shannon started inviting expressions of interest from external candidates to join its governing body.  Given the fact that the development of the Technological University of the Shannon, TUS, will prove to be so transformative for the regions concerned, it is crucial that there is adequate representation from all sides involved in university life.</p>  <p>  The 2018 legislation to establish technological universities allowed for board membership of up to 22 or 26, depending on the number of institutes of technology that merge.  I question why limiting this to 17 is seen as appropriate, given the geographic breadth of what we are talking about here.  Given the broadness geographically and institutionally of the TUS and the potentials that are involved, there needs to be flexibility in terms of the level of representation allowed for universities of this status.</p>  <p>  This Bill also contains mention of promoting a student-focused system.  While I welcome that, it appears that the proposed reform to governing bodies could result in students having less representation on governing bodies.  I would appreciate any clarity the Minister of State could provide on these concerns.</p>  <p>  The world and, indeed, this country is changing rapidly these days.  Progress is speeding up.  This is the case in terms of technological advances, and it is equally the case for issues of personal development, equality and matters of tolerance and inclusivity.  This rapid level of progression must be factored in when we are discussing the issue of representation on boards of institutions.</p>  <p>  I welcome many aspects of this Bill, including student representation on the board of the HEA.  This is where the importance of adequate and broad representation cannot be over emphasised.</p>  <p>  While I also welcome the fact that improvements have been made in some areas during pre-legislative scrutiny, such as the inclusion of a specific role from the HEA in promoting cross-Border co-operation in higher education, Sinn F&eacute;in would still like to see a specific role in promoting cross-Border student enrolment.</p>  <p>  I also recognise the establishment of the National Apprenticeship Office, but we need certainty that this is not used as an opportunity to dismantle the craft apprenticeship model.</p>  <p>  Finally, I want to bring attention to how some people are not qualifying for supports to continue in their education.  People need to be supported and encouraged in their ambition to improve the prospects of their families, not told to give up their education to avail of supports.</p></speech>

You might ask why would I be proud of that.  I did it because I was an automatic member as the Lord Mayor.  It is a terrible way of governance of any institution to have automatic members and I welcome the Bill because it reforms that system.</p>  <p>  I have been asked to put on the record of the House the concerns of some institutions that the Bill could create a transfer window.  Where we end the governing bodies all at the same time, there will be significant competition in the sector by different institutions to fill all of the places.</p> <p>We could consider allowing the current governing bodies to serve out their terms and, in an ordinary way over time, those new structures would be taken up.  The Bill will also remove many councillors from governance structures here, which is important because that kind of system is not fit for purpose but there should be an alternative structure that allows councillors to have a role and input into how these governing bodies operate.</p> <p> I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his discretion.</p></speech>

Day care services at the Abbeyleix community nursing unit, which were attended more than 100 people, have been closed.  The hospital has ceased services to allow for its refurbishment and day care services were being housed in a part of the hospital that was being used for storage, but I am told it is not going to reopen.  This has left a huge area of east and south County Laois without services, in areas such as Timahoe, Swan, Ballinakill, Durrow, Rathdowney, Borris-in-Ossory and, of course, Abbeyleix itself, as well as all the areas surrounding that.  Abbeyleix hospital offered an excellent service.  It also provided services for inpatients in the nursing unit, such as chiropody and physiotherapy, along with social activities, which are very important.</p>  <p>  It is puzzling that Portlaoise day care centre is closed for refurbishment at the same time, and I do not see activity around it, or at least there was not up to one week ago.   The doors just closed.  I am not arguing against refurbishment or any investment in facilities such as this but we need to find out why HSE management takes these decisions.  Mountmellick day care centre, too, is closed for refurbishment and extension, meaning the entire county has been left without day care services.  Laois has no day care services and that is not acceptable.  What kind of decision-making is this?  Of course, we need to upgrade and invest in facilities and that is all overdue, but we should not close the whole lot to do that.</p>  <p>  The importance of day care centres to the elderly cannot be stressed enough.  I acknowledge Deputy Butler, as Minister of State with responsibility for older people issues, has a particular interest in this area and she is focused on the issue.  They are vital for people, not least those who live alone in rural areas.  We should try to support the elderly.  There has been something of a change in thinking about this.  Throughout the 2000s and the recession that ensued, people were inclined to say nursing homes were the first option.  In fact, the first option should be to try to sustain people in their own homes.  That is more cost effective, it is what they want and it will be far more satisfactory if we can do that.  Those one or two days a week in the day care centre are vital, as families and elderly people tell both me and the Minister of State all the time.</p>  <p>  Elderly people may feel they do not have a voice, so I convey to the Minister of State the feelings that have been expressed to me by many families and elderly people throughout the county.  We have been left with no day care services.  We are now out of Covid, and the Minister of State can imagine how important that one outing a week was, so we should try to provide for it.  It is a part of the service, along with home care in some cases, that is needed to keep people in their own homes.  Abbeyleix hospital needs to reopen, as do the centres in Portlaoise and Mountmellick, although I ask the Minister of State to focus on the one in Abbeyleix in her response.</p></speech>

A focus I have had since September last has been on trying to get as many day care centres open as possible, and I have an update for him.</p>  <p>  It is a key priority for me to allow more people to engage in services that allow them to remain independent and live in their own homes with dignity.  The HSE has operational responsibility for planning, managing and delivering health, personal and social services, including day care centres.  These services are fundamental to the health and well-being of our older population.  Access to these centres can play a key role in enabling older people to live independently in their communities, as the Deputy noted.  They provide invaluable support, advice and social interaction for older people, who may be experiencing isolation and loneliness for any number of reasons.</p>  <p>  It remains my priority to ensure day care centres reopen as quickly and safely as possible following the necessary closures in 2020 in response to Covid-19.  The process for reopening day care centres commenced in 2021 and the HSE continues to work actively on the reopening for older people as a priority.  At the end of December, 237 centres for older people, or 73% of the total, had reopened and it is planned that a further 66 will open in 2022.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy pointed out, Abbeyleix day care service has been closed since March 2020 due to Covid-19.  Older person services in Laois are working closely with HSE estates to identify alternative suitable accommodation for the service to resume.  The Deputy will be aware renovation works are under way to improve the residential services at the hospital.  To facilitate work, these services were relocated to the part of the building where day services had previously been provided.  These works, which were required from the perspective of infection prevention and control, public health and HIQA in light of the pandemic, are expected to be completed by quarter 1 of 2022.  On completion, the residential service will be transferred to its original location on the ground floor.  Portlaoise hospital proposes to have 18 intermediate care beds available as part its winter planning once this part of the building has been vacated by older person services.  This is the area of the hospital where the day service was based.</p>  <p>  As an interim solution, people who attended the day service in Abbeyleix hospital will be offered a place in line with infection prevention and control and public health advice at the day service on the Timahoe Road when it reopens following necessary renovation works.  These renovations are also expected to be completed in quarter 1 of 2022.  The HSE has confirmed to the Department that it is actively sourcing an alternative suitable building to provide a day service in Abbeyleix and the environs of Mountrath and Timahoe.  The suitability of the options put forward will be considered by older person services as an alternative day service location for the people who previously attended Abbeyleix hospital.  This is currently at the early stages of planning.  The HSE has reassured the Department that the staff of the community nursing unit continue to liaise with people who previously attended the service on an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

She set out the case in detail.  Even so, when the HSE closes the door, it can be difficult to get it reopened, as the Ceann Comhairle will be aware.  It closed the door of the day care centre in Monasterevin in 2014 and that has not reopened.</p>  <p>  I have raised concerns, and I am sure the Ceann Comhairle and other Deputies from his constituency have too, about the issue of relocation.  There is a site at the hospital and, where possible, there should be support to keep the service on site.  HSE estates needs to re-examine this and try to keep the service on the same site as the nursing unit, as it is now called, or the "hospital", as it is referred to locally, given there are integrated services on the site.  A building is being sourced and the HSE will probably end up leasing or purchasing a site.  It may be a more cost-effective option to locate the service on site and that should be explored.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned that in December, 73% of centres for older people were open, but zero per cent are open in County Laois.  That is the point I am trying to get across.  This is a serious situation.  Portlaoise hospital is already oversubscribed, as I understand, without the tranche of patients from Abbeyleix hospital, given it is not being extended but rather only refurbished.  Similarly, the Mountmellick service covers a huge area, into the Slieve Bloom Mountains, up to Clonaslee and that area.  That, too, needs to be reopened.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to take up the issue of these three locations with the HSE.  When HSE estates indicates something is at an early stage, that sets alarm bells ringing for me.  It needs to be pushed on.  I acknowledge the point about day-to-day operational responsibility for planning and managing, as the Minister of State set out, but sometimes the HSE needs a push from a Minister&rsquo;s office to get it moving.</p>  <p>It is not acceptable that a whole county is left without day care services.</p></speech>

As I said, we have 73%, or 237, of day care centres open.  Where the challenges arose was in any day care centre that was part of or adjacent to a community hospital, that is, in the community nursing units, and this has happened all over.  I will give an example.  Even though most of the restrictions were lifted last Friday, there is still quarantine in nursing homes.  There are 575 nursing homes in the country and 213 of them have a current outbreak.  As I stand here today, 1,000 staff in nursing homes are out due to Covid-related illness.</p>  <p>  I chaired an inter-agency meeting last week on nursing homes and community hospitals with the HSE, the Department of Health, HIQA and public health.  The number of cases in community nursing units and hospitals seems to be running about two to three weeks behind the spike of 26,000 cases just after Christmas, so we still have to take a very cautious approach.</p>  <p>  The problem is bringing people from the community into a community hospital when there are not multiple exits and entrances or multiple dining spaces and sitting room spaces.  That is where the challenges are occurring.  Of the nursing homes that are not open throughout the country, the majority are located in residential centres and there are challenges with regard to infection prevention and control.  I was not aware there were none open in Laois and I give the Deputy a guarantee I will keep a close eye on that.  To get older people back into the communities, it is vital they have day care centres.  I will liaise with the Deputy again on it.</p></speech>

I raised this matter during that debate and I want to tie down the particular issue of why there is not in place in the Irish mental health service a regular peer review of psychiatrists and the manner in which they are managing their patients and the prescribing of medication.  When a patient is in a hospital setting, there is a team of nurses and doctors in place and there is a whole system where, if a patient is detained for a period of time, there is a full hearing on both sides of the argument as to whether that patient's care in the psychiatric hospital continues.  However, for outpatient care, it appears there is a glitch in the system in that there is no peer review.  This is my main concern.</p>  <p>  I have been speaking to people involved in clinical psychology and to counsellors.  All of the accredited counsellors have supervisors so there is a gatekeeper who assists them to make sure the advice and assistance they are giving is in the best interests of their patients and they can continue to improve and learn from that supervisor and gatekeeper.  However, that does not appear to happen within the outpatient facility for those requiring care for psychiatric difficulties, whether in regard to depression or anxiety.  I ask that a proper structure is put in place to deal with this issue.</p>  <p>  As has been very much highlighted in recent days with the review carried out in Kerry, in the South/South West Hospital Group area of the HSE, more than 200 children were adversely affected because the checks and balances were not in place.  I do not believe we can continue with the system as structured at present without having some change and ensuring there is that review.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure the necessary changes in that area are made.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.580" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1614" speakername="Mary Butler" time="18:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700062#NNN00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue, which is timely and very important.  The Deputy asks about peer review for psychiatrists in the context of prescribing medicines to people using mental health services and, no doubt, like me, he is thinking of the publication yesterday of the report into the independent review of care provided in the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in Kerry.  I could go into the report but we spoke about it last night and the Deputy is acutely aware of the devastating impact it had on the children, young people and families affected.  The report clearly identifies a catalogue of failings at multiple levels within the system.  This is clearly evidenced by the lack of clinical oversight, to which the Deputy alluded, including the absence of a clinical lead and a CAMHS consultant.  There was no system used to check the prescribing of medication or the quality of service by the doctor's supervisors.  There were also concerns raised regarding governance and oversight of the team by line management and the effectiveness of the CAMHS oversight group.</p>  <p>  These failings are central to the issue raised by the Deputy about peer review.  The Medical Council of Ireland maintains the specialist register for psychiatrists, who must comply with requirements, including training, to remain on the register.  This includes peer review, which is a training issue and is part of the registration process for psychiatrists.</p>  <p>  In the context of the report into care provided in south Kerry CAMHS, all of the recommendations, including those related to clinical oversight, will be implemented as a matter of priority, with many already under way.  The recommendations made include an assessment of a reconfiguration of the service and a full nationwide audit of compliance with existing CAMHS operational guidelines by all CAMHS teams.  Furthermore, a prescribing audit will be conducted in each of the 72 CAMHS teams nationally to include a random selection of files, proportional to the medical caseload, from a continuous six-month predefined time period in 2021.  A further audit of case files in north Kerry will also be carried out.</p>  <p>  There are 35 recommendations in total in the report which cover other areas such as staff training, clinical oversight, recruitment, care planning and involvement of children and families in governance structures, among others.  We all acknowledge that fundamental reforms are needed in many areas of mental health service delivery, not least in child and adolescent services.  This report has brought them into sharp relief.  We need to take one step further.  At the moment, two drafters have been appointed by the Attorney General to start drafting the mental health Bill to amend the Act that was introduced in 2001.  That Bill is currently undergoing pre-legislative scrutiny in the Joint Sub-Committee on Mental Health.  I believe this is a real opportunity to make sure those checks and balances are put in place and underpinned by legislation.</p></speech>

Another point in the report was that clear written guides for the use of antipsychotic medication should be developed.  There are very good recommendations in the report.  I want to know the timeline for the implementation of these, not just in Kerry but for the entire country.  It is an extremely good and well-researched report and it contains very constructive proposals that need to be implemented at an early date.</p></speech>

There are 35 recommendations in the report and six of those recommendations are already complete.  If memory serves me, I said last night that 13 of them are being progressed and the rest have yet to commence.  I will be keeping in close contact with the HSE to make sure these recommendations are in place.</p>  <p>  One part of the review we are doing is in regard to the 72 CAMHS teams dealing with those children who are medicated.  As we know, out of 1,000 of the case files in Kerry, 500 children were medicated and 500 were not.  We are going to do an audit of those children throughout the country who are medicated to find whether this raises red flags.  What we are also doing is looking at the standard operating procedures for all CAMHS teams that were introduced in 2015, with the guidance having been updated in 2019.  We are also doing an audit to see that those checks and balances are in place.</p> <p>The most important thing to do is to make sure that any parent who brings a child to CAMHS anywhere in the country has confidence in the service.  I know Paul Reid, the chief executive of the HSE, said earlier today that it is working out the details of how these audits will be carried out.  I am in close contact with the Department and the HSE.  The audits will be done in a timely manner and it is important that they are independent.  It is also important that standard operating procedures regarding all CAMHS teams are enforced.</p></speech>

Long Covid has been called a hidden iceberg of long-term illness, yet the HSE has been slow to acknowledge the condition or provide clear care pathways, which could have serious long-term implications for those with the condition, as well as for our health service more generally and for our economy.  Various studies give different incidence rates of long Covid.  A research paper produced by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, at my request, estimates that the number of people in Ireland who have had Covid-19 and are experiencing or will experience long Covid is at a minimum of 114,500, and growing, with the continued rate of infection.</p>  <p>  The World Health Organization definition of long Covid is where symptoms persist for more than three months from the onset of the initial Covid-19 infection, lasting for at least two months, when they cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis.  In general, those with the condition are impacted in their everyday functioning, with symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath and cognitive dysfunction.  These effects appear to occur irrespective of the initial severity of the infection, but occur more frequently in women, the middle-aged, and those with more serious symptoms initially.  I estimate that if all 114,500 people claim Covid illness benefit, and subsequently claim illness benefit for the minimum five-month duration as specified by the World Health Organization definition, this would cost the Department of Social Protection &euro;925 million.  This figure does not include health costs, nor does it take into account the reduction or loss of productivity and absenteeism, never mind the financial and personal impact it has on those with chronic conditions associated with long Covid.</p>  <p>  Sadly, in-depth searches of the HSE website and a variety of HSE documents do not identify any sources quantifying or indicating the nature or scale of the impact of long Covid on our health service.  This could be a sleeping crisis that may overwhelm the already horrendous waiting lists in our health service.</p>  <p>  The HSE stated last September that it planned to establish specialist long Covid clinics.  As of today, only a model of care for long Covid has been agreed, with the HSE now starting to implement it.  The HSE has stated that a variety of disciplines will need to be recruited to support these clinics.  As a result, they have no idea when long Covid clinics will become fully operational.  Here is the sting in the tail.  It is only after these become operational that pathways to and from general practitioners and community services will be established, even though the majority of people with long Covid will have to rely on their GP to access the service initially.  This slow rate of action is in stark contrast to dealing with primary Covid infection.</p></speech>

Covid-19 is a new disease, so information on it, its features and its course are still emerging.  The natural history, clinical course and consequences of Covid-19 are still not completely understood.  It is recognised that most patients with Covid-19 return to baseline after acute infection, but a proportion of people report ongoing health issues.  There is a lot of uncertainty in the international literature about how many people experience these prolonged symptoms, so it is extremely difficult to determine the scale of this.</p>  <p>  People who have had Covid-19 and are in need of further care are currently being followed up by their GP or in hospital settings as clinically appropriate.  Treatment is currently focused on the management of specific symptoms.  Those in the community who are concerned about persistent Covid-19 symptoms should contact their GP in the first instance.  Building on the services already in place to support people with post-acute and long Covid symptoms, I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that the HSE has developed an interim model of care for long Covid.  A programme manager for long Covid has been appointed and clinical leads representing respiratory medicine, infectious diseases and neurology have also been appointed.  This interim model of care outlines how services and supports for people with long Covid should be designed and delivered.  I advise the Deputy that an implementation team has been established to oversee this work and its initial priority will be on the establishment of post-acute and long Covid clinics to treat patients as needed, while also working to better understand the demand for this service.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised the Department of plans for each hospital group to have access to both a post-acute and long Covid clinic.  It is planned that long Covid clinics will be located at Cork University Hospital, St. James's Hospital, University Hospital Limerick, Galway University Hospital, Beaumont Hospital and St. Vincent's University Hospital.  It is planned that post-acute clinics will be located at Cork University Hospital, St. James's Hospital, University Hospital Limerick, Galway University Hospital, Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, Letterkenny University Hospital and the Mater University Hospital.  The HSE has indicated that long Covid clinics will manage people from 12 weeks post onset of symptoms.  Post-acute clinics will be assessing and managing individuals with ongoing symptoms that are four to 12 weeks after initial onset of infection.  This will include those that have been hospitalised, in addition to GP referrals for people with more moderate to severe symptoms.</p>  <p>  I understand from the HSE that it will be setting up working groups for these clinics over the coming weeks.  The objective of these working groups will be to standardise the pathways of care, including multi-disciplinary team supports and operating aspects of the services.  This may need to adapt and change over time in response to lessons from the sites, the evolving situation with Covid and emerging evidence.  I assure the Deputy that the Department of Health will continue to develop an understanding of the implications of long Covid to inform policy as appropriate.</p></speech>

The difficulty with the reply is that I do not see the sense of urgency about this in the HSE.  As the Minister of State says in her reply, the HSE is setting up working groups for clinics over the coming weeks.  As I have pointed out, it is only when these clinics are operational that referral pathways will be put in place for GPs.  The Minister of State is advising people to go to their GPs but the GPs are not being given the tools or the referral pathways for those particular patients.  Today, 114,500 people are affected, and that number is increasing.  This has to take on a greater level of urgency.</p>  <p>  The emerging consensus in the literature in this area is the importance of those multidisciplinary rehabilitative teams for post-Covid patients, as the Minister of State has outlined.  Post-Covid rehabilitation will assume increasing importance as the surge of patients is discharged from hospital, placing additional burdens on our health system.  The rehabilitative needs of patients are varied and multifaceted.  Clinics should offer these multidisciplinary assessments.  The emerging literature emphasises the importance of the assessment of post-acute Covid patients after the discharge and of preparedness for the appropriate clinical rehabilitation pathways.  Such initial multidisciplinary assessments for long Covid may play a role in reducing unnecessary chest X-rays and clinic appointments and help to focus the type of follow-up care that is needed.</p> <p>Surely, with limited hospital appointment capacity, we must try to provide focused, targeted support to these patients.</p></speech>

We are still learning about this condition and the supports that are needed to care for those affected by it in Ireland.  The Department of Health, through the Health Research Board, HRB, continues to fund research into the clinical impacts of Covid-19 so that we can learn more.</p>  <p>  To aid recognition and management of those affected the WHO, through a global consensus process, has proposed a working clinical case definition of post-Covid-19 syndrome which occurs "usually 3 months from the onset" of Covid-19, with symptoms that last for at least two months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis.  The common symptoms identified include "fatigue, shortness of breath, cognitive dysfunction but also others and generally have an impact on everyday functioning".  Symptoms may be "new onset following initial recovery" from an acute Covid-19 episode or persist from the initial illness.  Symptoms may also fluctuate or relapse over time.  However, the WHO notes that this definition may change as new evidence emerges and our understanding of the consequences of Covid-19 continues to evolve.</p>  <p>  In Ireland those affected by long Covid will continue to be cared for through our health services.  The HSE's planned service development will also adapt as we learn more about what is needed over the coming period to ensure that all the necessary supports are in place.</p></speech>

Since then, there has been no stationmaster on site and the maintenance of the station has been subcontracted out.  In July 2017, this same station was deemed so beautiful that An Post captured it in a commemorative stamp.  It was great to see the building on a commemorative stamp.  The beautiful stone station, which was designed by the architect Mr. Sancton Wood who also designed Heuston Station, was the stationmaster's home for many years.  It continues to be an important part of the fabric of Bagenalstown.  To say that it is not busy enough to keep it manned is a slap in the face for this rural town and the people in it, who matter just as much as people in larger towns and cities. </p>  <p>  Just last year, Bagenalstown station was added to the Waterford to Dublin early-morning commuter route because, as the Minister of State knows, Bagenalstown is an important town.  The move to self-service for this station was a retrograde step.  While an Irish Rail staff member can disembark at all stations to help with machine tickets and accessibility issues, there is nobody at the station before a train comes to help those who need assistance.  What is worse, the toilets are rarely opened.  Steps like these show that we are slowly but surely eroding the rural way of life.  Around 140 commuters use the Bagenalstown station and now that restrictions have been lifted and working from home is being phased out, more and more commuters will be using this service.</p>  <p>  Transport poverty and inaccessibility are social and environmental issues.  More than one in four people living with a disability do not use public transport because of accessibility issues.  Although there is the promise of a customer service operative on board to help commuters with mobility and other issues, this is often not the case and the driver has to get out to assist passengers which causes delays.  This kind of reduced service will contribute to further reductions in the use of public transport at a time when we need to find more ways to cut our carbon footprint.</p>  <p>  To have a train station without assistance or toilets in 2022 is scandalous.  What can the Department do to sort this out?  I welcome the fact that there will be a public consultation on the need for extra carriages from Waterford to Carlow and Bagenalstown to Dublin.  It is my understanding that this will be advertised shortly and people will be encouraged to have their say.  One of the biggest issues with the train that comes from Waterford is that by the time it gets to Bagenalstown and Carlow, it is absolutely full and people have to stand.  I know that during Covid things changed and fewer people were travelling by train but we will need extra carriages now.  I ask that when the public consultation process is being launched that it is heavily advertised so that people are aware of it.  We do not want people to say they were not aware of it.  We need to cut our carbon footprint, as the Minister of State knows well.  I look forward to the response from the Department.</p></speech>

I understand that the Deputy's question is specifically in relation to toilet facilities in Muine Bheag train station</font><font color="#4F4F4F"> </font><font color="#212100">and I advise the Deputy that issues such as this are an operational matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  The Minister for Transport has no role in such matters</font><font color="#4F4F4F">.</font></p><p><font color="#212100">  Nevertheless, the Deputy may wish to note that as part of the overall ongoing investment in the rail network, the Department of Transport recently secured Government approval for additional funding for the infrastructure manager multi-annual contract, IMMAC.  The IMMAC provides the funding framework for the protection and renewal of our railway infrastructure.  Deputy Murnane O'Connor spoke about the beautiful building in Bagenalstown and the fact that it featured on a commemorative stamp and I agree that it is a beautiful building.  With the increased funding secured over the five years of the contract out to 2024, just over &euro;1.1 billion in Exchequer funding will be made available to support delivery.</font>This funding will increase service reliability and punctuality, improve journey times and ensure continued safety of rail services across the network.  </p><p>A new national train control centre is under construction, with completion and full commissioning by 2024.  This control centre will completely transform the management of the rail network as compared with today and will allow for the future expansion of services in the years ahead.  These investments are complemented by the 41 new rail carriages which are under construction, with expected delivery to commence in mid-2022.  There is significant investment under way in the rail network and services to continually improve the attractiveness of rail transport to customers.</p><p>Regarding the Deputy's specific query on facilities at Muine Bheag or Bagenalstown station, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has advised the Department of Transport that the company's position over the past couple of years has been to move to online or ticket machine ticket sales.  Almost 90% of tickets are now acquired digitally.  In July 2019, Bagenalstown station moved from being partially staffed to a full self-service station.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has advised that it does not generally provide toilet facilities at stations which are unmanned as such facilities tend to be subject to a disproportionate amount of vandalism and incidents of anti-social behaviour.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is rebalancing its customer service provision with greater on-board services, including toilets and fewer facilities located in stations.</p><p>As regular customers on the Waterford to Dublin route will know, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann now has dedicated customer service officers on board over 80% of services on this route to assist passengers.  Furthermore, there are ticket sales available at the station via the ticket vending machine and the customer service officers will be able to assist people with Department of Social Protection tickets, seating, service information and more, on board. This means that there will always be assistance for wheelchair customers at Bagenalstown with the on-board customer service officers available to help with boarding and alighting.</p><p>Furthermore, in relation to facilities at Carlow, two new lifts have recently been installed at Carlow station, including a new footbridge in January this year.  Iarnr&oacute;d Eireann is in discussions with the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Carlow County Council regarding a car park expansion, including bicycle parking, for Carlow station.  Finally, Iarnr&oacute;d Eireann has advised that the fleet that operates the Waterford route is its newest and most modern fleet, the intercity railcar, and all trains serving Carlow and Bagenalstown stations have toilets on board for customer comfort.</p></speech>

I compliment Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on the lifts at Carlow railway station.  It was important that they were installed.  It is now 2022 and they were a long time coming but I welcome that investment.  I also appreciate that the car parking facilities at the station are being looked at but I am seeking clarity on Bagenalstown station.</p> <p>It was wheelchair users who came to me about this.  They felt it was unfair that they could not access the toilets in the railway station.  We have to be very mindful about this.  While everything is going online and that is understandable, we cannot shut down our rural railway stations or having them half-manned so that there is a situation where a person with a disability or a wheelchair user is not able to use it.  We do not need to go there.  I am mindful, as I am sure the Minister of State is, that we keep rural towns going.  The railway station is part of Bagenalstown.  It has always been there and has always provided a great service.  When it closed it was a great loss to the people of Bagenalstown.  While the service was going it was not what it had been.  It does effect quite a number of people.  I would ask that Irish Rail look at this.  We should not set a precedent of concentrating only on large stations such as Heuston Station in the big cities and forget our little rural stations that have been the lifeblood of our communities and were there before time, giving great service.  That is my greatest worry.</p></speech>

The decision to move to a self-service station in Muine Bheag in 2019 was part of a wider decision by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to rebalance its operations.  The Minister suggests that as it is an operational matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, it would be very well placed for the Deputy to contact it on this issue.</p>  <p>  The experience of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has been that toilet facilities in unmanned stations attract higher levels of antisocial behaviour as well as more incidence of vandalism.  However, we all know, if someone is waiting for a train and they are short taken it is very important that the toilet is in operation and that it is available.  I know the service from Waterford to Carlow to Dublin.  It is all well and good that the trains are of the very highest quality.  They are the newest and the most modern fleet.  Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh will know this very well.  They have excellent facilities on board but I take the Deputy's point about anyone who is waiting at the station.  It is a beautiful location.  The Deputy would be well placed to raise this with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  I have no doubt that the Disability Federation of Ireland would also support her call. </p></speech>

If the toilet is already there, it is even more straightforward that it should be made available.  It is all very well to tell Deputy Murnane O'Connor that she should follow up on it.  Given the millions, indeed, billions of euro that we are now spending on the rail service it would be no harm if the Minister asked Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to cop itself on and tell them that customers cannot go to the toilet online.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.599" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="19:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700065#QQQ00500"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	&quot;That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann shall take note of the Report of the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands entitled &quot;Examination of Bogus Self Employment&quot;, copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 16th June, 2021.&quot; </blockquote>  <p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to debate this motion on the report of the joint committee on bogus self-employment.  I will share my time with Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh.</p><p>I would like to thank Members for their attendance this evening and committee members for their work that culminated in the publication of this report.  I would like to specifically thank Deputy Joan Collins who acted as the committee&rsquo;s rapporteur and our committee&rsquo;s policy adviser, Mr. Jack Savage, whose assistance to the committee on this report was invaluable.  In June 2021, the committee published its final report entitled, Examination of Bogus Self-Employment.  Bogus self-employment is the practice where a worker who is acting in the capacity of an employee is classified, often at the request of the employer, as self-employed for PRSI purposes.  The extent of bogus self-employment is largely unknown.  However, several estimates indicate that bogus self-employment results in significant losses to the Exchequer through lost employer PRSI contributions.  During its engagements the committee heard that some evidence shows that activities around bogus self-employment have cost the Exchequer approximately &euro;600 million in recent times. </p><p>Another area regarding the code of practice that was considered by the committee was the role of platform working.  This is a relatively new way of working where a contract for service is awarded through a third-party digital platform.  The committee had concerns that this type of work was not fully accounted for in the code of practice due to its significant growth in recent years.  The committee welcomed the response from the Department that these workers were not excluded from the code of practice.  However, as new ways of working are continuously developed, the committee is of the view that the code of practice must be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that it continues to be applicable to all those who operate in the workforce.</p><p>The committee&rsquo;s report also acknowledges the difficulties faced by those who are wrongly classified as self-employed when it comes to accessing social welfare benefits that they would be entitled to if an employer&rsquo;s PRSI contribution was contributed to their record.  The Department of Social Protection informed the committee that self-employed class S contributors are not able to receive illness benefit, carer&rsquo;s benefit, health and safety benefit and occupational injuries benefits.  Other consequences faced by those who are registered as self-employed while working in an employee capacity include a lack of access to union representation and collective bargaining.  These issues were repeatedly highlighted throughout the committee&rsquo;s consideration of the matter.</p><p>Specifically, the committee issued 12 recommendations in its report focusing on a number of areas that can be strengthened to ensure that bogus self-employment is not able to continue.  First, the committee recommended that the code of practice for determining employment or self-employment status of individuals is updated and placed on a statutory footing.  The committee welcomes the response from the Minister for Social Protection who published the updated code of practice last year and urges her to place the code of practice on a statutory footing, as was previously committed to, by the end of the current Oireachtas term.</p><p>The committee also recommended that the Minister, in consultation with the relevant stakeholders, would investigate whether more evidence would need to be provided by companies engaging with contractors to prove that the individual contracted as a self-employed worker is not, if fact, operating in an employee capacity.  In response to the committee the Minister explained that this would create an additional bureaucratic burden on both companies and individuals.  However, the committee is still of the opinion that placing the burden on companies to prove that an individual is self-employed, rather than a person classified as self-employed trying to assert that they are an employee would be a favourable outcome for workers. </p><p>The committee also examined the issue of targeted inspections that have taken place in specific sectors of the economy to identify instances of bogus self-employment.  This recommendation was designed for further interaction between the Department of Social Protection and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to ensure consistent levels of investigations are carried out each year. </p><p>The committee acknowledges the work of the joint investigation unit based in Revenue and the work of the employer status investigation unit, ESIU, that was established within the Department of Social Protection in 2019.  The committee notes that the ESIU is part of a suite of measures used by the Department to ensure the correct classification of workers for PRSI reasons.  Another important section within the Department that investigates the issue of employment status is the scope section.  The committee notes and wishes to make all those watching and listening aware that every worker who believes they should be registered as an employee due to their work conditions has the right to make an application to this section to ensure his or her employment status is correct.</p> <p>Every worker can avail of this and each worker is entitled to an individual investigation based on the merits of his or her own case.  This was confirmed to the committee by the Minister, the Department, and the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  However, the committee also received information that some scope cases have carried on for far too long and recommended that decisions be reached within six months.  It was confirmed to the committee that the majority of decisions are provided within six months of application and the committee remains of the opinion that this should be the maximum timeframe for such cases.</p> <p> While the ability to make an application to the scope unit is beneficial, the committee heard from major organisations that many workers are deterred from approaching the scope unit for fear of reprisal from employers.  In this instance the committee recommended that the Minister for Social Protection work with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to develop stronger anti-victimisation laws that protect workers from such actions.  In response, the committee was informed that work was continuing between both Departments for the development of such legislation.  However, the committee was also informed that the publication of such legislation would depend on the identification of a suitable legislative vehicle.  Tonight, I ask the Ministers of State to provide an update on the development of this legislation and whether an appropriate legislative vehicle has been identified.  Similarly, the committee recommended that harsher penalties be applied to employers who are found to have wilfully misclassified their employees as self-employed.  Again, the committee was informed that this was being developed subject to the identification of a suitable legislative vehicle and I also ask the Ministers of State for an update on the progress on this recommendation.</p> <p> Before I conclude I express my thanks, as Cathaoirleach of the joint committee, to the Minister and to the individuals and organisations who informed the committee&rsquo;s consideration of this matter of bogus self-employment.  I now pass over now to my colleague, the Leas-Chathaoirleach of the committee, Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh.</p></speech>

I thank him also for taking on the job of putting this report together.  Much of the preparatory work was undertaken in the Thirty-second D&aacute;il and would have been lost but for the decision made by Deputy Naughten to use our Covid time, when we could do little else, to bring together the work and form a report from it.  I also acknowledge the huge work undertaken by Deputy Joan Collins, who has unfortunately stepped out of the Chamber, and policy adviser Jack Savage in putting it together.  It was a good use of our committee time when there was little else we could have done.</p>  <p>  I thank the committee for including recommendations on platform working.  It is those two particular recommendations I wish to focus on.  Platform working is something we inaccurately refer to as the gig economy.  It is a real example of digital disruption of the way we organise our work patterns.  We are struggling to define it, much less catch up with it in terms of legislation and employment rights.  Eurofound, the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions, gives the most plain-language definition I have found of it, namely, the "matching of supply and demand for paid labour through an online platform".  Deliveroo is the example that springs most readily to mind for most people.  It is an excellent example of what is more correctly called on-location platform-determined work.  However, that is only one of five forms of platform work outlined in the Eurofound policy brief on the subject.  We have seen this type of work explode over the course of the pandemic and it has become much more visible as well.  I stress that it is not necessarily a bad thing.  I have been engaging with many Deliveroo riders and the feedback is they do the work because it suits them to do it.  They may be in education, have other jobs or commitments and they like the flexibility.  However, they have concerns from the perspective of individual workers and I have broader concerns around employment rights and social protection aspects of this.</p>  <p>  We are not alone in struggling to keep pace with the rate of change in these traditional categorisations of employer, employee and self-employed.  The EU directive on transparent and predictable working conditions makes a stab at it and I know of no member state that has got it right in terms of adequately defining the relationship between what Eurofound calls the triangular relationship between platform, worker and client.  Let us investigate this a little.  Where does the responsibility for safety lie?  If a rider's bike is defective, his or her brakes are not working properly or the e-bike does not conform to a correct specification, who is responsible?  Where do we go if the rider has a collision with a pedestrian?  If a rider is attacked - and there have been notable examples of this happening over the course of the pandemic - where does the duty of care lie?  A recurring theme when talking to people engaging in platform work, not just of the type I describe but more broadly, is the algorithm.  How does any given platform dole out the work and under what criteria?  Are the criteria visible or invisible to the worker?  What level of transparency is there?  It is not always clear and obvious and questions can arise from that as well.  If speed of delivery is one of the criteria, does that encourage or reward risk-taking or rule-breaking behaviour?  Would you be tempted to run red lights if you got more delivery jobs?   I acknowledge SIPTU has been doing very important work around trying to organise riders but the very nature of the work makes it difficult.  The riders are working different hours.  They are often of different nationalities and may not share a common language.  The work is also inherently competitive in nature.  Riders are competing against others for jobs and it kind of militates against collective bargaining.  All this makes it hard for the workers to come together and advocate and we all know workers are stronger when they operate as a collective.</p>  <p>  Beyond that is the wider lens of taxation and social protection.  How and where is a platform worker's income being taxed?  Probably more important for me is the question of how and where are the platforms' profits being taxed.  This returns to the more general issues around bogus self-employment, PRSI, and the social protection benefits a worker could or should be entitled to in respect of their social insurance contributions.  These are difficult and really complex issues to answer.  As I said, we are not the only country to struggle.  There is not an EU member state that has adequately answered these questions.  However, it is going to become increasingly important as we see more and more digital disruption in the labour force.</p>  <p>  Recommendation Nos. 9 and 10 relate to platform working.  They also refer to the update of the code of practice for determining employment status.  I have reviewed the update on it.  It is section 9.4 of the revised code that deals with "Workers in the digital/gig economy".  As I have already adverted to, that is actually inaccurate language.  The section that deals with platform working runs to four paragraphs and refers back to the idea of there being a binary status whereby these workers can either be resolved into "employed" or "self-employed".  Increasingly, we are seeing that is a grey area.  I would like the Ministers of State to comment in their contributions on whether we are adequately dealing with it.  If we are looking to put this code of practice on a statutory footing as Deputy Naughten suggested, are we going to be able to cope with platform working and the new challenges it brings?  I refer not just to the visible type like Deliveroo but also the much less visible type of platform working, such as Clickworker, for example.</p>  <p>  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this report to be debated.  There are numerous committees in the Oireachtas producing good work and very good reports that are often left on a shelf or to wither on the vine.  It is a very useful use of D&aacute;il time to be able to draw out from the report some of the more important aspects and threads.  I very much welcome the opportunity and look forward to the rest of the debate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.602" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1505" speakername="Damien English" time="19:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700066#RRR00300"><p>I thank Deputies Naughten, &Oacute; Cathasaigh and the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands for their work on this and for bringing forward this motion based on their report.  I really appreciate the work they did in gathering material and information from the relevant stakeholders to produce this report.  As was outlined, this report builds on the work carried out by the previous D&aacute;il and the previous committee.  It is great that work did not go to waste.  I acknowledge that Deputy Joan Collins was also involved in this too.  She was mentioned in her absence by her colleagues earlier.  I compliment all those involved for their work in this space on my own behalf and on that of the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys.  We look forward to working with them on this with the new group I will be chairing in this space.</p>  <p>  I also want to thank the committee for the opportunity afforded to the Minister for Social Protection and her Department officials to engage with it during this work, as we were able to provide written input over a number of stages of the drafting process.  Senior officials of the Department also had very valuable interactions with the previous committee during its programme of work.  By way of further acknowledgement, I note that the Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection commended the report to members of the Committee of Public Accounts at his recent appearance before it.</p> <p>I am very glad, therefore, to welcome this report and the opportunity to note its contents here today, in addition to having this discussion and debate.  I again thank Deputy Denis Naughten and the Ceann Comhairle for facilitating that.</p> <p> The committee's report deals with a very important issue, one that concerns me as Minister of State in the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Social Protection.  It is also very important to the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, the Minister of State at the Department of Rural and Community Development, Deputy Joe O'Brien, and our officials.  It is something we have worked on over a long number of years.  We believe that the deliberate misclassification of a worker as a self-employed contractor in a situation where they are actually working as an employee is wrong.</p> <p> Ensuring a worker is correctly classified is very important.  The classification of a worker as an employee can act as his or her passport to a collection of rights and employment protections, which are something we speak quite a lot about in this House.  They are very important, certainly as we move out of Covid-19 and into a jobs-led recovery.  We have to make sure that those protections are there and are honoured.  These can come in the form of key protections under unfair dismissal, the rights to maternity, paternity and parental leave, or access to welfare benefits.  I cannot stress enough how important these rights are, which many can take for granted.  Misclassification of a worker's employment status undermines these rights and it can also deny the State valuable revenue from PRSI.  As the total PRSI liability for self-employed workers is lower than it is for employees, there will always be those who try to present an employment relationship as self-employment.  Accordingly, we are determined to continue with the progress we have made in tackling the issue of false self-employment where it occurs.</p> <p> The committee's report contains 13 recommendations in this regard.  Six of these have already been completed and four are under way.  Some elements of this report cross departmental boundaries and will inform our future work.  We would all agree that employers should not be permitted to avoid the PRSI liability involved in engaging workers on an employee basis by unilaterally declaring them to be self-employed contractors.  However, I believe, and I want to state on the record, that the vast majority of our employers do not do that and do not wish to deprive their workers of their rights and protections.  That is borne out by the fact that, while false self-employment does exist, there is no evidence to suggest it is rife in the vast majority of Irish workplaces or that it is a significantly growing phenomenon. Figures from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, show that the number of self-employed workers as a proportion of all workers in Ireland has remained largely stable for more than 20 years.  That said, any instance of false self-employment is not tolerable and we want to deal with it.  As a consequence, it is a matter that this Government takes very seriously and the reason we have embarked on so many initiatives to deal with it.</p> <p> In this respect, a specialised team of social welfare inspectors, called the employment status investigation unit, was established in the Department of Social Protection and additional decision support resources were assigned to that unit.  The same unit networks with inspector units throughout the Department of Social Protection, as well as the Workplace Relations Commission and Revenue, to ensure its work draws on existing resources to the maximum extent possible.  This unit has been carrying out a programme of targeted investigations of employers and contractors.  To date, it has reviewed more than 500 employers and their contractors across various sectors of the economy.  Some 300 of these cases have been targeted for in-depth employment status investigations.  To date, PRSI arrears of more than &euro;600,000 have been assessed.</p> <p> The committee recommended that a standard definition of "employee" and "worker" is developed and applied in legislation.  Using a number of powers and functions under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, deciding officers in the Department of Social Protection can make determinations in relation to a person's employment status.  In other words, they can decide whether a worker is or was an employee or self-employed.  The law makes a distinction between contracts of service where an individual is employed and contracts for service where an individual is not employed.  From that decision flows the appropriate categorisation for PRSI purposes, the most common being class A for an employee and class S for a self-employed person.</p> <p> There is no set test in law for an employment relationship to exist.  Self-employed people are usually identified by the fact that they are in business for themselves and provide a service to multiple clients.  They are generally more independent workers than employees and they have far greater control over how and when to deliver a service.  Deciding officers from the Department of Social Protection are guided by their own statutory powers and the case law that has evolved in the courts over many decades.  It is worth noting that legislation is already in place that makes it illegal not to pay the correct class of PRSI, with associated sanctions and penalties.</p> <p> This brings me to the recommendations regarding the code of practice on determining employment status.  This guidance for departmental deciding officers, and in fact for anyone who wishes to understand the distinction between the different statuses of employment, has been revised.  The Minister for Social Protection relaunched the code last summer following a review and overhaul conducted by an interdepartmental working group consisting of the Department of Social Protection, Revenue and the Workplace Relations Commission.  This guidance does not create new law.  It reflects the up-to-date position as it has emerged in the courts and in legislation.  It sets out the key factors that have been found by the courts to determine whether a person is employed or self-employed.  In this regard, the courts have found that the determination as to the appropriate insurability classification is a complex matter and must be arrived at by looking at what a person actually does, the way in which it is done and the terms and conditions under which the person is engaged, be they written, verbal or implied.  Steps are under way to place this code on a statutory footing.</p> <p> When arriving at a determination on the employment status of an individual, a deciding officer will typically have to weigh up a number of factors.  Of particular importance are features in the relationship between the worker and the employer or contractor and whether this relationship carries the characteristics of employment.  For example, the degree of control exercised over the worker by the other contracting party is quite significant, as is the control over when, how, and where the service is provided.  Cases that involve decisions on employment status may arise from requests from employers, employees, employer representative groups, employee representative groups, the Department's own social welfare inspectors, departmental officials working in social welfare scheme areas, or the Revenue Commissioners.  In every case, the decision is an individual one and may be appealed to the social welfare appeals office.  I assure everyone in the House that no individual worker who seeks a decision from the Department of Social Protection's scope section is turned away.  There are no group decisions, but only individual decisions.  Each case turns on its own facts and the law is applied without fear or favour to those facts.</p> <p> The committee's report also highlights the importance of data and statistics and I agree with this observation.  From 1 January 2021, a new European regulation on social surveys, Regulation 2019/1700, became law.  It affects a number of surveys, the most significant being the labour force survey, LFS.  These changes will provide Departments with new statistical data on self-employed individuals.  Although I understand that the new CSO data will not be available until later this year, it should assist in targeting our employment status investigations and inspections to ensure compliance into the future.</p> <p> There are a number of recommendations contained in the report that we cannot commit to or agree to just yet.  The most important of these is where the committee has suggested that greater documentary evidence should be provided by new businesses to prove they are in fact self-employed.  According to the CSO, there are approximately 340,000 self-employed individuals in Ireland.  In this regard, it is essential that we do not lose sight of the fact that legitimate self-employment is a key part of the labour market.  In addition, we must continue to support genuine entrepreneurs to set up and succeed in their own businesses, particularly as they are key engines of job creation.  Therefore, any proposal to increase documentary requirements would require careful consideration.  It would have to be clear that the imposition of the additional bureaucratic burden would provide a tangible solution to the issue of false self-employment, but I am happy to work with Members on that.  We discuss red tape for SMEs a lot in committees and across the Houses.  I understand that the majority of people in the Houses are of the view that we should keep red tape for SMEs to a minimum in order to support them in their work.  That is a concern I would have about this piece and this recommendation, but I am happy to tease it through and look at it further with Members.</p> <p> I am very optimistic about a new working group, announced in December, which is being established by the T&aacute;naiste to examine issues around false self-employment in Ireland.  This group will have representation from the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Social Protection, alongside Revenue, as well as participation from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, IBEC, the Construction Industry Federation and Irish Small and Medium Employers.  I will chair this new group and all options will be on the table to streamline and improve the processes involved in deciding employment status, including factors affecting specific sectors such as platform work, which is often referred to as gig work, rightly or wrongly, as Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh said.  It is something we will focus on a lot as it often comes across our desks.  We are very much involved in discussions with our European colleagues regarding this issue and there will also be a focus on it in our work programme during the French presidency of the Council of the European Union.  We are happy to engage more with this committee and Members on that.</p> <p> This group that I will chair will build on the work conducted by the committee and examine the issues around false self-employment in Ireland.  I want to be very clear that I will be very happy to work with Members on that.  I will be happy to engage on behalf of my Department with any interested Deputies or colleagues across the different committees who want to work on it.  I observe that the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, will be involved in this work as well.</p> <p> In conclusion, I once again thank the Chair and members of the Committee for their work on the production of the report, in addition to the members of previous committees.  I have no doubt that its contents will be keenly considered by the new working group to be inaugurated in the coming weeks.  I hope to be able to communicate regarding a start date for that very soon.</p></speech>

I commend my party colleagues, Deputies Kerrane and Paul Donnelly, who are members of the current committee and contributed to this work.  I commend all members of the committee, including, in particular, Deputy Joan Collins, who acted as rapporteur.  I commend the 12 recommendations of the report.</p>  <p>  Bogus self-employment cheats us all.  Unfortunately, we have never seen a Minister stand with that particular phrase for a photo opportunity.  I have often noted that the best example of populism in modern Irish politics was the disgraceful campaign that tried to imply there was widespread fraud among people claiming social welfare payments.  There is fraud and it should be tackled but it is, I would guess, only a fraction of what is impacted as a result of bogus self-employment.  The fraud or the overpayments that take place within social welfare happen in the here and now.  Fraud that takes place in bogus self-employment has an impact on the here and now but it could be still having an impact in decades to come.  At a time when this House is debating whether the Government parties can get away with increasing the pension age, as was their previous stated intention, money from the PRSI pot is being lost every year and will continue to be lost for some time. </p>  <p>  The workers who are at the tail end of this practice are denied employment rights, surety of tenure and basic entitlements and the Exchequer is denied ring-fenced funding for pensions, sick pay, unemployment benefits and so on.  If those workers are unemployed or need assistance for a period, every other taxpayer has to pick up the slack while a few companies - I accept it is probably only a few companies - pocket the difference.  The difficulty is that we are unsure as to how extensive this practice is.  One ICTU report estimated that between 2007 and 2014 up to &euro;640 million was lost to the Irish taxpayer as a result of this practice.  </p>  <p>  The committee report makes a number of key recommendations, including that the code of practice that determines self-employment versus employment be updated.  According to the response given by the Minister of State, Deputy English, that has been carried out.  However, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has described it as wholly inadequate because it does not have supporting legislation.  The committee proposed what I believe is a very sensible and logical proposal, namely, that an advertisement campaign promoting the right to apply to have one's employment status adjudicated be rolled out.  There is no evidence or suggestion in the Minister of State's response that that is something that will be given the type of resources that previous campaigns were given.  Crucially, the committee recommended that the Department of Social Protection and Revenue together develop an inspections target and regime.  In my own engagements with Revenue and the Department on this matter, they consistently passed the buck as to who is responsible for any given aspect.  On the ten other recommendations I have heard very little from the Minister of State that suggests an eagerness to implement them.</p>  <p>  I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Minister of State will be aware that that committee has also dedicated a significant amount of time to this matter because of the overarching aspect of this issue but also because of the significant concern about Exchequer funds being lost.  The Committee of Public Accounts also produced a report on the matter, specifically on what was essentially a back room that affected the courier sector, which deal was done in the 1990s and is still having repercussions.  It is a considerable issue for the Committee of Public Accounts to get either the Department of Social Protection or Revenue to acknowledge that this is an issue, let alone the extent or scale of it.  </p>  <p>  Our State broadcaster, RT&Eacute;, was on the verge of misleading the Committee of Public Accounts in regard to its employment prospects.  It took four members of the committee asking a representative of RT&Eacute; a question in regard to its settlements with Revenue before RT&Eacute; finally acknowledged to the committee that it had reached a financial settlement with Revenue.  It took a number of weeks of deliberations and correspondence with the Committee of Public Accounts to find out that RT&Eacute; had paid &euro;1.22 million to Revenue.  The scary fact is that much more in costs are to come, perhaps, with Revenue but certainly with the Department of Social Protection and with the staff involved.  We have no idea how much that will be.  This is at a time when RT&Eacute; is seeking more Government funding.  As recently as last week at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts RT&Eacute; would not commit to providing details even for those workers for whom it has reached settlements with Revenue in order that those workers would receive what they are owed in lost revenue and entitlements. </p>  <p>  It also needs to be noted that in many cases the issue of bogus self-employment disproportionately affects vulnerable workers.  I was also a member of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response.  At the height of the pandemic - the scariest part of the pandemic - that committee heard from representatives of meat plant workers, predominantly workers from eastern Europe who were supposedly independent contractors for a company in respect of which they registered in a different country, in some cases, that they had never been to.  We had people from a particular country being brought into Ireland to operate a line on a meat factory and as far as our official structures were concerned they were working for companies that were based in an entirely different country.  This is happening.  It is, I fear, more widespread than is acknowledged.  We found out that in many cases these individuals were living in unfit accommodation that was owned by their employers.  In at least one case, when the scope section determined in favour of the worker, there was no follow-up in terms of an audit of the factory to find out whether there were other cases.  Most would acknowledge that there were more cases.</p>  <p>  This issue has been raised on quite a number of occasions by representatives of all political parties.  I have heard Deputies and Senators raise it and, as we know, committees in the area of social protection in the previous D&aacute;il and this D&aacute;il have done great work in this area.  The Committee of Public Accounts is to pursue this matter further.  Most members of that committee accept that there could be substantial funding lost to the State.  What we need now is action.  I welcome the Minister of State's response and his remarks in regard to taking this issue seriously, but what we now need to see the evidence of that.  As I said, this is, potentially, an issue that will have a profound impact for our pension regime, our PRSI base and, particularly and most importantly in the short term, for the workers who are being exploited in the here and now.</p></speech>

I was the only member of that committee coming into this D&aacute;il.  As a member of the current committee, I requested that the committee continue with this report.  It was a difficult one because when one is not dealing directly with the witnesses such as ICTU and all of the other groups, one is working off records of printed material.  I thank my fellow members of the committee for their work in drawing up the report.</p> <p>I also thank those who made submissions, especially those from the trade union movement who have first-hand knowledge of the scale of bogus self-employment and its effects on workers' pay and conditions.  I also thank Mr. Martin McMahon who came before the committee.  I will deal with that point later in my contribution.<br/><br/>Bogus self-employment is a serious and growing phenomenon not just in Ireland but internationally.  It is an issue that is taken very seriously by the European Trade Union Confederation.  It is a particular problem in construction but applies across the board, impacting pilots in airlines, journalists, university staff, staff in meat plants and the staff in RT&Eacute;.  Deputy Carthy mentioned the case of RT&Eacute;.  That situation was peculiar.  It was not the scope section of the Department of Social Protection that investigated cases of bogus employment in RT&Eacute;; it was RT&Eacute; itself.  That was out of order.  It should not be the case.<br/><br/>Bogus self-employment also features in other areas of the economy, and the casualisation and precariousness of employment are being used to drive down wages and conditions and to reduce union membership and organisation.  That point must be strongly made.  It is driving down union membership and organisation.  I believe the 13 recommendations in this report, if implemented, can make a difference in reducing bogus self-employment, in assisting workers in obtaining their rights as workers, and in assisting trade unions to organise and represent workers on a collective basis.  The key question here is that the recommendation of the code of practice for determining self-employment status is updated and placed on a statutory footing, as the Chair of the committee has said already.  That must happen without delay.  The Minister raised this point last June and we are still waiting for it to be put on a statutory footing.  In welcoming this recommendation, Unite the Union stated that the process of putting the code of practice on a statutory footing &quot;must of necessity encompass the important legal principles set out in court judgments, many of which seem to be ignored in individual Appeals Panel decisions&quot;.<br/><br/>Recommendations Nos. 2, 3 and 4 deal with the overlapping of three different agencies, namely, the scope section of the Department of Social Protection, which is seriously under-resourced, the Workplace Relations Commission, and the newly established employment status investigation unit.  This overlapping can cause significant delays in determining a case or an appeal.  It would be much better if workers had access to one point of contact in making an appeal on their status.  A key question which needs resolution is the need for a standard definition of the term &quot;employee&quot;.  This should be done in the code of practice and applied to all legislation dealing with employment.  I will return to the point I wished to make about Mr. McMahon.  He does not support the recommendations put forward in this report and he does not think a code of practice is the proper way to go.  He thinks it should be based on case law and not a code of practice.  However, the other submissions we received were strongly supportive of a code of practice and that is why the committee is recommending it.<br/><br/>As I said at the beginning of my contribution, this report and its recommendations can make a difference, if implemented.  I was very disappointed with the Minister's letter of last September responding to the publication of the draft report in June.  The Minister in effect rejected every single recommendation in the report.  As to putting the updated code of practice on a statutory footing, the Minister stated she was currently considering ways to do it, subject to the availability of a suitable legislative vehicle in a busy legislative programme.  That in no way strikes me as a strong commitment or speaks of a sense of urgency around the issue.<br/><br/>The Minister also made particular points about recommendation No. 12 in the report.  That recommendation states:</p><blockquote>	The Committee recommends that the period for employers to pay backdated PRSI contributions that they previously avoided is increased from six months to six years.  That would mean that the <i>Workplace Relations Act 2015</i>be amended to allow adjudication officers and the Labour Court consider breaches of employment enactments for up to 6 years rather than the generally 6 months. </blockquote> <p>The Minister asked for clarification of that recommendation.  Unite the Union argued that &quot;the limitation periods applicable to breaches of employment law should be no less than those applicable to other areas of contract law which can have retrospection of up to six years&quot;.  Unite made the point that employment law is different from contract law and that contract law allowed for six years.  That would put major pressure on any employers that are trying to con the system through bogus self-employment.  If such employers had to make a large payment, they would think twice about it.<br/><br/>It seems to me that neither the Minister nor leading officials in the Department regard bogus self-employment as a serious problem that needs urgent action and a change in approach.  If that is the case, they are in denial.  The Minister and the Department do not see bogus self-employment or the question of platform working as a serious issue.  These are serious issues across Europe.  I urge other Deputies to support the committee's report and to assist the committee members in maintaining pressure on the Government to ensure the implementation of the report.  I noted the Minister's point about setting up a group to examine the question of bogus self-employment under the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and I would like to have an input into that.  I do not think this is the end of the matter.  It is only a part of the process.  I know that in the future, when we get more information about bogus self-employment and how it is operating, we will have to look in more detail at how to protect workers from these practices.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-01-27a.608" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="19:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022012700069#UUU00200"><p>Well done to the committee for producing this document on the important issue of bogus self-employment.  The first introduction that Deputy Collins and I got to this issue was on picket lines outside building sites on many a cold morning.  Some of the first of those were probably more than decade ago, perhaps 15 years ago.  It is scary to think about how long ago some of those pickets took place outside the premises of some big, wealthy building contractors that are still operating.</p>  <p>  Building Workers against the Black Economy was one of the activist groups that was established to highlight the plight facing its members in terms of bogus self-employment.  They literally and metaphorically stood out in the cold and were victimised and blacklisted for protesting over bogus self-employment.  There was a large irony to that.  One of the refrains the workers would repeat was that they had to go on strike and protest for the right to pay tax.  The rich in this country do everything they can to avoid paying tax but those workers had to go out on strike for the right to pay tax.  That is the truth of all this.  It is deeply ironic, but that is what the struggle against bogus self-employment was about for the workers.  It was about the right to pay tax and the right to have the benefits and employment security that flow from that.</p>  <p>  Those workers were up against big building contractors that did not want to pay PRSI or to have any obligations to workers.  Those contractors did not want to pay sick pay or to have to pay workers if work was rained off or whatever.  They would go to horrendous ends, much of which I witnessed first-hand.  Nasty tactics were deployed against the workers who tried to highlight the issue.  I pay particular tribute to a man who has since passed away in tragic circumstances, Mr. Billy McClurg, a bricklayer from my area.  He was one among many fantastic activists who suffered as a consequence of their actions.</p> <p>Some of them never worked in the building industry again because they sought to highlight bogus self-employment.  It has taken this long to get here but I am glad it is now officially acknowledged that this is a serious problem and we must do something about it.</p> <p> It was very heartening to hear departmental advertisements advise people who believe they have been misclassified that there are places they can go now and that it is acknowledged.  It is a pity it has taken so long but at least we have come some way in that regard.  There is no doubt that bogus self-employment is still going on.  Everybody is losing out.  The workers obviously lose out.  We do not know the exact scale of bogus self-employment.  I believe an Irish Congress of Trade Unions report estimated it could be costing the Exchequer &euro;600 million per year.  The 2018 intervention in the building industry by the joint investigation unit and scope section, which identified 500 workers who were misclassified by building contractors, yielded the State an extra &euro;60 million.  Those 500 workers resulted in &euro;60 million in additional revenue that year.  We can see what a big loss this is to society in terms of tax revenue.  Obviously, it is also a loss to the workers who are treated this way and are then vulnerable.  Of course, the other big advantage of bogus self-employment is the idea of a hire them and fire them workforce that can just be got rid of because there is absolutely no obligation to them.</p> <p> I am very glad we are moving forward on this issue.  I hope the Government will take on the recommendations.  The onus should be put on employers to prove they are fully compliant, not misclassifying people and so on.  One point I really want to make is that if such employers are identified, they should be hauled over the coals for everything.  It should not just involve an individual adjudication which, of course, the employers appeal in many cases.  It is often at the appeal that decisions get overturned.  I take the point about the scope section responding and it does respond.  It often goes into an organisation and finds that the workers are right but then the barristers come out for the employers.  They wheel in the heavy guns against the workers who do not, in many cases, have any representation.  Sometimes they have union representation but other times they do not have any representation.  They certainly cannot afford barristers and so on.  Decisions get overturned at the appeals level in many cases and the matter gets dragged out.  In the meantime, the workers are out in the cold and often blacklisted at that point.</p> <p> There is one recommendation I would like to make to the Government and the Department if they are serious about this.  First, if any employer is found to have bogusly misclassified workers, there should be a forensic audit of everything it does.  That audit could involve every single employee and all the employer's accounts and books.  The whole thing should be gone through with a fine-tooth comb because if there are one or two cases, it can be guaranteed there is more dirt in that company.  We should go after such employers to provide a real deterrent that will stop these people doing what they are doing.  While they may have got caught in that instance, very often they will just carry on regardless.  That must be stamped out.</p> <p> The second recommendation I will make, which I hope the committee and Government will take on board, is that where a company or employer that is guilty of bogus self-employment is in receipt of public money, that money should be stopped immediately.  There should be a big black mark over that company preventing it from getting any public money in future until it has wiped the slate clean, having been fully sanctioned and penalised, the truth established and so on.  Too often, the same companies involved in this sharp practice of exploiting workers, breaking the law and robbing the taxpayer get a slap over the wrist and are back in business and getting Government contracts, funding, grants and tax breaks the next week.  There is, therefore, no real deterrent.  That has to stop.</p> <p> I did not hear if the Minister of State responded on the recommendation about the blacklisting legislation.  That needs to come forward.  That is a serious business.  Blacklisting is a real thing and it must be stamped out.  I appeal to the Government, as the committee has recommended, to bring forward the blacklisting legislation.</p> <p> I may not get answers now but I am hoping perhaps the officials or the Minister of State will respond to the issues I raise.  I would like to see the scope section and the joint investigation unit expanded in respect of the resources available to them.  In addition, they should deal not only with bogus self-employment but any breach of employment rights and employment legislation.  Perhaps they already do so; I do not fully understand all these mechanisms but I do not think that is the case.</p> <p> I have raised one issue repeatedly and I would really like the Government to go after this.  Sometimes, we think these things only go on in construction or maybe Deliveroo.  RT&Eacute;, the respectable State broadcaster, was found to be engaged in massive bogus self-employment and misclassification of staff.  There is another area where this kind of sharp practice of bogus self-employment goes on.  The scope section has found in favour of a couple of workers in the film industry which is in receipt of substantial State money every year.  I do not think anybody wants to investigate the industry.  I think the view is that because these are the glamourous film people, we should not look into it too much.  It might be too much of a can of worms.  Bogus self-employment is taking place, however.</p> <p> Another practice that is taking place - this is why I would like to see the scope section's remit expanded - is abuse of the fixed-term workers legislation whereby workers accumulate service for employers in the film industry but the employers do not want to recognise that service.  They do not want to acknowledge it, even though they must do so under EU law and the fixed-term workers Act.  The employers then go into the Workplace Relations Commission and argue that they are not actually the employer.  They say they get all this money from the Government to employ people but they do not actually have any employees.  That is what they say to the WRC.  When the workers tell the WRC that their rights have been abused, the employers argue that while these people worked on their film, they are not technically their employer and, therefore, they have no obligations to those workers.  I would like to workers to be able to tell other agencies, not just the WRC but agencies such the scope section, the joint investigation unit and similar bodies, that this is happening and ask for an inspection or investigation to establish that something is going on in order that action can be taken.</p></speech>

I am familiar with the time Deputy Boyd Barrett described when he referenced events ten or 15 years ago.  In a previous role, I assisted migrant workers in the construction industry to engage with the scope section and their employers.  In my constituency, airline pilots have also faced that issue.</p>  <p>  As agreed by all Deputies this evening, the committee's report deals with a very important issue.  Deliberate misclassification of a worker as a self-employed contractor in a scenario where he or she is actually working as an employee is wrong for number of reasons.  First, it results in a loss to the Social Insurance Fund, which pays for a wide range of social protection schemes.  More important, it can deny workers access to our robust employment rights legislation.</p>  <p>  I reiterate that it is not a matter of making a choice about someone's employment status.  Employment status should reflect the reality of the relationship between the parties and while it will be difficult to fully eradicate false self-employment, the Government is committed to minimising its potential and detecting and dealing with it whenever it does occur.</p>  <p>  Working with the WRC and Revenue, the Department of Social Protection will ensure we tackle the issue of false self-employment with a joined-up approach.  While self-employed individuals now have an entitlement to a large proportion of available social welfare entitlements such as the State contributory pension, there are some benefits currently not available to self-employed contributors.  It is very important that if individuals are, in fact, working as employees on a contract of service, they should be covered for all the available entitlements.  It is likely the case that there are certain sectors in which these benefits will be particularly important.</p>  <p>  Employers should be aware that anyone who incorrectly treats a worker as self-employed will be liable for that worker's PRSI contributions along with the employer contributions that should have been paid to the Collector General.  Individual workers can always contact the scope section of the Department when they believe they have been misclassified by an employer.</p> <p>The European Commission is planning a new directive on improving working conditions in platform work.  This would be a welcome addition to the legislative stock and it will help us in our efforts to eradicate this problem.</p> <p>  Finally, I am confident that the working group that will be established shortly and will be chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy English, will be an important development and that through its work it will carefully examine the remaining recommendations of the committee&rsquo;s report.  As well as this, it will be a place to which we can bring the other issues that were raised here tonight by the various Deputies.</p></speech>

I thank those who contributed not just at our own joint committee but also, as was pointed out earlier, the members of the previous joint committee who held the hearings on this issue.  They did the heavy work in their hearings.  I thank Deputy Joan Collins who was able to bring that together working with Mr. Jack Savage and who produced the recommendations of the report that we are discussing.  I want to acknowledge the work done by the former Cathaoirleach of the committee, Senator O'Loughlin, as well as the members of the last committee.  We took over that work.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy English, said earlier that both Departments are looking at the 13 recommendations set out in the report.  Six of them have been completed and four are now under way.  However, the legislative proposals that we have tabled are vitally important.  That needs to be addressed.  We are seeing a change and shift in work patterns in this country.  We will bring forward legislation on remote working.  Surely that could be used as a vehicle to help expedite some of this legislation.  This is not about creating a bureaucratic system for people who are genuinely self-employed.  As the Minister of State, Deputy English, pointed out, 340,000 people are self-employed in this country.  However, as Deputy Boyd Barrett highlighted earlier, there are big employers who have received, or are receiving, substantial funds from the State, yet they have no employees whatsoever.  It is about getting that balance right.  It is about addressing emerging areas like platform working.</p>  <p>  On foot of our report, not only did we refer it to the Department of Social Protection and to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, we also passed on a copy to the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Committee of Public Accounts is following through on that within its own remit.  We are looking forward to the completion of the Committee of Public Accounts hearings, as well as to the publication of its report.  Once its Chair, Deputy Stanley, has published that report, our committee will then consider what elements we need to progress from that particular point in time.</p>  <p>  I want to thank everyone who contributed to this debate.  I thank those who facilitated this debate.  This is an issue that the committee will be revisiting in the future. </p></speech>
