L&eacute;ir&iacute;tear leis freisin sprioc an Rialtais chun an cion cainteoir&iacute; Gaeilge a earc&oacute;far chuig comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; a mh&eacute;ad&uacute; go 20%, a fh&aacute;gfaidh go dtiocfaidh m&eacute;ad&uacute; ar an gcumas a bheidh ag comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a shol&aacute;thar i nGaeilge do chainteoir&iacute; Gaeilge agus do phobail Ghaeltachta.  T&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist coiste reacht&uacute;il, an coiste comhairleach um sheirbh&iacute;s&iacute; Gaeilge, a bhun&uacute; chun tac&uacute; leis an obair seo.

Meastar go mbeidh cur chuige n&iacute;os dinimici&uacute;la ann mar thoradh ar na bearta seo, maidir leis an l&iacute;on cainteoir&iacute; Gaeilge agus maidir leis na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; Gaeilge san earn&aacute;il phoibl&iacute; a mh&eacute;ad&uacute;.</p> <p> M&aacute; t&aacute; an ch&oacute;ras nua seo chun a bheith &eacute;ifeachtach, beidh orainn d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; earca&iacute;ochta.  Is &eacute; ceann de na pr&iacute;omhfhadhbanna a chuireann bac ar sheirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge n&aacute; nach bhfuil na daoine leis na scileanna cu&iacute; fostaithe sna hoifig&iacute; cu&iacute;.  M&aacute; t&aacute; muid chun feabhas a chur air seo, caithfidh an St&aacute;t l&iacute;on na bhfostaithe St&aacute;it at&aacute; in ann seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge a mh&eacute;ad&uacute; agus a chinnti&uacute; go bhfuil Gaeilge ar a dtoil ag oifigigh St&aacute;it at&aacute; ag feidhmi&uacute; i gceantair Ghaeltachta.  Beidh s&eacute; mar chusp&oacute;ir sa Bhille go mbeidh 20% de na daoine nua a earca&iacute;tear don tseirbh&iacute;s phoibl&iacute; ina gcainteoir&iacute; Gaeilge, go mbeidh gach oifig phoibl&iacute; at&aacute; lonnaithe sa Ghaeltacht ag feidhmi&uacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge agus go mbeidh na comhlachta&iacute; in ann freastal ar an &eacute;ileamh &oacute;n bpobal ar sheirbh&iacute;s&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  Is &iacute; an earca&iacute;ocht cro&iacute;l&aacute;r na ceiste, agus t&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist t&oacute;g&aacute;il, c&eacute;im ar ch&eacute;im, ar l&iacute;on na bhfostaithe le Gaeilge agus ag eascairt as sin, go mbeimid in ann feabhas a chur ar shol&aacute;thar seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.</p> <p> Tugann mo Roinn taca&iacute;ocht l&aacute;idir do ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; tr&iacute;&uacute; leibh&eacute;al faoin gCiste tri&uacute; leibh&eacute;al agus l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn s&eacute; seo go bhfuil deiseanna suntasacha ag na daoine &oacute;ga freastal ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; ollscoile, l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge agus c&aacute;il&iacute;ochta&iacute; ardleibh&eacute;al a bhaint amach.  D&aacute; bharr sin, beidh f&oacute;rsa saothair n&iacute;os oilte againn agus beidh deis ag na dalta&iacute; at&aacute; ag freastal ar scoileanna Gaeltachta agus scoileanna l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge faoi l&aacute;thair mar chuid l&aacute;rnach den earn&aacute;il phoibl&iacute; amach anseo.</p> <p> T&aacute; earc&uacute; l&iacute;on leordh&oacute;thanach de chainteoir&iacute; Gaeilge sa tseirbh&iacute;s phoibl&iacute; ag cro&iacute;l&aacute;r na hiarrachta&iacute; d'fhonn for&aacute;lacha Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la 2003 a chur i bhfeidhm.  N&iacute; m&oacute;r a choinne&aacute;il ar intinn gur fh&oacute;gair an tSeirbh&iacute;s um Cheapach&aacute;in Phoibl&iacute; com&oacute;rtas ar leith le haghaidh oifigigh feidhmi&uacute;ch&aacute;in le Gaeilge le d&eacute;ana&iacute; le hais na gcom&oacute;rtais le sruthanna Gaeilge iontu a bh&iacute; &aacute; riar le roinnt blianta anuas.  Meastar go bhfeicfear tortha&iacute; n&iacute;os fearr de bharr an chur chuige nua seo.</p> <p> C&eacute; go bhfuil spriocanna an-t&aacute;bhachtacha l&eacute;irithe againn d'earca&iacute;ocht, n&iacute;ltear ag d&eacute;anamh dearmaid ar na hoibrithe fostaithe san earn&aacute;il phoibl&iacute; agus a gcuid ionchur i seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; Gaeilge a shol&aacute;thar don phobal.  T&aacute; comhaont&uacute; seirbh&iacute;se s&iacute;nithe ag mo Roinn leis an Roinn Caiteachais Phoibl&iacute; agus Athch&oacute;irithe chun oili&uacute;int sa Ghaeilge agus t&aacute;st&aacute;il inni&uacute;lachta a shol&aacute;thar don St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s.  Is &iacute; aidhm an chomhaontaithe seo tac&uacute; leis an bhfoireann chun a n-inni&uacute;lacht sa Ghaeilge a fhorbairt agus chun cur le cumas na St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;se seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a chur ar f&aacute;il don phobal i nGaeilge.  T&aacute; an comhaont&uacute; seo t&aacute;bhachtach ach go h&aacute;irithe i gcomhth&eacute;acs Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la 2003 agus an Strait&eacute;is 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge 2010-2030.  Faoin gcomhaont&uacute;, t&aacute; freagrachta&iacute; ar mo Roinn i dtaca le hoili&uacute;int agus meas&uacute;n&uacute; inni&uacute;lachta sa Ghaeilge a &eacute;asc&uacute; don fhoireann sa St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s.  T&aacute; r&eacute;imse leathan de ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; oili&uacute;na sa Ghaeilge &aacute; shol&aacute;thar ag an gcomhlacht Gaelchult&uacute;r chun na cr&iacute;che seo faoi chonradh at&aacute; aontaithe le Foras na Gaeilge.</p> <p> Baineann alt 7 den Bhille le c&oacute;ras na gcaighde&aacute;n teanga a bhfuil i gceist a thabhairt isteach in ionad ch&oacute;ras na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga at&aacute; ann faoi l&aacute;thair.  T&aacute; c&oacute;ras na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga at&aacute; ann faoi l&aacute;thair ag brath ar chomhlachta&iacute; san earn&aacute;il phoibl&iacute;, at&aacute; liostaithe sa Ch&eacute;ad Sceideal a ghabhann leis an bpr&iacute;omh-Acht, chun na bearta a leagan amach chun a chinnti&uacute; go sol&aacute;thr&oacute;idh siad seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; don phobal tr&iacute; Ghaeilge, agus chun leibh&eacute;al na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; sin a mh&eacute;ad&uacute; c&eacute;im ar ch&eacute;im in imeacht ama.  Glactar leis go forleathan n&aacute;r &eacute;irigh le c&oacute;ras na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga.  T&aacute; an c&oacute;ras sin c&aacute;inte ag an gCoimisin&eacute;ir Teanga, a l&eacute;irigh na heasnaimh sa tuarasc&aacute;il d&aacute; chuid: Tr&aacute;chtaireacht ar Ch&oacute;ras na Sc&eacute;imeanna Teanga, a foils&iacute;odh in 2017.  Cuireadh c&oacute;ras na sc&eacute;imeanna ar bun chun cur le l&iacute;on agus caighde&aacute;n na seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge a bheadh &aacute; gcur ar f&aacute;il ag na comhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute; don phobal.  T&aacute; pr&oacute;iseas daingnithe na sc&eacute;imeanna d&uacute;shl&aacute;nach, ach t&aacute; dul chun cinn d&eacute;anta &oacute; thaobh seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; de &oacute; cuireadh na sc&eacute;imeanna ar bun.  T&aacute; s&eacute; aitheanta againn, &aacute;fach, go raibh agus go bhfuil go leor deacrachta&iacute; leis an gc&oacute;ras.  Mar sin, mar chuid den Bhille nua seo, t&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist c&oacute;ras na gcaighde&aacute;n a thabhairt isteach anseo in &Eacute;irinn.  Faoin gc&oacute;ras seo, bheadh rang&uacute; le d&eacute;anamh ar chomhlachta&iacute; poibl&iacute;, ag baint &uacute;s&aacute;ide as rialach&aacute;in chun caighde&aacute;in a leagan s&iacute;os do na comhlachta&iacute; sin.</p> <p>Ar an mbealach seo, beimid in ann a chinnti&uacute; go mbeidh na caighde&aacute;in is airde &oacute; thaobh &uacute;s&aacute;id na Gaeilge de bainteach leis na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; a bh&iacute;onn ag sol&aacute;thar seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; don phobal, pobail na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta san &aacute;ireamh.</p> <p> Ceada&iacute;tear in alt 8 an tagairt don Choimisi&uacute;n Logainmneacha sa phr&iacute;omh Acht a scriosadh.  Is g&aacute; an leas&uacute; seo a dh&eacute;anamh i bhfianaise na breithe a th&oacute;g an Rialtas chun deireadh a chur leis an gCoimisi&uacute;n Logainmneacha sa bhliain 2012, mar chuid d&aacute; phlean um athch&oacute;iri&uacute; na seirbh&iacute;se poibl&iacute;.  Cuireadh coiste saineolaithe, arna cheapadh ag an Aire ar bhonn riarach&aacute;in, in ionad an Choimisi&uacute;in Logainmneacha.  Is de dhroim an leasaithe roimhe seo in alt 8, lenar cuireadh deireadh leis an gCoimisi&uacute;n Logainmneacha, a dh&eacute;antar an leas&uacute; in alt 9.  D&eacute;antar for&aacute;il leis maidir le pr&oacute;iseas comhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;in sula nd&eacute;anfaidh an tAire ord&uacute; logainmneacha, sula leasa&iacute;tear n&oacute; sula gc&uacute;lghairtear &eacute;.</p> <p> In alt 10, leasa&iacute;tear na hailt a bhaineann le toghairm ghi&uacute;ir&eacute; agus f&oacute;gra&iacute; in Acht na nGi&uacute;ir&eacute;ithe, 1976, chun for&aacute;il a dh&eacute;anamh maidir le f&oacute;gra d&aacute;theangach a eisi&uacute;int nuair a dh&eacute;antar duine a thoghairm chun f&oacute;namh mar ghi&uacute;r&oacute;ir.  T&aacute; an fhor&aacute;il seo &aacute; lorg ag pobal labhartha na Gaeilge le fada.</p> <p> Ceada&iacute;tear le halt 11 aisghairm a dh&eacute;anamh, am &eacute;igin sa todhcha&iacute; nuair a thiocfaidh na caighde&aacute;in teanga in ionad na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga go l&eacute;ir, ar na hailt sin den phr&iacute;omh Acht ina nd&eacute;ile&aacute;iltear leis na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga.</p> <p> Ceada&iacute;tear, le halt 12, aistri&uacute; &oacute; ch&oacute;ras na sc&eacute;imeanna teanga go caighde&aacute;in teanga.  D&eacute;anfar caighde&aacute;in teanga a thabhairt isteach go c&eacute;imneach chun aistri&uacute; ord&uacute;il &oacute; sc&eacute;imeanna teanga a chinnti&uacute; agus d&aacute; bharr sin beidh c&oacute;ras n&iacute;os simpl&iacute; agus n&iacute;os tr&eacute;dhearca&iacute; ann chun seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; Gaeilge a shol&aacute;thar.</p> <p> D&eacute;antar for&aacute;il le halt 13 maidir le gearrtheideal an Bhille, maidir lena fhorl&eacute;iri&uacute; agus lena lua, agus maidir le for&aacute;lacha tosach feidhme.</p> <p> Mar at&aacute; r&aacute;ite go minic roimhe seo, n&iacute; miste dom a threisi&uacute; ar&iacute;s gur d&oacute;igh liom go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ar cheann de na hacmhainn&iacute; n&aacute;d&uacute;rtha is luachmhaire at&aacute; againn.  Creideann an Rialtas go bhfuil s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach pobal labhartha l&aacute;idir Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta a choth&uacute; chun saibhreas oidhreachta na teanga a choinne&aacute;il beo agus a thabhairt sl&aacute;n don ch&eacute;ad ghl&uacute;in eile.  C&eacute; go bhfuil an Rialtas tiomanta gach rud a dh&eacute;anamh laistigh d&aacute; chumhacht chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn, braitheann todhcha&iacute; na teanga go pr&iacute;omha ar an bpobal.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil dearcadh dearfach ag tromlach an phobail i leith na teanga.  T&aacute; orainn timpeallacht a choth&uacute; ina mbraitheann daoine muin&iacute;neach as a gcuid Gaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id, cuma c&eacute;n leibh&eacute;al cumais at&aacute; acu inti.  Is c&eacute;im chun tosaigh &iacute; foilsi&uacute; an Bhille seo chun cuidi&uacute; leis an sprioc seo a bhaint amach.  Cabhr&oacute;idh s&eacute; seo leis an bpobal leas a bhaint as an teanga mar theanga phobail agus teaghlaigh sa Ghaeltacht agus chun go gcuirfear an teanga chun cinn ar bhonn n&iacute;os forleithne taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht.  Fad&oacute;, th&aacute;inig an pobal le ch&eacute;ile i meitheal chun an fh&eacute;ir a sh&aacute;bh&aacute;il.  T&aacute; an n&oacute;s seo le feice&aacute;il sa seanfhocal &ldquo;n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile&rdquo;, agus aonta&iacute;m go hioml&aacute;n leis.</p> <p> Agus m&eacute; ag caint ar mheitheal, cuirim mo bhu&iacute;ochas in i&uacute;l don Teach seo as an taca&iacute;ocht a fuair m&eacute; f&eacute;in agus oifigigh mo Roinne le linn an phr&oacute;isis fada seo.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas don Taoiseach, don T&aacute;naiste, agus don Aire, an Teachta Madigan, a bh&iacute; mar Aire St&aacute;it romham, chomh maith le baill Chomhchoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus na nOile&aacute;n, baill den fhreas&uacute;ra, agus na geallsealbh&oacute;ir&iacute; uile a chuidigh linn teacht go dt&iacute; an pointe seo leis an mBille Teanga.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leo go l&eacute;ir as ucht a gc&uacute;namh, a gcomhairle agus a dtaca&iacute;ocht.  Iarraim ar an D&aacute;il taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don Bhille seo, at&aacute; f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach don Ghaeilge agus neart&uacute; na Gaeilge sa ch&oacute;ras St&aacute;it i gcoitinne.  De bharr seo, molaim an Bille seo don Teach.</p> <p> T&aacute; m&eacute; s&aacute;sta &eacute;isteacht leis na tuairim&iacute; ar fad &oacute;n bhFreas&uacute;ra faoin mBille seo.  Beimid ar ais sa bhliain nua, le c&uacute;namh D&eacute;, chun an Dara C&eacute;im a chr&iacute;ochn&uacute; agus chun dul tr&iacute;d an bpr&oacute;iseas, ag obair leis an gcomhchoiste chun smaointe a fh&aacute;il faoin mBille seo.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas ar&iacute;s do chuile dhuine as ucht a dtaca&iacute;ocht.  T&aacute; a fhios agam go raibh frustrachas orthu go l&eacute;ir maidir le moill an Bhille agus t&aacute; s&eacute; sin pl&eacute;ite go minic sa Teach seo.  T&aacute; an Bille againn anois agus t&aacute;imid ag iarraidh br&uacute; ar aghaidh agus &eacute; a chur tr&iacute;d an d&aacute; Theach chomh sciobtha agus is f&eacute;idir.  Ag an am c&eacute;anna, teasta&iacute;onn uainn &eacute; a phl&eacute; agus tuairim&iacute; na gComhalta&iacute; faoin mBille a fh&aacute;il.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Leas-Cheann Comhairle as ucht an deis seo.</p></speech>

Beimid ag tac&uacute; leis an Dara C&eacute;im ach molfaimid a l&aacute;n leasuithe ina dhiaidh sin.  Cuireann s&eacute; seo an sc&eacute;al a chualamar mar ph&aacute;ist&iacute;, The Emperor&rsquo;s New Clothes, i gcuimhne dom, ina mb&iacute;onn daoine ag tn&uacute;th go m&oacute;r agus ag fanacht le haghaidh &eacute;ada&iacute; nua na r&iacute;, ach nuair a thagann s&eacute;, n&iacute; bh&iacute;onn aon &eacute;ada&iacute; air.  T&aacute; an Bille seo cos&uacute;il leis sin.  T&aacute;imid ag tn&uacute;th leis an mBille seo go m&oacute;r ar feadh na blianta.  Bh&iacute; daoine ag fanacht, agus bh&iacute; cruinni&uacute; ag an Aire St&aacute;it le hOifig an Ard-Aighne maidir leis.  Chuir an tAire St&aacute;it an-obair isteach go pearsanta chun teacht chomh fada leis an l&aacute; seo, mar aon leis an Teachta Connolly, an comhchoiste agus mo chomhghleacaithe, na Teachta&iacute; Aindrias Moynihan agus &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  T&aacute;imid anseo anois agus t&aacute;imid ag fiafra&iacute; cad faoina bh&iacute; an fuss.  T&aacute; a l&aacute;n ruda&iacute; an-t&aacute;bhachtach sa Bhille, ach an rud is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; nach bhfuil ann n&aacute; spriocdh&aacute;ta.  T&aacute; an Rialtas ag tabhairt gealltanais do dhaoine go mbeidh gach rud ceart go leor, agus ag tabhairt a l&aacute;n tuairim&iacute; gur chreid a l&aacute;n daoine, ach gan d&aacute;ta n&oacute; target n&iacute; bheidh aon bhr&uacute; ar dhaoine aon rud a dh&eacute;anamh faoin mBille seo.

N&iacute; bheidh aon ionadh ar an Aire St&aacute;it go mbeidh leasuithe ag teacht maidir leis sin.</p>  <p>  T&aacute; an Bille seo thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach, os rud &eacute; go bhfuil a l&aacute;n ruda&iacute; maithe agus suimi&uacute;il ag tarl&uacute; leis an nGaeilge agus na Gaeltachta&iacute; ag an n&oacute;im&eacute;ad seo, mar na gaelscoileanna, c&uacute;rsa&iacute; ollscoile agus c&uacute;rsa&iacute; fiontair.  T&aacute;imid f&oacute;s i mbaol an teanga a chailleadh, in ainneoin na deiseanna at&aacute; ag teacht &oacute;n obair at&aacute; ar si&uacute;l le Gaeilge agus sna Gaeltachta&iacute;.  Leis an mBille seo, t&aacute;imid ag gealladh do dhaoine a bhaineann &uacute;s&aacute;id as Gaeilge n&oacute; at&aacute; ina gc&oacute;na&iacute; sa Ghaeltacht go mbeidh siad in ann &uacute;s&aacute;id a bhaint as seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; St&aacute;it agus freastal ar chomhlachta&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge, agus go bhfuil meas ag an Rialtas agus an St&aacute;t ar an nGaeilge.  N&iacute;limid s&aacute;sta amh&aacute;in go leagtar amach sa Bhunreacht gur pr&iacute;omhtheanga na t&iacute;re &iacute; an Ghaeilge.  Caithfidh meas na t&iacute;re, an Rialtais, agus na St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;se a bheith leagtha amach freisin.

Caithfimid &eacute; sin a athr&uacute; m&aacute; t&aacute;imid ag iarraidh go mbeidh aon neart ag an mBille.</p>  <p>  T&aacute; an tAire ag d&eacute;anamh a l&aacute;n oibre sna ceantair Gaeilge faoi l&aacute;thair agus caithfidh fios a bheith aige c&eacute; chomh dains&eacute;arach at&aacute; c&uacute;rsa&iacute; ag an n&oacute;im&eacute;ad seo.  T&aacute; daoine ag f&aacute;g&aacute;il na ceantair agus n&iacute;l daoine &oacute;ga ag fanacht iontu, go h&aacute;irithe &oacute; thaobh na ceantair traidisi&uacute;nta de.  T&aacute; ceantair eile &aacute; spreagadh i l&aacute;r na cathrach, &aacute;fach, cos&uacute;il le Cluain Dolc&aacute;in n&oacute; ceantair eile sa chathair seo, i gcathair na Gaillimhe, agus i gcathair Chorca&iacute;, rud a l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn go bhfuil daoine ag iarraidh Gaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id agus go bhfuil suim acu inti.  Caithfimid oibri&uacute; leis na ceantair nua sin agus na seancheantair traidisi&uacute;nta chun Gaeilge a choime&aacute;d.  Caithfidh an Ghaeilge a bheith mar an phr&iacute;omhtheanga sna ceantair sin agus caithfimid cinnti&uacute; go bhfuil misneach ag daoine an Ghaeilge a &uacute;s&aacute;id mar phr&iacute;omhtheanga an lae, i gc&uacute;rsa&iacute; leighis agus oideachais, mar shampla. </p>  <p>  In dteannta leis an mBille seo, t&aacute; pr&oacute;iseas ar si&uacute;l ag an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna maidir le p&aacute;tr&uacute;nacht me&aacute;nscoileanna.

Gan gaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute;, n&iacute;l aon &uacute;s&aacute;id sa Bhille seo.

Sin an taith&iacute; at&aacute; againn &oacute;n bParlaimint Eorpach.  Gan c&uacute;rsa&iacute; oideachais agus gan ghaelchol&aacute;ist&iacute;, n&iacute; bheidh an Rialtas in ann na daoine sin a fh&aacute;il.

Caithfimid an tuarasc&aacute;il sin a cheangal leis an mBille seo agus le strait&eacute;is na Roinne.  C&eacute; go bhfuil an tAire St&aacute;it go pearsanta ag obair go dian sa Roinn, t&aacute; s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir nach bhfuil Aire sinsearach le cumhacht ag seasamh taobh thiar den Bhille seo.  N&iacute;l Air&iacute; &aacute;irithe eile sa Rialtas ag tabhairt a dtaca&iacute;ocht don Bhille seo agus n&iacute;l suim acu ina aspirations.  Caithfimid seasamh suas in aghaidh na hAir&iacute; sin.</p> <p> T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeimid ag teacht ar ais anseo.  Seoladh litir chuig an Taoiseach agus b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go bhfreagr&oacute;idh s&eacute; &iacute;.  Nuair a thagaimid chomh fada le C&eacute;im an Choiste, beidh d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht againn.

T&aacute; gach l&aacute; t&aacute;bhachtach don Ghaeilge agus do na Gaeltachta&iacute; ag an n&oacute;im&eacute;ad seo.

T&aacute; s&eacute; in am obair a dh&eacute;anamh agus strait&eacute;is l&aacute;idir a chur le ch&eacute;ile maidir le c&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta.  Beimid ag tos&uacute; leis an strait&eacute;is agus leis an obair ar Ch&eacute;im an Choiste den Bhille seo.  Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an mBille ach t&aacute; a l&aacute;n obair le d&eacute;anamh agus leanfaimid ar aghaidh leis sin tar &eacute;is na Nollag.</p></speech>

Foils&iacute;odh na ceannteidil in 2017.  T&aacute;imid ag feitheamh le fada an l&aacute;.  Rinne an coiste Gaeilge an-ch&iacute;oradh ar an &aacute;bhar seo agus foils&iacute;odh tuairisc chuimsitheach le linn bliain na Gaeilge in 2018.  Bh&iacute;omar ag s&uacute;il ag an am go mbeadh deis againn Bille Gaeilge a rith n&oacute; Acht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la a leas&uacute; i mbliain na Gaeilge.  Faraor, tharlaigh moill agus moill eile, de bharr an Bhreatimeachta agus mar sin de.  L&eacute;ir&iacute;onn na moille &eacute;ags&uacute;la go l&eacute;ir neamhshuim an Rialtais maidir leis an nGaeilge.</p>  <p>  &Eacute; sin r&aacute;ite, t&aacute; Bille againn anseo anois.  Sin dul chun cinn agus f&aacute;ilt&iacute;mid roimhe.  T&aacute; roinnt mhaith bearna&iacute; ann agus t&aacute; leasuithe ag teast&aacute;il, a mholfaimid san am at&aacute; amach romhainn.  M&aacute; chr&iacute;ochna&iacute;mid an Dara C&eacute;im anseo, an bhfuil s&eacute; i gceist go mbr&uacute;far an Bille ar aghaidh l&aacute;ithreach go dt&iacute; C&eacute;im an Choiste agus tr&iacute;d an ch&oacute;ras gan aon mhoill?  An gcinnteoidh an tAire St&aacute;it dom go mbogfar an Bille ar aghaidh gan a thuilleadh moille?</p>  <p>  T&aacute; roinnt &aacute;bhair faoi leith gur mhaith liom d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach orthu.  T&aacute; &aacute;bhar amh&aacute;in nach bhfuil sa Bhille agus is &eacute; sin spriocanna ama.  T&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh breis daoine le Gaeilge sa St&aacute;tch&oacute;ras chun freastal ar phobal na Gaeilge ar fud na t&iacute;re.  &Oacute;n bpl&eacute; a bh&iacute; againn leis na Ranna &eacute;ags&uacute;la le bliain go leith anuas, is l&eacute;ir nach bhfuil ach 2% n&oacute; 3% de na foirne sna Ranna &eacute;ags&uacute;la compordach agus &aacute;balta a ngn&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge agus freastal ar phobal na Gaeilge.  Caithfear an l&iacute;on sin a ard&uacute;.  T&aacute; roinnt Ranna, cos&uacute;il leis an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna, i bhfad n&iacute;os l&aacute;idre na Ranna eile, ach t&aacute; bearna&iacute; ann.  Caithfear spriocanna ama a leagan amach chun cinnti&uacute; go mbeidh pobal na Gaeilge &aacute;balta pl&eacute; leis na hoifig&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la agus go mbeidh a fhios acu go bhfuil na hoifig&iacute; sin &aacute;balta freastal orthu.  Deirtear i gc&oacute;na&iacute; nach bhfuil an t-&eacute;ileamh ann do sheirbh&iacute;s&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  Tomhaiseann na Ranna an mh&eacute;id uaireanta a &uacute;s&aacute;ideann siad Gaeilge leis an bpobal, ach n&iacute; d&oacute;igh liom gurb &eacute; sin an tslat tomhais ceart.  Feicimid ar&iacute;s agus ar&iacute;s eile nuair a th&eacute;ann muintir na Gaeilge sa t&oacute;ir ar sheirbh&iacute;s&iacute; &oacute; na Ranna &eacute;ags&uacute;la, b&iacute;onn orthu cnaip&iacute; &eacute;ags&uacute;la a bhr&uacute; chun Gaeilge a roghn&uacute; nuair a ghlaoinn siad ar an Roinn agus n&iacute; bh&iacute;onn siad &aacute;balta a ngn&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh l&aacute;ithreach mar gheall air sin.  B&iacute;onn orthu feitheamh go dt&iacute; n&iacute;os d&eacute;ana&iacute; sa l&aacute;, n&oacute; fi&uacute; go dt&iacute; an ch&eacute;ad l&aacute; eile.  Nuair a bh&iacute;onn dithneas ar dhaoine, teasta&iacute;onn uathu br&uacute; ar aghaidh go tapa.  Mar sin n&iacute; f&eacute;idir an t-&eacute;ileamh a thomhais sa bhealach sin, mar go dteasta&iacute;onn &oacute; dhaoine br&uacute; ar aghaidh agus d&eacute;anfaidh siad a ngn&oacute; tr&iacute; Bh&eacute;arla mura bhfuil s&eacute; &eacute;asca teacht ar sheirbh&iacute;s as Gaeilge.</p>  <p>  Mar a luaigh m&eacute;, t&aacute; &eacute;ileamh ann &oacute;n bpobal agus ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh sprioc ama leagtha s&iacute;os sa Bhille.  Mura bhfuil, sleamhn&oacute;idh an t-am ar&iacute;s.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sin f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach.  N&iacute; h&eacute; sin an t-aon sprioc ama amh&aacute;in gur ch&oacute;ir a bheith ann, &aacute;fach.  Mar shampla, baineann alt 4, m&iacute;r an-t&aacute;bhachtach, le litri&uacute; ainmneacha agus aitheantas daoine agus iad i dteagmh&aacute;il leis na Ranna.  N&iacute;l an deacracht ch&eacute;anna ansin mar gheall ar dhaoine a earc&uacute;.  Is r&eacute;iteach teicneola&iacute;ocht don chuid is m&oacute; at&aacute; i gceist.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh s&eacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os &eacute;asca sprioc ama a leagan amach chun go mbeadh na c&oacute;rais &eacute;ags&uacute;la &aacute;balta an litri&uacute; ceart a &uacute;s&aacute;id agus go mbeadh aitheantas daoine &aacute; aithint ag na Ranna.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh sprioc ama ann.</p>  <p>  T&aacute; an-chuid &aacute;bhair eile gur mhaith liom br&uacute; ar aghaidh leo.  An rud is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; n&aacute; go dteasta&iacute;onn uainn, in ainneoin na moille go l&eacute;ir, an Bille a bhr&uacute; ar aghaidh agus na molta&iacute; sin a chur isteach ann.</p>  <p>  Tuigim go mbaineann an sprioc 20% le hearc&uacute; trasna an r&eacute;imse ar fad.  An mbaineann s&eacute; le daoine a earca&iacute;tear go sealadach freisin?</p> <p>T&aacute;im ag tagairt do dhaoine ar n&oacute;s an fhoireann a dtugann comhairl&iacute; contae isteach don samhradh iad n&oacute; docht&uacute;ir&iacute; agus banaltra&iacute; a earca&iacute;onn an HSE go sealadach.  An mbeidh siad san &aacute;ireamh?  Conas a n-oibreoidh &eacute; sin?  Teasta&iacute;onn uainn go mbeadh pobal na Gaolainne &aacute;balta teagmh&aacute;il a dh&eacute;anamh leis an gc&oacute;ras, agus &uacute;s&aacute;id a bhaint as, go compordach ina theanga f&eacute;in.  N&iacute;lim ag caint faoi phobal na Gaeltachta amh&aacute;in, ach faoi phobal na Gaolainne ar fud na t&iacute;re.</p> <p> Tuigim go mbeidh coiste nua i gceist agus go mbeidh a chathaoirleach lonnaithe i Roinn an Aire St&aacute;it.  An mbeidh r&oacute;l co-ordination ag an gcoiste sin?  Feicfimid go bhfuil bearna&iacute; ann &oacute; thaobh an ch&oacute;rais oideachais.  T&aacute;imid ag iarraidh l&iacute;on na gcainteoir&iacute; Gaolainne a ard&uacute; ach, ag an am c&eacute;anna, n&iacute;l freastal ar na Gaeilgeoir&iacute; &oacute; thaobh scola&iacute;ochta de.  F&oacute;gra&iacute;odh s&eacute; scoil nua lasmuigh de cheantair Ghaeltachta inn&eacute;, anseo i mBaile &Aacute;tha Cliath, ach n&iacute; raibh a oiread is Gaelscoil amh&aacute;in san &aacute;ireamh in ainneoin go bhfuil pobal m&oacute;r Gaolainne sna ceantair sin agus ar fud Bhaile &Aacute;tha Cliath.  T&aacute; s&eacute; soil&eacute;ir go bhfuil faill&iacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ar mhuintir na Gaolainne go forleathan.  Tharraing&iacute;omar an cheist seo cheana f&eacute;in.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh an c&oacute;ras sin athraithe chun a chinnti&uacute; nach mbeadh an faill&iacute; ch&eacute;anna &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ar mhuintir na Gaolainne.  Ina l&aacute;n cathracha, n&iacute; bheadh an pobal at&aacute; ag &eacute;ileamh na Gaolainne ina mh&oacute;ramh ach bheadh mionlach m&oacute;r ann.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh freastal orthu sa ch&oacute;ras oideachais chun a chinnti&uacute; go mbeadh breis daoine ag teacht tr&iacute;d le Gaolainn, chun go mbeadh an deis sin ag daoine agus chun an Ghaolainn a choth&uacute; gach uair agus is f&eacute;idir.</p> <p> Beidh leasuithe &aacute; mholadh againn, go h&aacute;irithe mar gheall ar sprioc-amanna.  T&aacute; moill go leor feicthe againn cheana f&eacute;in leis seo.  T&aacute; s&eacute; f&iacute;orth&aacute;bhachtach go mbogfa&iacute; &eacute; ar aghaidh.  T&aacute;im f&eacute;in ag tn&uacute;th le p&aacute;irt a ghlacadh sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht amach anseo agus &aacute;r molta&iacute; a chur chun cinn.  Cabhr&oacute;idh m&eacute; i ngach sl&iacute; gur f&eacute;idir chun Bille n&iacute;os l&aacute;idre a chur chun cinn chun a chinnti&uacute; go mbeidh deis ann don Ghaolainn amach anseo.</p></speech>

Is &eacute; sin an fh&aacute;ilte is m&oacute; a bhfaighidh s&eacute; uaim maidir leis an mBille seo.  T&aacute;imid ag tn&uacute;th leis le tamall fada.  I sl&iacute; amh&aacute;in, is maith an rud &eacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; ann mar thugann s&eacute; deis d&uacute;inn d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach ar an gceist t&aacute;bhachtach seo.  Mar a d&uacute;irt m&eacute;, bh&iacute;omar ag fanacht ar an Aire St&aacute;it agus na hAir&iacute; a bh&iacute; ann roimhe an Bille seo a r&eacute;iteach.  Bh&iacute; siad ag gor ar an mBille seo le hocht mbliana ar a laghad.  An toradh at&aacute; air sin n&aacute; go bhfuil praiseach ann, in ainneoin chuidi&uacute;, chomhairle agus chur chuige an Fhreas&uacute;ra.  Is trua sin toisc go raibh deis againn.  B'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil deis againn f&oacute;s.  Chuala m&eacute; an tAire St&aacute;it ag r&aacute; go bhfuil s&eacute; s&aacute;sta &eacute;isteacht a thabhairt d&uacute;inn.  Cheap muid go ndearna s&eacute; &eacute; sin roimhe nuair a foils&iacute;odh na ceannteidil.  Cheap pobal na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge i gcoitinne go raibh &eacute;isteacht tugtha ach n&iacute;l s&eacute; ann go f&oacute;ill.  Beidh deis againn ag C&eacute;im an Choiste agus ag an Tuarasc&aacute;il Bille i bhfad n&iacute;os foirfe a dh&eacute;anamh de a bheidh tionchar ceart maith aige i leith na teanga seachas Bille a dh&eacute;anfaidh aimhleas ar an nGaeilge.</p>  <p>  Is f&eacute;idir an Bille seo a bheith ina ch&eacute;im ar gc&uacute;l d&aacute; n-acht&oacute;fa&iacute; &eacute; mar at&aacute; s&eacute; faoi l&aacute;thair.  Muna bhfuil ach f&iacute;s ann seachas sprioc, n&iacute; fi&uacute; tr&aacute;ithn&iacute;n &eacute;.  T&aacute; an St&aacute;t beagnach 100 bliain ar an bhf&oacute;d agus ba shin an sc&eacute;al i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.  Deirtear go bhfuil b&aacute; ag an Rialtas don Ghaeilge agus go bhfuil s&iacute; &aacute; cur chun cinn.  N&iacute; leor sin.  N&iacute;or &eacute;irigh le haon duine a t&oacute;gadh le Gaeilge, lasmuigh n&aacute; laistigh den Ghaeltacht, seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; ioml&aacute;n an St&aacute;it, seachas bunseirbh&iacute;s&iacute;, a fh&aacute;il tr&iacute; Ghaeilge riamh.  N&iacute;or &eacute;irigh leo toisc nach raibh aon bhata ann.  N&iacute; raibh aon bhr&uacute; ceart ar an St&aacute;t n&aacute; ar an st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn mar ba ch&oacute;ir.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeimis i bhfad n&iacute;os m&oacute; chun tosaigh ag an staid seo n&aacute; mar at&aacute;.  T&aacute; t&iacute;ortha eile timpeall an domhain at&aacute; tar &eacute;is a dteangacha d&uacute;chasacha a athbheochan agus a shl&aacute;n&uacute;.  T&aacute; siad i mbarr a r&eacute;ime sna t&iacute;ortha sin.  Th&oacute;g na t&iacute;ortha sin c&eacute;imeanna nach bhfuil t&oacute;gtha ina n-ioml&aacute;n sa t&iacute;r seo.</p>  <p>  N&iacute;lim ag caitheamh anuas ar an Aire St&aacute;it.  T&aacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; d&eacute;anta aige n&aacute; mar at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag Air&iacute; eile.  T&aacute; dul chun cinn d&eacute;anta.  M&aacute; chuirfear na hathruithe at&aacute; molta i leith an ch&oacute;rais oideachais i bhfeidhm ina n-ioml&aacute;n, c&eacute;im chun tosaigh a mbeidh ann.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh mic l&eacute;inn agus iad si&uacute;d at&aacute; ag obair sa st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras in ann an f&oacute;n a fhreagairt i nGaeilge tar &eacute;is 14 bliain de scola&iacute;ocht.  T&aacute; s&eacute; tubaisteach go bhfuil an sc&eacute;al anois n&iacute;os measa n&aacute; mar a bh&iacute; s&eacute; 50 bliain &oacute; shin.  T&aacute; daoine ann nach bhfuil focal Gaeilge ar bith acu.  Is tubaiste &eacute; sin.  Is l&eacute;ir nach bhfuil an cur chuige againn.  N&iacute;lim ag cur an mhille&aacute;in ar an Rialtas amh&aacute;in ach is &eacute; at&aacute; i gceannas ar an St&aacute;t seo agus is aige at&aacute; na pingin&iacute; agus an chumhacht dl&iacute;the a chur i bhfeidhm a mbeadh tionchar acu ar Ghaeilge agus ar Ghaeilgeoir&iacute; na t&iacute;re.</p>  <p>  Thar na blianta, nuair a lorg daoine go mbeadh f&iacute;ne&aacute;lacha n&oacute; pion&oacute;is ann d'eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; nach raibh ag comhl&iacute;onadh cearta Gaeilge, d&uacute;radh n&aacute;r bhealach ceart &eacute; an cur chuige sin.  D&uacute;radh go mbeadh ruda&iacute; ceart go leor &oacute; thaobh na Gaeilge.  T&aacute; an meon c&eacute;anna le feice&aacute;il sa Bhille seo.  Thar na coic&iacute;se deireana&iacute; ach go h&aacute;irithe, l&eacute;igh m&eacute; agus chuala m&eacute; go raibh fadhbanna ag an Aire St&aacute;it cur ina lu&iacute; ar na hAir&iacute; agus Ranna go leagfa&iacute; s&iacute;os sprioc 20% d'fhoireann a bheith l&iacute;ofa sa Ghaeilge agus go mbeadh 2030 ina sprioc do gach uile Ranna St&aacute;it &eacute; sin a bhaint amach.  Tuigim cad a bh&iacute; curtha ina choinne agus an meon at&aacute; ann sa st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras mar is &eacute; an meon ceannann c&eacute;anna &eacute; agus a bh&iacute; ann i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.  T&aacute; an st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras agus an St&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;s, seachas daoine aonair f&eacute;in, coime&aacute;dach.  D&eacute;antar iarracht an c&oacute;ras &eacute; f&eacute;in a chosaint agus b&iacute;onn eagla ann nuair a thagann athr&uacute; chun tosaigh.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; radacach 20% a lorg.  N&iacute; ch&oacute;ir dearmad a dh&eacute;anamh air sin; n&iacute; rud radacach &eacute;.  Bheadh s&eacute; d&aacute; nd&eacute;arfainn go mbeadh Gaeilge ag 100% de st&aacute;tseirbh&iacute;sigh roimh 2030, fi&uacute; gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh tar &eacute;is 100 bliain.  T&aacute;imse r&eacute;ala&iacute;och go leor chun a thuiscint go dtarla&iacute;onn ruda&iacute; mar sin diaidh ar ndiaidh agus cuibhseach mall, go h&aacute;irithe nuair at&aacute;thar ag caint faoi dhaoine ag leibh&eacute;il dhifri&uacute;la thar beagnach 50 bliain.  N&iacute;l aon spriocdh&aacute;ta leagtha s&iacute;os.  N&iacute; deirtear go mbeadh 20% ann faoi 2030, 30% faoi 2035, agus mar sin de ar aghaidh.  Luaitear 20%.  B'fh&eacute;idir go dtarl&oacute;dh m&iacute;or&uacute;ilt agus go nd&eacute;anfadh an st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras an 20% sin a aimsi&uacute; go huathoibr&iacute;och faoi am &eacute;igin a roghn&oacute;idh an coiste comhairleach at&aacute; le bun&uacute;.</p> <p>Go bhfios dom, bh&iacute; s&eacute; i gc&oacute;na&iacute; d'fh&iacute;s ag an St&aacute;t go mbeadh an St&aacute;t d&aacute;theangach.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; agus n&iacute; raibh &oacute; buna&iacute;odh &eacute;.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os fearr i dtr&eacute;imhs&iacute; difri&uacute;la ach &oacute; thosaigh m&eacute; ar scoil agus &oacute; thosaigh m&eacute; ag labhairt na Gaeilge den ch&eacute;ad uair ag bliain d'aois, bh&iacute; s&eacute; deacair orm mo ghn&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge gan cur as dom f&eacute;in.  Caithfidh m&eacute; seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; a lorg, seasamh amach, n&oacute; fanacht beag&aacute;in&iacute;n breise d'am.  T&aacute; s&eacute; seo sa Bhille.  T&aacute; iarracht d&eacute;anta sa Bhille d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach air sin.  Is &eacute; sin at&aacute; &aacute; r&aacute; agam; is f&eacute;idir &eacute; sin a athr&uacute;.</p> <p> B&iacute;onn fadhbanna ann le foirmeacha.  Sa l&aacute; at&aacute; inniu ann, b&iacute;onn r&iacute;omhair&iacute; i gceist maidir le sol&aacute;thar foirmeacha, f&oacute;in a fhreagairt, agus ruda&iacute; mar sin.  D&aacute; bhr&iacute; sin, n&iacute;l leithsc&eacute;al ar bith ann.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os deacra 30 n&oacute; 50 bliain &oacute; shin gach uile fhoirm, ar n&oacute;s iarratais ar phas, a chur ar f&aacute;il i nGaeilge.  Anois t&aacute; s&eacute; deacair go leor teacht ar fhoirm ar bith i st&aacute;isi&uacute;n Garda ach is f&eacute;idir iad a fh&aacute;il ar l&iacute;ne.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeifear in ann cnaipe a bhr&uacute; agus gach uile fhoirm St&aacute;it a fh&aacute;il tr&iacute; i nGaeilge n&aacute; i mB&eacute;arla.  N&iacute;l leithsc&eacute;al ar bith ann.  </p> <p> N&iacute;l leithsc&eacute;al ar bith as ainmneacha gach uile chomhlacht St&aacute;it gan a bheith as Gaeilge &oacute;n t&uacute;s.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go craobhscaoiltear iad i nGaeilge seachas teideal B&eacute;arla a &uacute;s&aacute;id.  T&aacute;im ag d&eacute;anamh na harg&oacute;inte sin &oacute; toghadh m&eacute;.  Gach uile uair a bhuna&iacute;tear comhlacht nua St&aacute;it ag rialtas, tugtar ainm B&eacute;arla air agus ceann sa Ghaeilge tar &eacute;is sin.  Ba ch&oacute;ir go n-ainmneofa&iacute; i nGaeilge iad ar dt&uacute;s agus go dtabharfa&iacute; leagan B&eacute;arla air tar &eacute;is sin n&oacute; go bhf&aacute;gfa&iacute; amach leagan B&eacute;arla.  N&iacute; dh&eacute;anann s&eacute; aon difr&iacute;ocht.  M&aacute; thagann comhlacht &oacute;n tSeap&aacute;in n&oacute; &oacute;n gC&oacute;ir&eacute;, is cuma sa tsioc leo c&eacute;n ainm at&aacute; ar eagra&iacute;ocht.  &Uacute;s&aacute;idtear an teideal at&aacute; ann.  Foghlaim&iacute;onn daoine conas &eacute; a fhuaimni&uacute; mura bhfuil an teanga acu.  Tuigeann daoine &oacute;n St&aacute;t Aontaithe n&oacute; &oacute;n gC&oacute;ir&eacute; Aer Arann agus Aer Lingus.  N&iacute; lorga&iacute;onn siad go n-aistr&iacute;tear go teanga difri&uacute;il an t-ainm.  N&iacute; ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh muid ag glacadh leis go gcasann an st&aacute;tch&oacute;ras agus an pobal i gcoitinne ar an leagan B&eacute;arla i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.  Chuir s&eacute; sin m&uacute;isc orm thar na blianta. </p> <p> Beidh a l&aacute;n molta&iacute; le d&eacute;anamh agam.  An fhadhb at&aacute; le leasuithe a chur isteach n&aacute; go dt&oacute;gann s&eacute; am d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leo.  Mhol m&eacute; go bhfoilseofa&iacute; an Bille agus go rithf&iacute; tr&iacute;d na Tithe &eacute; chomh tapaidh agus is f&eacute;idir.  N&iacute;l m&eacute; ag iarraidh moill a chur air seo.  M&aacute; t&aacute; an tAire St&aacute;it s&aacute;sta glacadh le molta&iacute; agus leasuithe ag C&eacute;im an Choiste, d&eacute;anfaimid iarracht &eacute; seo a acht&uacute; faoi dheifir roimh thoghch&aacute;n.  M&aacute;s rud &eacute; nach bhfuil an tAire St&aacute;it chun glacadh le leasuithe chun an Bille seo a l&aacute;idri&uacute;, n&iacute; fi&uacute; tr&aacute;ithn&iacute;n &eacute; seo agus ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar bhealach &eacute;igin eile.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go n-&eacute;ireoidh linn leis an mBille seo agus go mbeadh fiacla aige nuair a thagann s&eacute; amach ag deireadh an ch&oacute;rais.</p> <p> Nuair a deirim fiacla, is pion&oacute;is at&aacute; i gceist agam.  Chuala m&eacute; m&iacute;ni&uacute; a tugadh faoi c&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach bhfuil fiacla n&aacute; spriocdh&aacute;ta&iacute; sa Bhille.  D&uacute;radh nach dtarla&iacute;onn &eacute; sin.  Tarla&iacute;onn s&eacute; i mbeala&iacute; eile.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; an-&eacute;asca fiacla a thabhairt do reachta&iacute;ocht mar gheall ar iarrth&oacute;ir&iacute; toghch&aacute;in.  Faoin dl&iacute;, mura bhfuil 30% d'iarrth&oacute;ir&iacute; toghch&aacute;in de ph&aacute;irt&iacute; &eacute;igin ina mn&aacute;, gearrtar airgead &oacute;n bp&aacute;irt&iacute; sin.  Is f&eacute;idir &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  Is f&eacute;idir a l&aacute;n ruda&iacute; mar sin a dh&eacute;anamh m&aacute; t&aacute; an toil ann.  N&iacute;lim ag caint faoi thoil an Aire St&aacute;it ach faoi thoil an st&aacute;tch&oacute;rais.  Go minic deirtear linn nach f&eacute;idir linn rud &eacute;igin a dh&eacute;anamh.  D&uacute;radh linn n&aacute;r f&eacute;idir ring-fencing a dh&eacute;anamh ar ch&aacute;in &eacute;igin ach t&aacute; s&eacute; l&eacute;irithe agam thar na blianta go bhfuil s&eacute; ag tarl&uacute; gach uile bhliain.  T&aacute; f&iacute;ne&aacute;il m&oacute;r &aacute; gearradh ar &Eacute;irinn toisc nach bhfuil muid ag clo&iacute; len&aacute;r spriocanna &oacute; thaobh na haer&aacute;ide de.  D&aacute; n-ins&iacute;tear don Roinn Cosanta go dt&oacute;gfar leath an airgid a fhaigheann s&iacute; uaithi mura bhfuil Gaeilge l&iacute;ofa ag 20% d&aacute; cuid foirne agus mura bhfuil an pobal in ann a ghn&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh l&eacute;i tr&iacute; Ghaeilge roimh 2030, bheadh athr&uacute; m&oacute;r meoin ag an Roinn sin thar o&iacute;che.  Bheadh an rud c&eacute;anna i gceist le haon Roinn n&oacute; eagra&iacute;ocht St&aacute;it.  Caithfear d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach air sin.  Mura nd&eacute;anann muid &eacute; sin agus m&aacute; ritear an Bille sin, beidh muid i bponc.  Beidh gach duine ag r&aacute; gur tarrth&aacute;il na Gaeilge &eacute; seo ach n&iacute; tharl&oacute;idh faic.  Cuirfear an mille&aacute;n ar an gcoiste comhairleach.  </p> <p> C&eacute;n f&aacute;th gur g&aacute; d&uacute;inn coiste comhairleach a bhun&uacute;?  D&aacute; mba rud &eacute; go mbeadh pion&oacute;is agus spriocdh&aacute;ta&iacute; ann, n&iacute; bheadh aon gh&aacute; le duine n&aacute; le heagra&iacute;ocht.  B'fh&eacute;idir gur f&eacute;idir le Roinn an Aire St&aacute;it f&eacute;in d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis.  M&aacute;s g&aacute; duine a chur i bhfeighil air sin, t&aacute; an Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga ann cheana f&eacute;in.  Ba ch&oacute;ir an jab sin a thabhairt d&oacute; agus ba ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh cumhacht aige f&iacute;ne&aacute;lacha a ghearradh, deontais a &iacute;sli&uacute;, n&oacute; p&eacute; pion&oacute;is eile a chur i bhfeidhm.</p> <p> Is cearta at&aacute; &aacute; lorg againn.  T&aacute;imid ag lorg &aacute;r gcearta mar Ghaeilgeoir&iacute; agus mar dhaoine a &uacute;s&aacute;ideann an teanga d&uacute;chais chun d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an st&aacute;tch&oacute;rais &oacute; bhun go barr agus &oacute; thus deireadh.  Ba cheart go mbeinn in ann seasamh anseo agus mo ghn&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge, ach n&iacute; f&eacute;idir liom, fi&uacute; san &aacute;it seo.  T&aacute;im tar &eacute;is an arg&oacute;int sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  Is f&eacute;idir liom mo ghn&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; Ghaeilge maidir leis an mBille seo toisc gur foils&iacute;odh &eacute; i nGaeilge.  T&aacute; rud sp&eacute;isi&uacute;il faoin gc&aacute;s seo; b'fh&eacute;idir an Bille a fhoilsi&uacute; i nGaeilge agus i mB&eacute;arla agus an meabhr&aacute;n a fhoilsi&uacute; i nGaeilge agus i mB&eacute;arla freisin.  D&uacute;radh liom n&aacute;r f&eacute;idir &eacute; seo a dh&eacute;anamh le haon Bhille eile.  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th gur f&eacute;idir &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh sa ch&aacute;s seo?  Is f&eacute;idir m&aacute; t&aacute; an cur chuige ceart &aacute; th&oacute;g&aacute;il.  N&iacute; f&eacute;idir liom mo ghn&oacute; reacht&uacute;il a dh&eacute;anamh san &aacute;it seo go huile is go hioml&aacute;n tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  Is f&eacute;idir liom labhairt i nGaeilge gan fadhb ar bith.  T&aacute; aistritheoir&iacute; an-mhaith sa Teach.  T&aacute; jab iontach d&eacute;anta acu thar na blianta.  Is athr&uacute; meoin at&aacute; ag teast&aacute;il.  In 2011, nuair a bh&iacute; Teachta Burton sa Roinn, thug s&iacute; gealltanas dom go mbeadh na meabhr&aacute;in reachta&iacute;ochta ar fad ar f&aacute;il go d&aacute;theangach.  N&iacute;l ceann ar bith foilsithe go d&aacute;theangach &oacute; shin seachas an ceann seo.  Is rud simpl&iacute; &eacute; sin mar n&iacute; rud dleathach an meabhr&aacute;n.  N&iacute; g&aacute; ach aistritheoir a fh&aacute;il.  T&aacute; obair i gceist mar t&aacute; t&eacute;arma&iacute;ocht casta ann.  Bheadh s&eacute; sin ina &aacute;is d&uacute;inn.  Tuigim an arg&oacute;int maidir leis an reachta&iacute;ocht f&eacute;in a bheith as Gaeilge agus as B&eacute;arla.  Is l&eacute;iri&uacute; &eacute; sin d'easpa cur chuige sa St&aacute;t.</p> <p> T&aacute; costas i gceist.  T&aacute; daoine cos&uacute;il le Ivan Yates ag ionsa&iacute; Gaeilgeoir&iacute; as &aacute;r gcearta a lorg.  Is &eacute; sin an dream c&eacute;anna a bh&iacute;onn ag caitheamh anuas ar Shinn F&eacute;in as Acht teanga a lorg sna S&eacute; Chontae.  T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm ach is cearta at&aacute; i gceist.  M&aacute; t&aacute; ceart i gceist, n&iacute;l rogha ann.  D&eacute;antar &eacute;.  Is &eacute; sin an difr&iacute;ocht.  Is &eacute; an fhadhb at&aacute; ann anois n&aacute; go bhfuil Gaeilgeoir&iacute; agus lucht na Gaeltachta tinn tuirseach &oacute; bheith ag &eacute;ileamh na gcearta sin agus seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; tr&iacute; Ghaeilge.  Stopann siad.  T&aacute; B&eacute;arla acu.  Casann siad air sin mar t&aacute; s&eacute; n&iacute;os &eacute;asca orthu.  N&iacute; g&aacute; d&oacute;ibh str&oacute; a chur orthu f&eacute;in.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="10:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800009#G01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32, 33 and 35 together.</p>  <p>  It is clear that this is the moment to finally secure an agreement that will restore the Executive, the Assembly and the North-South Ministerial Council to operation.  The Taoiseach and Prime Minister Johnson spoke on Friday and agreed that achieving this is the top priority for both Governments.  If the Executive is not in place by 13 January, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Julian Smith, has stated there will be an Assembly election.  Nobody sees this as a desirable outcome.  If, however, an agreement cannot be found by then, the people will deserve their say.</p>  <p>  I met the Secretary of State in Belfast on Monday and met him again yesterday.  We believe that an agreement can be found and done in a matter of days - if the parties are ready to come together and do it.  The talks process initiated by the two Governments last May saw real engagement by all the parties, and good progress was made, including on progressing the implementation of outstanding commitments from previous agreements.  We do not believe there is any appetite among the people or parties of Northern Ireland for this process to be extended now.  What is needed are direct leader to leader discussions, political will and political courage.  All the parties have shown in the past that they are capable of showing that leadership in the interests of all the people in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The statements the party leaders made last week following the general election results, indicating that they recognise that people in Northern Ireland want to see them operating power-sharing institutions and that they need to reach an agreement to get back to doing so, were very welcome and important.  The Secretary of State and I have already met the parties separately this week and we will bring them together this afternoon in a round-table format to seek to confirm there is a shared determination to find agreement in the short window available to us.  The two Governments, as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, will continue to do everything we can to support the parties in this.</p>  <p>  I hope the Deputies, all of whom are experienced Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la, will understand that it would probably not be helpful for me to go into the details of what is yet to be finalised or the compromises being discussed.  It would probably have a negative impact if I were to start talking about that publicly.  What I can say is that the bilateral engagements I have had with the parties and the Secretary of State this week have been good.  There are a number of outstanding issues requiring compromises and help from the Governments for the parties to find consensus.  I believe we can do this and that now is the time for the parties to come together to re-establish an Executive and a functioning Assembly in order to allow Northern Ireland to make decisions for itself again in so many areas and, from our perspective, to allow the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement to function again for the betterment of the population of this island, both North and South.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1360" speakername="Se&aacute;n Haughey" time="10:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800009#G01200"><p>It is almost three years since Sinn F&eacute;in collapsed the Executive in Northern Ireland, leaving the people of Northern Ireland without a voice in the Brexit negotiations.  Since then there has been a political vacuum in Northern Ireland, and the lack of a functioning Executive, coupled with instability created by Brexit, has had a particularly negative impact on the region.</p>  <p>  I appreciate what the T&aacute;naiste had to say about the sensitivities of the discussions.  I was going to ask him about the stumbling blocks at this point and the areas where compromise may be needed, perhaps in respect of an Irish language Act or legacy issues.  It is clear that we need the institutions up and running.  There is a crisis in the health services in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The UK general election results were particularly interesting in that business and farming interests made their voices known.  The moderate centre came to the fore, and it would be remiss of me not to congratulate Colum Eastwood and Claire Hanna of the SDLP and Stephen Farry of the Alliance Party on their election to Westminster.</p>  <p>  I wish the T&aacute;naiste well in his endeavours.  I appreciate the constraints he is under.  He certainly has the support of this side of the House to get the institutions up and running.  Does he envisage the talks adjourning today or resuming after Christmas?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.35" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1309" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="10:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800009#G01300"><p>I believe that all of us welcome the fact that these talks have recommenced.  As the T&aacute;naiste said, this is the moment.  For almost three years, Sinn F&eacute;in has worked to achieve an agreement to deliver solutions and end the current impasse.  That should not be lost on anyone in this House.  These solutions would have ensured that every citizen was treated with dignity, parity of esteem and respect.  A lot of progress has been made in this time and a deal was reached in February.  It was agreed by all parties and both Governments.  Sadly, at that time the DUP leadership could not get it over the line and then collapsed the agreement.  We understand people's frustrations at the failure of previous efforts to restore the Assembly, but we need an inclusive Executive that brings together parties that are truly committed to delivering good and inclusive government and change for all.  Sinn F&eacute;in has entered these negotiations in a spirit of optimism and determination to restore the political institutions.  However, political leaders need to demonstrate the political will to restore Stormont on a sustainable and credible basis that guarantees rights and equality for all.  I believe we can do that.  However, after a decade of austerity, underinvestment and stifled economic growth in public services and communities in the North, there also need to be adequate financial commitments from the British Government in order that progress can be made on tackling these issues.  Has the T&aacute;naiste raised these issues with the British Government?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1353" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="10:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800009#G01400"><p>Those of us who have been on the edges of discussions such as this understand perfectly that the T&aacute;naiste cannot be completely upfront and frank with us as to what has happened to date.  I think all of us wish him well in his endeavours because this really is important.  We will not get back the past 1,000-plus days.  It is most regrettable that we have had a shocking void in representational politics in Northern Ireland at this critical time for the island of Ireland during the critical phases of the discussions on Brexit.  It is all the more urgent that we have a solution to these matters now and I hope the T&aacute;naiste's endeavours will be successful in that regard.</p> <p>I would not be as sanguine as the T&aacute;naiste in respect of the option of an election.  Of the 90 MLAs who were elected, several have already opted out of politics.  There has been somewhat of a transformation in mood.  The most recent Westminster elections have indicated that, and I am delighted to see the return to Westminster of two SDLP MPs and one from the Alliance Party.  A fresh mandate might not be a terrible thing, but it would be preferable if we could have institutions up and working right now.  We cannot get back the past 1,000 days, but all of the political parties in Northern Ireland have got a clear message from the electorate while knocking on doors that people expect the institutions to be functioning again, particularly in the teeth of a health crisis and a nurses' strike.</p></speech>

There has been an absence of the capacity to make political decisions, which has had a knock-on consequence in multiple areas.  That absence of a united voice in Northern Ireland during the Brexit negotiations has also been damaging.  It has been polarising, particularly in view of the fact that parties have taken very different approaches to the issues.  The matters that require sensible middle-ground solutions will not be a surprise to people.  For example, language and culture issues are linked to identity, value and a sense of being, who people are in Northern Ireland and where they have come from.  These issues have always been a difficult part of politics in Northern Ireland.  Legacy issues are difficult.  I do not believe that we will be able to solve them during these negotiations, but a marker has been put down that this is a painful and difficult process that Northern Ireland needs to go through.  However, it is a necessary process for trying to bring communities together from a reconciliatory perspective.</p>  <p>  Regarding sustainability, there is a need to change the way in which the Executive and assembly function.  The smaller parties are really strong on this issue.  They are not going to go back into an Executive and be part of a devolved Government in Northern Ireland if they do not feel that their input is valued and their mandate is respected.  That is an important part of what the Irish and British Governments are trying to do.  To be fair to the two larger parties, I believe they recognise that.  They want a fully inclusive Executive and for it to be different this time.  In the context of the Executive's functioning, transparency and accountability, if things are done that should not be done, it should be ensured that there is a consequence and a sanction for same and that we have systems that function, can be relied upon and are not controlled by any one, two or more parties.  These are the kinds of discussion that we are having now and have been having throughout the summer.  Nothing is being rushed - we have been discussing these matters for many months.  What we are trying to do now is close this out and not have an endless continuation of that discussion through the Christmas period.</p>  <p>  The talks will not be adjourned today.  There is work to do in the coming days.  I, for one, am committed to working right the way to and including Christmas Eve if necessary to try to get the right result.  If it is not possible to do that before Christmas, we will take it up again early in the new year in order to ensure that we give the best possible chance of getting a successful conclusion to this process and avoiding what would be an election too many for Northern Ireland.  It is true that parties like the SDLP and the Alliance Party have nothing to fear from an election.  If anything, they have momentum after the general election.  However, they recognise that people in Northern Ireland do not want one.  They have had two general elections and a European election.  We need a period of stable government where parties are working together and giving leadership to bring communities together in Northern Ireland on some difficult issues.  That is what the parties want.  It is certainly what the people of Northern Ireland to whom I have spoken from all backgrounds want.  There was a strong message from the general election to all parties - get back to work in Stormont, start making decisions for the good of Northern Ireland again and start working together.  That message has been heard loud and clear.</p>  <p>  May I answer the question on the financial commitments?</p></speech>

The Prime Minister and the Taoiseach have spoken about the two Governments working together on a number of projects that would benefit communities on both sides of the Border.  I, for one, am committed to that principle.  In terms of strand one issues, Northern Ireland will primarily look for financial support in a series of areas from the British Government.  That is a matter for the Secretary of State and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  I believe I have answered the questions.</p></speech>

In November, the Independent Reporting Commission published its second report on progress towards ending continuing paramilitary activity.  According to it, "paramilitarism remains a stark reality in Northern Ireland" and continues to be a serious obstacle to peace and reconciliation.  The commission also noted the political vacuum in Northern Ireland and the continuing uncertainty regarding Brexit alongside the increasing number of deaths, attacks and other disturbing events linked to paramilitary organisations in the past year.  The task of ending paramilitarism has become "immeasurably more difficult".  The report underscores the real need to have functioning institutions in Northern Ireland and to revitalise the peace process.  As the T&aacute;naiste stated, it is almost three years since the assembly collapsed.  Division and discord have been allowed to fester in the absence of political leadership in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  Who does the T&aacute;naiste envisage being in the Executive once this process is over?  Will all parties be involved at the end of these discussions?</p></speech>

I do not know whether the T&aacute;naiste would agree, but the optics of Mr. Smith's refusal to meet the five party leaders on this issue was regrettable.</p>  <p>  We all want to see an Executive that is transparent, accountable and inclusive.  Last week's Westminster election returned an historic majority of Irish nationalist MPs.  Does the T&aacute;naiste agree with the Taoiseach that these results show a shift in the political tectonic plates?  Will the Irish Government work with all parties here on a plan for uniting Ireland?</p></speech>

I am not sure how more forthcoming he can be about how that is shaping up and what he envisages.  We obviously cling strongly to the Good Friday Agreement because that is the underpinning of the progress we have made in the past 30 years.  Any review of the Good Friday Agreement that might be necessary is something that people are reluctant to consider.  I recall the lines from the old poem:</p> <blockquote> 	And always keep a-hold of Nurse<br /><br />For fear of finding something worse. </blockquote></speech>

They are a very small minority within communities and we need to be very careful not to label certain communities and areas as supportive of, or dominated by, paramilitarism.  The report the Deputy refers to is absolutely right.  Whatever about the challenges for devolved government in Northern Ireland, where parties are working together to deal with a legacy issue that needs a comprehensive response to do away with the criminality, intimidation and bullying of communities that paramilitary structures thrive on, to try to facilitate that without devolved government is very difficult.  In many cases, that puts the PSNI in an impossible and sometimes dangerous position.  I pay tribute to the PSNI and encourage nationalists and unionists to apply to be part of the future of policing in Northern Ireland.  It is really important that we have that balance.  What is needed here for policing and communities is to see political leaders working together to stamp out the impact of paramilitary activity within communities.  I hope that a new Executive will be deeply committed to that and to working with the PSNI to do it, as well as working with community leaders which is as important as policing to bring about that change.</p>  <p>  I need to be careful not to comment too much on the health workers and the industrial action threatened for today because the Irish Government does not have a role in policy and decision making in certain areas in Northern Ireland.  However, it is very clear, and I spoke to the Secretary of State about this, that what is needed to address healthcare concerns and pressures in Northern Ireland is a health minister in Stormont who can negotiate with Westminster to get the funding needed and can change policy in areas where that is needed.  There is a real health crisis in Northern Ireland.  We need a department of health, led by a minister, to be able to make the necessary changes and financial decisions around that. </p>  <p>  In respect of a different form of Executive the important point is that we try to remain true to the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement which does recognise that Northern Ireland would evolve over time.  What we are trying to design is not some fundamental change in direction but recognising flaws in the way in which the institutions functioned before that perhaps contributed to their collapse and trying to ensure that is less likely to happen again in the future.  Ultimately, what will maintain a sustainable Executive in the future will be trust and relationships between political parties and their leaders.  </p>  <p>  Sometimes there is party politics in the way we debate in this Chamber but all of the parties are working hard to restore an Executive.  That includes Sinn F&eacute;in, the DUP and the smaller parties - the SDLP, the Alliance Party and the UUP.  There is no one party, or group of parties, that is trying to deliberately frustrate the process.  There is a real open mind to trying to get a sensible foundation based on compromise and accommodation of other people's views that I believe this time can ensure we are not at another false dawn for a return to devolved government and that we can achieve the restoration of a Stormont Executive and a functioning Assembly in the short term. </p></speech>

We are determined to play our part in shaping the post-Brexit EU.  The Taoiseach, I, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy McEntee, and other Ministers will continue to engage with our counterparts across member states and in the institutions in the period ahead.</p>  <p>  The European Council adopted a new EU strategic agenda last June to guide the work of the Union over the next five years.  Its priorities, namely, prosperity, security, climate change, and upholding EU values, are ones which very much accord with our own values, as set out in last year's national statement on Europe.  We want to see the EU leading on climate change, defending fundamental rights and freedoms, and building a fair and social Europe. </p>  <p>  The new Commission, led by Ursula von der Leyen, is equally committed to implementing the strategic agenda and it very much informs the guidelines which have been set out for the incoming Commission's work.  Last week, we saw the unveiling of the Commission's proposals on the European green deal which aims to make the EU carbon neutral by 2050.  This is a goal which Ireland very much supports and we will work closely with our partners to help achieve it. </p>  <p>  Ireland will engage actively and constructively in the ongoing discussions on the many critical challenges confronting the EU, including agreeing the next EU budget for the period 2021-27, and ensuring that the rule of law and fundamental values are upheld by all EU members.</p>  <p>  We will continue to prioritise building new alliances with like-minded member states.  The steps we have taken in recent years to reinforce our embassies in EU member states, as part of the Global Ireland initiative, will help facilitate this.  We will also develop strong relations with the new leaders of the European institutions.  The President of the European Council, Charles Michel, visited Dublin last month for consultations with the Taoiseach and we hope Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, will also visit in early 2020.  </p></reply>

Fianna F&aacute;il wishes the new Commission well and hopes, among other things, that the next five years will see advances in equality, strengthening of the rule of law and democracy, the promotion of sustainable economic growth, delivery of commitments given on climate change, ensuring Europe has a sufficient budget, an orderly Brexit and agreement reached on the future trading relationship between the EU and the UK.</p>  <p>  The next five years will be critical for Europe and my party has consistently called for Ireland to ensure its voice is heard in debates on the future of Europe and on EU reform.  We believe Ireland should be a leader in this regard and make meaningful contributions to such debates.  The citizens of Europe are calling for reform of the European Union and that debate is overdue.  Can the Minister assure me that Ireland will be to the forefront and proactive in bringing about reform measures which the citizens of Europe are calling for?</p></speech>

We have done a huge amount in consulting Irish citizens on the kind of future for Europe that they want and envisage.  The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, has done a brilliant job in leading a consultation process in different parts of the country, inviting submissions.  I was involved in that process as well and I expect the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, was too.  We got thousands of submissions and public debate on the kind of Europe that we want to be part of in the future.  Many of the issues the Deputy referred to, and that we see the EU now trying to lead on, are consistent with that.</p> <p>I refer to respecting human rights, respecting minorities, having a social as well as an economic Europe, making sure that Europe can impact on other parts of the world in terms of the value system that we advocate for and the kind of democracy that Europe is based on, supporting peace but at the same time responding to new threats and dangers in areas such as radicalisation, and trying to find ways of dealing with significant challenges that the EU is struggling with, for example, migration, in a way that is humane and consistent with international standards and law.  These are issues that Ireland is comfortable discussing and debating and on which we want to try to lead by example.</p></speech>

Also, 12 of the 27 Commissioners are women.  That must be a good thing.  It must be good for the European Union and, indeed, for the future of Europe, and it is worth pointing that out.</p>  <p>  On one of the objectives of Ireland in the context of the EU, I would suggest, as I am sure the T&aacute;naiste will agree, that Ireland should be also at the forefront of defending European values and ideals.  Europe is facing threats, both inside and outside the Union, and it is essential that these issues are faced head on.  The assault on democracy, the rule of law and academic and judicial freedoms in EU states such as Poland and Hungary must be confronted, and my party certainly supports linking EU funding to ensuring that these principles are adhered to.  As I say, the future of Europe is under threat from illiberal regimes, and that is something that all of us must be conscious of and deal with appropriately.</p></speech>

We are losing a strong partner that has advocated on most briefs for the same things that we have been advocating for.  We are losing a powerful partner in many of those arguments.  Therefore, Ireland has been embarking for quite some time, because of Brexit, on building new alliances, turning friendships into political partnerships on important briefs in terms of the kind of approach we want to the Single Market, globalisation, climate change, the rule of law, etc.  The loss of the UK will not simply be a financial or security one for the European Union.  It is something much more fundamental than that, particularly from an Irish perspective, and we need to act to build alliances that can help to compensate for that.  That has taken up a big part of my time over the past two years.</p></speech>

This is a key step to enable an orderly withdrawal and to move on to the future EU-UK relationship discussions.  The European Council discussed the future relationship on 13 December, and adopted conclusions on preparations for negotiations.  The Deputy can be assured that we have been preparing for those negotiations for quite some time.</p>  <p>  Once the UK has left the EU, the European Commission will present a draft negotiating mandate on the future relationship for the Council to consider.  The Commission has established a task force for relations with the UK, led by Mr. Michel Barnier, to co-ordinate work on Brexit.  Having Mr. Barnier leading these efforts is something that Ireland is very strongly supportive of.  Meetings of the European Council, the General Affairs Council and the Committee of the Permanent Representatives of the Governments of the Member States to the European Union, COREPER, assisted by a dedicated working party, will ensure that the negotiations are conducted in line with European Council guidelines.</p>  <p>  Ireland wants to see the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK while also ensuring level playing field provisions to facilitate fair competition.  We will be engaged in all stages of the negotiations to ensure that Ireland's priorities and interests are appropriately reflected in the EU&rsquo;s position.</p>  <p>  The negotiations will be challenging, as is the timeline.  The transition period, which lasts until the end of 2020 may be extended once, by mutual agreement, for up to two years.  A decision on extension is needed by 1 July 2020, and I note that the UK may not wish to extend.  In any event, I would stress that the EU will work hard to secure a successful outcome to the negotiations whatever the timeframe.  Our focus will be on content.  I do not believe the EU will be rushed by any new legislation in Westminster, one way or the other.  The EU will focus on content and getting the right deal as opposed to timelines.</p>  <p>  Substantial work will also be required during the transition period to finalise a range of issues arising relating to the implementation of the withdrawal agreement, including the implementation of the protocol on Ireland-Northern Ireland.  Preparedness work for all possible Brexit outcomes will continue to be important in the phase ahead.</p>  <p>  Protecting Ireland's interests will require a continued whole-of-government effort underpinned by the same cohesive approach that has characterised our Brexit strategy from the start.  We will continue to build on our strong relations with the task force, Commission and member states and engage with Oireachtas Members and stakeholders across the island.  I hope that regardless of what happens next year in terms of a general election here, we will maintain a cohesive approach in this House to get the best possible deal from an Irish perspective through the next round of negotiation.</p></speech>

While this is, of course, preferable to a no-deal Brexit, the deal reached in October represents a hard Brexit and will negatively impact on the Irish economy.  Following the ratification of the withdrawal agreement, the UK will enter a transition period which is due to expire at the end of 2020.  That leaves a few short months to negotiate a future trading relationship which, I think we can all agree, is a challenging timeframe.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, arrangements in Northern Ireland also have to be worked out, in detail and in practice.  The revised Irish protocol ensures that there will be no hard border on the island.  Northern Ireland will be de facto in the EU Single Market for goods and agrifood and complying with the EU's customs code.  This is a complex and complicated situation.  It will require new infrastructure and systems and it will involve increased volumes of paperwork, checks and increased cost for businesses.  It is envisaged that a specialised sub-committee that forms part of the overall joint committee created to manage the new relationship between Britain and Europe will put the protocol on Ireland into effect.  Will the T&aacute;naiste give us any detail at this stage on the specialised sub-committee - who will be on it, how it will work and when will it be up and running?</p></speech>

What is being delivered is not a hard Brexit.  We do not know yet whether it will be a hard or soft Brexit.  That will be determined by the future relationship discussions.  What we have delivered to date is a withdrawal agreement that protects core Irish interests in key areas - the peace process and preventing physical border infrastructure.  Whatever happens in the future relationship now, we have that deal done, and if there is a future threat of no agreement on a future trade deal and because of an absence of an agreement, World Trade Organization rules applying to trade, we will still have the Northern Ireland issues resolved.</p>  <p>  I am confident that a sensible trade deal can be done that allows for tariff-free and quota-free trade between the EU and the UK, but for that to happen the UK must give reassurance to the EU that there is a fair and level playing field for that trade in terms of equivalence of standards across so many areas, including workers' rights, environmental rights, consumer protections and animal welfare.</p> <p>That is what the free trade agreement negotiations over the next year or so will be about.</p> <p> I am confident that we can get a good deal.  Whether it will be possible to get it done in 11 months is a different question.  I do not think we should be distracted by the UK legislating domestically and tying its hands with its own legislation.  The EU will approach the negotiations in the way that it would be expected to, which is to focus on content and getting this right.  This will determine the relationship between the UK and the EU for decades to come.  It will not be rushed.  At the same time, however, everybody wants to move on and get this done in a timely manner to end the uncertainty that continues to revolve around Brexit.</p></speech>

What kind of trade agreement are the T&aacute;naiste and the EU hoping to achieve?  There have been references in the media refer to the bare bones of a trade deal that could be agreed by the end of next year.  Are we hoping for something more comprehensive than a bare-bones trade agreement, with some general issues also covered?  The question of the UK legislating so that an extension will not be sought in the summer is probably more related to internal politics within the Conservative Party.  I accept what the T&aacute;naiste has to say in that regard, namely, that we must proceed without that threat hanging over the EU.  What kind of trade agreement he hoping to achieve for Ireland, as a member state of the EU?  I presume the specialised sub-committee will be up and running in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

He now has a strong majority and can legislate for what he sees appropriate.  Since he has a strong majority, he can also amend that legislation in the future if he wants to.  UK and British legislation is a matter for Britain.  The EU will not be bound by British law and will negotiate on the basis of content and trying to get the best possible deal for the EU, while also respecting the British mandate in those negotiations.  There has been a lot of talk about legislating in a way that prevents the British Government from seeking a further extension beyond next year.  That is a political decision for the British Prime Minister.  Whether legislation is in place is largely incidental in my view because his decision can be facilitated by changing such legislation in the future if he wants to do so because he has a majority.</p></speech>

People should not forget that the next negotiation is not just about a trading relationship, it will also involve bilateral negotiations on fishing, data, aviation, security and a range of other matters.

This represents an increase of almost &euro;21 million on the 2019 allocation and the sixth consecutive year in which allocations to ODA have increased.</p>  <p>  Based on the Department of Finance budget day forecast for GNI in 2020, we expect the ODA-GNI percentage to be in the region of 0.31%.</p>  <p>  The Government is firmly committed to making incremental, sustainable progress towards achieving the UN target of 0.7% of GNI to ODA by 2030.  Reaching 0.7% will require a significant expansion in ODA volumes over the next decade and difficult choices will be required between competing priorities, particularly if economic circumstances change.</p>  <p>  It is essential that the planned growth in ODA is managed effectively and in a manner that ensures optimum progress in advancing our development objectives.  To that end, we are looking to grow capacity and systems to ensure that we can further increase ODA contributions in a responsible way while maintaining the high quality for which Ireland&rsquo;s development co-operation is known internationally.</p></speech>

I recognise that budget 2020 was framed in the context of Brexit.  As a result, I welcome the increase in ODA.  Information released under freedom of information regarding budget negotiations indicates that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade stated in an email to the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform that in order to remain at the Government target of 0.31%, Vote 27 will require an increase of &euro;50 million and that it recognises, in this difficult economic situation, that further increases in the Government's ODA percentage will be very difficult but requests that the Departments agree a roadmap to reach the Government's commitment of 0.7% by 2030.  The email suggests including specific reference to this in the Budget Statement.  As far as I am aware, despite the requests from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister for Finance did not refer to a roadmap in the Budget Statement.  What prospect is there of putting in place a roadmap for this issue?</p></speech>

There is no question about that.  We have made several references to it in the past.  Thankfully, when one speaks about this subject at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, there is absolute consensus among all members that this is the direction in which we need to go.  Last year's increase to the ODA budget was the largest in a decade.  This year's increase was somewhat less substantial in the context of competing domestic priorities, most prominently with regard to a possible no-deal Brexit.  In the context of that very challenging financial environment, the allocation of &euro;830 million to ODA remains a significant budgetary commitment by the Government to international development.  We are well on our way there.  We are anxious to reach that goal of 0.7%, which would push us towards &euro;2.5 billion in spending per annum.  The earlier public engagement process that led to the publication of our new international development policy in February, A Better World, included a number of significant meetings throughout the country.  Thankfully, there is also consensus among the general public that this is the right thing to do.  Nobody need have any fear.  The Government and all of the political parties represented here are determined that we reach that 0.7% target.</p></speech>

The fulfilment of this ODA target represents an essential commitment, on which the poorest nations depend.  Several other countries have met this target and we must actively strive to do the same.  I think I know what the Minister of State's answer is going to be, namely, he would like to work with all the parties to bring about this roadmap and to achieve the target, but perhaps he might confirm that.</p></speech>

I met Emma and Jake DeSouza yesterday to discuss their case, along with political representatives from three different political parties, which is very encouraging.  This was a very constructive meeting and we agreed to remain in ongoing contact as the Government engages with the new British Government to secure a satisfactory solution.</p>  <p>  Citizenship and identity provisions are central to the Good Friday Agreement and it is vital that they are upheld.  Emma DeSouza is an Irish citizen and this is provided for and protected under the Good Friday Agreement.  The decision of the tribunal in the DeSouza case on 14 October does not define the extent of the British Government&rsquo;s obligations under the agreement.  In the Good Friday Agreement, the Governments "recognise the birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both".  It, therefore, includes an explicit right to both Irish and British citizenship, and an explicit right of people to identify and be accepted as Irish or British, or both.  Sensitive and generous approaches by the British Government are needed to ensure this is meaningfully provided for in law.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has raised the DeSouza case with the British Prime Minister and will do so again.  I have discussed the matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on a number of occasions, including yesterday, when we met in Belfast.  In February, then Prime Minister, Theresa May, acknowledged the serious concerns in this area and pledged to "review the issues around citizenship urgently to deliver a long-term solution consistent with the letter and spirit" of the agreement.  I have written to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the British Home Secretary to formally ask that this review be urgently concluded to provide an outcome that is consistent with the letter and spirit of the agreement.</p>  <p>  I found Emma DeSouza to be a really impressive individual yesterday, and she is very well informed in regard to what she is trying to do.  This is a test case for many other people as well, and she sees it as that.  That is why we will continue to work politically with our partners in the British Government to try to get an acceptable resolution to this issue.</p></speech>

I acknowledge and commend his work on the case up to now.  The T&aacute;naiste's comments that no one should have to go to court to assert their rights to be identified as Irish or British citizens, and their right to be respected, are also welcome and bring clarity from the Irish Government to this case.</p>  <p>  This rights case goes to the heart of the citizenship section of the Good Friday Agreement.  The agreement is crystal clear on the terms of citizenship.  Emma DeSouza is an Irish citizen and it is unacceptable that she should have to go to court to prove it.  I know the Irish Government's support is appreciated but, given the fact the British Home Office continues to drag Ms DeSouza through the courts, continued Irish support and defence of the rights of Irish citizens is vital.  It would not be unprecedented for an Irish Government to support an Irish citizen who is trying to assert their rights.  I again appeal for the Irish Government to do whatever it can in this regard.  It is long past time the British amended their laws in regard to citizenship provisions.  We all know citizenship and identity provisions are central to the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste has raised the case with the British Government.  What does he believe should happen next?  What is the next step we should expect from the British Government? </p></speech>

Therefore, while we want to support Emma and Jake DeSouza, I believe the best way we can do that is through political influence and conversation with the British Government.</p>  <p>  My relationship with the Secretary of State, Julian Smith, is very good.  I know this is a decision that may well be taken by other Cabinet members in the British Government.  Certainly, there was the commencement of a review mechanism under then Prime Minister May and we would like to see that review concluded and providing a successful outcome.  While I do not think the Irish Government should be prescribing how the British Government does this, certainly, the Irish Government, as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, has a responsibility to make sure people who were born in Northern Ireland and want to be considered as Irish should not be prevented from accessing entitlements and rights that everyone in Northern Ireland should be able to access as a result of that identity.  We will continue to pursue this issue until it gets resolved. </p></speech>

The ongoing legal battle has been a huge financial strain on the DeSouza family and they are currently fundraising online to help raise funds for the legal case.  They have had to make huge financial sacrifices.  I am aware the Oireachtas justice committee has agreed to write to the T&aacute;naiste to explore practical support for Emma and Jake DeSouza in the context of the Irish Government being co-guarantor.  What practical support can the Irish Government give this family?  Despite the warm words and promises from the British Government, it is actually using its taxpayers' money to challenge Ms DeSouza's Irish citizenship and a core premise of the Good Friday Agreement in the courts.</p>  <p>  It is practical support that is needed and I do not think it would be unprecedented to provide it.  I know of other court cases the Irish Government has taken in the past to assert citizen's rights.  It would be helpful to the family.  Collectively in this House, we are looking for practical ways to offer support.  Particularly given the fact the Irish Government is co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, this is one way of practically supporting them. </p></speech>

I understand the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission is also producing a report on this case and it will be published around 16 January.  That will be an interesting read.  There is activity to try to resolve this case.  The best way we can help Emma DeSouza is to resolve this politically in the short term, if we can, so that she does not have to continue to pursue her interests in the courts, which is an expensive and risky process for her financially, and I can totally understand that.  We had a good discussion on this yesterday.  I said we would keep in contact with Emma and Jake DeSouza, and we will.  Hopefully, we will be able to try to make some progress on this issue in the short term to bring an end to the need for ongoing legal challenge.</p></speech>

I am seeking to have the widest possible range of passport services made available to people in County Cork and the southern region such that, for example, they do not have to travel halfway across the country to Dublin to get a passport in an emergency, and then travel back to Cork.  I understand the passport reform programme has been considering various efforts.  Is it considering the provision of passport printing facilities in Cork?</p></reply>

It operates three passport printing machines, two of which are located in the main production facility in Balbriggan, County Dublin, with another in the Passport Office in Lower Mount Street, Dublin.  Passport applications from citizens residing in Ireland or elsewhere in the world are distributed for processing across the three Passport Offices.  All passport applications are processed through the centralised automated passport service system.  All production facilities can print a passport, irrespective of the channel through which the application is processed.  The printing system allows for flexibility between printing machines if any one machine has reached capacity.  Each passport printer has a printing capacity of 250 passports per hour.</p>  <p>  The purchase cost of a new passport printing machine is in excess of &euro;1.7 million, excluding the cost of security, maintenance, technical fit-out, staffing or rental costs.  Given the current capacity for printing and the costs involved, installing further passport printing facilities in the Passport Office in Cork is not required at this time.  I am satisfied that the printing capacity of production equipment currently employed by the Passport Service is sufficient to meet the current and anticipated future demand for passports.  There are no plans at this time to commission additional passport production equipment or sites.</p>  <p>  The Passport Office in Cork can facilitate the issuance on the spot of an emergency passport where there is an urgent need to travel for medical reasons or due to a bereavement abroad.  In the relatively small number of non-emergency cases where citizens require a rapid turnaround on their passport application, applicants can either book an appointment at the Passport Office in Dublin and have the application processed that day, or book an appointment for the Passport Office in Cork and have it processed within three working days.</p></speech>

In the interests of balanced regional development, I am seeking that a service be made available such that people would have access to the faster turnaround and be on an equal footing.  It should not be all Dublin-based.  We should explore the possibility of having services distributed throughout the country.  Cork is the only Passport Office outside Dublin and it does not have a printing facility.  The purchase of new machines is not necessary, although it is an option.  Alternatively, the existing machines could be moved.  There are several ways of dealing with this issue and I am not calling for one particular solution but, rather, that we ensure there is a faster turnaround in Cork.  Has the passport reform programme looked at the possibility of having additional printing facilities in Cork?</p></speech>

I asked my officials to consider that possibility.  We looked at cost, as well as the printing capacity in the existing locations.  We have three printers across two locations in Dublin.  As I outlined, the numbers in respect of providing printing facilities in Cork did not add up.  People have lobbied me for a passport office in Northern Ireland, given the number of people seeking passports there.  More than 80% of applications to renew or access a first passport are completed online and, as such, the system and its efficiency do not rely on the location of the printers.  We need to keep the matter under review.  I am not saying "No" indefinitely but, rather, that the current capacity that is sufficient and the Passport Service is running efficiently.  If there is a genuine emergency, people can get an emergency passport at short notice in Cork.</p></speech>

It has gone from 2.1 million passengers in 2015 to 2.4 million in the past year, with further connectivity to a hub in the Netherlands, as well as Paris.  People want to use the south, including Cork Airport, as a gateway to travel around the world.  Having a passport is crucial to such travel.

If a person in Cork, Waterford or Kerry needs to travel in an emergency, he or she can get an emergency passport on the spot from the Passport Office in Cork.  If a person wishes to go on travel for reasons other than an emergency, there is a turnaround time of three days for those who need a passport quickly.  We have managed to achieve a situation whereby normal passport renewals completed online are returned within a week.  We have put in place a very efficient system.  I take the Deputy's point that sometimes people make a legitimate mistake by not checking their passport when due to go away and, as a result, need a fast turnaround time.  Some people need to drive to Dublin to get a passport.  It is not true to say that one cannot get a passport in Cork on the spot.  One can do so if there is a genuine emergency.  We are putting systems in place that are far more efficient than was previously the case.  Turnaround times are far faster.  That is the reform programme on which we have been focusing rather than trying to place printers in various parts of the country to try to service everybody locally, which would have a knock-on consequence in terms of efficiencies.  I am not saying "No" forever regarding printing in Cork.  The reform programme we have implemented in the past two years has focused on turnaround times for everybody.</p></speech>

A few weeks ago, he met the other Taoiseach in these islands, the Scottish First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, and the Secretary of State for Scotland, Alister Jack.  I understand they established a bilateral view on areas of co-operation.  Obviously, everything has changed since the British general election and, clearly, Scotland will be moving towards independence.

I engaged with the Irish community there and economic partners, as one would expect. I also met the Cabinet Secretary for Government Business and Constitutional Relations and was honoured to address parliamentarians at an event in the Scottish Parliament hosted by its Presiding Officer, Ken Macintosh.</p> <p>The purpose of these engagements was to build on the strong cultural, political, economic and community ties that exist between our two countries.  The visit took place in the context of a strategic review of Irish-Scottish relations, which I announced jointly with the Cabinet Secretary, Ms Hyslop, at the beginning of November.  This review will examine the relationship between our two countries to identify current collaboration on matters devolved to Scotland and how we might build on this to enhance our overall relationship.  This is a unique exercise in that it is the first time we are undertaking a review of this kind of joint co-operation with another jurisdiction.  From my meetings in Edinburgh, I came away with a strong sense of the interest in, and appreciation for, our bilateral relationship.  Through our consulate in Edinburgh, established 21 years ago, and the Scottish Government Hub in Dublin, we have worked intensively to deepen that understanding and collaboration.  I am confident that this review will result in a joint report with recommendations and will contribute significantly to strengthening that relationship for the future.</p> <p> Brexit, and the EU-UK future relationship discussions to follow, will undoubtedly present some challenges for our bilateral relationships with the UK as we work with EU partners to secure the best possible outcome for Ireland and the EU.  Strong and close relationships with the UK Government and individually with the devolved Administrations will be of ever-greater importance during this time and in the years ahead.</p></speech>

It was the Men of Ulster, or Ulaidh, who first established the Scottish kingdom.  Throughout the Middle Ages, Irish people were referred to as "Scots".  What practical steps will happen in terms of co-operation?  I know that the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, are establishing a joint health forum.  The Scottish have a national health system, because they have Scotland's NHS.  What can happen in a practical way in that area?  Scotland has an outstanding track record in education.  The T&aacute;naiste might have seen recently the University of St. Andrews was given the title of the best university in the world.  The Scottish have a separate legal system as well.  Scottish MSPs and civil servants attended a meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  They told us about their innovative programme for gender budgeting and other initiatives.  What definitive help will we give to them, particularly in the context of us being an independent member of the European Union and their hope to have the same status?</p></speech>

Regardless of the future of Scotland, this review is focusing on areas of co-operation that involve devolved powers for a devolved government in Scotland as opposed to anything else.  It is important not to create expectation on some of these issues.</p>  <p>  The review will comprise three parts: an external mapping exercise aimed at detailing current government-to-government co-operation and where it can be grown; a round of external consultations with stakeholders focused on looking beyond government in the areas of business and the economy, community and diaspora, academic and research links, culture, and rural, coastal and island communities - working together and learning from each other; and a public questionnaire aimed at garnering the opinion of the public on where the relationship can be enhanced and developed into the future.  We will have the results of that review in the medium term, in the next couple of months.  That will have clear recommendations, and I look forward to implementing those.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned the islands.  In terms of language, there will be discussion on a language Act for the North in the coming days, but Scotland is a country that has a native language that is virtually the same as our own native language.  Will there be any particular developments in that regard?  We know of BBC Alba and how close the two languages are in that whole cultural area, but there is also closeness in the economic area.  Before our success with foreign direct investment, the Scots had Silicon Glen and were ahead of us on IT.</p>  <p>  We are a member of the European Union and we have to remember that we facilitated West Germany to bring East Germany into the Union.  I think states like Catalonia and Scotland are hoping to, and there may be a situation down the line - we will call it the Catalonia question - where may want to, enter the European Union.  Perhaps that is something that we as existing members of the European Union should be thinking about post Brexit.</p></speech>

We want to be supportive and we want to develop an even closer relationship, with a structure around that relationship, for the future.  We want to be a partner to Scotland.  We want to do that in the context of the overall relationship between Britain and Ireland.  That involves complex political management, for obvious reasons, in the context of Brexit and the political pressures right now in Scotland.  We want to be supportive and a good neighbour, but we also, for the first time, want to put a structure around areas where we can co-operate on a bilateral basis in a way that is constructive for both sides.</p></speech>

As I have stated on several occasions in this House in recent weeks, Ireland and our European partners remain deeply concerned about the credible reports of the treatment of ethnic Uighurs and other minorities in the Xinjiang region, including arbitrary detention, widespread surveillance and restrictions on freedom of religious belief.  We have raised our concerns with our Chinese counterparts in both bilateral and multilateral contexts, and, along with EU partners, we continue to do so. </p>  <p>  Ireland was one of 23 states to sign up to a joint statement on this issue at the UN General Assembly Third Committee on 29 October. This statement called on the Chinese Government to implement urgently eight recommendations relating to Xinjiang made by the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, including refraining from the arbitrary detention of Uighurs and members of other Muslim communities.  In July this year, Ireland was one of 22 states to sign up to a joint letter at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.  This letter expressed concerns about credible reports of arbitrary detention in large-scale places of detention as well as widespread surveillance and restrictions.  The letter called on the Chinese Government to uphold its international obligations to and respect for human rights in Xinjiang.</p>  <p>  The issue has also been raised at EU level, both bilaterally and in multilateral fora, including at the EU-China summit and EU-China human rights dialogue in April this year.  During the dialogue, the EU noted that while actions to counter terrorism are essential, these actions must respect the principle of proportionality, fundamental freedoms and international laws.</p>  <p>  The Government is also closely monitoring the ongoing protests in Hong Kong.  I am concerned, in particular, about the violent confrontations that have taken place.  I welcome, however, that the district council elections were held on 24 November without incident and call on all parties to respect the election results.  I also welcome recent moves towards an inclusive dialogue from the Chief Executive, Ms Carrie Lam, and the Hong Kong authorities.</p> <p> With regard to the protests, Ireland fully supports fundamental freedoms such as the freedom to assemble and the right to peaceful assembly.  As I have noted previously in this House, Ireland has consistently called for these freedoms, which are provided for in Hong Kong&rsquo;s basic law, to be upheld.  Whereas the protesters' right to peaceful demonstration should be respected, we should not condone violence.  Dialogue and engagement rather than violent actions will provide the best outcomes for the people of Hong Kong.  At the same time, I continue to call upon the police to exercise restraint and proportionality in its response.</p> <p> Ireland fully supports EU statements on developments in Hong Kong, the most recent of which was released on 18 November by the then High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Ms Federica Mogherini.  This statement recalled the EU's support for the one-country, two-systems principle and reiterated the EU position that restraint, de-escalation and dialogue are the way forward.  It called for confidence-building measures, including an inclusive and sincere dialogue, reconciliation and community engagement and for a comprehensive inquiry into the violence, use of force and the root causes of the protests.</p> <p> At a bilateral level, officials in my Department have engaged with the relevant Chinese authorities to convey our concerns, including with representatives of the Hong Kong Government.  Along with the EU office and representatives of other EU member states in Hong Kong, we will continue to engage regularly with Hong Kong authorities on this matter and to convey our support for dialogue and a peaceful resolution to the protests.</p> <p> Ireland and the EU will continue to monitor developments and engage with Chinese authorities and like-minded partners in bilateral and multilateral fora to address these concerns.</p></reply>

It seems clear that the Chinese authorities are not adhering to the basic law and the 1997 agreement, which was to last for 50 years.  It is effectively an international agreement but China is disregarding it.  The recent local elections mentioned by the Minister demonstrate the vast bulk of the 7 million people in Hong Kong want independent and democratic institutions.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned the UN General Assembly Third Committee, which found reports of detention of large numbers of ethnic Uighurs and other Muslim minorities.  They were being held for long periods without trial and there was mass surveillance that disproportionately targeted ethnic Uighurs.  We had a ludicrous statement from the Chinese authorities yesterday or earlier today that 1 million detained Uighurs have now graduated from these camps.  The current position is untenable and outrageous.</p></speech>

There has been a lull in the severity of the violence and ongoing tension but it is obvious that there was an outbreak of violence on a smaller scale last weekend.  There was a very disturbing report that on previous occasions first responders and other medical staff were detained by law enforcement agents while they tried to provide assistance to the injured.  As the Minister indicates, the values supported by the Hong Kong protestors included freedom of expression and the right to peaceful protest, and these have been seen as threats to the Hong Kong Government.</p>  <p>  We can see what has happened in China to Uighurs and other Muslim minorities so we cannot really hold much hope that the Chinese would respect the democratic will of the people in Hong Kong, as we saw in recent election results.  A great deal depends on China but I do not have too much faith in its respect for democracy.</p></speech>

Ireland is trying to use the influence we can bring to bear in the international fora in which we operate.  Within the United Nations we have been both vocal and, I would like to think, quite courageous when many other countries were not signing a joint statement at the UN General Assembly Third Committee.  Ireland decided it would do so because we wanted to be part of the process of shining a spotlight on this matter.</p>  <p>  It is important to say that our relationships with China are probably better than they have ever been.  My relationship with the Chinese ambassador is very good.  I met the Chinese Foreign Minister this week, albeit briefly, in Madrid.  From my experience, the way to get results and use influence is through political engagement.  That is what we will continue to do.</p></speech>

We have a report today that Han Chinese are being sent to every household in the country to continue a level of oppression.  How can we deal with a country that seems to have a network of concentration camps?  That is a clear point.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste indicated that these two major international letters have been signed that concern the matter.  Is it not time to start thinking about sanctions?  The Minister has correctly said that trade between China and the entire European Union has grown exponentially.  We are using Chinese phones and other equipment.  Is it not time to talk seriously about sanctions and major steps to address the oppression of the Uighurs, who are the majority in their state, and the people of Hong Kong?</p></speech>

It is good to hear that the T&aacute;naiste met the Chinese Foreign Minister and that he has a relationship with the ambassador here.  It is about keeping these matters on the agenda.  The demands of the protestors are something we would take for granted here.  They include the withdrawal of the word "riot" and unconditional release of arrested protestors without charge, as well as an independent inquiry into police behaviour and the implementation of genuine universal suffrage.  There has been no real concession on the part of either Ms Lam or the Chinese Government; it is extremely unlikely that such a concession will come.</p>  <p>  We have heard from China the way in which the Chinese media have portrayed what happened in Hong Kong.  It certainly did not give a true account that the protestors were seeking democracy.  We must be a stronger voice but I know trade is probably dictating our response.</p></speech>

It is true to say we have an increasing trade relationship with China but we have trade relations with many countries which, at times, have had questions to answer in respect of human rights.  We have raised those questions.  Ireland needs to continue to be courageous in raising these matters, shining a spotlight on parts of the world where uncomfortable questions and conversations need to take place.  The way to do this is not to jump immediately to calling for sanctions but rather to seek engagement.  My experience with China and its ministers is that they are more than willing to engage in conversations that may be uncomfortable as long as it is done in a respectful rather than threatening way.  That is the approach we continue to take, and it does not mean that we do not raise matters at international forums which force people to have uncomfortable conversations.  It is a really important role for Ireland to play.</p></speech>

I met senior representatives of the Government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, as well as UN officials from United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, UNRWA; the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, UNTSO; and the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, OHCHR.</p>  <p>  At the previous meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council, FAC, on 9 December in Brussels, I briefed EU Foreign Ministers on my visit.  In following up the matters I raised, the FAC will discuss the Middle East peace process in more detail at its next meeting in January, and I look forward to participating in that discussion.</p> <p> I remain engaged with the small group of participants who gathered in Dublin in February of last year to consider how best to encourage a move towards a just and durable peace.</p> <p> The Israel-Palestine conflict featured in several of my discussions and meetings during the high-level week at the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September, including my meeting with a senior White House adviser, Mr. Jared Kushner.  In that meeting, I clearly conveyed Ireland's encouragement for any efforts that can bring about genuine progress, made clear Ireland's support for the long-agreed parameters of a two-state solution and communicated Ireland's well-known views on the expanding settlements in the West Bank.  All settlement activity is illegal under international law.  Ireland's view represents the settled international consensus.  I have been unequivocal about this in public statements when the question of settlements has arisen.</p> <p> I will continue to ensure the Middle East peace process remains high on the Irish foreign policy international agenda.</p></speech>

What is the T&aacute;naiste's view on the initiative that has been taken by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg, Jean Asselborn, to start a debate at EU level on Palestinian statehood?  Does the T&aacute;naiste support the initiative?  He may be aware that Mr. Asselborn has suggested that the EU should have a greater involvement in this matter.  What is the T&aacute;naiste's view on that?</p>  <p>  I would also like to ask the T&aacute;naiste about the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018, which is before the Oireachtas.  I am aware that there are different legal interpretations of this Bill.  At the very least, it has shone a light on the need to do something to try to address the imbalance in power that exists between Israel and Palestine.  I wonder whether the T&aacute;naiste has anything to say about the progress of the Bill.</p></speech>

The EU needs to defend the two-state solution as an outcome of that process and to stand up for international law and its interpretation.  As a result of my efforts and those of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg, a comprehensive debate on how the EU might be able to do these things more effectively will take place at the next FAC meeting on 17 January 2020.</p>  <p>  The Deputy probably knows my view on the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018.  I do not believe there are "different legal interpretations" here.  The Attorney General's legal interpretation is crystal clear.  Ireland should not do this.  Legally, it cannot do this.  I understand the frustrations of people about the lack of progress with the Middle East peace process.  I understand why this Bill has emerged, but I do not believe it represents the right approach.  My views on the legality and consequent appropriateness of this legislation are clear and on the record.</p></speech>

I do this on my behalf, on behalf of the Ceann Comhairle and on behalf of the Acting Chairmen, who are so helpful to us.  I wish to express my sincere thanks to the Clerk of the D&aacute;il and Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas Service, Mr. Peter Finnegan, and to all the staff of the House.  They play a very important role in the smooth running of the House.  I thank the entire staff for the professional manner in which they look after all of us and the support they provide to Members.  I thank the press corps for the role they play in our democracy by reporting our proceedings.</p>  <p>  Christmas remains most special to all of us.  When we go to our homes over Christmas, we have to remember those who struggle on the margins of our society.  This Christmas will be a very lonely one for the many people who find themselves without homes of their own.  We should remember those people.  Christmas is a time to reach out and assist those who find the journey of life very difficult and burdensome.  I wish all of you a very happy and blessed Christmas.  I know this will be a Christmas where we have a break to recharge the batteries.  This might be necessary, bearing in mind events that may take place in 2020.</p>  <p>  Ar mo shon f&eacute;in, thar ceann an Cheann Comhairle agus thar ceann na Cathaoirligh Ghn&iacute;omhacha a bh&iacute;onn sa Chathaoir seo go minic, ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a chur in i&uacute;l leis na Teachta&iacute; go l&eacute;ir.

I want to place on the record our great appreciation for the hard work and diligence of the staff of the Oireachtas.  They often demonstrate their patience with all of us.  This place simply could not function without them.  Christmas is a time for family, for renewal and for hope.  I wish everybody beannachta&iacute; na f&eacute;ile.  I hope people have an enjoyable Christmas.  To those who are on my Christmas list and those who are not, Nollaig shona in equal measure.</p> <p> I heard an Leas-Cheann Comhairle's very wise words on how we should recall those on the margins and people who are struggling this Christmas.  Sometimes when those words are said very sincerely, they sound rather hollow to those who are struggling.  I would like us to make a new year's resolution that when we return we will make true and be true to that Christmas promise.  I wish the leaders of Government, Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il, a good rest as we undoubtedly head towards an election.  I wish them well under the mistletoe as they snuggle up together over another Christmas season.  I suggest that in the new year, the best present that could be brought is a new Government, new politics, new hope and renewal because those things are not just for Christmas.</p></speech>

I extend good wishes to the Ceann Comhairle and hope that he will rejoin us here in full health and vigour early in the new year.  I wish every Member a restful sojourn over the Christmas break.  As others have stated, we probably face into more challenging times early in the new year.  I do not mind winter elections, we have had them in the past, and whatever comes, comes.  I thank all the staff of the House, the Captain of the Guard and his team, all the ushers, the catering staff and everyone who works in this place to make it function.  I always say that it is an extraordinary privilege to be elected to this House, the national assembly of the Irish people.  We clash with each other during the year but it is an extraordinary privilege and I thank everyone who makes it work as well as it does.  Sometimes we are critical of ourselves but when we look at the functioning of other places, we are not a bad democratic House and democratic forum for the people of Ireland.  I look forward to reconvening here in the new year, early or late, and to carry on our collective work on behalf of the people of the country.  I re-echo the view that there are people who find Christmas very difficult, who do not have homes to go to and who do not have what we all expect to have, such as a decent Christmas dinner.  It is appropriate not only that we reflect upon them but that we resolve to ensure that things are better for all citizens of Ireland in the coming year.</p></speech>

I look forward to coming back in the new year.  I hope that the election will happen sooner rather than later in order that we will have the opportunity to change the roles of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, which I would welcome.  On behalf of the group, we echo the views of An Leas-Cheann Comhairle in respect of those who are having a difficult time and who will have a difficult time over Christmas.

I thank the Captain of the Guard, the ushers, the canteen staff, cleaners, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and everybody who is involved in this House.  It is an honour and a privilege to be here.  I hope Santy will come to the Taoiseach and enlighten him to give us the election date.

Up to 1,300 providers have been left without insurance cover following a letter from their broker, Padraic Smith, who said that he had spent the past six months trying to find alternative insurers through intermediaries and so on.  Providers now have only weeks to find an alternative.  Many quotes they have received represent a dramatic increase on their existing premiums, from &euro;1,500 to &euro;4,500 in some cases and in others from &euro;3,500 to &euro;9,000.  Without question, this is causing real stress and anxiety not just for providers but also for many parents who simply will not be in a position to find alternative places, as was revealed on last evening's edition of "Prime Time".  The sector is in crisis for a number of reasons.  There is a shortage of places, the goal posts relating to regulatory burdens have been changed and there are questions regarding the credibility of the career pathways for many working in childcare.  It must now have to deal with what is potentially an existential insurance crisis.  The Government's response to date has been very confusing.  It was slow off the mark and the degree to which it seems to have been caught by surprise is incredible.  Different Minsters have also been dismissive.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach stated that childcare services are mostly private businesses and are expected to cover their costs by the income they receive, and that seemed to be it.  Equally, the Taoiseach indicated that the Department did not know about this until 6 December.  I find that extraordinary, particularly in view of the fact that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, said that he was aware of the impact on various sectors in June.  Mr. Peter Boland of the Alliance for Insurance Reform went before the joint committee in April and told it that many sectors, including that relating to childcare, faced existential crises in the context of insurance.  I would like clarity on when the Government discovered all of this.</p>  <p>  This morning, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy D'Arcy, stated that the new, increased rates were essentially reasonable and that the childcare providers should get on with it and take them on board.  He stated that what is involved would amount to &euro;60 per child, which he said should be reasonable.  He must know that the cost of childcare in Ireland is much higher than the OECD average in terms of its impact on net income.  Affordability is a big issue and an additional cost on parents is not sustainable.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, stated that she was shocked and stunned and indicated that something would have to be done.  Deputy Darragh O'Brien put forward a constructive solution in respect of this matter to the Minister in April whereby any childcare provider that operates an early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme would be able to access insurance via, for example, IPB Insurance, which is capitalised to the tune of &euro;1.5 billion and has &euro;600 million in a retained income.  An approach like that or else a subvention will be required to resolve this matter.  Why was the Government so unaware of the issue of insurance in the childcare sector?  The Taoiseach must be concerned about that lack of awareness.  What does he intend to do to ensure that cr&egrave;ches can stay open in 2020?</p></speech>

Many parents are worried their cr&egrave;che or childcare provider might not be open in the new year and that they may see a steep increase in fees in the new year.  The Government is working very hard to make sure neither of those scenarios arise.  I met the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, and her Secretary General yesterday to discuss a number of matters relating to children and youth affairs and this was one of them.  We are working together with the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, the industry and others to make sure we have a solution.</p>  <p>  The vast majority of childcare providers, close to 100%, are now registered for next year so people can be given the reassurance they will not find out when they go to their cr&egrave;che or childcare provider in the early new year after the holidays that they are not open.  They will be open.  That is not to say there will not difficulties finding insurance in the next few weeks.  As things stand, only one underwriter, Allianz, is currently providing insurance to childcare providers following the exit of Ironshore from the market.  Up to 1,300 childcare providers have been affected by Ironshore's exit, with most of their policies due to expire on 31 December.  Allianz, through its broker, Arachas, has stated it is willing to consider quotes for all affected services.  Quotes are being processed within 24 hours of applications in the vast majority of cases.  As of today, the majority of the providers impacted by Ironshore - 869 of 1,300 - have been given quotes.  The balance can be processed within a short timeframe and, therefore, reports of thousands or even hundreds of the services closing appear to be inaccurate.  There may be a very small number of high-risk services which may not receive quotations.</p>  <p>  Providers are reporting increases in premiums that range from 10% to significantly higher than that, but it is understood the majority of services will experience an increase at the lower end.  It is worth pointing out that the provider that is exiting the market had been offering insurance at much lower rates.  The average cost of insurance from Allianz, the insurer that is staying in the market, for full-time childcare is &euro;60 per annum per child and the average cost for sessional services, such as the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme, is &euro;25 per annum per child.  While parents pay an awful lot in childcare fees in Ireland, only a very small proportion of it is required to cover insurance, roughly &euro;60 a year on average and less is some cases.</p>  <p>  The insurer has said that premiums of over &euro;450 per annum can be paid monthly by direct debt, reducing the immediate impact on providers' cashflow in the new year.  This is an issue we are seized of and on which we are working, and I am confident that parents, when they bring their children back to their cr&egrave;che or childcare provider in the new year, will find the cr&egrave;che or childcare facility will be open.</p></speech>

The Government must have been aware that this was a looming crisis within the childcare sector.  The response has been very lethargic since then.  Likewise, Peter Boland of the Alliance for Insurance Reform raised an existential crisis facing sectors, including the childcare sector, at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach in April 2019.</p>  <p>  What the Taoiseach seems to have said here this morning is that everything will work out fine and there will be no difficulties.  Is that what he is saying or does he acknowledge that many cr&egrave;ches will be facing significantly higher insurance costs as a result of the exit of one insurer from the market?  The OECD average for childcare costs is 12.6% of net family income.  In Ireland, it is 27.4% so there is a real affordability and cost issue in Ireland.  The additional costs will find their way to the parents and they will have to pay the additional childcare fees.</p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach explain why the Government seems to have been caught so unawares?  He has said the Government was working behind the scenes.  Can he bring more clarity to what that means in terms of helping cr&egrave;ches to ensure their viability and continuance into 2020?</p></speech>

I do not agree with his assessment.  We have all been aware for a very long time that there is a general issue regarding the cost of employers' liability and public liability insurance.  We set up an interdepartmental working group to deal with those issues a very long time ago and we have been implementing its recommendations as recently as yesterday, with the establishment of the Judicial Council.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific issue of Ironshore pulling out of the market, I only became aware of that in the last couple of weeks and I think it is the same for others.  As to where we are now, one insurer, Allianz, is still in the market.  It is a good and reliable insurer, which has been there for a very long time.  It is willing to offer quotes to those childcare providers which were insured with Ironshore previously at an average rate of roughly &euro;60 per child.  Ironshore was offering very low cost insurance.  Allianz offers insurance at a premium of about &euro;60 per child per year.  Work is ongoing to see if we can get another insurer into the market.  As good as Allianz is, it would be better if there were two or three insurers and a degree of competition.</p>  <p>  In terms of the general issue of affordability, the Government absolutely acknowledges that the cost of childcare is a huge burden on very many families.  More so than any other Government in the history of the State, we have been active in improving that.  We brought in two years of guaranteed preschool provision for children.</p></speech>

We brought in increased and longer maternity benefit, parental benefit and paternity benefit for the first time.  This is very much a Government that is building a society with the family at its centre and that is trying to make life easier for families.</p></speech>

Insurance companies have been exposed for charging customers extortionate premiums, despite the fact that claims have fallen significantly and those same companies' profits continue to soar.  There was general outrage when motorists discovered the extent to which they were being ripped off.  There is an ongoing issue for every festival, playground, community organisation and GAA club with their insurance costs but now, disgracefully, our childcare services have fallen prey to the same greedy arrogant insurance industry.</p>  <p>  At the core of this problem is the fact that we rely on private provision for early childhood education and for childcare.  That is the nub of it.  The root of this problem is that childcare providers have no option but to rely on the vagaries of market forces and market providers which can decide whether they will open their doors.  All of that needs to change and it is my strong belief that we need to move towards making early childhood education and care a public service.  That is the answer to this but that will take considerable work.  However, in the here and now, all those childcare providers, parents and childcare workers - who not alone do not have a structured career pathway, as Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin would have it, but are very low-paid, are in very insecure work and, for the most part, are women - want to know that the doors of the cr&egrave;ches will open in January.  I am alarmed to hear the Taoiseach, on the one hand, speculate about the concern - it is actually panic - that families are feeling about all of this and, on the other hand, move to give a reassurance that registration of these cr&egrave;ches is in order and that they will open in January.  The fact is if they do not have insurance cover, they will not be opening in January.  The Taoiseach speculates that the new quotations and premiums will be reasonable but that is not the evidence we have heard from any number of providers.  One in Tallaght, for example, with which Deputy Crowe has been working, has had a &euro;1,000 hike in its premium.  It provides for ten children, one of whom has special or additional needs.  Other premium hikes range from &euro;600 to &euro;2,800.  These are breathtaking additional costs and if they can be met by the provider, which is not a certainty, they will come out of the pocket of parents.</p>  <p>  We need Government intervention.  The Taoiseach needs to give solid assurances to parents, childcare workers and providers that they will be able to operate in January.  That means the Government has to step in.</p> <p>Simply to recommend to those families that they cross their fingers and hope the market will be good to them is frankly not good enough.</p></speech>

I am not entirely sure what she means by stepping in, but perhaps in her further reply she can outline exactly what she would do if she was in my position.  Whether it is a public provider or private provider, insurance is still needed, and whether it is a public or private, a provider can still be sued.  That applies to schools, hospitals and community centres.  Anybody is at risk of being sued and almost any concern needs insurance, whether it is public or private.  There is still an insurer in the market, namely Allianz SE.  That insurer is willing to offer cover to cr&egrave;ches and childcare facilities at an average rate of &euro;60 per child per year.</p></speech>

That firm is now out of the market.  Allianz is still there, offering insurance to childcare providers at an average cost of &euro;60 per child per year.  It has already offered insurance to 869 of the 1,300 providers formerly covered by Ironshore, and is willing to make offers to others within 24 hours.  I am confident that this situation is under control and will be resolved.  I totally understand that parents are worried, as I acknowledged earlier.  As the Deputy said, some of them may even be panicking.  It is our job not to cause them to panic or add further worry.  That is why we should be factual in our comments and not add to parents' concern, anxiety and worry at this time of year.  This is being dealt with.</p></speech>

The facts of the matter are that very many childcare providers believe they will not be able to meet additional insurance costs and therefore may not be in a position to open their doors in January.  They are the only facts we need to face.  The last thing I want to do is cause panic or anxiety to any parent or childcare worker.  Therefore, they have to have a more concrete response from the Government rather than the Taoiseach, with the greatest of respect to him, sounding like an advertisement for Allianz and say what a great provider it is.  Perhaps it is, and perhaps its premiums will be reasonable, but that is a considerable gamble.  It is a considerable statement for the Head of Government to make given what we know about insurance costs and the behaviour of insurance companies in this State.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach asked me what he needs to do.  He needs to give assurance to providers, parents and childcare workers that where those premiums are extortionate or cannot be met, the State will step in on an interim, one-off basis to assist those providers.  That is not ideal, but as I said earlier, it is not ideal that we regard childcare and early years education as a matter for the private market.  We need to fix that, but in the here and now the absolute priority is that people have complete assurance that their children will have a place in care in January and childcare workers will have jobs to go to.  That is how serious this is.  I will ask directly.  In the event that Allianz does not meet the Taoiseach's high expectations and the premiums cannot be met by providers, will the State step in with a subvention or emergency fund to make sure the doors open in January?</p></speech>

If an insurer is unable to provide cover for a particular facility, be it a cr&egrave;che, a childcare provider or anything else, there may be a good reason for that.  There may be a very high risk in insuring it, for a particular reason.  For the State to wander in blindly, no questions asked, and offer to cover the bills of a private company or even a public body would be an entirely reckless thing to do.</p></speech>

In one of the last Leaders' Questions put to the Taoiseach in 2019 before the Christmas holidays, it is apt to mention the deplorable state of the health service.  In particular, I refer to Letterkenny University Hospital and the legacy of this Government to date.</p>  <p>  This week the HSE published its national service plan for 2020, following approval from the Government.  While it includes several measures, the plan will not specifically address bed capacity or staffing issues at Letterkenny University Hospital and it does nothing to end the current HSE embargo.  The plan for 2020 has been allocated a budget of &euro;17.4 billion by the Government.  This is a record-breaking budget, the largest in the history of the State.  While this represents a 6.3% increase in funding compared with 2019, it is clear that the plan will do nothing to alleviate the effect of the current HSE embargo on the quality of healthcare in Letterkenny University Hospital and across Donegal.</p>  <p>  The embargo, or, as the Taoiseach continues to call it, the interim control measures, was introduced in April and was supposed to last for only three months.  As we enter 2020 with the HSE service plan in place for next year, this embargo is no longer a so-called interim measure.  It has been reported that as part of the Government's official directions to the HSE when drawing up its service plan, the Department of Health sought to maintain the employment restrictions.  That means hospital overcrowding at Letterkenny University Hospital will continue, as will the staffing crisis at that hospital and the resulting decline in patient safety.  Letterkenny University Hospital has some of the highest numbers of patients on trolleys this year, with 47 people waiting when I last raised this issue with the Taoiseach in November.  This problem is not confined to Letterkenny University Hospital but also applies to community services right across the county.  In Donegal alone, more than 100 posts lay vacant despite being approved by the national recruitment service.  The embargo is here to stay, and if this Government returns after the next election, it will continue.</p>  <p>  What is worrying is that the HSE has indicated that it will need an additional &euro;420 million to address demographic, technological and other pressures and to tackle unmet need.  An extended and more intense recruitment embargo will continue as a result.  This vicious cycle will remain in place if Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il continue with it.  It is up to the Taoiseach to break this cycle.  Will the Taoiseach signal an end to the HSE embargo or interim control measures in 2020?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.182" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800021#T01300"><p>I thank the Deputy.  Following Government approval, the HSE published its service plan for 2020 yesterday.  The budget for the HSE next year is &euro;17 billion, the biggest ever budget for our health service, and an increase of more than 6%.  While the Deputy rightly points out that we have a growing and ageing population, a 6% increase is more than what is required to meet the resultant demographic demand.  A lot of that money, roughly half, will go into additional pay and pensions for our healthcare staff.  We stand over that.  We want to be able to pay our staff better and pay them more, and that is why so much of next year's budget will go into pay and pensions.  Roughly half of the increase will go directly to staff in pay increases, pensions and the hiring of additional staff.  I thank the HSE, the new board and the new CEO for the professional and collaborative manner in which the service plan was drawn up this year.  It was so much more professional and collaborative than in previous years.  We have seen a dramatic improvement in financial planning and management under the new CEO and board, and I am grateful to all of them for that.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Deputy's question about the embargo, I know he has read the service plan and knows it provides for an increase of 3,000 in the total number of staff in our health service.  Increasing staff numbers by 3,000 does not constitute an embargo.  This time next year 3,000 more staff will work in our health service than today.  However, managers are no longer permitted to hire staff for positions that are not funded.  That is the norm across the public service.  It was not the norm in the health service for a very long time.  Now it is, as it should be.  Because normal public service rules now apply and staff cannot be hired for positions that are not funded, the deficit for the HSE is dramatically lower than in previous years.  Principals cannot hire teachers that are not funded and Garda inspectors cannot hire garda&iacute; that are not funded.  We now have a normal set of rules in our public service and health service when it comes to the hiring of staff.  There will be 3,000 more staff in our health service next year.</p>  <p>  There will also be additional funding for community services and extra home care hours.  For the first time, the budget for disability will exceed &euro;2 billion in one year, which will mean more places for school leavers with disabilities, more autism services, additional respite care, more personal assistant hours and more residential places for people with disabilities who are no longer able to live at home.</p> <p>Often they have ageing parents who cannot look after them anymore.  There are additional palliative care beds: 55 in Kildare, Mayo, Waterford and Wicklow following the opening of the new hospices.  I do not think so many hospices have ever been opened in one year.  There is additional funding for the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, to widen eligibility and reduce prescription charges, to extend free GP care to six year olds and seven year olds and make it easier for people over 70 to get a medical card.  There is funding for the maternity strategy, the cancer strategy and the trauma strategy.  There is &euro;1 billion for mental health for the first time, additional funding for the fair deal scheme to make sure that waiting times do not exceed four weeks, or at least stand at an average of four weeks, additional funding for the voluntary hospices such as Marymount Hospice, St. Francis's Hospice and others, to begin to equalise their funding with the statutory hospices and additional funding for winter capacity.  By no means will the extra staff and extra money solve all our problems in the health service, but it does give us a fighting chance of making some real improvements next year.</p></speech>

Even with what the Government is doing, we will still be here next year talking about a deficit in the HSE.</p>  <p>  Why did we not get the service plan before budget 2020 so that we could see what it was intended to do?  The reality is that we will still be in crisis early in the new year, as the winter bug hits, and right throughout next year.  While the Taoiseach says there will be extra funding, the Cleary Centre will still not have a new building.  Seaview House respite home, Lifford hospital, iCARE and the Bluestacks centre will still be looking for funding.  St. Joseph's in Stranorlar and all those other hospitals right across Donegal will all be in need because of the Government's inaction and its lack of recognition of the fact that health services need more than just money and highlighting the extra money the Government is spending on health.</p></speech>

However, I do not disagree with Deputy Pringle.  Of course we will have problems and challenges in the health service next year, just as we have had in every previous year, and just as every other country does too.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Pringle pointed out some of the difficulties we will face next year, it would be remiss of me not to point out some of the positive things that will happen next year.  We will see two new hospitals open in Ireland next year: the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and the national forensic mental health campus in Portrane.  We will see three major extensions open: the Dunmore wing in Waterford, the new wing in Limerick and the new wing in Clonmel as well.  We will see healthcare become more affordable for many more people.  Seven and eight year olds will get free GP care.  More people over 70 will get a medical card and prescription charges will go down for everyone.  We will see patient outcomes continue to improve.  More people will survive stroke next year.  More people will survive a heart attack next year, and we will continue to see improvements in cancer survival, which are already better now than in the NHS, and I believe in the next couple of years will exceed the European average.</p>  <p>  We will also see waiting lists continue to fall.  We have seen the waiting lists for outpatient appointments fall for four months in a row.  It took years of investment and effort to get there but we have got there.  The waiting times for people waiting for operations have been falling for approximately two years.  The number of people waiting more than 12 weeks for a hip replacement or a knee replacement, or for cataract, angiogram, vein and tonsil appointments is half what it was when I became Taoiseach.  We will have lots of problems and we will deal with them, but we will also see lots of improvements too.  Let us acknowledge them because at the very least we should be respectful to the staff in our health service who work so hard to deliver those improvements.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.188" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="12:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800022#U00600"><p>I wish the Taoiseach a very happy Christmas from County Clare in particular.  I wish to raise with him a Bill that was discussed in this House on 26 November, the Thirty-ninth Amendment of the Constitution (Right to Health) Bill 2019, which I introduced.  An amendment was accepted by this House that a report on the Bill would be produced within six months.  However, it will be due on 26 May, which most likely will be beyond the lifetime of this Government.  I want to keep this issue alive on the floor of this Thirty-second D&aacute;il.  I would like to get the Taoiseach's views on the principles of the Bill.  I believe it is a bold and ambitious Bill, a constitutional proposal that challenges the current thinking on health policy and health provision.  It would place a socio-economic right to health into the Constitution.</p><p>The Bill reads:</p> <blockquote> 	i The State recognises the equal right of every citizen to the highest attainable standard of health protection; and the State shall endeavour to achieve the progressive realisation of this right.<br /><br />ii The State shall endeavour, within its available resources, to guarantee affordable access to medical products, services, and facilities appropriate to defend the health of the individual.<br /><br />iii The health of the public being, however, both individual and collective, the State shall give due regard to any health interests which serve the needs of the common good. </blockquote>  <p>The Government did not accept that proposal and, as I outlined, it tabled an amendment.  The two objections the Government made is that the amendment would be justiciable and it wanted to know how it would defend and put a limitation on rights in terms of taking cases to court.</p><p>The second ground on which the Government opposed the Bill was the separation of powers.  The fear was that courts could dictate Government policy and it raised the question of what enforcement powers the courts would have concerning the provisions within the constitutional amendment.</p><p>Health inequality kills, and we certainly have health inequality in Ireland at the moment.  Our two-tier system is a blight on the public service, in particular for the marginalised within the community.  We continue to export our graduates due to the poor state of the health service.  That results in gaps in the service and indefensible delays in the delivery of care, notwithstanding what the Taoiseach has just said.  Such an amendment would place the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare on a constitutional basis rather than as a leisurely option.  There would be no excuse for the Government to delay the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare.  The amendment would act as a driver of health reform and new health policy.  One of the strengths of the amendment is that failure to provide health services that are necessary, reasonable, proportionate and rational can be judged by the courts and, if found wanting, they could direct the Government to act to remedy its failings.  In my view, courts would not decide policy, but could direct the Government to formulate policy and to vindicate a right to health.  The failure of the Government to deliver on our health needs provides a powerful imperative for this amendment.  I would like to get the Taoiseach's views on it.</p></speech>

We were all very much of the view that it should not be dismissed out of hand and that it is something that deserves proper consideration by the committee, as has been proposed, if not in this D&aacute;il then certainly in the next one.  I have always had an open mind on including socio-economic and cultural rights in the Constitution, whether it is housing, education or health, but I also think we need to be realistic about it too.  All of us in this House know that rights may exist in law or they may be put into the Constitution, but that does not mean that they are realised on the ground.  Eighty-three countries have a statutory right to housing but every single one of those has homeless people.  Just making something a right in law or in the Constitution does not necessarily mean that it happens on the ground in the real world.  It does not provide resources or money when money is not available.  It does not help one to find staff if the staff are not available.  It does not build buildings that do not exist.  Governments have to do that, in particular by running an economy well to produce the resources to allow them to do that.  No constitutional provision can change that reality or that fact of life.</p>  <p>  The second thing we must bear in mind as well is that we need to be cautious not to create new rights and new legal obligations that may put people in a position whereby they can sue the State and receive compensation for not having those rights vindicated.  None of us wants to see hundreds of thousands of euro being paid in compensation payments to people who did not get healthcare when that money could have been spent on healthcare, or hundreds of thousands of euro being paid to people because their right to housing was not vindicated when that same money could have been spent building a house.  We need to be smart about these things.  If we are going to put something into the Constitution, we must fully tease out the sequelae and the unintended consequences.  That is the reason I think we are taking the right approach by referring it to the committee for detailed consideration either in this D&aacute;il or the next.</p></speech>

For instance, we have a constitutional right to primary education.  That is a socio-economic right that is already within the Constitution.  This amendment would oblige the Government to act to provide health services to meet the needs of citizens.</p> <p>Only if it failed to demonstrate that would there be a right to appeal to the courts to have it vindicated.  The wording in the Bill, to the effect that there would be a progressive realisation of rights within available resources, gives sufficient protection such that there would not be a sudden march to the courts if the provision were introduced.  No longer could the Government say that it is doing its best.  If this measure were introduced, the Government would be obliged to do much better than its best.  It would be obliged to vindicate a right to health.  It would occur in respect of cases such as that of Alex O'Shaughnessy, who has had his chemotherapy deferred on several occasions.  Ninety year old patients are sitting on chairs rather than lying on trolleys in our accident and emergency departments.  An average of 600 patients are on trolleys.  The number is only 552 today, which is a pretty good day, but there are 74 people on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick.  If what I propose were introduced, it could no longer be said we are sorry we cannot meet the targets for the provision of scoliosis services.  The Constitution would oblige the Government to meet them.  Failures such as those I have mentioned and myriad others would be unconstitutional.  The provision would mean the courts could direct the Government to improve the health services.  Failing to do so would be justiciable.</p></speech>

I have an open mind on this but I do not believe that his suggestion is the panacea he may suggest it is.  A constitutional right and a court judgment cannot build a hospital that does not exist, hire specialists who are not available or create resources that are not available.  The Deputy mentioned that he has included in his terms a caveat such that provision be made within available resources.  It should be borne in mind that it is only two years since we have been able to balance the books in this country.  We had an IMF programme before that.  It is only in the past two years that the amount of money we have got in revenue has exceeded the amount we are spending on public services and other matters.  Up until two years ago, the courts would presumably have said the resources were not available, and that would have been of no benefit to anyone.</p>  <p>  I agree with the Deputy on something, namely, that the two-tier system within our public hospitals is wrong.  The Cabinet approved a proposal on Tuesday that the Ministers for Health and Finance will outline later today.  It is to offer a new contract to hospital consultants, including new consultants who want to become consultants in our system or existing consultants who wish to move to the contract.  The new contract will provide a salary scale to hospital consultants of between &euro;180,000 to &euro;222,000 now, rising to &euro;250,000 per year in 2020, on the proviso that the consultants taking up the contract commit to work in our public hospitals only and dedicate themselves to our public health service.  This is a major change.  Linked to that is a Government commitment to increase the number of consultants by a net 1,000 over the next ten years.  We will press ahead with this.  This is Sl&aacute;intecare happening.  We have done a good deal with the general practitioners, of which the Deputies are aware.  Progress is being made in that regard.  We are now willing to make a deal with consultants and offer them &euro;250,000 per year provided they commit to our public hospitals and public health service alone.</p></speech>

His mother was on "Prime Time" last night.  It was probably the last place she wanted to be because her son's operation was postponed again.  It had to be deferred last week because of a shortage of intensive care nurses at the time.  I hope the operation will take place soon.  Eoin has 94% curvature and, at 16 years of age, is in great pain.  This should give the Taoiseach cause for thought and reflection before he just reels off statistics and figures about the health service.  The boy's mother, Catriona, said that the pressure on the nurses in Temple Street is ridiculous, as is the number of hours they are expected to work.  I refer in particular to the pressures emanating from the emergency departments in the children's hospital.</p>  <p>  Deputy Donnelly produced figures that were presented by the Department and the HSE in regard to children's waiting times across the board, including for therapies and a range of specialties.  They are quite shocking and represent a damning indictment of Government policy.  That is why the HSE service plan is very worrying in terms of additional capacity in 2020.  It seems to me from the remarks of the CEO and the actual plan itself that, in terms of home help hours, children services and so on, 2020 is going to be an extremely difficult year for the health services.  We need a debate in the House as soon as we come back after Christmas, on 15 January, if we come back.  The service plan should be number one on the agenda, in addition to what it entails for the health service and for children like Eoin Ward in 2020.</p></speech>

I became aware of that case this morning.  For many good reasons, I am reluctant to discuss any individual case but I understand the operation has been rescheduled for later this week.  I hope it will go ahead.  I had the distinct displeasure as a junior doctor of having to ring people and tell them their appointments were cancelled.  I remember it well.  I am aware of the kind of stress and worry cancellations cause for people who have taken time off work and packed their bags and who have psychologically prepared themselves for an operation.  Where operations are cancelled, however, they are rescheduled, very often for a few days later and sometimes for the following week.  It is important to state that the total cancellation rate for operations is somewhere in the region of 2% or 3%.  I accept that this does not matter to a patient who is among the 2% or 3% but it is the rate.  Cancellations occur for many reasons.  Sometimes a bed may not be available.  Sometimes key staff are not available.  Staff can get sick too.  Sometimes a piece of equipment may not be working.  Sometimes there are infection-control issues.  Where an operation is cancelled, however, efforts are always made to reschedule within days, if not the following week.  Increasing capacity, such as by building our children's hospital, opening the two hospitals next year and opening three major extensions next year, and taking on more staff will help to reduce the number of cancellations to a rate below 2% or 3%.  We need to be honest with people that sometimes operations will be cancelled for various reasons, but every effort will be made to reschedule them within days.</p></speech>

Since the Women's Aid report was published, a sixth woman has died violently in Ireland this year.  Jasmine, Elzbieta, Cathy, Skaidrite, Valerie and now Nadine have been killed.  They have left 14 children without mothers.  Our hearts go out to Nadine's family, particularly her young daughter.  A total of 231 women have died violently in Ireland over the past 23 years, yet the State's response has been glacial.  While the study commissioned by the Minister for Justice and Equality on familicide and domestic homicide reviews is welcome, it is two decades late.  Ireland urgently needs to establish an independent multi-agency system of domestic homicide reviews, underpinned by legislation, similar to the reviews in Britain since 2011.  The study team headed by Ms Norah Gibbons is due to complete its work in the middle of next year.  I believe there is broad support right across the D&aacute;il, certainly on this side, for the introduction of domestic homicide reviews.  Will the Taoiseach commit Fine Gael to the establishment of such reviews on the completion of Ms Gibbons's study?</p></speech>

Reimbursement is not guaranteed and it would seem to be very arbitrary when it comes to the criteria.  One such person, Ms Pamela Fowler, has given me permission to speak about her son today.  Ryan Fowler has a condition called Gardner's syndrome, with desmoid fibrosis, and his family was granted a ministerial licence this summer.  They were told some weeks ago, however, in a letter they received, that his prescription would not be reimbursed.

Between 70 and 80 people suffer with Parkinson's disease in the Carrick-on-Suir, Clonmel, Cashel and Clonmel areas.  The support group in Clonmel is run by volunteers, namely, patients, sufferers and their families.  Most of those have Parkinson's disease and to date five of those people have passed away.  There has been a fight to get a nurse specialist.  There are four in the country, but none in our region of the south east.  I refer to funding to train nurse specialists and create a course for nurse specialists in Clonmel or in the south Tipperary area.  Ideally, the group would like to have a neurologist and a clinic in the area.  Will the Taoiseach implore and urge the HSE and the Minister for Health to provide nurse specialists and, it is hoped, neurologists to help these people who are doing so much to help themselves?  They are vulnerable people and they are suffers, but they are supporting themselves.

I have been contacted by representatives of Na&iacute;onra Chaitl&iacute;n Maude in my own constituency, which cannot secure insurance for January 2020.  I have the quotes here which refer to double and treble the costs for next year.  Killinarden Community Centre is facing closure because of the cost of insurance for the centre.  It is used by after-school clubs, youth clubs and senior citizens' groups and others.  The insurance cost has risen from &euro;8,000 in 2011 to &euro;34,500 this year.  That is a rise of some 300%.  The community centre is in a disadvantaged area and is being crowdfunded.  The future of Fettercairn Youth Horse Project is under threat after its public insurance increased by almost 500% this year, from &euro;8,520 to &euro;42,000 in February 2020.  That is not sustainable and those are only a couple of examples.  I can give a list of more cases, if the Taoiseach wants them.  This is clearly not working.

I do not wish to add to that, other than to say that everyone in the House will be aware that the Government does not set the price of insurance, because it is a private market, but we can improve the environment in which the insurance sector operates.  One of the big reforms brought in only this week is the establishment of the Judicial Council.  That will lead to a committee of judges that is going to review the level of awards paid to people when it comes to personal injuries and other issues.  We are confident that will help to bring down premiums in the future.</p></speech>

As this Thirty-second D&aacute;il appears to be coming to an end, the opportunity to reform Irish politics radically has been totally missed, as we can see over recent weeks.  I feel that the image of the D&aacute;il bar, where alcohol is available during working hours, sends out a very bad image.  I know of no other workplace where alcohol is served during working hours.  I have no issue with the D&aacute;il bar serving non-alcoholic beverages or with a cafe.  The availability of alcohol here in our workplace is wrong.</p></speech>

I just spoke to a childcare operator in my own constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  She eventually got her policy renewed this morning at a cost increase of 166%.  She is operating on a small and tight profit margin already.  She cannot afford to pass on additional costs to the parents, who are under financial pressure, as we all know.  I appeal to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to ensure that adequate supports are given to the childcare sector to make sure that we do not lose any existing places.  As has been noted, there are great pressures on places in many counties in the eastern part of my own constituency, which is on the outer commuter belt of Dublin.  The last thing we want to do is to lose childcare places.  There cannot be additional costs for parents or for the private or community operators either.</p></speech>

Under the programme for Government, there is a commitment to enhancing the medical sector.  I want to ask the Taoiseach about the turnaround timeframe for medical card applications.  I have several constituents waiting for a reply and it seems the times are getting longer and longer.  In essence, many of these people are very unwell.  It is not the number of medical cards that are being granted, to be fair, it is just the turnaround time.  Is there a reason for the delay, and if so, what is the Taoiseach going to do about it?</p></speech>

Last week, we discussed with the Minister the fact that over 200 childcare providers have not engaged in any way with the system while several hundred others had not completed registration.  At that point, the Minister confirmed that they would not be in a position to be funded in the new year.  Parents and staff are concerned that these providers may not be able to open and services might not be available in the new year.  We know the registration deadline has passed.  Can we get clarity on providers which have not in any way engaged or have failed to provide the minimum amount and, as a result, are not registered any longer?  Are they going to be in a position to reopen in the new year?  Will parents have services available?</p></speech>

I want to raise the issue of insurance for businesses in general.  Every week, owners of filling stations, hotels, playgrounds, as well as community groups, GAA and soccer clubs, tell me how concerned they are about the cost of insurance.  While I acknowledge there has been some movement and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, made a major statement last week on the Judicial Council, when can we expect movement from it?  I have been told quite a number of businesses will announce closures in the new year.  I am sure the Taoiseach and no other Member wants that to happen.  This is a massive crisis facing us.</p></speech>

A part of the council&rsquo;s component is the personal injuries guidelines committee which will assist Deputy Murphy.  It has already met and is scheduled to meet again early in the new year.  Its function will be to lead the recalibration of the book of quantum.  I have no doubt we will see progress on this.

I acknowledge an increase of &euro;1.4 billion in funding.  However, I am astounded the plan is cutting the number of short-stay beds in public units from 1,929 to 1,720, a decrease of 209.  There is no rationale behind this or explanation for it.  It flies in the face of the HSE's capacity review which called for between 5,600 and 6,300 extra beds under the category by 2030.  This cut means the Government is failing to meet a growing need and is ignoring the evidence of several reports which it commissioned.  This will challenge services for older people in 2020.</p></speech>

My recollection is that when one takes the number of beds in the round, such as fair deal, transition care, acute and short-stay, there is an increase.  I do not have the exact details of that.  I will ask the Minister to provide the Deputy with a proper reply.</p></speech>

This is the third time I have raised an issue concerning protected disclosures.  When a protected disclosure is made in the HSE, why is it that the HSE actually investigates its own?  The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, have a copy of the protected disclosure in question.  Everything is being done to discourage the individuals from disclosing what is happening in the system.  They are being punished, their pension has been lost and they are not being paid.  Why is it that there is no clarity, accountability or responsibility when somebody tries to tell the truth, goes through the right protocol but is punished?  This protected disclosure is now being buried.  I need to get answers because this individual is being punished for telling the truth.</p></speech>

There are procedures within the Protected Disclosures Act which outline how they are managed.  First, they are protected which means that the person making any allegation or disclosure cannot be identified, deliberately or inadvertently.  Second, we are not allowed to be told about them because they are protected.  It is a difficult one to answer.  I am sorry.</p></speech>

There was certainly engagement from my office with Children&rsquo;s Health Ireland which manages the children's hospitals.  The children's hospitals are particularly busy at the moment because of the respiratory syncytial virus, RSV.  As we do not have single rooms in our very old children's hospitals, when a virus is rampant in one, there is significant demand and pressure on beds.  In turn, beds have to be closed because of infection control.  That will be very different with the new children's hospital.  Every room in that hospital will be a single room.  We will be able to deal with so many different infection control issues.  There will even be rooms for parents to stay over.</p>  <p>  As an interim measure, some additional beds are being opened over the winter period.  It is only an interim solution, however.  What we need is the new children's hospital.  We needed it yesterday.  It is a pity it was not built during the boom.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, it is not the only State contract awarded which has seen significant delays and cost overruns.  Curraghmore national school in Mullingar is one such contract.  The Minister visited the school in advance of the local elections.</p> <p>It was promised to be opened in September of this year; it was not opened.  It was promised to be opened in October; it was not opened.  It was promised to be opened by Christmas and again it is failing to meet that deadline.  I do not expect the Government to micromanage every State contract, but I expect that contractors who continually fail to meet their contractual obligations should not be permitted to get further State contracts.  Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Education and Skills to revert to me with an exact timeframe for when the pupils and staff can expect to be in their new school in Curraghmore in Mullingar?  Will the Government consider introducing legislation to ensure that contractors who continually fail to meet their targeted timeline and come in over budget will not be looked upon favourably for further State contracts? </p></speech>

Hopefully we can get that school open as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  I point out that overall the schools building programme, the roads programme and the Irish Water programme are running on schedule and on budget.  Of course, some projects are ahead of schedule and some are behind schedule.  Within the confines of European law, we are examining how we might improve public procurement to allow us either to blacklist certain contractors, which is very hard to do unless there is a court conviction against them in which case it is possible, or to have our scoring system take better account of past performance or past underperformance.  The Deputy should bear in mind that as a significant number of tenders end up in litigation, we need to get it right.  The last thing we want is not to award a contract to particular contractors, have them sue us, delay the whole thing and then find they win.</p></speech>

Not a single house has been built because the Department is refusing to jointly fund the northern cross route road which runs through the housing development.  For the past two weeks, on the advice of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I have been trying to raise the matter as a Topical Issue.  There is a housing crisis and we have a solution here.  This is a no-brainer.  Thousands of families will get an opportunity to own their own homes, not only in Louth but also in the Taoiseach's constituency in Dublin.  Hundreds of thousands of euro can be gained through levies.  It is a no-brainer.  I invite the Taoiseach along with the Fine Gael Deputies and councillors to come to Drogheda to visit this site and see it at first hand.  I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that the Department provides its half of the funding for the development.</p></speech>

Last night, Nadine Lott became the sixth woman to be murdered in this country this year.  She was murdered in front of her six year old child.  I left the discussions of the FAI at the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport to raise this issue here.  Women are sickened, appalled and angry at the ongoing failure to deal with femicide and violence against women.  A number of laws could be looked at to address the matter, including Clare's law which is under consideration in Britain, the no-contact order Bill I introduced and many others.  The Government could start by funding services and begin an education campaign in society about the nature of toxic relationships and how women and girls are groomed into accepting manipulative behaviour.  I am not asking the Taoiseach to do all that.  I am just asking him to agree something today.  This is a really serious issue and it is not being dealt with.

In recent weeks, I read that more women were killed violently by men they knew - there have been more cases of femicide - than there are people killed as a result of drug-related murders, which is extraordinary and indicates how common murders of women by men who know them are in this country.</p>  <p>  I reject the Deputy's suggestion that the Government does not care.  The Government has ratified the Istanbul convention on domestic violence.  We have provided an extra &euro;5 million a year in funding for domestic violence services since the Minister, Deputy Zappone, took charge of her Department.  The Government will preside over the opening of new women's refuges in Rathcoole and, I think, in Carlow and Galway in the coming months.  Action is being taken.  I absolutely agree that we need to have an educational campaign on the issue.  That has been discussed at a Cabinet sub-committee.  We have also introduced changes in the law, assisted by Deputy Coppinger and others, to define consent better, for example, and to introduce a prohibition of coercive control.  This is very much on the Government's agenda and will be a specific topic for the Citizens' Assembly when it starts its hearings on gender in the coming weeks.  A special meeting would be a very good idea, but it is, as the Deputy knows, a matter for the Business Committee, of which I think Deputy Coppinger is a member and I am not.</p></speech>

Given the experience with restructuring elsewhere, for example, in the HSE, where sometimes the best people leave under those schemes and those people who ideally would leave stay on, can we ensure it will be a targeted scheme?</p></speech>

I am satisfied that the Garda Commissioner will now commence implementing the scheme.  A sum of &euro;6.5 million has been made available.  It was always going to be a targeted scheme designed to proceed along the lines as envisaged in the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland.  It is expected that real progress on the severance scheme will be made, commencing early next year.</p></speech>

They include people like Denis O'Brien, Larry Goodman and the Dunne and Heffernan families.</p></speech>

Given the levels of deprivation, the housing crisis and the climate crisis that needs investment, should we as a society have billionaires?  If the Government is serious about tackling inequality, should the Government move to ban billionaires by having a 100% wealth tax on all wealth in excess of &euro;1 billion?  With that, it would be possible to build 150,000 carbon-neutral homes, transition to 100% renewable energy creating 36,000 jobs and have a complete transition to free, green and frequent public transport for the next 20 years.</p></speech>

If one was to bring in a 100% tax for them, they definitely would not be resident in the State.  The yield from any tax that is 100% is zero.  Rather than bringing in revenue, we would probably end up with less.  Anybody will understand that if something is taxed at 100%, one will not get any revenue out of it.</p>  <p>  There are many forms of equality.  There is equality before the law and I am proud to be part of a Government that helped to repeal the eighth amendment and helped to bring about marriage equality in the State.  I am proud to be part of a Government that for five years has seen poverty and deprivation rates reduce in Ireland.  According to the Central Statistics Office, income inequality in Ireland is now at its second lowest since records began.  That is something that very few socialist governments have ever achieved.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.320" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1270" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="13:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800027#Z00900"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	  	That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for the amendment of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 in order to establish a cross-border statutory agency to investigate and report on criminal activity between Northern Ireland and this jurisdiction.  </blockquote>  <p>The purpose of the Bill is to establish, on a statutory basis, a cross-Border crime agency.  The agency will draw from specified security, taxation and environmental authorities from the State and Northern Ireland.  The remit of the agency will cover organised criminal activity and fuel smuggling in the Border region.</p><p>The Bill covers the establishment of an agency composed of a director general and eight officers drawn from specific authorities.  The structure of this cross-Border agency would enable the appointment of the director general, and also details the eight designated officers of the agency.  Four officers would be appointed by the Minister for Justice and Equality, to include an officer from the Environmental Protection Agency, an officer from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, a chief superintendent nominated by the Garda Commissioner, and an officer from the Criminal Assets Bureau.  A further four officers would be appointed on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice for Northern Ireland, or the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if the Northern Ireland Executive is not in place.These would include an officer from the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, an officer from Northern Ireland's revenue commissioners, a chief superintendent from the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, and an officer from the National Crime Agency.</p><p>The proposed legislation also specifies the functions of the agency.  It details its remit over organised criminal activity, illicit trade, human trafficking and fuel smuggling in the Border region.  The section also empowers the agency to receive relevant information from the police forces in this State and in Northern Ireland.  The section also details a requirement to publish an annual report, to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There is also a specified requirement for the director general to appear before the relevant Oireachtas committee when requested.</p><p>The Border area needs a focused agency to stamp out crime.  Recent deplorable incidents, which I have discussed in the House with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, on a number of occasions, including attacks on persons and property, and the recent and very sinister development of cross-Border involvement in devastating human trafficking, show that cross-Border criminality is escalating.  The cross-Border organised crime threat assessment 2018, produced jointly by the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, shows the scale and changing nature of cross-Border crime.  Brexit represents a new challenge to the 224 mile Border and the distinct security threats in the area.  We need a fresh focus on tackling cross-Border criminality.</p><p>The Bill would strengthen, expand and formalise the existing cross-Border crime task force, which does not have a set staff or legislative powers.  The new agency would be composed of officers from police forces in the North and South, Revenue, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Environmental Protection Agency and their Northern equivalents.  The agency would be headed by a director general with dedicated staff.</p><p>The recent British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly report on cross-Border crime noted there had been an increase in the number of criminal groups with cross-Border operations in the past five years, rising from approximately one in five groups in 2014 to one in three groups in 2018.  The current task force needs to be strengthened with clear powers and dedicated staff.  Currently, it is organised on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis with no full-time staff.  Only two reports on the work of the agency have been issued due to the collapse of Stormont in January 2017.  This is simply not good enough.  The Bill will ensure we have the tools in place to tackle the changing nature of the criminal threat in the Border area.</p></speech>

"Flash the Lights at Me", an old song from around the Border, was about giving warnings and was related to folk smuggling, so to speak.  However, the type of criminality that exists and the agility and ability of criminals to circumvent the State are self-evident in more recent people trafficking.  This Bill is all about establishing the dedicated, formal and statutory structure that is required.  We are all aware that there is good co-operation between the various agencies, as Deputy Brendan Smith noted.  Until such time as this co-operation is placed on a statutory footing and there is accountability, we will not get to grips with the criminality that exists on this island.  I fully support the Bill.</p></speech>

We have seen much of this around the country with protests at various large supermarket retailers and distribution units.  This is a reflection of the real frustration among farmers, in particular, beef farmers, about the complete absence of a future for them.  They do not see any possibility of the sector recovering from the terrible position it is in.</p><p>We welcome the establishment of the beef task force and the lifting of the injunctions against farmers, which was one of the obstacles facing the task force.  This is healthy and a move forward.  It is clear, however, that the pace of progress does not reflect the urgency of the situation.  There is a fundamental flaw in the supply chain.  Part of this is an absence of price transparency.  The <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>had sight of leaked documents that show eye-watering margins.</p> <p>Three of the supermarket chains make up 75% of the retail market in Ireland and they can make more than 50% on the retail price of beef and other meat products.  At present, farmers lose 70 cent to 80 cent per kilo on beef.  This is a major problem and unless we can get to grips with it we will have a huge difficulty.  I understand that the standard answer will be that the Government cannot interfere in the market and that it will have to let the market rule but, ultimately, a monopoly and what is, in effect, a cartel are in place.  Earlier this year, the vice president of the Irish Natura Hill Farmers Association pointed out to the Oireachtas committee that there were, in effect, a monopoly and a cartel operating to the detriment of the farming sector.  Does the Taoiseach agree that legislation needs to be put in place on beef price transparency?  Sinn F&eacute;in has a Bill in this regard.  Will the Taoiseach support it?  Will the Government bring a new sense of urgency to the beef task force to ensure it delivers for the sector?  It is not just about the price of beef, it is about the viability of an entire farming sector.</p></speech>

In the interim, there has been, at a rhetorical level, an improvement in terms of the Government's official policy on forestry, particularly its importance in the context of climate change.  However, in terms of delivery, we are in a worse position than we have ever been.  The rate of new planting actually got worse over the past six years, as did the situation in terms of the type of trees we grow, namely, one species, Sitka spruce.  The forestry sector is commercially focused rather than based on understanding the need for a sustainable model that would contribute to a sustainable environmental future.  The Mackinnon report that was produced recently confirmed some of the points that I and others have been making about this matter for a long time.  We are not taking forestry seriously.  Will anything improve on this front?  We have a target to plant 8,000 ha of trees.  We have had targets similar to this or even higher in the past ten years.  We never meet them and we are now down at an all-time low of approximately 3,000 ha a year, which is dismal.  Will we move from paying rhetorical lip service to forestry and climate change to real delivery in terms of afforestation?</p></speech>

What is remarkable in walking all of the land of north County Dublin, which we have been doing on and off for 20 years, is the massive destruction of hedgerows and the development of super-large fields for grain growing in which there are no trees or hedgerows and everything has been chopped down to a height of 6 ft.  The Taoiseach and I have knowledge of the area.  It is clear that this may in the future be the pattern in the rest of Ireland.  Farmers must try to make a living and they should be strongly supported by the Government in doing so but we have a problem with biodiversity.  Last year, there were very bad fires in the forests around Killarney that resulted in significant destruction of trees and wildlife.  In north County Dublin and, presumably, a lot of north Leinster, the EU is paying farmers to cut down hedgerows to make these very large fields, thereby completely destroying a significant percentage of the hedgerows, which are natural biodiversity corridors because, as has been stated, we do not have massive indigenous forests.  We hope to have these but we do not have them at present.  As the leader of the country, will the Taoiseach have a look at this matter in the context of how to address it?  Obviously, the farmers' interests must be taken into account but so must our commitments in respect of biodiversity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.342" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="13:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800028#AA00400"><p>In recent weeks, the Taoiseach has rolled out what is already a highly negative campaign on his behalf and on that of his party.  Who he thinks he is impressing with this is anyone's guess.  One part of this negative campaign is the ridiculous claim that everyone who supported a proposal for more investment in public transport, including a major improvement in rural public transport services, is plotting and scheming to do down rural Ireland.  The Taoiseach has stated this in the House and elsewhere.  The Taoiseach even went to north Meath and said that the dastardly Fianna F&aacute;il Party was going to scrap local roads by means of a sinister process called reprofiling.  The pettiness is striking because even for what is a very petty Government, this may be the first time ever the Opposition has been attacked by a Government for quoting the Minister for Finance.  The current Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and almost every other member of the Government has mentioned the fact that its own massive overspending has required reprofiling of capital plans.  This continues apace.  I hope the Taoiseach keeps the absurd attack going because all it does is reinforce how the Fine Gael Party is now so out of ideas that all it can do is continue to make up attacks against the Opposition.  This is another example of the Government trying to distract attention from a crisis that has arisen on its watch.  Farmers have been promised urgent action in respect of their income and the crisis relating to viability.  This is another example of a slow and very limited response.  No one is stating that the Taoiseach can go out and set higher prices.  What is being asked for is urgent and co-ordinated action to address the fact the critical primary producers are getting squeezed by an unfair market.  The beef task force was supposed to drive forward action.  It was announced at the start of September but did not meet for the first time until the beginning of December.  It is not due to meet again until next month.  When will the pace of this work increase?  What proposals have been prepared to address the continued weakness of sterling and the imminence of a less open trading regime with our largest market?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.343" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="13:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800028#AA00500"><p>I thank the Deputies for their questions and contributions.  I assure the House that the Government is deeply committed to fully supporting and developing Ireland's beef sector and to protecting the incomes of beef farmers.  As we all understand, the Government does not have a role to play in determining the price that beef farmers get from factories.  However, I would like to see an increase in the price being paid to farmers in order that they will receive a price in line with the EU average.  At present, they do not.  Certainly, I support greater transparency on price.  In this context, I will give indications from Meat Industry Ireland that market conditions are improving.  This is being reflected in some price increases for farmers though not enough to date.</p>  <p>  The Government provides significant financial assistance to the beef sector to encourage greater efficiencies and productivity.  We have done this through a series of measures, including the &euro;300 million beef data and genomics programme, &euro;20 million for the beef environmental efficiency pilot in 2019, &euro;78 million drawn down through the beef exceptional aid measure and the restoration of the areas of natural constraints scheme to &euro;250 million.  A total of &euro;85 million in targeted schemes supporting sustainable beef farming is provided in budget 2020.  In the event of a no-deal Brexit, &euro;85 million has been set aside for beef farmers, with the possibility of further funding depending on the impact.  However, the Government will work hard over the coming months to secure a trade deal with the UK that will continue to give our farmers free access to the British market, which is so important to them.</p>  <p>  Particularly at this time of the year, the basic payment scheme is fundamentally important to farmers in order to maintain cashflow.  The commencement of the basic payment scheme balancing payment will bring the total paid to more than 120,000 farmers under the 2019 scheme to date to &euro;1.14 billion.  The implementation of the agreement reached between beef stakeholders on 15 September is important in terms of providing immediate benefit to producers as well as the introduction of a range of strategic measures that seek to tackle structural imbalances in the sector.  The agreement provided for an immediate increase in the range of bonuses.  It increased the level of bonuses being paid on certain animals, as well as significantly increasing the number of animals eligible for bonuses.</p> <p>The cumulative impact is that over 70% of all steer and heifers slaughtered are now eligible for a bonus on top of the basic price paid.</p> <p> On forestry, Deputies will be aware that roughly 11% of Ireland is now under forest, which is the highest level in 350 years, but it is still very low by European standards.  We have set the objective to plant an additional 400 million trees between now and 2030.  There are good incentives in place for farmers and landowners to get involved in forestry but uptake is disappointing.  I would like to see not only farmers but all major landowners plant an acre or a hectare of trees, ideally native trees.  We are willing to provide financial assistance for them to do that.  The planting of more trees, including native trees, will have to form part of the new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, which will arise at European level in the next couple of months or year or so and the climate action measures being taken at European level through the European green deal.</p> <p> On the issue of hedgerows, which was raised by Deputy Burton, I will have to come back to her with a more detailed reply.  I do know that many hedgerows are protected but not all are.  Hedgerows are, of course, habitats in their own right.  They allow animals to travel and they act as corridors between habitats, as the Deputy mentioned.  There are payments to maintain and nurture hedgerows under GLAS, but again perhaps we could enhance them.  I think I have covered all of the other questions in my replies.</p></speech>

It covers issues relating to the environment, including climate action and the implementation of the Government's climate action plan.</p>  <p>  The Climate Action Plan 2019: To Tackle Climate Breakdown, was published on 17 June 2019.  The plan contains more than 180 actions, broken down into 600 individual steps, which Ireland needs to implement to meet its EU 2030 targets and achieve its longer-term low carbon transition objective.  Delivering such an integrated set of actions and policies requires a deep collaboration across Government with business, communities and also individuals.  The work of the Cabinet committee on the environment is an important part of facilitating this collaboration and driving implementation of the plan.</p>  <p>  The Cabinet committee on the environment has met twice since its establishment, on 30 September and 2 December 2019.  It is intended that it will meet quarterly.  There is significant work under way across each of the areas covered by the committee through Departments, agencies and a range of interdepartmental groups such as the climate action delivery board.  These matters are also regularly considered at meetings of Government and in bilateral meetings with the relevant Ministers.  At tomorrow's Cabinet meeting, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, will bring the heads of the climate action Bill for approval.  The Cabinet committee is due to meet again early in the new year, where its focus will be on the delivery of actions due in 2020 and beyond, as well as unblocking any potential barriers to Ireland decarbonising its economy and society.</p></reply>

Last month, the Corporate Europe Observatory published a damning and in-depth article exposing the Government's close relationship with the plastics industry.  Much of the information in the article came from freedom of information, FOI, documents secured by journalist, Juno McEnroe, and my colleague, Lynn Boylan, former MEP for Dublin.  Throughout the negotiations in Europe on the plastics directive, industry allies were consulted on the Commission's text.  The industry was often rapidly informed of developments at EU level by officials, and the interests of the industry were put forward by the Government.  It is clear from the FOI documentation that Government's relationship with the industry is much tighter than its relationship with the NGO sector.  This is very alarming.</p>  <p>  Repak is a company established and owned by the industry to operate the country's recycling schemes.  Its members include companies such as Coca-Cola and Unilever, which are two of the world's worst plastics polluters, and multinational retailers such as Tesco, Aldi and others, which generate huge amounts of plastic waste.  The documents released show the officials contacted Repak regularly to run text by it when copying and pasting new legislative drafts of the EU directive.  Officials were also interested to hear the views of the industry as part of informing Ireland's response to what were, in reality, modest proposals.  New information on the position of another member state was also shared by officials with Repak.  It is not only Repak that has the captive ear of Government.  The Government proactively sought the views of industry representatives and groups on the Commission's drafts of the directive on single use plastic and passed their concerns to Brussels.</p>  <p>  These documents undermine any faith that we could have in Fine Gael to put the people ahead of the corporate interests.  That is the core of this issue.  There are some big battles ahead, some of which will happen soon, in regard to environmental concerns.  Can we be confident that Fine Gael has the capacity, capability and intent to put public interests ahead of short-term corporate profits?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.352" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="13:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800029#BB00900"><p>It is absolutely freezing outside, and I think most people have felt that cold.  We should bear this in mind over the next number of weeks because we have hundreds of thousands of people in this country affected by fuel poverty.  For elderly people, in some cases, it is life threatening.  There are hundreds of thousands of people in receipt of the fuel allowance.  These are, in the main, people on very low incomes who are trying to heat their homes in the current freezing temperatures.  This is a real social problem.  It is also an environmental problem because people on low incomes and living in poorly insulated homes have to spend massive amounts of money to keep their homes and themselves warm.  Often, they cannot do so but insofar as they try to do so, they are wasting huge amounts of energy.</p>  <p>  This time of the year brings into sharp focus the need to do something dramatic and radical in terms of providing supports, grants, funding and assistance to people to insulate their homes or for the State to move in directly and have them insulated, thereby achieving two important objectives: one, keeping people warm who are freezing and, two, dramatically reducing CO2 emissions if it is done right.  The annual cost of heating an A1 energy rated home is approximately &euro;280.  For those living in the lowest energy rated homes, which, in the main, are those on low incomes, that cost per annum can be &euro;3,000.  The people who are most affected by these issues have the least resources.  The grants provided under the energy schemes are nowhere near sufficient to assist people on low incomes to insulate their homes.  Those living in private rented accommodation and social housing, if they wanted to, cannot insulate their homes.  The public schemes in this regard are abysmal.  Will the Government address the issue of retrofit insulation and supporting people affected by fuel poverty and the cold to insulate their homes and thus also address a major cause of CO2 emissions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.353" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="13:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800029#BB01000"><p>I want to raise two issues in regard to the Cabinet committee on the environment and the work, or lack of work, on the part of Government in regard to the environment.  I have repeatedly asked the Taoiseach about the electric vehicle target under the climate action plan and I have pointed out to him that to meet the target set of 1 million vehicles in ten years, almost every vehicle purchased from January 2020 would need to be an electric vehicle.  The Taoiseach made that facile announcement regarding 1 million electric vehicles in ten years, with no research behind it.  On the last occasion I raised this issue, I asked the Taoiseach if work had been undertaken at departmental level to underpin that target or give support to the idea that it was a credible target, and he said he would check it out.  Has the Taoiseach checked it out?  Is there documentation available that underpins the target for electric vehicles set in the climate action plan?  I would appreciate some clarity on that issue.  I would also appreciate if the Taoiseach would provide me with the documentation, which should not be any great secret.</p>  <p>  On the smoky coal ban, the Taoiseach has tried to play partisan politics with this issue.  It is legitimate for the Opposition and me, and I have been at this for quite a while, to ask, given the former T&aacute;naiste, Mary Harney, was able to introduce a smoky coal ban in 1990, which we have had since, in Dublin and elsewhere without any legal challenge, why it is not possible for the Government to introduce a nationwide smoky coal ban.  The Taoiseach has retorted by referencing legal advice, which, strangely, has been only half-published.  I find this only gives succour to the vested interests outside of this State who want to maintain the distribution and sale of smoky coal here.</p> <p>Notwithstanding the fact that our own indigenous coal manufacturers have invested millions in changing their manufacturing plants and developing facilities for smokeless coal, they have now been left high and dry.  They were given commitments by previous Ministers that a smoky coal ban would be introduced nationwide and they prepared accordingly.</p> <p> On the legal advice issue, why has the Taoiseach given succour to these coal merchants and companies by more or less publishing their letters or legal points as if they have total validity?  I was involved in bans such as the smoking one, and one will be given advices and will see other advices, but one does not concede publicly.  I argue that the public health requirements of our people should trump anything.  There is growing evidence now that the problems are getting worse in many areas throughout the country, with very damaging implications for public health, respiratory health in particular.  Professor Clancy and others have been long-time campaigners for this.  They all say that the original ban brought in the 1990 had a demonstrable impact on health at that time.  It is a neglect of duty.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.355" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="13:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800030#CC00200"><p>The Labour Party motion will be debated later today and it is hoped it will be passed to ban smoky coal totally in this country.  Is the Taoiseach aware that of the smoky coal that is sold, even in cities like Dublin where the ban is in effect, up to 60% is sulphur, so it is the most damaging kind of smoky coal?  I do not know what kind of legal advice the Taoiseach has been quoting.  I suspect some barrister was asked for an opinion and threw in a notion that there could be some contest.  We have had the smokeless requirement in place in Dublin for more than 20 years.  There has been no legal challenge.</p>  <p>  What is the Taoiseach doing to stop the massive cross-Border trade in smuggling smoky coal?  On a cold night at the moment in various estates in Dublin and towns throughout the country, one can taste the sulphur in the coal.  This is causing up to 1,500 avoidable deaths in Ireland a year and is a misery for the children affected by asthma.  I encourage the Taoiseach to meet representatives of the Asthma Society of Ireland because they will tell him the individual stories of the children who, on bad nights, possibly like tonight, are not able to breathe.  It is putting massive pressures on children's health services.  Who is the Taoiseach in hock to that he will not bring in a ban-----</p></speech>

On the question regarding plastics, it is right and proper that officials and civil servants should engage with all stakeholders on any issue, whether it is industry bodies, unions, NGOs, or through public consultations, provided it is done in a transparent way and in accordance with the Regulation of Lobbying Act and the Freedom of Information Act.  The lobbying Act was brought in by a Government of which I was a member precisely to regulate lobbying properly and make it more transparent, which had not been the case under previous Administrations, but not to try to ban or restrict it.  Lobbying is part of a democracy and should happen in one.</p>  <p>  The Government has taken the lead on plastics, first by banning single-use plastics from Departments.  There are none in mine, and this is being extended across the public service, with a few exceptions where they may be necessary.  We are strong supporters of new European Union proposals to introduce a ban on unnecessary single-use plastics in the Single Market.  We are very supportive of that.</p>  <p>  On fuel poverty, the fuel allowance, or energy allowance, as it is going to be renamed, will increase in January in a few weeks.  We are going to use some of the proceeds coming in from the increase in the carbon tax to retrofit social housing, particularly in the midlands, with &euro;40 million is expected from that.  This will allow us to retrofit and improve the energy rating of more social housing in the midlands, and this will be built upon in the years to come. There is also the warmer homes schemes and some other grants that people can apply for.  We are increasing our effort in that regard all the time.</p>  <p>  On electric vehicles, this query has been put into the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I have not received a reply yet, but I will pass it on to Deputy Martin as soon as I do.</p>  <p>  On smoky coal, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has announced an extension of the ban to 13 more towns, and this will kick in from September of next year, which includes towns that have some serious air quality issues.  We have decided, however, against a nationwide ban as our best legal advice tells us that it could lead to the existing local bans, including the one here in Dublin, being struck down or it may require us to the ban the burning of wood and turf, as well, which we do not want to do.</p></speech>

That is the problem we are facing.  We do not want to ban the burning of turf and wood in Ireland, particularly not in rural areas, which is why we have adopted a more proportionate and legally sound approach, which is to extend the smoky coal ban to the 13 towns that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, announced yesterday.</p></speech>

Croatia, however, is a partner and ally of Ireland's in the European Union, and the fact that the Taoiseach met its President and Prime Minister formally is reasonable.</p>  <p>  The more important question is what official resources the Taoiseach used at the meeting of his political party in Zagreb and whether he always fully respected the non-political nature of public servants by not involving them in meetings held at his party political conference.  Will the Taoiseach assure us that all costs relating to those parts of the trip that involved being at the party conference, including personal transport, were paid for by Fine Gael?  Equally, will he assure us that no public servants were brought to the party conference?</p>  <p>  In a related matter, it was for this party that the former Deputy, Dara Murphy, was given leave to work for by the Taoiseach, because of which he was absent from his D&aacute;il work.  Perhaps Dara Murphy's good fortune was that, unlike Deputy Bailey, no opinion poll was done showing him to be a liability to Fine Gael.  Will the Taoiseach tell us whether he has asked Fine Gael how much money it received to support Dara Murphy in his D&aacute;il work?  Every party gets political funding related to the number of Deputies it has.  Does he think he will ask the party to return the money?  This would be for the period that the former Deputy was working in Europe.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach's attempt to defend himself by going on a personal attack on others impresses nobody.  These are legitimate questions that deserve legitimate answers.</p></speech>

Did the EPP advise Fine Gael, perhaps through the party secretariat, that the appointment would be made?  Why did nobody raise a query as to how somebody could have two full-time jobs, one in this  House and the other with the EPP?  the latter is not an honorary job such as being a vice president or president of a party group.  It is a full-time, active job.</p> <p> Will the Taoiseach state whether carbon credits are used to offset his travel on the Government jet?</p></speech>

Using the Government jet to attend an EPP meeting does not stand up to scrutiny and nor does it wash with anyone.  Even the most independent observer of the Taoiseach's decision to use the Government jet for this purpose would admit that it reeks of entitlement, which goes to the core of the matter.  I understand from media reports that when the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, was in office, he did not use the Government jet and always used commercial airlines to attend such meetings.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will explain his decision to use the Government jet in this instance and in others.  While I am sure he, like many of us, is fully aware of the sensitives regarding the use of the Government jet, he seems to have ploughed ahead regardless, which seems to be the attitude of the Government in respect of many issues.  It goes ahead and says, "Divil may care what the people will think."  That attitude will come back to bite the Government, and hopefully soon.  Will the Taoiseach confirm what role the former Deputy, Dara Murphy, had in organising the event?  Was he central to it?  Did he organise the attendance list for it?</p></speech>

It is used within those rules and I assure Deputies that civil servants would not allow it to be used outside of them.</p>  <p>  I visited Zagreb on 20 and 21 November.  The programme for my visit included an official meeting with the Prime Minister, Andrej Plenković.  The meeting took place for more than a hour, included a press conference and was held in the Prime Minister's office.  I also attended a reception hosted by our ambassador, attended by members of the business community and of the Irish community in Croatia, which took place at the ambassador's residence.  Unfortunately, due to a technical issue that delayed my arrival in Zagreb, it was not possible for me to meet President Grabar-Kitarović, which had been planned, although I look forward to meeting her on another occasion if she is re-elected.  My meeting with the Prime Minister, Mr. Plenković, was especially timely as Croatia will assume the Presidency of the European Union for the first time in January.  During its term of office, it will manage a number of files of importance to Ireland, including Brexit, the Union's budget for 2021 to 2027, inclusive, and the multi-annual financial framework.  We also discussed enlargement, on which Croatia, as a Balkan country, has important insights.</p>  <p>  While in Zagreb on 20 and 21 November, I also had the opportunity for an extensive range of valuable meetings and discussions with other European leaders, principally concerning the next steps on Brexit and the future relationship with the UK.  My visit to Zagreb included meetings with the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk; the incoming President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen; President Anastasiades of Cyprus; President Iohannis of Romania; Prime Minister Ludovic Orban of Romania - not Hungary; Prime Minister Boyko Borissov of Bulgaria; Prime Minister Arturs Kri&scaron;jānis Kariņ&scaron; of Latvia; Chancellor Merkel of Germany; the Prime Minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, of Greece; Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway; and the former Chancellor of Austria, Sebastian Kurz.</p>  <p>  As a small member state with a similarly small administration, Ireland understands well the scale of the task involved in undertaking the Presidency.  I offer the Prime Minister, Mr. Plenković, my full support and co-operation in that regard.  For my meeting with him, I was accompanied by the ambassador and a small team of officials and advisers from my Department.  No civil servants attended the EPP congress but security, of course, did.</p>  <p>  On the former Deputy, Dara Murphy, I said yesterday what I was going to say about an inquiry, and I hope that inquiry can happen, as it should.  The impression has been created that he was totally absent from the D&aacute;il for two years, but that is not true.  In fact, he was present for more votes in this calendar year than Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin was-----</p></speech>

The people would like to know, if they vote for Fianna F&aacute;il, whether some of the Deputies under investigation will be rewarded for their conduct by being made Ministers under Fianna F&aacute;il.  It is reasonable for the public to ask that question and to want to know the answer.</p>  <p>  Currently, there is no offsetting, but the climate action plan commits the Government to consider offsetting emissions from the use of flights.

I am, therefore, pleased that last week's European Council also made clear that priority should continue to be given to implementing that agenda and to delivering concrete results for the benefit of our citizens.</p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that the strategic agenda reflected the outcome of this extensive consultation with our citizens, including in Ireland.  As a result, the European Council's statement that the conference should build on the successful holding of citizens' dialogues over the past two years and foresee broad consultations with citizens in the course of the process is welcome.  I expect the conference to contribute to the development of EU policies in the medium and long terms in order that we can better tackle current and future challenges together.  It may also consider any institutional reform that can contribute to that goal.  Ireland will continue to participate fully as the debate evolves.</p></reply>

Nevertheless, I wish to raise two separate points.</p> <p>The Taoiseach said yesterday that he will continue to block the legislation in the D&aacute;il that relates to economic relations with the illegal settlements on the West Bank on the basis that this "is a sole competency of the European Union".  The T&aacute;naiste said the same thing this morning.  The Taoiseach has indicated that EU policy is preventing action from being taken, but when I asked him whether he or the T&aacute;naiste has lobbied for a change in that policy, he failed to answer.  There is no public evidence that the either Taoiseach or the T&aacute;naiste has made any representations or proposals on this matter.  Does this not indicate that the legislation is being blocked on policy terms rather than on legal terms?  In light of the failure of the T&aacute;naiste's effort to achieve a breakthrough - he has said that he has a close relationship with Prime Minister Netanyahu - will the Taoiseach tell us whether Ireland is proposing or supporting any new initiative in the face of the threatened West Bank annexations and the permanent statelessness of millions of people?</p> <p> In recent weeks, Prime Minister Orb&aacute;n has started to ramp up his efforts to limit freedom of activity in Hungary.  His previous actions are well known.  He has taken the appointment of theatre directors into political hands, he has reduced the rights of Opposition politicians in the Hungarian Parliament and he is imposing political oversight of curriculums in universities.  These actions are a clear violation of basic democratic principles.  The issue is whether anything is to be done.  Is the Taoiseach happy that everything that can be done is being done in order to address the fact that an EU member state is drastically undermining core democratic freedoms?</p></speech>

The statements on last week's EU Council meeting will begin shortly.  I would like to ask the Taoiseach about the focus on an area that is now being driven by one of the new vice presidents of the European Commission, Mr. Frans Timmermans.  His responsibilities include climate change, which all of us in this House recognise as the biggest economic and social issue that we need to address.  It is very difficult to address it on a global basis when the US is withdrawing from its commitments under the Paris accord.  I would like to ask the Taoiseach about the most recent discussions.  How does he envisage that the targets can be achieved without the full participation of the US in particular?</p></speech>

I ask the Taoiseach to comment on the Government's position on Mr. Macron's proposals, particularly in the context of Irish neutrality.  Ireland is a neutral country.  President Macron has indicated in recent times that he is very critical of the capacity of NATO.  He sees very serious defects in NATO.  As part of his vision for Europe, he has indicated that he would like widespread changes to be made to pension entitlements, for example.  I am most concerned about the question of military alliances.  He has spoken in a number of speeches about certain countries being part of a group that will go forward to the united states of Europe.  As a neutral country, Ireland has very different interests.  I know that Fine Gael has some alliances with individuals like President Macron outside of the EPP.  Will the Taoiseach indicate whether Fine Gael remains committed to Irish neutrality in the context of European discussions?  Will there be room in Europe for countries which are militarily neutral alongside countries which may belong to other defence arrangements?</p></speech>

It is certainly something we can consider.  It is unlikely that we will be able to find consensus at European level to take action of that nature, given that some member states exhibit strong support towards Israel.  We have taken a very strong position on Jerusalem.  I was very active at European Council level in asking that as part of our conclusions, we do not accept Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, or at least not until a two-state solution has been delivered.  We have also taken very strong positions against settlement activity and the annexation of occupied lands.  We have done that at EU level and at the UN and we will continue to do that.  It is well recognised by the Palestinian Authority and by Arab countries that Ireland is at the forefront of the countries that support the Palestinian cause.</p>  <p>  Deputy Martin asked about the rule of law in Hungary.  The European Commission is empowered to take action with regard to the rule of law and takes such action.  We are very supportive of the European Commission's actions in this regard.</p>  <p>  We deeply regret the decision of the US Administration to withdraw from the Paris Agreement.  I remind the House that the US has not yet withdrawn from the agreement.  The policy of the US might yet change, depending on the outcome of the elections there next November.  Notwithstanding all of this, it should be borne in mind that US emissions are coming down and that many US states and cities are taking climate action anyway.</p>  <p>  I have never heard President Macron using the term "united states of Europe" and I have not heard him arguing for such a development.  He is certainly a supporter of greater integration.  We agree with some elements of this approach, but not others, depending on the circumstances.  Ireland will continue to be a neutral country and will continue to be a non-member of NATO.  We do not intend to participate in a European army if such an entity is established.  We will be part of security.  Our decision to sign up to permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, was endorsed overwhelmingly by this House.  Ireland is a long-standing member of the Partnership for Peace.  I think we can contribute to continental security and world security through what we do at the UN and what we do at the EU under the banner of PESCO and otherwise.</p></speech>

At the European Council meeting on Thursday, we discussed climate change, the EU's long-term budget and external relations, particularly the EU-Africa partnership and Turkey's recent actions in the eastern Mediterranean.  We agreed to continue economic sanctions against Russia.  We expressed solidarity with Albania following the recent earthquake there.  We considered the idea of a conference on the future of Europe.  On Friday, we held a eurozone summit to take stock of progress on economic and monetary union.  We then met in Article 50 format to discuss Brexit and the preparations for the negotiations on the future EU-UK relationship after the UK's withdrawal from the EU.</p>  <p>  In addition to the formal Council meetings, I launched a climate action forum with Prime Minister Frederiksen of Denmark and Prime Minister L&ouml;fven of Sweden.  This initiative developed from my meetings with them in Copenhagen and Stockholm in October.  It will enable us to pool experience, offer leadership and encourage others to act.  The climate action forum strengthens the exchange of information, ideas, experience and best practice between us.  At the gathering, I congratulated Finland's Sanna Marin on her recent election, at the age of 32, as the youngest Prime Minister in Europe.  I also congratulated her on Finland's successful EU Presidency, which will draw to a close at the end of the year.</p>  <p>  The European Council had a long discussion on climate action.  We heard from President von der Leyen.  I welcomed the proposal for a European green deal that was published by the Commission last week.  We endorsed the objective of a climate-neutral EU by 2050.  As one member state was not in a position to commit to that goal for itself, we agreed that the European Council would come back to the matter in June 2020.  Our agreement represents a major step forward.  Climate neutrality by 2050 is now EU policy.  The new EU budget and the work of the European Investment Bank and other bodies will be directed towards achieving that goal.  Our action will help to create an opportunity for green growth, new jobs, new businesses and a cleaner and more biodiverse environment.  The transition to a climate-neutral Europe will require significant public and private investment.  The European Investment Bank will invest an estimated &euro;1 trillion in climate action and sustainability between 2021 and 2030.  We also agreed that there would be a just transition mechanism to assist the regions and industries most affected.</p>  <p>  Prime Minister Marin of Finland presented the Presidency's negotiating box for the multi-annual financial framework, which is the EU budget for the period 2021 to 2027.</p> <p>In the discussion that followed, I set out Ireland's position, saying that we want to see long-established, well-functioning and successful policies, such as the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, Cohesion, Horizon and Erasmus+, continue to be properly funded.  We also want significant investment in meeting new challenges, such as migration, security and climate action.  I welcomed the proposed special allocation of funding for a PEACE Plus programme of &euro;100 million for Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  The European Council agreed to continue working on the basis of the negotiating box, and President Michel will now take the negotiations forward.<br/><br/>On Thursday we discussed a possible conference on the future of Europe with the President of the Parliament, David Sassoli.  Arising from this, we asked Croatia, as the incoming holder of the Presidency, to explore the content, scope, composition and function of any conference.  At the euro summit on Friday we heard an assessment from new ECB President, Christine Lagarde.  We asked the Eurogroup to continue its work on reforming the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, and on strengthening the banking union.  Ireland sees a European deposit insurance scheme, EDIS, as an important part of that work.  We also agreed that a budgetary instrument for convergence and competitiveness will be finalised as part of the negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and invited the Eurogroup to provide its views on this swiftly.<br/><br/>The European Council also met on Friday in Article 50 format to discuss Brexit.  Our discussions were informed by the decisive results of the UK general election the previous day, and by a presentation by Michel Barnier, the European Union's chief negotiator.  The expectation is now that the UK will leave the EU on 31 January on the basis of the withdrawal agreement and that there will be a transition period.  For this to happen, the withdrawal agreement will need to be ratified in Westminster and in the European Parliament.  As the House is aware, the agreement guarantees that there will be no hard border on this island.  It also protects the common travel area and the existing rights of British and Irish citizens to travel, live, work and access public services and welfare in both jurisdictions.<br/><br/>At the European Council, we also considered the proposed next steps.  The EU's high-level position is already set out in the joint political declaration and in the political direction provided by the European Council at successive meetings.  Last week we invited the European Commission to present a draft mandate for the future relationship negotiations for the Council to consider once the UK has exited.  These negotiations will create the basis for EU-UK relations for years to come.  It is vital that we get this right and create the best possible framework for working and co-operating with our close neighbour and friend.  Together with our EU partners, we will work for the closest, deepest and broadest possible relationship with the UK.<br/><br/>At last week's European Council, we confirmed that our future partnership with the UK will go beyond trade.  It needs to cover a broad range of issues, including citizens' rights.  There was a strong view that we want free trade with the UK with no tariffs, no quotas, as little bureaucracy and as few checks as possible.  However, it has to be on the basis of a level playing field and common minimum standards.  Health and safety and environment standards, employment rights, production methods, product standards and state aid will all need to be considered.<br/><br/>Throughout these Brexit negotiations the unity of the EU has been notable, and the solidarity of our EU partners with Ireland particularly so.  We must maintain the same solidarity and unity in the next phase.<br/><br/>I wish to reflect on the future of Europe.  Past generations knew instinctively that a united Europe could bring an end to war and set us on the path to peace, democracy, the rule of law and prosperity after the Second World War.  For young people today, the horrors of world war and the evils of fascism and communism are not in their memory.  For them, Europe needs a new project, a new <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>.  Dealing with challenges that can only be overcome through collective, multilateral action must be that <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>, with climate action first among them.  Others include security, migration and the regulation of large corporations, many of which are now larger than states.  This was a crucially important European Council meeting.  It marked a very significant moment in the EU's emergent global leadership on climate.  It also prepared the ground for the challenges we will face in 2020, in particular in three areas: the negotiation of the EU's future relationship with the UK; the EU's seven-year budget; and the EU's external relationships, including with Russia, Turkey and the continent of Africa.  In her wrap-up remarks, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will focus more on external relations, including the EU-Africa Partnership and Turkey, as well as the current situation at the World Trade Organization.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.403" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800033#FF00200"><p>Last week&rsquo;s summit discussed many topics but delivered very little progress.  It was in many ways a summit about beginning the transition to the slightly revised agenda introduced by the new presidents of the Council and the Commission and continued shadow-boxing over profound issues that must be resolved in the coming year.</p>  <p>  Europe has been a world leader on climate change.  It has not done enough and it must do much more, but it has taken a lead in trying to introduce legally enforceable and financially supported action.  Every significant study says that we must immediately and rapidly accelerate efforts to reach carbon neutrality in our economies and to protect our gravely endangered biodiversity.  It is a profound challenge that is not just environmental but also potentially touches every aspect of economic, social and cultural life.  Therefore, the debate on setting a clear target for achieving carbon neutrality and refocusing activity on reaching this target is so important, and equally it is why it is so disappointing that agreement is proving so difficult to achieve.</p>  <p>  It is entirely fair to say that a target that is jointly agreed and jointly enforceable must also have a significant amount of joint funding.  This is at the root of the problem in reaching agreement.  No government is supporting the position of the climate change deniers and no government has, publicly at least, argued against the idea that the only way of achieving climate goals is to act collectively.  This is a positive start and it sets Europe apart from much of the world.  However, what we have not yet done is to set out a credible pathway from today to achieving carbon neutrality.  We need to be honest enough to admit clearly that there are industries and activities that face a dramatic, and in some cases terminal, period of change to meet the goals.  We cannot stand back and simply let the communities and families involved find their own way forward.  We know there is a need for targeted investment and a permanent programme to help create not just new jobs but also jobs that offer a good and sustainable future.</p>  <p>  It must also never be forgotten that one of the core foundations of the European Union is that it offers each of its members an opportunity to achieve and sustain prosperity.  Where members impose a major commitment on all, they have the responsibility to help implement the commitment.  Action by the European Union is realistically the only way of achieving the climate goals being discussed.  The European Union must be the leader in helping to achieve a transition that is just and that prevents large numbers of communities from suffering the decline that is likely if nothing is done.  Fianna F&aacute;il&rsquo;s proposal for the just transition fund for communities in the midlands is an example of how this can be done.  Indeed, it is an example that is so good that the Taoiseach wants to claim credit for it even though he wanted to spend the money on a tax giveaway.  The EU cannot only reach agreement on a target but also reach the target, but to do this it has to accept a step-change in the funding of climate initiatives, including research and innovation supports and direct aid for the regions that will be worst hit by the transition to a carbon-neutral economy and society, which simply has to be made.</p>  <p>  Of course, action by Europe is only one part of the more important global challenge.  In this respect the failure to achieve a breakthrough in the COP 25 negotiations in Madrid is deeply regrettable.  Europe must now consider with other willing partners what other actions can be taken to enforce climate objectives, including within trading agreements.  The lack of movement on financing was at the core of the failure to move the climate agenda onwards during last week&rsquo;s council meeting, and this is linked to the discussions on the EU&rsquo;s future budget.</p>  <p>  The communiqu&eacute; contains only two lines on the budget.  Unfortunately, it appears that the debate is driven by countries, supported by Ireland, trying to hold the EU to a budget level that will directly prevent it from addressing many vital issues.  How is it possible to demand and expect an organisation that represents 1% of the combined economies of the EU to meet the demands that are placed on it?  The fiscal hawks are doing great damage to the Union and to our economies because they are preventing more serious action on driving innovation, supporting a just climate transition, and helping communities and regions to prosper.  The position of countries like Ireland to start with the red line on funding rather than asking the basic question of how much is required to fund the activities we have prioritised is also self-defeating.</p>  <p>  This is particularly so with the eurozone.  An essential part of making sure there is no repeat of the eurozone crisis is to create a fiscal capacity that can help convergence and ensure that regions experiencing an economic shock have some stimulus available, given that devaluation is not an option.</p> <p>Yet because of a group of countries, including Ireland, the massively watered-down and ridiculously-named budgetary instrument for convergence and competitiveness, or BICC for short, has been hobbled before it has been even established.</p> <p> This is unfortunately a continuation of the sort of casual Eurosceptic opinions which have been so common in England since Margaret Thatcher&rsquo;s day, namely, the idea that everything which goes to the Union is "them" taking "our" money.  The facts show that the net fiscal and economic benefit to net contributors are enormous.  Even net contributors gain from the increased effectiveness of the Union and overall convergence.</p> <p> The idea that next year some form of conference on the future of Europe will be convened is reasonable.  However, things should be made clear at the start.  There is no public interest or support concerning the major rewriting of the treaties or starting on a new round of constitutional change.  It seems increasingly obvious that the issue is not how do we change the competencies of the Union, the issue rather is what will we do to help it be more effective in fulfilling the roles we have already set for it.</p> <p> Many parts of the Union are dealing with a period of great change in terms of population changes, both depopulation and rapidly expanding populations, communities outside of major metropolitan areas are feeling squeezed, we must tackle the climate emergency, we must deliver energy security and the Union&rsquo;s core values are under threat.  What is needed is a practical agenda for the future, showing how the Union intends playing a leading role in tackling these and other problems.  A Union based on never-ending zero-sum arguments about money and influence cannot be effective.</p> <p> A number of other important issues arose at the summit.  It was right that the leaders decided to stand with Greece and Cyprus against Turkey&rsquo;s aggressive posture in the Mediterranean, including completely unacceptable drilling activity.  The continued repression of opponents of the Ankara government and its shocking attacks on Kurdish communities in northern Syria suggest a further move away from respecting basic rights and seeking to be part of the free democratic world.  It is now over five years since Russia invaded and partitioned Ukraine.  Since then Russian-controlled and supplied forces have worked to partition off further major parts of the country.  It is one of the most striking things of recent years how the far right and far left in much of Europe have served as apologists for Vladimir Putin in this, and they have recently been stepping up efforts to remove any consequences for Russia of this behaviour.  The European Council was correct in rolling-over the sanctions for the next six months.  While it is correct to support the Minsk process it is the responsibility of Europe to stand with Ukraine in opposing any moves to create another permanent frozen conflict in the east of the country.</p> <p> Finally, the Council commented on the World Trade Organization, WTO, and reaffirmed its commitment to the idea of a rules-based trading system.  At a time when many international institutions are breaking down it is right to defend principles which have directly enabled enormous numbers of new jobs and opportunities both here and throughout the world.  If the rules-based trading system breaks down it is the workers of the world who will suffer the most.  The US behaviour in this regard is very regrettable.  The Government should be making representations in that regard.</p> <p> This was a low-key start to the work of the new Commission and President Michel at the Council.  It achieved little but it did discuss important issues.  Hopefully, 2020 will see significantly greater urgency and a willingness by countries such as Ireland to help break the self-defeating arguments which are preventing the Union from doing the job which we need it to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.405" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1309" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="14:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800034#GG00200"><p>In October, we all welcomed the fact that an agreement between the EU task force and the British Government had been reached.  Following a meeting with the T&aacute;naiste, Sinn F&eacute;in was satisfied that the agreement ensures there will be no hardening of the Border and that no veto would be given to the DUP.  However, the Taoiseach and the Irish Government must be vigilant and it would be wise to take consideration of the manner in which Brexit negotiations have unfolded over the past three and a half years.  In the Tories, we are dealing with a party with very little understanding of Ireland, our history or our people.  Their approach throughout the recent negotiations is evidence of that fact.  We are dealing with a British Prime Minister who once compared the Border on this island with a boundary between boroughs in London.  Again, that shows no real understanding of the geography or history of Ireland and the impact of partition and years of conflict on our island.</p>  <p>  We know there were agreements previously that were not acted on and some of them were ignored.  There have been false dawns before and the British Government, by delays, has whittled away at the progress and goodwill that have been achieved in the peace process.  If one were to talk to many communities throughout the North people would talk about the lack of a peace dividend for their community and that is right across the North.</p>  <p>  Emboldened by his majority, the British Prime Minister has amended the Brexit withdrawal Bill to insert a legal clause that future trade negotiations must conclude by 31 December 2020.  That can happen only if the British Government agrees to a near full-aligned deal with the EU or, on the other hand, a bare bones trade agreement.  While remaining optimistic a positive deal can still be struck, it is the responsibility of the Irish Government to prepare for all possibilities.</p>  <p>  Caution, vigilance and an unwavering commitment to the protection of Ireland&rsquo;s interests must be how the Government proceeds in the new year.  Ireland will need significant support in the future and the Government needs to push for EU funding in this regard because Brexit will have a hugely negative impact on the island of Ireland and its people. </p>  <p>  Nowhere is such a resolute approach more needed than in defending the Good Friday Agreement and the Irish peace process.  We must see an end to the sustained and dangerous attacks on the agreement from the British political establishment.  Mr. Johnson must receive that message loud and clear from all governments.  Both Governments, as co-guarantors, must honour their obligations to uphold the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts but it is also the responsibility of the Government to champion the vote in the North.  Ireland, North or South, did not consent to Brexit.  That reality cannot be forgotten, sidelined or brushed under the carpet.  Last Thursday, the people in the North once again used their vote to reject Brexit.  That was seen most powerfully in the historic result in north Belfast.</p>  <p>  Brexit has changed the political landscape in Ireland, Britain and Europe.  The Taoiseach said that the political tectonic plates had shifted in the North.  All the old certainties are gone.  In the election, voters clearly responded to co-operation between pro-remain, progressive parties.  That has demonstrated once again that the majority of people in the North are opposed to being dragged out of the EU, opposed to any hardening of the Border in Ireland and want to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the all-Ireland economy.  This election was a defining moment in our politics.  It delivered a majority of Irish nationalist and progressive MPs.  The Irish Government must pay attention to this.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in wants to see a successful conclusion of the talks established by the two Governments this week and for the political institutions to be restored on a credible and sustainable basis.  We need a new kind of politics, a new Assembly and a new Executive, which is underpinned by resources to deliver quality public services.  We need an inclusive Executive that brings together parties which are truly committed to delivering good and inclusive governance.  After a decade of austerity and underinvestment that has stifled economic growth, public services and communities in the North need adequate financial commitments from the British Government.  I also welcome the commitment given by the T&aacute;naiste today that the Irish Government would not be found wanting in this regard.  All of this is achievable.  It is time for party leaders and both Governments to show their political will to deliver on good Government for all.</p>  <p>  This European Council meeting had a significant discussion on climate change.  Last week the European Commission launched its vision for a European green deal.  It is a compromise document, one that Sinn F&eacute;in believes could or should be more ambitious and more radical in its outlook.  The Commission at least recognises that the existing targets are not good enough and wants to increase the greenhouse gas emission reduction target from 45% to 55% by 2030.</p> <p>This is a real problem for the Government as it has consistently failed to achieve even the current modest targets.  Last week also saw the publication of the climate change performance index, in which the Irish State went from the worst performer in the EU to the second worst performer in a year.  This was spun as a success by the Taoiseach and his Ministers.  We are only ahead of Poland, which gets 80% of its energy from coal.  The European Commission has called for a review of the framework for energy infrastructure to ensure consistency with the climate neutrality objective.  It is hard to see how Fine Gael's love for fracked gas terminals will survive such a review.  This is an issue that has received cross-party support.  However, the Taoiseach and his Ministers, as is their style, have simply ignored the views of the House and want to make out that fracked gas is somehow climate neutral energy.</p> <p> The Commission's green deal also calls for a new circular economy action plan, including a "right to repair" and other provisions around reparable rather than obsolete goods; a requirement for the design of all new buildings to be in line with the needs of the circular economy and climate proofing of the building stock; increased and expanded use of rail, including the transport of freight by rail, an area where it will be interesting to see what level of Government investment is prompted; a review of all current tax exemptions for aviation and maritime fuels; improved and expanded public transport, another area which will be interesting to watch; and an increase in the area of land under organic farming in the EU, to be coupled with a farm to fork strategy that will strive to stimulate sustainable food consumption and promote affordable healthy food for all.  These are just some of the proposals in the EU's green deal.  I believe they are progressive and show real potential. </p> <p> I also note that there was a discussion on the Africa-EU Partnership.  This was primarily focused on migration.  The new President of the European Commission, Dr. Ursula von der Leyen, promised she would make migration a "core topic" of her Presidency.  The EU's current policies have turned the Mediterranean into a graveyard.  They have involved pushing refugees back to Libya, where they are tortured and brutalised in so-called detention centres or in slave markets.  It has involved throwing money at autocratic leaders and has led to further human rights abuses.  This has all been funded by the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa.  This trust fund should be spent on development and improving socioeconomic conditions.  Instead it is leading to increased human rights abuses and is preventing refugees from seeking international protection.  In this review of the Africa-EU Partnership Ireland should seek massive reform of the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa.  Either the fund's harmful focus on migration should be removed or we should simply stop paying into it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.407" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1353" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="14:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800035#HH00200"><p>I am glad to have the opportunity to make a few observations on the European Council meeting that took place last week.  It is important to debate matters discussed at the European Council in this House.  As I said this morning, the single biggest economic challenge facing the European Union is providing global leadership on climate change and forming the vanguard on climate action, not least as the current US President and his Administration are in the process of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement.  I listened with interest to the Taoiseach's comment that perhaps a change in Administration in the United States might change that direction of travel.  That is certainly to be hoped for.</p>  <p>  The Labour Party strongly endorses the European Council's decision to back the objective of making the European economy climate neutral by 2050 in line with international commitments.  I welcome the fact that the Vice President of the European Commission, Mr. Frans Timmermans of the Labour Party's sister party in the Netherlands, is leading on the EU's green deal programme.  I have no doubt that this programme will be designed to help the creation of new, sustainable jobs and to provide targeted support to the regions of Europe that find the transition to a carbon-free environment most difficult to achieve.  It is regrettable that one member state, Poland, could not commit to the 2050 objective.  This is to be revisited in June 2020 when I hope the Polish Government will be brought on board with respect to the collective will of the Union.  If this is not possible, the EU will need to look at measures to make sure that our collective targets are not undermined by one member state, especially given that Poland still has a significant coal-mining industry.</p>  <p>  Two things are clear from the European Council's conclusions on climate action.  First, every member state needs to have a forward-looking vision of how it can transform its economy through research and innovation.  This transformation is not just a challenge, but also a tremendous opportunity.  Second, this transformation will require major investment, and the State will have to take a lead role in providing this investment.  The Labour Party welcomes the European Council's call for the development of strong research and innovation policies.  </p>  <p>  What are our Government's plans in that regard?  What additional resources will be made available to universities, including the new technological universities we are in the process of creating, to engage in the kind of research that could assist the development of sustainable low-carbon technologies?  What additional investment will be made in State enterprises, those engines of growth we have had since the beginning of the State which have been transformative in a range of areas, particularly energy production?  How will they be enabled to scale up their pilot programmes in various sustainable economic activities, including wind energy, recycling and new forms of land management?  Alternatively, is the Government planning to rely on the private sector to lead on all of this?  The Government should clearly outline an ambitious strategic approach and show willingness to back investment as part of a transformative climate strategy.</p>  <p>  The Labour Party welcomes the European Council's focus on an economic transition that is just, socially balanced and fair, not just cost-efficient and competitive.  I welcome the intention of the European Investment Bank, EIB, to facilitate &euro;1 trillion of investment in climate action and environmental sustainability in the period from 2021 to 2030.  That sounds like a mind-numbing sum of money, but over ten years it equates to &euro;100 billion per year.  Ireland's share by population size would be only around &euro;1 billion per year.  Will Ireland benefit from &euro;1 billion of EIB investment every year?  Do we have the plans and the capacity to absorb that?  What is the Government going to do to ensure that we are ambitious and have those plans?</p>  <p>  The European Commission has announced that &euro;100 billion of investment will be made available through the just transition mechanism.  The Labour Party has been calling for such a just transition approach, meaning investment to create new, sustainable jobs in the regions that will have to undergo the greatest level of change to become climate neutral.  This will allow the entire country to become climate neutral.  I cautiously welcome the invitation extended by the European Council to the Commission to consider changing state aid and public procurement rules in order to facilitate our climate neutrality objectives.  I have no doubt that State enterprises will have to play a significant role, and we should be willing to rethink rules that may hold State enterprises back from making major capital investments that would help address these ambitious climate change targets.</p>  <p>  As I have said before, I am critical of the strategic agenda set out by the new Commission under President Ursula von der Leyen.  It lacks the level of ambition needed to drive Europe towards an ambitious social and environmental programme.  However, I am glad to see that the European Council has recommended a Europe-wide conference on the future of Europe.</p> <p>This will be an important opportunity to spell out a vision of a people's Europe based on sustainability and on the highest standard of life, rather than just a recreation of a European market, which is what the von der Leyen agenda largely offers to date.</p> <p> As others have mentioned, I note that in June next year there will be another EU summit with the African Union.  As I said previously, this is a vital relationship and I hope that Europe's strategic interests will be matched by a willingness to invest in Africa, such as through a new Marshall Plan for Europe's neighbourhood.  We must also look at how European corporation tax policies impact on Africa and we need to reform them.</p> <p> I welcome the solidarity shown to Albania and hope the assistance offered will have an impact.  I welcome the offer of assistance to Albania and North Macedonia.  The European Council could have done much more.</p> <p> I also welcome that the European Council has clearly stated that "a balance of rights and obligations" and "a level playing field" must be maintained in the next phase of the UK-EU relationship.  This is particularly important as Boris Johnson's announcement that he will legislate to prevent any delay to the UK's transition period means that we are very time constrained in our capacity to negotiate a comprehensive trade agreement in the short 12 months ahead.  The prospect of a no-deal conclusion, unfortunately, has loomed again on the horizon.  No deal would be unlikely to last for long given the dire economic consequences of such an occurrence for the UK itself, but a rushed deal could have negative long-term consequences if it does not sufficiently protect the European market from being undermined by a race to the bottom in terms of both labour and environmental standards.  It is already rumoured that the new Conservative Government may remove social and environmental protections from the withdrawal agreement.  These concessions were negotiated by the British Labour Party.  If that happens, it will clearly signal that Prime Minister Johnson intends for the UK to become an even more deregulated market economy in stark contrast to the regulated norms we have built up over 40 years in the European Union.</p> <p> I am pleased to see Michel Barnier continue to act as head of the negotiation team for the European Union in the next phase of contact with the United Kingdom.  Mr. Barnier has shown a steadfast commitment to Ireland's interests, and I have every confidence that this will remain the case.  From a Labour Party perspective, we recognise the real economic harm and hardship that would follow from the UK leaving the EU at the end of 2020 without a deal or with the bare bones of a deal.  We also recognise that a poor deal could undermine workers' rights and environmental standards, and not only in Britain because the contagion could impact right across Europe.  That is an outcome we should work might and main to avoid.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.409" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="14:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800036#JJ00200"><p>At one level, Ursula von der Leyen's commitment to a new green deal and addressing climate change is positive because the climate emergency is a terrifying reality that is hurtling at humanity at a ferocious pace and threatening our existence and that of future generations.  Insofar as the popular movement, in particular of young people and environmentalists, has forced this issue, through people power, strikes, protest and direct actions, to the top of the political agenda to such an extent that Ursula von der Leyen feels the need to state it is her key priority, that is all very positive.  I contend that at a European-wide level and, similarly, in the rhetorical commitments of this Government, there is a stark contrast between verbal commitment and a capacity or even willingness to deliver on the sort of radical climate measures that are necessary to address the climate emergency.  At a European-wide level, when one looks at the fine print of Ursula von der Leyen's paper, I believe Europe will be prevented from taking the radical action necessary because it hopes to do so while upholding key pillars of the economic philosophy that is hard-wired into the European treaties, in particular in the form of state aid rules and the commitment to market mechanisms.  Every policy objective is rammed through the requirement that it be delivered through a competitive market and through preventing state aid to particular industries.  That means, in effect, that nothing will happen because Europe is committed to a privatisation agenda as a result of those state aid rules, perhaps not consciously but certainly in effect.  Public transport is the most obvious example of that.  If one pursues the privatisation of public transport, as the Government is doing here and as is being done right across Europe, and state aid rules preclude a renationalisation of the public transport system and transport has to operate on a for-profit basis, how does one deliver a public transport system that will be attractive enough for large numbers of people to move away from the private car to using public transport?  The answer is that it cannot be done.</p>  <p>  Ursula von der Leyen referred to carbon pricing.  What is the effect of carbon pricing?  One effect is that the cost of bus fares and fares for other forms of public transport will increase rather than decrease.  That is what has happened consistently in this country.  Despite privatisation and all the talk that it would deliver greater efficiency and competition, it does not deliver that at all.  Fares continue to go up and private providers have no interest in providing public transport on routes on which they cannot make a lot of money.  As a result, public service obligation routes are cut.  One can even see that in the BusConnects plan under which public service obligation routes are being threatened in favour of high frequency and highly profitable commuter routes.  Less profitable routes, for example, those used predominately by elderly people with a bus pass, are the ones that come under threat.  The way to address that is by means of heavier levels of subsidisation, in other words, distorting the market, but we are prevented from distorting the market because of the legal rules of the European Union that say we cannot do that.</p>  <p>  Afforestation in this country is another example.  We are in the bizarre position that the State company set up with the specific objective of increasing afforestation is effectively precluded from afforestation because of state aid rules.  Coillte has therefore delivered a dismal result in terms of afforestation levels, which are falling.  They have fallen in the time I have been in the D&aacute;il from approximately 6,000 ha a year when I first came into the D&aacute;il to approximately 3,000 ha now.  Notwithstanding all sorts of interesting targets that are never met, the actual delivery does not happen.  Similarly, that prevents the sort of subsidies that would be necessary for small farmers because it would distort the market.  What we end up with is companies like Coillte becoming much more commercial and focused on commercial forestry crops that are not very good for the environment.  Increasingly, the company is even cutting down forests to make way for wind farms or other such developments, thereby departing completely from its core objective of planting trees and stewarding the national forest estate.</p> <p>Those are just some examples.  The necessary dramatic shifts, including on retrofitting and the insulation of homes, and the State intervention in the economy that is necessary if these dramatic shifts are to be made will simply not happen because the neo-liberal rules of the European market prevent them.</p> <p> The other important point I would make in this regard is that if we are to have the sort of radical climate action that is necessary, we need to bring the people with us.  For many who are suffering from poverty, particularly fuel poverty, or who were at the wrong end of the growing level of income inequality in this country and the rest of Europe, action on the climate is increasingly looking like a threat that will make them poorer rather than make their lives better.  The carbon tax is obviously a good example of that.  The poorest people are likely to be hardest hit, which is hardly endearing the climate agenda to people who are attacked in that way.</p> <p> This flows from another critical fact about the European Union, or Europe and western capitalism more generally.  In this regard, consider the comments of the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, on the wider European agenda preventing the horrors of the 1930s, 1940s and so on.  Hello?  The far right is on the rise everywhere in Europe.  Notwithstanding that the EU is supposed to act as a buffer, the opposite is happening.  The far right is on the rise in Austria, Germany, France and all across Europe.  Why?  European leaders had better start asking themselves this.  When one saw some of the nasty elements gathered outside the D&aacute;il last Saturday &ndash; far-right elements actively and consciously seeing themselves as linked to the far right across Europe &ndash; it led to the scary thought that this stuff is on the way back.  Why is it happening all across Europe?  The answer, of course, is that inequality is growing massively.  Wage share &ndash; the share that working people take out of national income &ndash; has fallen dramatically all across Europe for the past 30 years.  This is worst in Ireland.  Ireland has seen the biggest fall.  In the 1970s, labour, or workers, took 60% of national income.  This is now down to 40%.  The rest, a much higher proportion, is going towards profits and the super-wealthy.  That pattern is reflected all across the European Union and the western world.</p> <p> Let me give another example of this sort of thing.  Just look at what is happening on the streets of France because of pensions being attacked.  We are wealthier than we have ever been in the western world.  One would think that would yield a dividend for people so they might enjoy their old age a bit more and have to work a little less than they once had to.  What is actually happening is that people's pension rights are being attacked.  They are being attacked most in Ireland.  Everywhere they are under attack.  President Macron is attacking them in France, which is bringing millions of people out on the streets.  He wants to move the pension age from 62 to 64. Here we are planning to move the pension age to 68.  That hardly endears people to the European vision or the necessity of climate action.  Unless these issues are addressed, dark clouds will loom environmentally, socially and politically on the European horizon.</p></speech>

Obviously, the multi-annual financial framework was discussed.  Nobody denies the importance of that and of the budgets for the work of the European Union.  I believe, however, that there are certain rights issues that are not receiving the attention they deserve and are not being acted upon sufficiently.  Speaking during the pre-European Council statements last week, I referred to a statement by the EU's ambassador to the African Union to the effect that, in spite of the EU being the world's largest overseas development aid donor, there is a core group of the world's poorest who are receiving less than 10% of EU aid.  While the EU is stressing the importance of the EU-Africa partnership, and there is going to be a summit, there is a need to spell out exactly how it will be a real partnership, not the traditional Europe-dominating-Africa relationship we have seen in the past.</p><p>Another rights issue that arose last week concerned Libya.  I refer to what is now happening with General Haftar, to the Rohingya and to the case in the International Criminal Court.</p><p>Disappointingly, we are not hearing that the EU is being proactive on the issue of Catalonia.  While I accept that Spain is the EU member, it is not right that people such as teachers, town mayors, community activists and others exercising their right to peaceful protest are being issued with arrest warrants.  Some are in prison.  We are aware of the sentences that have been imposed on the seven elected representatives and the two leaders from civil society.  There is much concern about the conviction of Mr. Jordi S&agrave;nchez and Mr. Jordi Cuixart, who<font color="#4F4F4F"> got</font>nine years in prison for leading a peaceful protest.  This is opening the door for criminalisation of activities such as peaceful civil disobedience.  The two men had already spent two years in preventative custody ahead of their trial.  The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has called for their release.  EU member states are allowing the European Convention on Human Rights and the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights to be violated.  I am referring to rights such as rights to a fair trial, to freedom of thought, to freedom of assembly and to freedom from discrimination.  The men are being denied their constitutional right to appeal their convictions through normal channels of the lower courts.</p><p>The former Speaker of the Catalan Parliament, Ms Carme Forcadell, was sentenced for allowing parliamentary debate on independence.  She said her role as Speaker of Parliament could not be to censor debate and that her duty was to defend the sovereignty of parliament and political pluralism.  She also stated, &quot;In a democratic parliament, the word has to be free.&quot;  For that, she got 11 and a half years in prison.  The EU is conspicuously quiet on this.</p><p>At the meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence yesterday, we had an interesting discussion that included Brexit.  It is all very well for Prime Minister Johnson to say everything will be done and dusted by 31 January, but we know there is a different reality.  It is in the months soon after 31 January that the reality will hit and that the elements of the unknown will arise.  Who really knows exactly what will happen?</p><p>There was a word of warning at the meeting yesterday on the disconnects.  It concerned the unionist-loyalist community's attachment to the Crown and its fear of minority status for the unionist community and their sense of British identity.  The younger generation is so caught by the past, some would see reconciliation as betrayal.  While many of us look forward to a 32-county republic, unionists will feel threatened by a border poll.  Instead of a border poll, there should be a discussion on a new Ireland and what a new Ireland or 32 counties would look like.  This would be just like the plans for a conference on the type of Europe that we would want.  In the midst of Brexit, these issues are still very alive and relevant because the legacy was never really resolved under the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>I just noticed a report from the Seanad special select committee on this.  Evidence was presented from a wide number of industries, including those from the food and drink, agriculture, fuel, and energy sectors.  The main thrust was the impact of Brexit on the food industry, and especially the impact of no deal.  This is not as far-fetched a possibility as it may seem if Britain is going out one way or the other on 31 January.  The introduction of tariffs will decimate Ireland's food and drink exports to the UK.  Northern Ireland farmers are already feeling the effects of losses.  We are seeing the repercussions of our over-reliance on one market, the UK market.  While negotiating Brexit was challenging and fraught, it might be nothing by comparison with implementation.</p><p>I realise we are discussing climate change tonight but I do not believe there can be progress on this unless there is a real commitment to climate justice.  The EU at least recognises there are serious challenges associated with achieving carbon neutrality.  It recognises a need for significant public and private investment.  There are a number of positive points in the conclusion in that the next multi-annual financial framework has to contribute significantly to climate action, with a commitment to achieve carbon neutrality.  I hate using the clich&eacute; about time running out but I believe this is the reality.  There is a need for much more action of this.  I am not just talking about funding.</p></speech>

I note the Taoiseach's comments about the new climate action forum involving Ireland, Denmark and Sweden.  Its work could be very valuable but the targets for Ireland for 2030, laid down in Ms Ursula von der Leyen's green new deal, will be certainly challenging for the next two Irish Governments.</p> <p>When will we see definitive proposals for the so-called socially-balanced and fair transition referred to in the European Council&rsquo;s communiqu&eacute;?  What proposals, if any, did the Taoiseach make on the fair transition and climate mitigation measures that we heard about?  He mentioned a just transition mechanism for regions and industries, but what on earth does that mean for people who are struggling, those in fuel poverty, etc.?  Earlier today, I discussed with the Minister of State's colleague, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, our increasing ties and co-operation with Scotland.  With the UK now definitely leaving the European Union and, potentially, Scotland leaving the UK and wanting to maintain its membership of the EU, it is time to question the whole structure of membership and enlargement.</p> <p> On the basis of recent meetings of the Council, it seems that, although we had the annual enlargement package and country reports on 29 May 2019, enlargement has been put on the back burner.  I asked the T&aacute;naiste about the futures of Albania, North Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Armenia, Georgia and even Turkey.  It seems that the Minister of State's colleagues once again parked enlargement, even though it is absolutely critical for Balkan security and economic development.  We have seen Turkey's recent unfriendly moves in respect of the republics of Cyprus and Greece, our sister states in the European Union.</p> <p> It is planned to hold a conference on the future of Europe.  That is timely in light of Brexit.  Conclusions 19 and 20 of 12 December mention Turkey and Albania but do not go into anything further about possible membership for Albania, for example, even in the short term.  We know, however, that Germany&rsquo;s opposition to Turkish accession since negotiations started in 2005 - those negotiations have been ongoing for almost a decade and a half - has been a major reason for the rise to and maintenance in power of President Erdogan and his AKP party.  The current regime in Turkey has some disturbing policies..  The country has turned away from the great reforms of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and the Turkish Republic earlier in the last century.  What kind of definitive actions can be taken about this situation now?</p> <p> The policy and plans for enlargement are critical to how we see Europe evolving.  If certain countries with a long tradition in European affairs - these might include various former Russian states, Ukraine and Kazakhstan - are precluded from membership in the medium term, what then will be the position?  Serbia and Montenegro, for example, have been candidates for membership since 2012 and 2010, respectively.  The report on Kosovo stated that the situation there is challenging.  We know about the situation in Serbia and Kosovo.  It seems, however, that we should be taking action in respect of North Macedonia and Albania, which have been candidates for membership since 2005 and 2014, respectively.  If Europe is for all Europeans, then clearly the current situation is not tenable, particularly with the UK leaving.</p> <p> During our pre-Council discussion, I mentioned the multi-annual financial framework.  As I stated, our budget contributions are increasing fairly rapidly, from &euro;3 billion next year to &euro;3.5 billion in 2023.  Before the Council meeting, the Taoiseach said that he expected our contributions to increase dramatically.  We do not want a situation where these contributions will be an overwhelming part of the budget, similar to our interest payments in the past.  Did the Taoiseach have any input in respect of the so-called "negotiating box" relating to the multi-annual financial framework, prepared by the Finnish Presidency and presented by the new Finnish Prime Minister?  Has the Taoiseach got real commitments?  He mentioned a peace dividend.  Have we got real commitments for support from the European Union in the context of the UK leaving in a few weeks' time?</p></speech>

I understand that she was unwell during the week.  I also wish her well in her work.  I wish a Happy Christmas to her, to her family and to the other Ministers dealing with this matter.  </p>  <p>  In the course of the recent pre-Council statements, I raised the challenges that would emerge to Ireland's farming and agriculture sector in the context of the EU commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.  I did so while highlighting the findings of the European Commission Joint Research Centre report which found that Ireland was the most carbon-efficient producer in the European Union per unit of dairy production and the fifth most carbon-efficient producer of beef per kilogram.  Those are its findings and not ours.  I also asked what would be the policy position or guidance we would be giving to the EU when it comes to outlining the ways in which we can approach carbon neutrality by 2050.  I would very much like to hear some detail of that today.  If the Minister of State cannot provide it, I ask that she commit to communicating the information to my office as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The conclusions reached by the Council acknowledge that the transition to climate neutrality will bring significant opportunities, such as potential for economic growth, for new business models and markets and for new jobs and technological developments.  It also accepts, however, that achieving climate neutrality will require overcoming serious challenges and that work must be done to put in place an enabling framework that benefits all member states, taking into account different national circumstances in terms of starting points.  We must also establish our starting point on the record of where we are with our carbon footprint and the good strides and achievements we have made.  We cannot be totally demonising the farming community all of the time.  That is what is happening in this House and abroad.  We need to stand up, assert our position and let them know from where we are starting.  I say that because if we start on the floor, where they would like us to start, we will be destroyed.</p>  <p>  That is a vital point to remember.  As I pointed out a few moments ago, Ireland and Irish farmers have an excellent reputation in the context of reducing carbon emissions.  I met some of the farmers who were outside yesterday a number of times.  Very few politicians went out to meet those farmers on the street.  Those farmers do not want to be here on the street.  They left early yesterday evening, thankfully, and did not cause much disruption, but they could have.  Those farmers are frustrated by the prices and by the way they are being treated in being dismissed and demonised.  It is totally unfair.  I wish Mr. Tim Cullinane, a Tipperary man and the incoming president of the IFA, well.  He was elected yesterday and I offer him my congratulations.</p>  <p>  There was a low turnout in the recent by-elections and there was also a low turnout in the election of the new IFA president.  Institutions are failing the people.  The farming institutions and the EU institutions are failing rural Ireland and the farm families.  We are just demonising them and portraying them as bad people and polluters who do care about the environment.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  They are good custodians of the environment and do much in that regard, including in the context of animal husbandry, crop management, planting trees and various other kinds of work.  They are interested in doing that.  Young people, as young as ten, were making tea and soup for people inside in a horse box yesterday.  They are interested in the future and that is why they were here yesterday.  It was not to glibly cause trouble with Dublin protests.  That is happening while the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, is almost absent.  He was away yesterday and some of the people outside thought he was on holidays.  I do not know where he was.  I think he was in Brussels and I said that to the people outside.  He could have been on holidays for the last four years because he has paid lip service to farmers and done nothing for them.  Farmers have an excellent reputation in respect of reducing carbon emissions.  Day in and day out, they are being demonised in this House, in the media and all over.  It is the duty of the Minister of State, at this level, and that is why I asked before she went, what she was going to bring to the table at that meeting.  I am asking her now to let us know in her reply, or to at least communicate with my office, what she put on the table.  She should have defended the people who put her in here.</p>  <p>  They are a responsible sector and they want to play their part.  I cannot reiterate that point enough.  I also refer to the farm organisations.  That said, the sad thing is, however, that they are not getting thanked for their work on mitigating carbon.  They do not want thanks.  They are not getting it, but they do not want it nor expect it.  They do want to be recognised and respected for what they are doing.  Instead, they are being demonised and held up as killers of the planet and other such nonsense.  That is patent nonsense.  It is unfair, unnecessary and unwarranted.  This is going to present very real challenges, not just for farmers but also for our entire economic model.</p>  <p>  In 2016 alone, the agrifood sector generated 7% of gross value added to the tune of &euro;13.9 billion, produced 9.8% of Ireland's merchandise exports and provided 8.5% of national employment.  That is not something to be sniffed at.  It is vital that we protect and sustain this area.  When employment in inputs, processing and marketing is included, the agrifood sector accounts for almost 10% of all employment in our State.</p> <p>That is no mean figure.  It has to be acknowledged and supported but the Government only pays lipservice to it.  We fought hard in the programme for Government negotiations to have every policy rural-proofed.  The Government must have shredded the document the hour after it got into office because nothing has been rural-proofed since.  I have yet to see any proposal from the European Commission which would be capable of protecting our economy from the kind of shock that would happen if we were to pursue this climate neutrality approach.</p> <p> The European Council in its conclusions last week also welcomed the European Commission's announcement that it will aim at facilitating &euro;100 billion of investment through the just transition mechanism.  The fact is, however, that we have seen what just transition means in an Irish context with the loss of jobs to the midlands region, as well as in Littleton, County Tipperary, and the complete erosion of industries which have supported those counties for generations with nothing to replace them.  The fund put in place by the Government to get the workers affected into new jobs or reskilled is pathetic.  It would not even pay the envelopes containing the redundancy notices.  Just transition is a great phrase.  It sounds almost gentle.  The reality is quite different, however.  In most cases, wherever it goes, it brings thousands of job losses with it and nothing to replace them.</p> <p> Who is really benefiting and what are we actually transitioning toward?  Sin &eacute; an cheist m&oacute;r.  There is a subterfuge going on here with many platitudes but no benefit.  We do not want benefit over anyone else.  We want recognition and fair play.  I have always believed that fair play is fine play.  Many countries are expressing doubt and a great deal of caution around where Europe is going with climate policy.  We have seen this with respect to the recent United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP25, held in Madrid.  Those countries that are not wholehearted supporters of the COP25 agenda were accused of obstruction, even when they presented specific concerns with the proposals which would negatively impact their economies.  Where are we going if we cannot have meaningful dialogue and representatives are demonised as obstructionists?  If countries cannot bring forward objections to these forums, then what is all the talk about consultation and agreement really about?  Our little country and the efforts it has made must be recognised.</p> <p> The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, announced that Ireland is signing up to a multi-annual pledge to the green climate fund which helps developing countries make the transition while doubling our annual commitment with a total contribution of &euro;18 million from 2019 to 2023.  This is in addition to &euro;196.7 million in international climate finance Ireland has contributed from 2016 to 2018 to developing countries, a not so insignificant sum to our small economy.  Ireland has also committed an additional &euro;3 million in total funding in 2019 to the least developed countries.  This support is focused on those countries that are vulnerable to climate change.  While I support this, we need to be acknowledged for what we are doing.  Although most of that is worthy, there is still a concern that we have given &euro;200 million to international climate financing without any real public engagement on that amount.  We are told we are obstructionists if we ask questions about this.</p> <p> I noted that in its conclusions, the European Council invited the European Commission to report regularly on the socio-economic impact of the transition to climate neutrality.  We must see more of this.  We must know the social and economic impact of what we are signing up to.  That information needs to be made widely available.  Will the Government make this kind of analysis much more readily available to the public to allow it to assess the social price of our carbon commitments?</p> <p> While the Government stood down a &euro;5 million spin team, it still does much spinning.  It might put some of that energy into telling our colleagues across Europe and the world that our farmers and farming families have played, are playing and will play their part.  They try to be self-sufficient and export the best of beef.  All we want is some modicum of respect and fairness.</p></speech>

This includes a 50% to 55% emissions reduction target for 2030.  That is a big deal.  Involved in this is the establishment of a just transition mechanism worth up to &euro;100 billion.  In this context, the outcome of the COP25 summit in Madrid was disappointing.  There was no breakthrough there.  I appreciate the positions of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic which had difficulties signing up to this.  I gather Poland did not sign up to it in the end.</p>  <p>  Has any thought been given as to how Ireland might access the just transition fund in due course?  Is peat production in the midlands envisaged as an area that could be addressed by the fund?</p>  <p>  I gather there were difficult negotiations around the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, which were deadlocked for much of the time.  Will the Minister of State indicate what contribution from Ireland is being sought?  What are we offering at this stage in the negotiations?  The Taoiseach has spoken about a &euro;1 billion fund to support Northern Ireland after Brexit.  Is that a realistic possibility?</p>  <p>  I welcome the decision of the Government to work to protect the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, Horizon, Erasmus+ and the Cohesion Fund.</p>  <p>  What is Ireland&rsquo;s position on the future of Europe conference to be held next year?  Will it involve treaty change or an intergovernmental conference?  I do not believe that is something we should envisage.  My colleague, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, said earlier that what we really need is a more practical agenda to tackle the problems faced by the citizens of Europe.</p>  <p>  While I have the floor, I wish the Minister of State a happy and peaceful Christmas.  We all appreciate her coming into the Chamber during the course of the year, as well as appearing before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, to answer our questions.  It is appreciated by all Members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.418" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1337" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="15:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800039#MM00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.</p>  <p>  Despite the fact that there was a lack of a conclusion to the COP25 negotiations, the new European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, was positive and made significant steps in the right direction with the launch of the green deal last week.  The endorsement by the European Council of the objective of climate neutrality by 2050 was also positive.  There were lengthy discussions among member states.  Poland still has concerns, not specifically around the overall EU objective but its ability to reach that by 2050.  It did not prevent the Council as a whole from approving this overall objective, however.  Ireland signed up fully to it.</p>  <p>  A new College of Commissioners has just been appointed.  We need to give them time to set out their goals and objectives.  A significant amount of funding, up to &euro;100 billion from the Commission, has been put behind this, along with a European Investment Bank supported &euro;1 trillion sustainable Europe investment plan.</p>  <p>The Commission is expected to publish its sustainable Europe investment plan in early January 2020.  That is obviously giving the Commission time to put that plan in place.  Of course, when we get that, individual countries' finance departments will need to examine those proposals accordingly.</p> <p> Last week we repeatedly raised our need to access the &euro;100 billion just transition fund, in particular relating to peat in the midlands.  It is not fair, as Deputy Mattie McGrath mentioned, to say that hundreds of people are being let go from their jobs and that there is no opportunity here.  The tone of last week's discussion, particularly on the part of the new Commission President, was very positive.  While there will be change and challenges, this is an opportunity to transition to new technologies and look at new kinds of jobs.  We know that the vast majority of our younger generation will be working in jobs that have not even been created yet.</p> <p> The fund from the European Investment Bank, EIB, and the just transition fund will allow us to look at these new types of mechanisms.  Deputy Howlin asked how we would to that.  At the Council last week, the Taoiseach met the Prime Ministers of Denmark and Sweden.  They signed their own agreement to consider how we can work with each other to share information and insights as to how we can develop these technologies, not just working with the private sector but also with the public sector.  Investment will be needed in both areas.  The issue of peat was raised in the context of the just transition mechanism.  This is not just an issue for us.  Our colleagues in Finland also have concerns.  We will continue to raise the matter, and once we have further detail on how we can access that, we will let Deputies know.</p> <p> There was quite a short discussion of the MFF at the European Council, but it was discussed in great detail at the General Affairs Council I attended earlier in the week.  This is the first time the General Affairs Council met with new figures put in place - the new negotiating box with the figures by the Finnish Presidency.  On the whole, Ireland was probably somewhat more satisfied with the proposals than most member states.  However, there are still some significant areas of concern for us, the main one being that the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, proposals still see a reduction.  While there was a proposal to increase the Pillar 2 payments by &euro;10 billion, there was still a cut to Pillar 1.  We will naturally pay more as a country because we will be net contributors for the full term.  We have consistently said we could pay above and beyond that, but not if the more traditional priorities as we see them, including CAP, Cohesion, Horizon and other such areas, are being cut.</p> <p> I personally engaged with my Finnish counterpart on the &euro;1 billion fund.  It was proposed that the European Commission would provide &euro;60 million per year, with matched funding by the Irish and UK Governments.  Over the lifetime of the seven-year budget, that would amount to just under &euro;700 million.  Through discussions, we were able to achieve an increase to a contribution of &euro;100 million from the European Commission, which with matched funding from the Irish and UK Governments would bring it to almost &euro;1 billion over the lifetime of the fund.  I would be confident that that funding will remain in place as proposed.</p> <p> In the context of Brexit, given the significant impact the PEACE programme has had already, the next phase of PEACE will be equally important.  A significant amount of work remains to be done on reconciliation and bringing communities together.</p> <p> We also support other things, including allocating 25% of the overall budget to climate change, the rule of law mechanism and own resources.  We are looking at plastic, which obviously is a self-depreciating fund, but something we are willing to look at.</p> <p> The conference is something that has stemmed out of the future of Europe debate in which Deputy Haughey and many other Deputies present took part.  Our own priorities as a Government fed into the new strategic agenda which the Commission and the new College of Commissioners are now tasked with implementing.  I would like to see that implemented through people-to-people contact.  We should focus mainly on implementing the strategic agenda as it has been laid out while also looking at other areas.  The Croatian Presidency starting in January has been asked to work towards defining a position with all the member states, looking at the content, scope, composition and functioning of such a conference.  Obviously, we would hope to play our part and make a contribution to how that will be defined.</p> <p> Most importantly, this will happen not just from a Council point of view but working with the European Parliament and the Commission.  Most importantly, we need to ensure that everything we do feeds back to the citizens because this should all be about engaging with people and ensuring that the work we are doing is based on the work they want us to do.</p></speech>

We absolutely must address the climate emergency.  There appears to be no recognition by the European Union that if addressing it seems like punishment for large sections of the population, they will just not buy into it and, worse still, they will react against it.  I mentioned that the far right is worryingly on the rise across Europe.  One feature of those on the far right is that they are climate change deniers.  If we are to take these people on, we need to pull the ground from under them by ensuring that life will be better for people by addressing the climate emergency, which it should be.  However, Europe must recognise that if it is going to win people over to that position - I see no sign of it but maybe the Minister of State can cheer me up on this front - it needs to address these things.  The most obvious thing is people's quality of life.</p>  <p>  I mentioned pensions.  How will the attack on people's pension entitlements across Europe endear people to the agenda of Europe?  How does the consistent reduction in wage share as a proportion of national income across Europe endear people to the European project on climate change?</p>  <p>  I have a very specific question.  Is there a recognition that state aid rules and market rules need to be changed, challenged or even abandoned in many cases to implement a just transition approach to the climate emergency?</p>  <p>  I have a question on Palestine, which I did not mention earlier.  Israel is acting like a complete rogue state in its treatment of the Palestinians.  After the move effectively to annex east Jerusalem, Israel is moving to annex parts of Hebron.  The Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu, is now talking about annexing the Jordan Valley.  It just goes on and on.  Ethnic cleansing is the only way to describe it and yet Europe is taking no action to sanction Israel, which it continues to treat as a preferred trade partner.  Is there any serious discussion about taking any action?  The Taoiseach always says that certain states in Europe will not tolerate sanctions, but I do not see the debate.  If Ireland is speaking up about this, where is the debate?  What is the response of those who are resistant to imposing sanctions on Israel for its flagrant breach of human rights?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.422" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1309" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="15:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800040#NN00400"><p>I raised the Palestinian question at the pre-Council discussion but that has already been asked.  I also raised the current situation in Malta.  As the Minister of State knows, there have been serious protests and mounting concern over the alleged involvement of the Prime Minister's former chief of staff and other employees in a murder and subsequent cover-up of the investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.  She was investigating corruption that went to the heart of government before she was assassinated.  Her family have said that the Prime Minister had been left deeply compromised and should resign because he failed to take action to clean up politics in Malta.  They argued that as long as he remained in place, a full investigation into her death was not possible.  I already raised it with the Taoiseach.</p> <p>Was the situation in Malta discussed?  Did the Taoiseach raise the matter with his colleagues?</p> <p> I welcome the strong statement from the European Council unequivocally affirming its solidarity with Cyprus with regard to Turkey's illegal drilling activities in Cyprus's exclusive economic zone.  Like Ireland, Cyprus is a small, partitioned island.  Partition on both islands has had a massively negative effect.  I believe the EU should work towards unification in both our countries.  Will the Minister of State indicate if the Taoiseach discussed with the Cypriot President Turkey's illegal activities in Cyprus's exclusive economic zone?  Did the Taoiseach personally express Ireland's full solidarity with the President?</p> <p> With regard to Brexit, I welcome the Minister of State's comments on the &euro;100 million in funding in the negotiations.  When will this funding be released?  The Minister of State has said it will be over a seven-year period, but when can we expect to see the effect of it?  I am conscious that Brexit is not just a situation that will impact negatively on the North or the Border region.  Has there been any discussion around a relaxation of fiscal rules?  When one considers the &euro;20 million being invested in making Dublin Port Brexit ready, this cost could be multiplied across different industries.  We know there will be a cost and a price to Brexit.  Will the Minister of State indicate if additional funding is to be made available for that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.424" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1337" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="15:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800041#OO00200"><p>I will start with the last questions, around Brexit and when the &euro;100 million funding will be ready.  We are still implementing funding from the EU-funded INTERREG and PEACE programmes, which will finish when this current budget term ends.  There is a question as to whether the next EU budget will be implemented on time.  We are pushing to try to make sure it is ready, which will be the end of next year.  The Croatian and German presidencies are the last two EU presidencies to deal with this.  We will push to try to ensure it is agreed by the end date and it can move to the European Parliament, so all of these programmes, including the new PEACE+ programme, can be implemented from 1 January 2021.  That is what we are aiming for and that is what we hope to see happen.</p>  <p>  On the relaxation of state aid rules, we have already seen with the rescue and restructuring fund through the Department of the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, which has allowed funding to be accessed in excess of what is normally allowed under state aid rules, specifically for companies to be rescued and restructured in the context of Brexit, where there are significant challenges for markets that are specifically focused on the UK and where they need to readjust and adapt.  We would expect and hope that this would continue.  Ireland and Belgium in particular throughout the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, have always sought flexibility within the next budget that would allow for possible challenges such as this, given that while we have been able to address Northern Ireland's specific concerns, we do not know what the future relationship will look like.  There may still be significant concerns and issues for businesses, for small and medium businesses especially, who are mostly dealing with the UK.</p>  <p>  On the issue of Cyprus and the question of Greece, I am not sure whether the Taoiseach spoke directly to either prime minister but through the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and I we have certainly expressed absolute solidarity with Cyprus and we have condemned the illegal drilling off Turkey in what are Cypriot waters and the move towards an illegal movement in what are now Greek waters.  This was addressed and discussed at the most recent European Council meeting.  We expressed solidarity with both of our European Union colleagues on this matter.</p>  <p>  With regard to Malta, I share Deputy Crowe's outrage at what happened.  We need to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice.  This is a matter for the police and we are aware that the Prime Minister had said he will step down by 12 January.  If there was any involvement at any level of government, then it is a matter for the police and needs to be investigated.  We would fully support that.  I do not believe the issue was raised specifically at the European Council meeting, but I will come back to the Deputy on whether the Taoiseach raised it directly with the Prime Minister.</p>  <p>  On the Middle East peace process, our position has not changed.  Ireland has always supported a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict and the T&aacute;naiste is very focused on this.  The T&aacute;naiste visited Israel and Palestine in the past two weeks where I believe he held useful meetings with the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu, and his foreign minister Mr. Katz.  He also met President Abbas and others on the Palestinian side.  We have always tried to encourage engagement and dialogue in this regard, but at the same time, when we see wrongdoing or statements we do not agree with, we are willing to call them out.  The comments made by Mr. Netanyahu in September about annexation of the Jordan Valley were particularly grave.  The T&aacute;naiste raised this matter with him and made sure Ireland's opposition, and our position on it, was known.  The annexation of territory by force is prohibited under international law, including the UN Charter.  Our position on that will not change.  We need, however, to ensure that we address this through dialogue.  This is the position we have always taken, particularly given our position as a peacekeeping country.  We will maintain this approach.</p>  <p>  On the question of addressing the climate issue and people seeing it as a punishment, it is people who have driven this agenda.  As the Deputy and many others have said, it is our younger generations who have taken to the streets and demanded that we bring about this change, but that we do so in a fair way and in a way that acknowledges that times and technologies are changing, including the ways in which we go about our daily lives and the ways we develop our businesses, industries and other sectors.  This has come from the people, but we must make sure that we implement it in a way that is feasible and possible.  This is why the Government's plan is based for the most part on a cross-party consensus to implement our objectives and goals to reach our 2030 targets and climate neutrality by 2050 in a way that is achievable, that would not put undue pressure on specific industries and sectors, that is affordable for people, and that is possible.  We cannot ask people to drive certain cars or implement certain ways of living if they are not available to them, if there are not enough electricity ports, if there are not enough supports available to adapt or change their homes, and if businesses cannot access or avail of the new technologies.  There is a lot of work to be done but a plan is in place.  A funding mechanism will come through the Exchequer and we also hope to work with the private sector.  We also hope to access EU funding, and not just around the just transition.  There is also the &euro;1 trillion fund that will be made available.</p>  <p>  We have increased the State pension by &euro;15 per week.  It might not seem like a lot but we have tried to ensure that given the difficult times we have had with the economy, our older people in particular and those who are most vulnerable are seeing the increase and the positive turnaround in our economy.  Obviously, that did not happen in this year's budget because we implemented a no-deal Brexit-specific budget, but we hope to return to that increase again next year, or in the next budget if that does not happen.</p>  <p>  Reference was made to Europe moving towards a more right-wing position, but it is simply not the case that EU countries are not engaging on this, especially from Ireland's perspective.  There is 92% support for the European Union in Ireland.  People took to the streets in the same way they did everywhere else in the world to demand action on climate change.  We acknowledge and accept, however, that we need to support people to be able to make that difference and make the change in their own homes.  This is exactly what the Government is trying to do.</p></speech>

He contacted me as he had planned to be here but there was a diary clash.  He has discussed the issue with me in the past.  This is the third occasion in the past 15 months on which I have raised it.</p>  <p>  The matter at hand relates to land identified in the local area plan, under the county development plan and regional planning guidelines, as an area of key strategic development.  It is also an area identified for a master plan to be carried out.  Due to how zoning has been carried out and identified in Celbridge in the local area plan, quite a bit of land referred to in submissions from the Department cannot be developed or built on until the necessary infrastructure is put in place.  We accept and acknowledge this and we must learn from the mistakes of the past.  We must have development in parallel with infrastructure and services being put in place.  This is why the issue is so important and why I have raised it here for debate.</p>  <p>  This is seen as key strategic land for development.  It does not rely on a lot of infrastructure or services.  It is right beside Hazelhatch train station.  It is close to schools and in walking distance of Celbridge GAA club and the tennis club.  There is fast access to the M7 and M8 motorways and from there to the M50 and a good road network.  It has all the positives.  It is on this basis, and because the land identified in the recent local area plan cannot be built on or developed because of the lack of infrastructure, that for now we are trying to get this prioritised and pushed on.</p>  <p>  When I debated this two months ago with the Minister of State, Deputy English, he acknowledged in the Chamber that the Department would be supportive of this and would engage with the local authority.  While the Department cannot tell the local authority what to do, it would acknowledge this is an area for key development and would be supportive of the local authority progressing with the master plan.  It is also worth noting that all the key stakeholders are willing to implement the master plan at no cost to the local authority but under direct guidance and in partnership with the local authority.  Everyone is on board.  It just needs to be progressed.</p>  <p>  In October, the Minister of State, Deputy English, gave a solid commitment that he would correspond, liaise and communicate with the local authority.  To my knowledge, this has not happened.  Hence, we have to discuss the matter again today.  I hope I will not have to raise it in the new year.  I have no reason to believe that the Minister of State, Deputy English, is changing on the commitment he made because so far he has been very positive about the project.  I ask for a strict timeline for when communication will happen between him and the local authority so we can get this much needed master plan progressed.  Once it is signed off and agreed, we can progress to the various stages.</p>  <p>  We have a housing crisis.  Celbridge has a population of 22,500.  It is on the periphery of Dublin, as are Leixlip, Maynooth, Kilcock and Clane.</p></speech>

People want to live there.  Funnily enough, according to the figures I obtained from the National Transport Authority, NTA, Hazelhatch train station has been identified as one of the least used stations in the country.  This is because it is outside the town.  A development such as this would be very advantageous because it would advocate for full use of public transport as the site is a five-minute walk from the train station.  It is also worth noting the Kildare line, which Hazelhatch train station is on, is identified as one of the priority lines for getting extra carriages when the new carriages come in 2021.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.433" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="15:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800042#VV00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.  As he pointed out, I am taking the debate on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy English, who had a prior commitment.  The advancement of housing development in Celbridge and the continued planned growth of this important town in tandem with the supporting infrastructure and amenities required is an important issue.  I remember when Celbridge was a village and I am not that old.  As the Deputy pointed out, 22,500 people now live there.  It has a unique location in terms of motorways, rail infrastructure and proximity to Dublin.</p>  <p>  The Celbridge local area plan for the period 2017 to 2023 was adopted by the elected members of Kildare County Council on 17 August 2017 and came into effect on 14 September that year.  I welcome the fact that the plan supports the provision of substantial new housing development in a key urban area close to Dublin.  Kildare County Council, in its current county development plan, has earmarked Celbridge to grow in population by approximately 10,000 people over the next five to ten years.  We need to plan for this increase and to ensure that Celbridge grows in a coherent fashion with the timely delivery of the new infrastructure that will be needed for this expanded population. The provisions in the plan enabling future housing growth on the southern side of the town, in proximity to the existing commuter rail station at Hazelhatch, are particularly welcome.  This development strategy is consistent with established national and regional planning policy, which encourages new housing accessible to such high-quality public transport facilities in the interest of sustainable development.  The local area plan did not identify the lands adjacent to Hazelhatch train station for immediate development due, primarily, to flood management issues.  Kildare County Council has engaged consultants to address the issue, with a final report due early next year.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, the local area plan also identifies the key pieces of strategic infrastructure that are required to be delivered as part of the planned new housing development areas.  The phasing arrangements set out in section 13 of the local area plan include requirements on the provision of new road, bridge, open space and other facilities that will support the new homes to be constructed.  Design briefs are also provided for the five key development areas earmarked for future housing development, which will further assist in ensuring the construction of quality residential neighbourhoods that are integrated into the existing urban fabric of the town.</p>  <p>  As part of the roll-out of the local area plan and in the interests of supporting the integrated development of housing within it, Kildare County Council is committed to preparing a transport mobility management plan to support the sustainable growth of the town.  State agencies, along with the Department and, I understand, the NTA will be active in their support of the development of such a plan, which will inform future infrastructure delivery.</p>  <p>  I understand that Irish Water is in the process of upgrading the Leixlip wastewater treatment plant which serves Celbridge, and is also actively working to address identified constraints in the local waste water system, in particular the upgrading of the local pumping station.  These measures will actively support the ongoing and future delivery of housing in Celbridge.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the Department is administering the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, launched as part of Project Ireland 2040.  The fund is designed to support the compact growth and sustainable development of Ireland's five cities, regional drivers and other large urban centres and to leverage a greater proportion of residential and commercial development, supported by infrastructure, services and amenities, within the existing built-up areas of our larger urban settlements.  The Department has responsibility for implementing the URDF, which has an allocation of &euro;2 billion over ten years.</p>  <p>  In 2018, bids were invited from public bodies for funding support from the URDF under category A, for projects that were proposed as being ready to be initiated, or under category B, as projects that required further consideration and development.  On 26 November 2018, initial URDF support of &euro;100 million was provisionally allocated to a total of 88 projects throughout the country.  As part of the first tranche, Kildare County Council was allocated support of &euro;400,000 towards its category B proposal to progress the technical and preparatory element of the Celbridge southern relief road and second Liffey crossing.  The advancement and completion of this category B project is, in the first instance, a matter for Kildare County Council.  It will also be a matter for the council to consider the advancement of subsequent elements of the wider project, and whether additional funding support should be sought for them under future URDF funding calls.</p>  <p>  While the URDF is not intended to provide direct support for particular housing projects, some of the projects it is currently supporting, including the Celbridge southern relief road and second Liffey crossing, will enable a significant proportion of residential and mixed-use development to be delivered within the existing built-up footprints of our cities and towns.  The Department will continue to work with Kildare County Council to support it in developing appropriate housing in key locations, such as Celbridge and other key urban centres in County Kildare, in accordance with the adopted statutory plans.</p></speech>

In each contribution I have made on this issue I have acknowledged the role of the Minister of State, Deputy English, working with me and my colleague, Deputy Durkan, in allocating the funding to take the second bridge in Celbridge from concept through to design and tender.  The tender process for consultants is under way, with a view to consultants being appointed early in the new year.  The second bridge will help to address the existing gridlock in the town and support future development.  It will also assist in the development of lands included in the submission from the Department, which seeks balance in the town in terms of future development.  All of this is very welcome, as I have acknowledged in the past in this House.</p>  <p>  The lands under discussion are in a different location and they are not reliant on the aforementioned infrastructure.  They are shovel-ready, once the master plan has been agreed.  The current local area plan identifies this land as a key area for strategic development.  It also outlines that the master plan should be completed.  The land is zoned residential but it cannot be built on for the reasons mentioned, such as lack of infrastructure and so on.  While these issues are being addressed, it will be some time before the process is complete.  I am asking that in the meantime the master plan be progressed.  For this to happen, we need the Department to communicate to the local authority that it should support the advancement of the master plan, which is identified as a requirement during the lifetime of the current local area plan, such that much-needed development and housing can be built in Celbridge on this particular site, which is located beside all of the amenities and services referenced earlier, in particular the train station.  </p>  <p>  The Kildare railway line, which services Hazelhatch train station located adjacent to this site, has been identified for additional carriages in early 2021.  It has also been identified as a line to be electrified in 2023, which means the DART will be coming to Celbridge.  It makes perfect sense for this development to progress.  What I need from today's discussion is an update on when the Minister of State, Deputy English, will communicate with Kildare County Council to advance and support the progression of the master plan.</p></speech>

I do not want to enter into any commitments on his behalf, other than to say that he has not changed his view, as pointed out by the Deputy in his initial contribution, on the strategic importance of the development of Celbridge.  This is a classic case in the sense that the national development plan speaks to the need to develop our towns within their existing footprint.  This is a new site, which is of huge strategic importance, but we have to marry that with the need for our town centres to be reinvigorated and invested in into the future.</p>  <p>  I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy English, to correspond with Deputy O'Rourke on when he or his officials will make contact with Kildare County Council on the master plan.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, was before the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs earlier today, where she agreed to make available a programme support payment of, as I understand it, approximately &euro;1,500 to childcare providers.  In many cases, insurance costs are increasing twofold, tenfold and, in some instances, 20-fold, in particular for non-members of Early Childhood Ireland.  A provider in my constituency who paid &euro;550 in 2019 is being quoted &euro;2,100 for next year by Arachas.  The operator has been told that if she pays &euro;245 to join Early Childhood Ireland, which is partly funded by the Government, she will only have to pay &euro;1,500.  The risk profile of this service has not increased and it has passed all of the regulatory rigours.  It is vital that services that are not members of Early Childhood Ireland are not penalised.</p></speech>

Basically, what the Minister of State said is that the cost will either result in the closure of cr&egrave;ches or in the cost being passed on to parents.  I have been contacted by many cr&egrave;ches in my area over the last week.  The Minister is aware of one of them and she has agreed to meet some of them, for which I thank her.  I will give an example.  Two parents, both earning &euro;30,000 per annum, pay rent of &euro;1,350 per month - they think they are doing well at that level - and up until recently &euro;1,100 per month for childcare.  Owing to changes demanded by Tusla, the cost of their childcare has increased to &euro;1,250.  If the insurance cost is added to that fee, they will be in very serious trouble.  The woman told me that two weeks into the month, having paid their rent and childcare costs, the couple have no money left.  We need to do something.  In this regard, I would suggest an increase in subsidies and the establishment by the State of a not-for-profit insurance entity to provide reasonable insurance for childcare providers.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach's response was underwhelming.  Yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Zappone, said she was shocked and stunned by the hikes in insurance premia.  I have been contacted by a number of providers in my area who are overwhelmed by what they are being quoted.  One operator of a cr&egrave;che on Wainsfort Road is facing closure as the quote she received is a 400% increase on what she paid last year.  I have heard similar stories from other cr&egrave;ches.</p>  <p>  My preference is for public childcare services in this country.  I cannot understand why, as a Deputy, I can get public liability insurance for approximately &euro;300 per annum and that when I was a member of Dublin City Council I could get public liability insurance in regard to putting up posters at a cost of approximately &euro;120 per annum.  We need to put in place a facility to enable childcare services to link into public liability insurance that is affordable.</p></speech>

This has arisen following the withdrawal of an insurance provider from the Irish market and the confirmation that another could not be found.  This is undoubtedly causing distress to providers and worry to parents.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge there are many providers who are facing increased insurance costs.  Until recently, there were two insurance underwriters offering insurance to the childcare sector in Ireland.  On 6 December, one of these, Ironshore, notified its 1,300 clients that it would be withdrawing from the market.  On 17 December, Padraic Smith and Company Limited, the broker which had provided the Ironshore underwriting services, informed its customers that it had failed to get a new underwriter to take over its client base.  This leaves only one underwriter currently offering insurance to the sector, namely, Allianz.</p>  <p>  The Government is limited in what it can do in this situation.  It cannot compel a private business to remain in the market and it cannot directly intervene in the pricing of insurance offered to childcare providers.  However, officials in my Department are working hard to find a way to support those services that have been impacted.  We have engaged with Allianz, which I understand has confirmed that it will offer quotes to all but the most high risk services.  Allianz, through the broker Arachas, is willing to consider quotes for all affected services.  Quotes are being processed within 24 hours in the majority of cases.  Some 1,100 quotes had been issued by midday today to previous Ironshore clients.</p> <p>This leaves 200 providers who have not yet received quotes.  I will receive an update on this tomorrow, which will be made available.</p> <p> There may be a very small number of very high-risk services that will not receive quotations.  The press has reported that some providers are reporting significant increases in premiums.  I understand that the premiums charged by Ironshore were considerably lower than the market average, which is leading to the increases.  I also understand that the average cost of Allianz insurance for full-time childcare is &euro;60 per year per child.  The average cost for sessional services, such as the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme is &euro;25 per year per child.  This equates to 0.5% to 0.75% of the turnover of a service.</p> <p> I understand that the increase is causing difficulties for providers.  My Department and the city and county childcare committees are offering a number of supports for providers, including a case management system for services experiencing sustainability difficulties.  For community providers, who are one in four of all childcare providers, financial supports can be made available after an assessment through a process managed by the childcare committees and Pobal.  I would encourage services to contact their local childcare committee to access a range of supports, including advice or business planning.</p> <p> With regard to the issue of insurance, I am liaising with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to consider a review of insurance in the childcare sector as part of the ongoing independent review of costs in the sector.  Consequently, we need to make the market more attractive to both existing insurers and to new entrants to increase competition, which in turn should lead to a reduction in pricing and an increase in capacity.  For the childcare sector, this includes compliance with regulations.  Compliance helps to manage risk.  Managing risk is important for children and should also make childcare facilities safer places.  I agree with the CEO of Tusla when he says that the childcare sector is largely compliant.</p> <p> I am glad that I am in a position to make a once-off payment averaging &euro;1,500 to providers to reflect their commitment, especially in a difficult year.  This is under the programme support payment I established in 2017 to recognise the administrative burden on providers.  This support will come from existing resources available to me in 2019 , and payments will be made by 28 December.  The range of payments will be from small amounts right up to &euro;26,000 for the very large providers, depending on the number of children being cared for.  It is a fast-moving situation but I am committed to supporting the sector appropriately, and above all to protecting children.</p></speech>

There needs to be greater interrogation of how that scheme is proposed to be rolled out.  The question is whether it will give comfort to the provider that I referred to earlier.  I do not buy the argument made by the insurance sector that risk profile has increased.  If people, providers and owners have been compliant up to now, either through the HSE or through Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, I do not understand how their risk profile has all of a sudden increased to the point where their insurance premiums are being increased to the extent of they are.</p>  <p>  I go back to the point that I made about one provider who is now being penalised, even though that provider's risk profile has not increased.  This provider is being told that if it joins Early Childhood Ireland, it pays &euro;240, the &euro;2,100 that is being quoted now through Arachas is reduced to &euro;1,500.  That blows the risk profile argument out of the water.  I am hopeful that the Minister will have regard to that.</p>  <p>  In the Committee on Children and Youth Affairs meeting today, Deputy Rabbitte called for a dedicated Oireachtas helpline so that we can work through cases like that and bring them directly to the Minister's Department.  I also support the call here that Irish public bodies or some other such institution should now be able to step into the breach to cover the risk.</p></speech>

That is what we have learned from the Central Bank.  Some of us have been saying that for quite a long time, by the way.  The Government said it was all fraudulent claims, particular risks, etc.  They are rip-off merchants.  We cannot allow the fate of childcare to be dictated by rip-off merchants.  We need a not-for-profit insurance entity.  That is not radical socialism, by the way.  They have done this in Canada in motor insurance.  Because motor insurance premiums were going through the roof, the state set up not-for-profit insurance entities.  It seems to me that we should have that for childcare, and for other sectors, for that matter.</p>  <p>  We have to ensure that administrative, insurance and other costs are not passed on to the already unaffordable cost levels of childcare.  In my area, they are the highest in the country, but they are unaffordable everywhere.  How is the couple that I mentioned earlier supposed to manage?  The national childcare scheme will only give them &euro;20 a week.  I made this point to the Minister last week.</p></speech>

This is the statement that issued from the Minister herself today.  This will go to administration and will not necessarily go anywhere else.</p>  <p>  We have to consider deeply what sort of society we are in at the moment.  We are dependent on children being looked after in childcare and early learning supports.  It is a fundamental requirement for families now to have this.  We are leaving it to the vagaries of the insurance market as to whether cr&egrave;ches will survive.  Either we have a public insurance body that provides insurance to childcare and other targeted areas or we bring in something like what I and every other Deputy in this Chamber has, which is the ability to get public liability insurance for about &euro;300 a year, or the ability, which I have, through Dublin City Council to get insurance to cover my posters for the year for approximately &euro;120.  Why can we not introduce something like this so that cr&egrave;ches can link in and get insurance at affordable prices to cover themselves?</p></speech>

I take the points that Deputy Sherlock is making on the differences in the costs of Early Childhood Ireland members and those who are not members and how the risk profile is not necessarily different.  These are good questions which I will raise as part of the ongoing considerations.</p>  <p>  On other issues, including the call from Deputy Rabbitte for an Oireachtas helpline, we need to get such a helpline set up so that there can be access to this information as this is a fast-moving situation.  More information is coming in on insurance quotes that are being offered to as many cr&egrave;ches as possible.  My overall objective is that there are no closures.  In the very short-term, one of the things we have done is to provide a programme support payments of, on average, &euro;1,500 to providers.  We will make provision as to how that is determined.  The formula for each cr&egrave;che is the same formula we have used in the past for programme support payments, which is in respect of the number of children and whether they are in full or part-time childcare.  It will differ from smaller to larger cr&egrave;ches.  The payment will be made by 28 December and the providers will not have to do any more administration to get this payment.</p>  <p>  I have also identified a sustainability service that Pobal also offers to ensure that facilities will not close.  The not-for-profit element is certainly part of that, for which there is potentially additional funding.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Boyd Barrett's point, I am hopeful that because of the things we are doing to support the providers in a difficult year, the cost rises across the board, insurance being part of those, will not escalate.  We need to look at that, which I fully accept.</p>  <p>  I take his point and that of Deputy Joan Collins on there being other kinds of not-for-profit models of insurance provision in other jurisdictions.  I am going to feed those into the work on insurance, which is happening in the Department of Finance.  We are looking for more data, particularly in the way that insurance premiums are rising, and will be feeding that data into the engagement with our colleagues.  There is perhaps a better way for our sector compared with others.</p></speech>

The services are well regarded in the community and those who have availed of them speak highly of them.  This year, unfortunately, we learned that Jigsaw in Clondalkin is to relocate with Jigsaw in Tallaght, based in a new premises there.  In discussions with my colleagues, Deputies &Oacute; Broin and Gino Kenny, and the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and Jigsaw, we were guaranteed there would remain a substantial outreach service for north Clondalkin.  The service has been widely availed of and there is great demand for it.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, however, the director of services at Jigsaw stated this week that the Clondalkin service was to relocate to a new premises at the end of the week and that outreach services have not been secured.  She went on to state that, therefore, there is now likely to be an interim period during which all appointments will take place in Tallaght.  That is not acceptable or workable.  We have been promised, and as a community we expect, a substantial outreach service to continue in north Clondalkin.</p></speech>

Since then, we have had two meetings with the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, and three with senior clinical staff at Jigsaw, we have engaged with the wider community, and there was a successful community vigil, all of which were about ensuring there would be a physical presence for Jigsaw in Clondalkin and the wider Dublin Mid-West area.</p>  <p>  In recent months, we believed there was a solution.  There was the possibility of co-locating Jigsaw with one or two other services, and negotiations were under way.  As Deputy Curran noted, we learned on Monday of this week that the options have not proved successful and that from next week there will be no physical presence for this vital mental health service for young people in the constituency.  The Jigsaw lease on the current premises will not expire until April and there is still time to resolve the issue.  We ask the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, to intervene directly to ensure that every effort is made between now and April to maintain a physical presence of Jigsaw services for young people in Clondalkin.</p></speech>

It would be an understatement to say that the matter has been handled very poorly by Jigsaw management since it arose.  It is a question of maintaining mental health provision in north Clondalkin and the wider Dublin Mid-West.  If the Jigsaw service in the area falls through, Dublin Mid-West, including Clondalkin and Rathcoole, will not have any mental health service provision, which will be a bad day for young people in the area.</p>  <p>  We call on the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, to intervene, given that 84% of Jigsaw's funding comes from the HSE.  That is a great deal of money, yet it has made a decision that is good for the centre rather than for young people.  The decision is deeply regrettable.</p></speech>

The service, with which I am personally familiar, was born out of necessity following a spate of youth suicides, not least in north Clondalkin.  I have been accused in the past of taking the issue personally, which I do.  Many of the young people who have died were children of friends and neighbours of mine.  One such person, to whom I spoke on the phone before I came to the Chamber, is Susan Doyle, whose son, Robert, passed away by suicide.  Susan reiterated to me her belief that her son, Robert, would still be alive today if a service such as Jigsaw had been available to him when he needed it most.  If there is another youth suicide in Clondalkin or Lucan after the service is removed from the area, we will be left to ask ourselves whether the person would still be alive if Jigsaw had maintained the level of service it now has.  The decision is a direct attack on the young people of Clondalkin.  I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, in the strongest way possible, to intervene.</p></speech>

I also welcome Deputy Ward to the House, given that it is my first time responding to him in the Chamber, and congratulate him.  It is a great honour and privilege to be elected to the House for the first time and to represent one's community, and it is appropriate that he spoke on this important issue.</p>  <p>  Mental health continues to be a priority for the Government and we recognise that mental health service users are among the most vulnerable in society.  Accordingly, &euro;39 million has been added to the mental health services budget for 2020, increasing the annual allocation to &euro;1.026 billion.  This represents an increase of &euro;315 million, or 45%, since 2012.  The funding has helped to enhance prevention and early intervention services such as Jigsaw.  As part of this, funding has been provided to open new Jigsaw sites next year in counties Tipperary and Wicklow.  The HSE has provided approximately &euro;10 million this year to support Jigsaw services nationally.</p>  <p>  The HSE has indicated that a decision was taken in 2018 to integrate services in Tallaght and Clondalkin under one management structure.  There is no intention to reduce the number of front-line staff.  The objective is to make the service more sustainable, flexible and accessible to young people throughout south-west Dublin.  Any suggestion that the service will be withdrawn in Clondalkin is unhelpful and may cause uncertainty for young people and their families.  The main hub for the improved service will be a new, larger premises in Tallaght.  The main base of the Jigsaw Dublin south-west team will move at the end of the week to the new, bespoke premises in Tallaght.  The plan was communicated at local level several months ago.  It is intended that Jigsaw will continue to use the Moorfield premises for the next few months.  Appointments for young people will continue to take place there, after the move date, to complete their therapeutic intervention with minimal disruption.  Jigsaw is considering other premises and co-location options in order that it can ensure a presence and accessibility for the entire catchment area, and it has moved to reassure everyone who avails of the service by posting "business as usual" messages on its social media.</p>  <p>  Jigsaw's commitment to long-term service delivery in Clondalkin, which it has given in writing to the local Deputies, remains firm.  It has sought the Deputies' support to help identify and secure a suitable location.  Jigsaw is actively pursuing two options for premises, co-located with other agencies, that will enable clinicians to deliver appointments to young people in Clondalkin.  It is hoped that one of the options will come to fruition to continue service delivery in Clondalkin with minimal delay.  In line with trends among Jigsaw's network, there was a 15% surge in demand for its services in south-west Dublin last year.  Jigsaw will continue to be responsive to this demand to the best of its ability.  There will be no reduction in its day-to-day work with young people or the community throughout Clondalkin, Lucan, Newcastle and Palmerstown.  The Minister of State, Deputy Daly, the HSE and Jigsaw have been in regular contact with all the local Deputies in recent months, with the most recent meeting held on 2 October.  Jigsaw subsequently met Deputies on 23 October and sent them a written update on 7 November.  Of course, I will convey the issues raised by the Deputies to the Minister of State, Deputy Daly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.455" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1298" speakername="John Curran" time="16:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800045#YY00700"><p>Let us get straight to the point.  We are not creating any uncertainty.  The director of services at Jigsaw stated there is likely to be an interim period during which all appointments will take place in Tallaght.  While the Minister of State said the service will be available to young people from Clondalkin, Lucan, Palmerstown and so on, it will not be based in Clondalkin, which is the concern.  As for the point that alternative premises are being sought, a cost is involved and I do not believe that Jigsaw has factored that in.  It is important that it has the funding to maintain a physical presence in Clondalkin.  The outreach service is not intended to bring people from Clondalkin and elsewhere to Tallaght.  It is supposed to provide a local service.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.456" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="16:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800045#YY00800"><p>It will not be business as usual if people cannot access the service at the location closest to where they live.  In many cases, the young people in question are very vulnerable and are at risk of self-harm and suicide.  The idea that accessing a service in Tallaght, where there is not even a direct bus service, would be business as usual is simply not the case.</p> <p>We are pleading with the Minister of State to ask his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, to intervene to reverse the decision to move the staff to Tallaght next week.  Another three months, at least, should be provided for to allow the two other options that are on the table to be explored and to enable Clondalkin and the wider area of mid-west Dublin to retain the service that is so desperately needed by its young people.</p></speech>

This decision has been a bad one from the outset.  It cannot be overturned without Government intervention.  I reiterate that 84% of Jigsaw's funding comes from the Government.  The Government has a say.  It must override Jigsaw's decision to pull out of Clondalkin.</p></speech>

When Jigsaw was providing a comprehensive service to the people of Clondalkin, Lucan, Palmerstown and Newcastle, it was business as usual.  That comprehensive service is being ripped away.  The hole in the youth mental health service provided to the people of this area will not be filled unless there is intervention.  I urge the Minister of State to use all of his powers to intervene in this instance to ensure that the people of Clondalkin enjoy the service they are used to.  It has saved many lives.  As Deputy Gino Kenny has suggested, we are talking about Jigsaw because it provides a really good service.  We will not know the damage caused by not having this service until it has gone.  I urge the Minister of State to intervene as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I accept Deputy Curran's point about the need for a local-based service in Clondalkin.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin has asked me to talk the Minister of State, Deputy Daly.  I assure him that I will do so.  Deputy Gino Kenny mentioned that it was Jigsaw's decision to pull out of Clondalkin.  He made the strong point that 84% of the money for Jigsaw is public money.  We accept that it continues to provide a good service.  Deputy Ward made the important point that we cannot allow a hole to develop in these services.  We accept that Jigsaw has saved lives.  The validity of the arguments is credible.</p>  <p>  Deputies will appreciate that the HSE has a statutory responsibility for the planning and delivery of health and personal social care services at local level.  In this case, the HSE and Jigsaw strive to deliver services in the best possible manner in line with the availability of resources and taking account of evolving service requirements.  The Minister of State, Deputy Daly, has had several meetings with the HSE and Jigsaw recently to ensure local public representatives and other groups are kept apprised of the need to integrate Jigsaw's services in Clondalkin with other services in the wider south-west Dublin area.  Deputies can rest assured that the Minister of State will continue to monitor this issue carefully.  I will bring the valid arguments that have been made by Deputies during this debate to the attention of the Minister of State.</p></speech>

As someone who has used the service, I am aware of the regular problems caused by people having to stand as far as Wicklow town or beyond.  There is no service later in the evening than 18.35.  It has been announced that Irish Rail is to get 41 new carriages, but not one of those additional carriages will be used on the Rosslare line.  There have been problems on the line for many years because it has been allowed to run down, in effect.  We need an immediate solution to address the current problem of overcrowding on trains.  Additional services are needed to allow people to travel later in the evening.</p>  <p>  We need to deal with a longer-term challenge in this context if we are to help commuters and others who travel from counties Wexford and Wicklow to Dublin.  The M11 resembles a car park at certain times of the morning and evening.  It is becoming more and more clogged.  It has been suggested that additional lanes should be developed.  It would make far more sense for us to invest in the rail network to provide a realistic alternative for commuters.  It makes sense to use the rail service from an environmental point of view and from a social point of view.  I have two questions for the Minister.  What immediate measures can be taken to address the overcrowding problem on this service and to expand the service in the evening?  What are the Minister's long-term plans for the development of the Rosslare rail service to make it a viable alternative to driving on the M11?</p></speech>

It is not fit for purpose in its current form.  Just five trains travel through County Wicklow to Dublin each day.  By the time the two trains that leave Arklow at 6.03 a.m. and 6.57 a.m. get to the station in Wicklow town, there is barely any standing room left.  Unfortunately, thousands of commuters in County Wicklow are being forced into their cars because suitable and affordable public transport is not available.  According to the 2016 census, some 1,750 people from Arklow and 4,339 people from Wicklow town commute to County Dublin each day.  They have to find work in Dublin because Wicklow has been neglected by this Government and previous Governments when decisions have been made on investment in jobs.</p>  <p>  The Government's approach to addressing the gridlock that is being created on the M11 by commuters who have been forced into their cars seems to involve a plan that may or may not come to pass until 2027 at the earliest.  The plan, which involves upgrading the M11 to a six-lane motorway, is absolutely ludicrous.  The 41 carriages that have been ordered will not arrive until late 2021, at the earliest.  The rail line through County Wicklow will not get any of those carriages.</p>  <p>  It is absolutely crazy that Irish Rail has responded to numerous requests for Leap card fare-capping to be extended as far as Arklow by saying that it will not consider the extension of the short-hop zone because too many people might avail of it.  Irish Rail does not have the capacity to cater for such increased numbers.  It is an absolutely crazy situation.</p></speech>

As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy and for the overall funding of public transport.  The operation and provision of services on the rail network is a matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in the first instance, in consultation with the National Transport Authority, NTA.  I acknowledge that some rail services, including services on the Rosslare-Dublin route, are crowded at certain times of the day due to the level of demand.  The Deputies can be assured that the safe operation of the rail network and of rail services is the overriding priority at all times for the company and for the Commission for Railway Regulation, which is the independent statutory body that is charged with overseeing the safety of the network.</p>  <p>  Since the economic upturn, there has been a significant increase in demand for rail services across the network.  The Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann fleet is fully deployed on scheduled services at peak times to cope with the current high levels of demand.  The company is maximising the use of its rolling stock to meet demand.  It has sought further investment to increase capacity.  As the Deputies will be well aware, there is a considerable lead-in time from the point at which funds are made available to the point at which new carriages are brought into operation.  At present, five return services are in operation between Rosslare-Wexford and Dublin Connolly on weekdays.  Approximately 688,000 journeys were made on the route in 2018, representing an increase of 4.9% on the previous year.  The service is primarily operated by InterCity rail cars, with the busiest peak services operated by commuter rail cars.</p>  <p>  The ability to increase frequency on the railway line between Rosslare and Dublin is limited for various reasons, including the single track south of Bray, the tunnel sections between Bray and Greystones and the intensity of DART operations on the line between Greystones-Bray and the city centre, on which DART services operate every ten minutes.  I understand that in 2020, the NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will examine options for the enhancement of the frequency of train services.</p> <p>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Government recently approved for the NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to proceed with the proposed purchase of 41 additional intercity rail cars to increase capacity on the rail network.  The additional stock will cost approximately &euro;150 million and is expected to commence entry into service by 2021, providing 34% increased capacity at peak times. </p></speech>

I am not asking the Minister to drive the trains, I am asking him to drive rail policy.  He has outlined some of the challenges we have with the single-track issue, the tunnels and the DART line, but this is about setting out a long=term vision to ensure that the people use the train and it is a viable alternative for people in counties Wexford and Wicklow.  We can talk about the M11 if the Minister wants, but we have to provide a real alternative.  I am asking the Minister to take on a leadership role on this to ensure that we have investment in those railways and that, within the next four to five years, we have the sort of service that will take people out of their cars.</p></speech>

The Minister's response this evening shows no commitment or desire to meet those targets.  He will be aware that there is an existing strategic paper carried out by Jacobs Engineering on the Greystones service improvement.  There are proposals to increase the capacity of the DART service to three trains per hour, reducing the cycle to 20 minutes.  That requires investment immediately but it does not even appear in the national development plan.  It will not be progressed any time soon.  It needs to be advanced immediately.  If we are serious about this, we need to look at job creation within Wicklow.  Thousands are forced out of Wicklow daily, onto the carpark that is the N11.  In a survey carried out by Wicklow County Council, 70% of those said they would work in Wicklow if there were jobs there.</p></speech>

He might be interested to know that in May, the NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann commenced pre-qualifying in relation to a ten-year procurement framework for a minimum of 300 battery electric units with the potential for that to increase to 600 over the life of the procurement framework.  The proposal forms part of the DART expansion programme.  I expect to receive a business case on the overall programme next year.</p>  <p>  I do not dispute for a moment what both Deputies are saying on overcrowding.  They are not on their own saying it, there is overcrowding on trains all over Ireland.  It is the result of an upsurge in demand.  The Deputies will be well aware that an upsurge in demand cannot be met by buying carriages and delivering them overnight.  That is not the way it works.  It takes time with procurement, delivery and putting them into action.  I have explained to the Deputies the orders that we have made.</p></speech>

I would have thought the Deputies would be pleased that we have acknowledged demand and that more people are using trains, buses and public transport.  Public transport in this country is a great success.  The downside is that there are crowded trains, but we have moved to sort that out and we will, but the Deputies should not expect it to happen overnight or immediately after Christmas, which is what they seem to be looking for.

There are some universal principles that we all appreciate and recognise.  We recognise that environmental pollution and degradation are all too often the by-products of our economy.  The EU has operated the polluter pays principle since 1987.  Today it is enshrined in Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>  <p>  While overall air quality in Ireland is relatively good compared with other industrialised countries, poor air quality persists in many areas due to traffic and the burning of solid fuels, leading to the premature deaths of more than 1,500 people annually according to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  The water quality of nearly half of Ireland's river sources is unsatisfactory according to the EPA and less than 1% of river sections can be described as pristine while nine of our rivers have the status of "seriously polluted".  Thousands of tonnes of waste are collected annually from litter or illegal dumping.  Perhaps more than 150 quarries are unauthorised, unregulated and cause pollution and destruction of habitat.</p>  <p>  The motion seeks to declare that Ireland should adopt fundamental changes in its economic model in favour of stronger environmental regulation to prevent harm and to hold accountable those who cause environmental harm.  The best model for Ireland is to emulate north European social democratic market economies such as exist in Denmark, Finland, Sweden or the Netherlands.  We are calling on the Government to act on a number of items.  We want it to recognise that under-regulation of economic activity or lax enforcement of existing rules allow greater levels of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions to occur.</p> <p>We want the Government to legislate to reinforce the polluter pays principle, including a requirement for greenhouse gas emissions to be included as a core component of company accounts in enterprises with 50 or more employees and all enterprises in highly polluting industries.  We want the Government to immediately enact a nationwide ban on smoky coal.  Such bans have already been proven to work in many larger urban areas without legal challenge.  We acknowledge the announcement by the Minister that the Government proposes to extend the ban to a larger number of towns.  We want the Government to produce a national clean air strategy.  We also want it to urgently present and implement a plan to regulate all quarries to eliminate illegal dumps.  Further, we want it to provide a quantified account of how the measures in the Government's climate action plan will reduce Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions to reach the target of 33 million tonnes by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050.<br/><br/>The purpose of the motion is to focus on the effect of pollution on people's health and the unfairness of society paying the cost of pollution while businesses continue to make profits.  I refer to the issues of trust and certainty.  Businesses like certainty, especially when it comes to making long-term investments.  Government regulation of the economy should be not only be clearly signalled in advance but should be followed through.  When Governments fail to do what they promise, as Fine Gael did in the case of the ban on smoky coal, it undermines public trust in politics and businesses' ability to make investments.  I am aware of many fuel businesses throughout the country that made expensive investments to be ready to produce smokeless coal in time for the introduction of the initial smoky coal ban.  One could say they were stabbed in the back by Fine Gael's failure to go through with the ban for entirely spurious reasons.  If there was a legal case to be made against the ban on smoky fuel, it would already have been made with regard to the cities and towns where it is banned and turf and wet wood may still be burned.  The Government's argument, repeated in amendment No. 3 to the Labour Party motion, is weak and implausible.  The only conclusion that can be drawn is that Fine Gael has some other reason for refusing to implement the nationwide ban.  I hope this reason will be brought to light by the Minister tonight.<br/><br/>While we welcome as progress the suggestion that the ban be extended to other towns on a piecemeal basis, this is a clear example of the Government's failure to understand how the ban is to be enforced.  I am sure the Minister will outline which towns are covered under this approach.  I do not believe anyone intends to have inspectors call from house to house to check what people are burning.  The easiest way to implement a ban is to enforce it at the point of sale.  Through Revenue, we know where all the fuel merchants are based and we can keep an eye on what they are selling.  Partial bans mean that fuel sales can continue down the road from towns with a ban and that makes enforcement more expensive and complicated.  Fine Gael's extension of the smoky coal ban to a further 13 towns is arguably a face-saving exercise that will deny life-saving improvements in air quality to dozens of other towns and villages around the country.  I welcome the fact that we seem to have cross-party support from a majority of Deputies in favour of implementing a nationwide ban on smoky coal.  If our motion is passed by the D&aacute;il, I expect the Government to acknowledge that and honour the D&aacute;il's decision by implementing a full nationwide ban.<br/><br/>Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 4 proposed by other parties leave the Labour Party's substantial motion entirely or mostly intact.  They add value to our motion and we welcome that.<br/><br/>In essence, if this motion is passed, we want the Government to recognise the motion and simply seek to have its contents implemented in a way that ensures the smoky coal ban is extended countrywide.  The benefits of doing that would be self-evident.  It would not be sufficient for the Minister to use the argument that EU law or competition law could act as an impediment to that.  If he already recognises the smoky coal ban exists and it is his intention to extend it to a certain number of towns, that surely negates the argument regarding non-adherence to competition rules.<br/><br/>I put forward a parliamentary question on this issue on 10 December which noted that a company, PurpleAir, in my native Cork has numerous air quality monitoring stations.  Cork city has had a smoky coal ban in place since 1995.  Notwithstanding that and the fact that PurpleAir is now <i>in situ</i>monitoring air quality, there is still a serious issue with air quality in Cork city and at certain other points in the county.  I do not wish to be parochial about this issue.  I have used Cork as a example but the situation there would be reflected in many towns and cities throughout the country.  In his reply to my question as to whether his attention had been drawn to the poor air quality in Cork, the Minister stated:</p><blockquote>	Further extension of the smoky coal ban in key locations would have a positive impact on air quality and public health, particularly in built up areas.  Regarding the proposed national extension to the smoky coal ban, a number of coal firms have indicated that they would challenge the proposal to expand the smoky coal ban nationwide, and also challenge the existing ban on the basis that the State should also apply such a ban to the burning of other fossil fuels, including wood and peat products.   </blockquote> <p>There is nothing in this motion that seeks to extend a ban on peat or wood products but there is a precedent whereby the State has already implemented a smoky coal ban.  If industry was ready for that in the past, it can be ready again to implement a nationwide ban.  Let us put that to the test and let us not be fearful of litigation or of taking on the vested interests who might seek to prevent us from having circumstances in which air quality would be improved immensely throughout the State.</p></speech>

I thank all the parties that have indicated their support for the principle of clean air and clean water, which are fundamental essentials to a healthy human life.  The Taoiseach stated in the House last week that Ireland is the third most advanced country according to the UN human development index.  Despite this, we have neither clean air nor clean water because of this Government's refusal to implement the serious changes that would clean up our rivers and lakes, improve our water quality and ban smoky coal.</p>  <p>  The towns in which the smoky coal ban is due to come into effect are home to 156,000 people.  As the Minister is aware, they will not be added to the list until next September.  Again, we are laggards in the implementation of essential health measures.  The towns not covered by the smoky coal ban are home to 356,000 people.  We need to reflect on this.  When it comes to clean air and water, this Fine Gael Government is showing the back of its hand to 356,000 people in Dunboyne, Arranmore, Nenagh and other such places.  Enniscorthy has a population of 11,381.  That town will be subject to the smoky coal ban next September.  What about Gorey, in which almost 9,822 people live?  It is wonderful that we will start to clean up the air in Enniscorthy next September, nine months from now, but I do not understand the Minister's reasoning in the context of bypassing Gorey, particularly when the regulations are exactly the same.  Leaving 356,000 people behind is really bad.</p>  <p>  The Government has performed very poorly in the management and organisation of the health service.  This is despite the fact that yesterday we voted for expenditure of &euro;17 billion, the largest health budget in the history of the State.  However the Government could cut ill-health figures and waiting lists at a stroke if it only had the courage to do so by introducing a ban on smoky coal and ensuring the presence of clean air and clean water in major towns and villages.  As I said, it is really difficult to know why Enniscorthy is included under the smoky coal ban but Gorey, with just 1,000 fewer inhabitants, has been left out.  That does not make any sense, particularly when we consider all those children suffering from asthma, the older people who have suffered from that condition all their lives and the many who will contract late-onset asthma in their 50s and 60s.  Families all over the country are listening to their children wheezing and trying to catch their breath tonight because it is so wet and miserable out there.  Families will be listening to their elderly people wheezing too, and the trolleys in hospitals will be full of those suffering from various cardiac and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, problems because this Fine Gael Government refuses to act.  What cowardice. </p>  <p>  We are told that the Government has legal advice but it refuses to say in any detail what it is or from where it comes.  Is this the legal opinion of a single individual barrister?  I do not think it is the opinion of the Attorney General, because if it was the Government might have the courage to tell us a little bit more about it.  As a former Minister, I know, as does anyone who has held ministerial office, that advice comes to Governments in all shapes and sizes.  If a Government wants to, it can seek out the legal advice that best suits its desired outcome.  This is what the Government seems to have done.  If the legal advice was as substantial as it suggests, the Government would have told us a lot more about it.</p>  <p>  We have evidence that the smoky coal used in Ireland is between 4% and 6% sulphur.  Sulphur is the most dangerous component when it comes to air pollution and damage to people's health and lungs.  There is a massive smuggling industry that takes smoky coal across the Border and sells it not just in the towns where it is legal and will remain so, like Dunboyne, but in housing estates all over the country.  Those of us who campaigned in the recent by-election will know that in certain big estates one can literally taste the smoky coal in the air.  Perhaps the Fine Gael people did not do those walkabouts in estates.  I ask the Minister to have some courage and ban smoky coal throughout the country.</p></speech>

It is a very important debate and deals with a range of environmental issues.  This is something I take very seriously.  There is no doubt that we have become much more aware of the huge damage the inadvertent consequences of some behaviour is causing to the environment.  We need to look at practices in industry, farming, transport and the ordinary household if we are to correct this.  That has been the fundamental thrust behind my work on climate action.  We need to look at how we source our power, because that has a huge impact.  We need to look at how we heat our homes and dispose of waste.  We need to look at how licences issued by the EPA are observed.  The motion raises several concerns in that regard.</p><p>The EPA plays a vital role, not just in overseeing regulation but in researching policy priorities.  Its reports have drawn our attention to the areas where we need to act.  It also supports local authorities, particularly with their responsibilities in enforcing rules against illegal dumping.  I know from experience in our shared constituency that the Acting Chairman, Deputy Broughan, is very conscious of that issue.  The motion is very critical of enforcement, and I recognise that it must improve.  However it is only fair to say that the EPA is very active in the enforcement field.  It carries out 1,500 site visits every year.  It identifies non-compliance in many of those visits and has been successful in prosecuting it.  The EPA takes a risk-based approach to this and has identified sites of particular consequence around which it is particularly vigilant.  It seeks to encourage people to be compliant as well as simply enforcing and inspecting.  The EPA has published its enforcement policy, which is of very significant assistance to people who want to be compliant but have perhaps fallen into practices leading them to non-compliance.  The EPA's work is to be commended.  However, I recognise the point made by Deputy Sherlock in his motion.  There is significant room to improve this system.  Through its research, the EPA itself points the way to those changes.</p><p>In making climate action my core project, I am addressing many of the issues raised in the motion.</p> <p>We address many of the issues by changing our waste patterns.  In many ways, we have very poor waste patterns in this country.  Half of the material that ought to be in the brown bin finds its way into the others.  Those sorts of things do damage to our soil if they end up in landfill and, as a result, we miss out on product that could be recovered in the circular economy, as is cited in many of the motions.</p> <p> We are also committed to delivering 600,000 homes with heat pumps in the next ten years.  A total of 500,000 homes will have improved their fabric.  A million of our vehicles will be electric.  They will have a very significant impact on air quality, but also on carbon emissions, which is one of our priorities.</p> <p> The Deputy in his motion questions whether the targets are quantifiable.  Not only have we quantified them in the plan, but we will produce a Bill of which the Deputy is supportive that will see a much better accountability framework for reporting in individual sectors and seeing exactly what is happening.</p> <p> The polluter-pays principle has been raised by the Deputy.  One of the things I am very pleased I persuaded the Government to introduce this year is the carbon price.  Not only do we have a carbon price but a trajectory for the next ten years.  That is very much signalling to people that carbon emissions do damage and we need to start to exit fossil fuels and to make other shifts.  That is the polluter-pays principle being adopted, but all the proceeds are being ploughed back into helping to empower people and their communities to make the changes they need to make.</p> <p> As the Deputy has recognised, I have extended the smoky coal ban to 13 additional towns on an incremental and proportionate basis.  These are towns of a size where we have evidence of exceedance of the levels of air pollution.  I believe there is a very strong reason to act in the public interest to protect those homes and to introduce the ban on smoky coal.  However, to proceed with a nationwide ban, regardless of the circumstances, would carry a very high risk of illegality.  I reassure the Deputy that it is based on advice from the Attorney General not from any individual.</p> <p> The problem here is that there is a fundamental freedom to trade across borders.  That is a fundamental principle of the European Union.  While it is possible to introduce restrictions on the grounds of public policy, that is permissible only where they are not being arbitrarily or discriminatorily applied to one product against another.  The essence of the difficulty here is that it would be very difficult to show the particulate matter content of other solid fuels is lower than that of smoky coal.  That is the reality we face.  If we do not proceed with the incremental, proportionate and evidence-based approach I have taken, we expose ourselves to a high risk of illegality.  We have had an indication that such a ban would be challenged in the courts.  The consequences of such an approach would be to expose people in rural areas to a sudden ban that would stop them burning turf and blocks of wood in their homes, which is something they have been doing for many years.</p></speech>

It would do significant damage to their ability to heat their homes.  The alternative would be that it would undermine the basis of the ban we already have.  If such a case were taken successfully, it would undermine the ban that applies to Dublin and to the 26 other substantial towns.  I am not willing to expose us to that risk.  That is the reason I am adopting the incremental and proportionate way I have set out.  It would be dishonest to pretend that a nationwide ban does not carry the probable outcome for either the ban in Dublin and in other urban areas or for rural areas, and I am not willing to do that.</p>  <p>  The motion also raises issues concerning water quality.  I recognise that the recent report by the EPA is disappointing and shows water quality deterioration in some river basins.  We recently introduced a water quality strategy that is set out in the Government&rsquo;s River Basin Management Plan for Ireland 2018-2021.  It sets out a comprehensive agenda to address the issue.  It is one we need to pursue vigorously and that will be done.</p>  <p>  We must be also very conscious that some of the sources of the pollution are coming from farming and wastewater discharges.  Both Teagasc and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the EPA are working with agricultural bodies and farmers directly and providing free advisory services to help them improve the run-off from land that is causing some of the damage to water quality.</p>  <p>  As Deputies are aware, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government has identified through Irish Water 255 projects that will improve water treatment in urban areas.  Some 94 of the projects have been completed up to 2018.  In addition, there is a marine strategy for clean and healthy, biologically diverse sustainably used marine waters.</p>  <p>  The motion is so wide that it is very difficult to deal with the range of issues that have been raised in the ten minutes that are available to me.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of quarry licensing, which is an issue that has been exposed in a recent RT&Eacute; programme.  While the legislation is in place, issues clearly arise in terms of more effective enforcement.  We must be fair and recognise that there is a need for the courts to take such offences more seriously.  I am pleased to be able to tell the House that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will engage with the planning authorities to help them to develop more decisive actions.</p></speech>

I am grateful for the opportunity to address this Labour Party motion, which Fianna F&aacute;il is supporting today.  The ongoing lack of enforcement and failure by the Government to prioritise and implement necessary legislative changes across a range of climate and environmental issues simply cannot be accepted.  The endemic failure of this Fine Gael Government to take any real responsibility over the past eight years for increasing pollution and emissions is a damning indictment.</p>  <p>  Several of the messages in this motion align closely with Fianna F&aacute;il's motion, recently approved by this House at the start of December, which put a spotlight on environmental degradation and raised a range of legislative and policy measures to radically improve enforcement at national and local level.</p>  <p>  This Labour Party motion rightly focuses on air quality and calls on the Government to immediately enact a nationwide ban on smoky coal.  We strongly support the demand.  The Government's failure to introduce a nationwide ban is having a major impact on pollution and on public health in those areas not currently covered, particularly for those with asthma and other respiratory conditions.  A nationwide ban is supported by a range of experts, across academia, and in other organisations such as the Asthma Society of Ireland.  However, the Government is continuing to reject the science and the recommendations.</p>  <p>  It is disturbing that Fine Gael appears to be more concerned about potential future legal challenges from companies outside the State than saving lives right now.  The Government is allowing big business to dictate policy.  It is bowing to pressure from companies with vested interests.  It is now shamefully seeking to distract from this pressure and is muddying the waters regarding the burning of other fuels.  Following the Government's recent tokenistic proposal to extend the ban to only certain towns, no one, not a Minister nor a civil servant, has explained why an arbitrary cut-off point of towns with populations of more than10,000 has been chosen.  Experts have rightly pointed out the difficulty for people, for example, who live in Gorey and are 178 people short, or in Shannon and are 271 short?  Are their health and rights less important than those in bigger towns and cities?</p>  <p>  The Government's consultation is also extremely concerning, as it deliberately tethers any action on smoky coal to the burning of other fuels.</p> <p>This move risks undermining public trust in any sort of ban, particularly in rural areas, and may actually impede climate action and improvements in public health.  There has never been any question but that domestic fuel-burning poses challenges and no one wishes to foist a rash move on vulnerable houses but it has been abundantly clear, including to previous Ministers, that a nationwide ban, specifically of smoky coal, is possible.  The Government is now seeking to distort and distract with a typical Fine Gael political manoeuvre that could stall any political progress on improving air quality.  We have seen no successful legal challenges to existing local bans or to different rates of duty being applied to different fuels, yet Fine Gael continues to play up this threat.  It is important that this House be made aware of the failure of the enforcement of the existing ban.  The best form of enforcement and of preventing smoky coal being used in some places and not others is a nationwide ban.  It is revealing that since the Attorney General produced this advice more than six months ago, the Government has made no attempt to improve enforcement among local authorities.  Potential opt-ins by county councils constitute a complete failure of the Government's leadership.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il has put forward two additions to the motion.  They are complementary to the proposed text and we hope they can be supported.  We have included an important reminder that the nationwide ban was committed to by three former Ministers, in 2013, 2015 and 2018, but that the current Minister, seemingly against all previous advice and analysis, is the only one to decide to reject an extension of the ban.  It is important that any phasing out of fossil fuels be rooted in social justice.</p></speech>

It is an important motion on clean air.  I wish to focus particularly on the issue of smoky coal.  Smoky coal is a significant contributor to air pollution.  The EPA estimates that 1,500 premature deaths are caused each year by air pollution.  The HSE has, in response to a parliamentary question I tabled, estimated that the economic cost to the State of air pollution is &euro;2 billion per year.  That is before getting into the health and moral costs, which are hurting people.</p>  <p>  The smoky coal ban was originally introduced in 1990 and was gradually expanded to cover 80% of the population.  The Minister now proposes extending it to an additional 13 towns, bringing the percentage up to 84% or 85% of the population, yet he is afraid to extend it nationally to cover 100% of the population because it would interfere with the market.  Surely in any assessment of market interference, a proportion of 80% or 85% would suffice, yet since 1990 not one single legal challenge has been brought against the smoky coal ban.  Why is the Minister bowing to the lobbyists from the coal industry outside the Republic?  Why is he so afraid of them?  If Governments were to act in the face of legal threats from private industry, none would bring in any regulation or rule.  The primary purpose of the State is to protect its people from dangers.  What is the rationale for the expansion to towns of over 10,000 people?  Why not 10,100, 10,200, or 8,763?  Why the round figure of 10,000?  Where does that come from?  Longford, with 10,008, is included, but Gorey, with 9,822, is not.  Shannon, with 9,729, is not included.  What is the difference?  The populations are based on census figures from 2016 but many of the towns are growing rapidly and their populations have certainly exceeded 10,000 by now.</p>  <p>  New Ross suffers very seriously from air pollution.  Like Enniscorthy, it is situated in a valley.  Therefore, when there is smoke in the air, it is very hard for it to dissipate.  People have to breathe it in.  The Asthma Society of Ireland has called for a nationwide ban.  The EPA and our top scientists in the field of air pollution and air quality call for a nationwide ban.  Smoky coal causes an increase in the numbers of hospital admissions, heart attacks and strokes.  It causes low birth weight and diminished lung capacity in babies.  It causes glaucoma.  Now we have an extension of the health divide in this country.</p>  <p>  I talked to a number of people who remember Dublin before the smoky coal ban was introduced.  There was a high level of pollutants in the air then.  The pollution could be seen and felt.  It can be seen and felt in other towns now.  The science tells us that only 10% of the total amount of air pollutants can be seen and felt.  Another 90% cannot be seen but it is breathed in.  It goes into one's lungs.</p>  <p>  A smoky coal ban needs to be introduced nationally.  Everybody deserves the same protection.  I am not going to accept the effort, suddenly and at the last minute, to</p>  <p>distract by introducing the issues of turf and wood.  Turf and wood amount to a total of less than 5% of the entire solid fuel burned in this country.  There is a ready and available replacement for smoky coal.  There is a policy that is implementable and practicable.  It should be implemented.  There should be no more distractions by way of introducing other issues.  The Government should start taking care and putting people's health above the coal industry outside this country.  The coal industry in the Republic actually wants a smoky coal ban introduced.</p></speech>

Potentially four people die every day as a result of poor air quality.  Deputies Burton and Browne mentioned some of the towns in Wexford.  In some of those towns at night, smoky coal can be tasted in the air.  If somebody has asthma or another respiratory illness, it causes serious problems.  In some cases, people cannot even leave their own homes.</p><p>I do not accept the Minister's argument about freedom to trade and the fear over court cases.  As he well knows, there are public policy and public health considerations that can override provisions with regard to freedom to trade.</p><p>Introducing a ban in a number of selected towns clearly does not work.  This afternoon, I spoke to the senior executive scientist with Wexford County Council and got the figures for particulate matter in the air last night.  In Enniscorthy and New Ross, the levels of particulate matter in the air were four times the level that is regarded as safe.  The level was also exceeded in Gorey but also in Wexford town at around 8 p.m. last night.  In Wexford town, the smoky coal ban is already in place but there is nothing to stop somebody from getting smoky coal outside the town and bringing it back in.  There are problems regarding enforcement.  The only effective approach is a national smoky coal ban.  We need to address the issues concerning smuggling.  This means we do have to have a stronger role for customs and Revenue in this area.</p><p>When I was a member of Wexford County Council, councillors sought to introduce a county-wide ban and to use the provisions under the Air Pollution Act 1997 to set up special control areas so each local authority could ban the sale and burning of smoky coal within its own area.  That proposal has sat in the Minister's Department since he became the responsible Minister.</p><p>As my colleagues have all stated, we are talking about potentially 1,500 deaths every year.  Dr. Thomas M&uuml;nzel has written in the <i>European Heart Journal</i>that air pollution now causes more deaths than smoking.  We have taken very strong action to try to reduce harm caused by tobacco.  Why will the Minister not show the same leadership in trying to stop deaths and problems for those with respiratory illnesses as a result of smoky coal as several Governments showed with regard to tobacco?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.517" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1225" speakername="Thomas Byrne" time="17:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800051#EEE00400"><p>I thank the Labour Party for this timely motion.  My own leader has brought up this issue on a number of occasions in recent years.  My party, when in government with former Minister Mary Harney, introduced the original smoky coal ban and there have been no legal issues in the intervening period.  This is the first time the Government has publicly addressed its legal strategy and told companies suing it that it is afraid of them.  It is certainly giving those companies legal strategies' ammunition.  The Minister and Taoiseach have done this deliberately time and again.</p> <p>If this decision ever comes before a court - I hope it does not because I want to see the other towns included - it will highlight that the 10,000 population figure is utterly irrational.  Ashbourne is on the list for the smoky coal ban.  About 3 km in the direction of the prevailing winds lies Ratoath, a town with a population of 9,533 which is not covered by a smoky coal ban.  This is ridiculous.  It is a really bad way to do policy.  The coalman will have to sell different products in different towns, as is already happening.  I met a coalman last week in Duleek and I discussed this very issue with him.  There is a smoky coal ban in Drogheda.  There is very bad air quality in Duleek because of smoky coal but, as the coalman told me, the big problem is the three coal lorries in Drogheda selling smoky coal illegally.  These three lorries are doing regular rounds and the Government is doing nothing about it.</p> <p> Every year, 1,500 people die as a result of smoky coal and bad air quality.  I have calculated that approximately 60 people in my county of Meath die every year because of this.  Only last week in Dunshaughlin, a constituent asked about a smoky coal ban for that town because of the air quality and how that affects him.  Dunshaughlin has not been included and it is only a few kilometres from Ratoath and Ashbourne.  The same applies to Kells, Duleek, which is near Drogheda, and Laytown-Bettystown, a census town with relatively arbitrary boundaries.  Laytown-Bettystown is an important urban settlement.  Its boundary could be changed in one direction to give a population of 15,000 or 20,000 or changed slightly in another direction to give a population of less than 10,000.  These census towns, as I understand it, have no basis in law and are simply census towns for statistical purposes.  The Minister cannot tell me that I could not change the boundary of Ratoath slightly and add 467 people to the population and thereby have the smoky coal ban apply to it.  The Central Statistics Office would only have to do its business slightly different.  The CSO census town boundaries changed between 2011 and 2016, particularly with the abolition of town councils.</p> <p> This is an utterly irrational approach and the Minister should go back to the drawing board.  What is needed now is for the Minister to be brave.  He should be as brave as Fianna F&aacute;il and Mary Harney and bring in this smoky coal ban nationally.  There should be one system in operation and enforcement should be taken in respect of those who are selling unhealthy coal.  This has to happen because lives are at stake.  It is rare in this Chamber that we can directly state that a decision will save lives.  The decision of Mary Harney saved lives in Dublin and other places.  The decision of Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, when he was Minister for Health, to ban smoking has saved lives.  This Minister's inaction will cost lives.  He has a chance to change his decision, however.  He can bring in a rational solution to this issue.  </p> <p> A rational response would be to put it up to big business, which is the international business as opposed to the Irish coal industry.  It is the foreign coal industry that the Minister is concerned about.  He should put it up to the international coal industry by making a statement that he is prepared to be as tough as people in office before him.  He would make clear he will be as tough as all the other parties in this House are saying they would be.  Given Fianna F&aacute;il's track record, the Minister can be damn sure we will do this if we are in office.  That time cannot come quickly enough.</p> <p> The Minister must look at this issue rationally.  The figure of 10,000 is absolutely irrational and will not stand up to scrutiny.  The example of Gorey and Enniscorthy was given, but Ratoath and Ashbourne must be the clearest example.  They are almost twin towns.  A few fields separate them, yet the Minister has taken the decision I outlined. </p> <p> I welcome the amendment proposed by my colleagues, Deputies Cowen and Jack Chambers.  It concerns the importance of having a just transition for workers and communities affected by the phasing out of fossil fuels and calls for that to be prioritised.  I compliment the Deputies on their work on this issue.  There is a need for the immediate deployment of available funding streams and the establishment of the independent task force that has been discussed.  This needs to happen because the phasing out of fossil fuels is bringing a change to communities all over the country.  They need to be ready for it.  By far the greatest change a ban could bring is that lives would be saved.  It would mean the Government would be operating not in fear of or in hock to legal threats from big international business, but would act in the interests of the citizens of Ireland and in the interests of saving their lives.  This D&aacute;il is appealing to the Minister with one voice, apart from Fine Gael, to put the smoky coal ban in place across the country.  </p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in will support it and the amendment tabled by Fianna F&aacute;il, which adds value to the motion.  We have tabled our own amendment and we are hoping that will also be supported.</p>  <p>  It is hard not to feel that this House has spent much time on passing motions on climate action, rather than actually rolling up its sleeves and getting on with the policy solutions that need to be put in place.  One of those solutions is made very clear in the motion where it states that there needs to be an immediate "nationwide ban on smoky coal, which has already been proven to work in many larger urban areas without legal challenge".  I hope the House will pass this motion today.  Hopefully, it will not be another motion passed by the D&aacute;il that the Government will ignore.  As many speakers stated already, a nationwide ban would save lives.  There is no good reason for the Minister and his Government to hold back on this.  In his opening statement, he stated that climate action is the most important part of his work as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  When it comes to practical solutions, however, and the big challenges, his Government is not facing up to them.  This is a very straightforward issue.  There is no quarrel from the Opposition and the Minister is being supported by Fianna F&aacute;il, the Labour Party, Sinn F&eacute;in and, I expect, the Green Party and others.  There is no reason, and the Minister has given no good reason to the House and the public, for not proceeding with a nationwide ban.</p>  <p>  The amendment tabled by the Government is typical of the Government when it comes to climate action.  It provides that we should proceed on climate action "on an incremental basis and in a proportionate way".  Everything the Government does on climate action seems to be on the basis that we should act incrementally.  That is being used as an excuse not to do what needs to be done.  There is no incremental action that needs to be taken when it comes to banning smoky coal, for example.  That needs to be done and it is a clear, simple, logical and effective policy solution that has the broad support of the public and, I hope, Members of this House.  For whatever reason, however, the Government is not doing it.  This approach of doing things on an incremental basis is not the type of overarching policy approach that should be taken by a Government.</p>  <p>  I will speak to the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment in a moment.  I support the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment on a just transition.  By way of information, we had the just transition commissioner before the Joint Committee on Climate Action today.  I was far from convinced, not with regard to his ability, which is beyond question, as is his integrity and experience, but because he told us that he has no office, staff or budget.  He has the &euro;11 million set aside in the Government's budget this year, but that is all.  He can consult communities and workers but cannot stray beyond the &euro;11 million allocated.  His costs and those of his staff will have to be met from that &euro;11 million.  This is extraordinary given that we have known for a long time that the just transition was coming.  I was not the only member who was not convinced by the just transition commissioner's testimony at the committee's hearing today.  Again, this calls into question the Government's commitment to climate action and the whole concept of a just transition.  The reason I support the Fianna F&aacute;il amendment is that the just transition cannot be abused.  It cannot be something to which we pay lipservice.  If we want people to buy into climate action, it needs to be done in a fair and just way.  People need to see that just transition works.</p>  <p>  On the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment, I will speak about the green new deal published by the European Commission.  There are parts that I have issues with and parts that I do not have issues with.</p> <p>The most significant change is the one that stated the targets set for 2030 and for 2050 are not good enough and need to be revised.  The last paragraph in the Labour Party motion calls for the provision of a quantified account of how the measures in the Government's Climate Action Plan 2019 will reduce Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions to reach the target of 33 million tonnes by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050.  While that is an important point in the motion, Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s amendment goes further than that, setting out how this can be achieved.</p> <p> One of the most obvious ways to achieve this reduction is through investment in public transport and the rail network.  A significant debate is going on about the expansion of the rail line to Navan, a development which my party supports.  Investment in intercity rail is important.  There needs to be a shift in thinking, not just by the Government but by politicians from all parties.  Public transport is the most obvious solution to enable people, not force them, to change their behaviour.  There are far too many people who do not have access to public transport.  Bus is important but rail services are the future, a point to which the Government needs to pay more attention.</p></speech>

There is a problem with quarries.  West of Galway city and right through Connemara, we will soon be facing a situation where 80% of the land will be designated as not being allowed for quarrying.  In 2007, quarry owners were asked to sign a compliance form.  In 2012, there was a substitute consent.  The minute they got that substitute consent, they could not quarry any more.  From 2012 to 2015, legislation let them down.  While it did not affect all of them, many were caught in a quagmire.  Regardless of whether people want them, if we do not have quarries, we will not be able to build houses or roads.  The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment needs to wake up and put the legislation in place that will facilitate quarries.</p>  <p>  Water quality is ferociously important.  However, every report on water quality contains "farmers this" and "farmers that".  It must be faced up to that raw sewage is going into every stream from small towns, large towns and cities.  Whether we blame Jack or Jill or whoever, that is the problem.  Until we give the money to Irish Water to put the required infrastructure in place, we will continue having this problem with water quality.</p>  <p>  I have no problem with the smoky coal ban.  The Minister should be upfront with the D&aacute;il, however, and show the legal material from the Attorney General.  All week I have heard this argument about wet timber.  Just in case anyone does not know it, wet timber does not burn too well.  All one will have is a bit of smoke and no fire.  Timber, as well as turf, can only contain a maximum of 30% moisture if it is to burn properly.  One also has to watch fuels being brought across the Border.</p>  <p>  I am a turf cutting contractor.  I am upfront about it.  I have seen cases where, after a house has been insulated, there was a 20% reduction in fuel consumption.  That is the advantage of actions that can be taken.  Up to 650,000 people have oil burners, which involves importing more fuel.  What are we doing about this?  While we might have a bit of turf or an ash tree down the corner of a field, we do not have oil.  Why are we not examining that?</p>  <p>  Up to 23,000 homes do not have central heating.  We must realise that fuel poverty exists.  There are areas where, whether we like it or not, people are not as wealthy, both economically and socially, as those in other parts of the country.  We are frightening these people with the language on this issue used in the D&aacute;il and in the media.  Ten years ago, the Government decided it would stop people and peg them out of their turbary rights.  The Government, however, got a different answer when the people stood up for their rights.  The Government needs to get the message once again.  If it tries it on once more, the people of rural Ireland will give the Government a quick message because they are battle hardened.  They will not give up on what they need and what they can only afford, namely &euro;400 or &euro;500 a year to heat their homes.</p></speech>

We will be supporting this motion, as well as the amendments tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party.  We support the idea of a nationwide ban on smoky coal and taking on the vested interests that would stand to lose from that in terms of profiteering.</p>  <p>  Illegal dumping is referred to in the motion but it has not featured much in this debate.  There has been an explosion in the level of illegal dumping over the past two decades.  It is no coincidence that it coincided with the privatisation of bin services and the introduction of bin charges.  I am opposed to illegal dumping in any circumstances.  However, it does not take a rocket scientist to explain or understand that if one hikes the cost of bin collections every year over a period of time, there will be an increase in illegal dumping.  For example, when I was a member of Cork City Council, the officials in the waste department made it clear that there had been a tenfold increase in illegal dumping since the introduction of bin charges and the privatisation of services in Cork city.  These policies should be reversed with the taking of bin services back into public ownership, the abolition of bin charges and the introduction of a steeply progressive tax system where the people at the top pay tax in a real sense to fund public services.</p>  <p>  Lives are at stake.  Air pollution in Cork city is as bad as it is anywhere else in western Europe.  PurpleAir, a real-time air quality monitoring website, has stated that on several nights recently, Cork was top of the European tables in this regard.  It had double the air pollution levels of London and treble those of Rome.  The burning of coal, peat and wood at home are important factors in this.  Up to 1,500 people die every year as a result of air pollution.  A staggering 400,000 people across Europe died as a result of air pollution in 2016, ten times the number of people who died as a result of road accidents.</p>  <p>  There are huge profits to be made out of this.  Those vested interests might need to be taken on.  One weakness in the Labour Party motion is that it refers to social democratic societies in Scandinavia being the ideal and so on.  These are societies where capitalism remains in place.  While an attempt was made to tame it in these societies, profit is still the key motive.  One needs to go much further than that to break with that system if one is going to tackle these issues.  That will not stop us, however, voting for the motion.  We will be putting in some written points to explain our view on that.</p></speech>

Our environment is showing concerning signs of reaching critical thresholds in many spheres.  Air quality and water quality are two of the warning signs that we will ignore at our peril.  The impact of these are felt mainly by the poorer, the more vulnerable and the less well-off in our society.  Poor air quality is a direct effect of our over-reliance on fossil fuels and private cars for transport.</p> <p>The People Before Profit budget submission stated that we need to have free public transport in order to reduce our reliance on carbon-producing fuels, while also improving air quality.  It is not reinventing the wheel.  Free public transport is becoming a demand in cities across America and in some European capitals.  It is a logical response to this type of crisis.  Traffic volumes returned to pre-crash levels and then went even higher this year.  Meanwhile, Dublin Bus has nearly as many vehicles as it had in 2009.  Worsening traffic congestion in the city leads to some areas having the worst air pollution readings.  The detrimental effects to which buses give rise are caused by gridlock in the city.</p> <p> According to the EPA report, 1,180 premature deaths in Ireland are linked to poor air quality which is an astonishing figure and greatly exceeds the figure for deaths on our roads, which we often talk about.  However, we seldom bring this statistic into our discourse.  These figures are not new and have been around for several years.  We are looking at them because we have increased the number of monitors, with 17 new ones put in place across the country this year.  Scotland alone has 88 such monitoring stations and has had this real-time information for many years.  Many of the hotspots the monitors have identified are in areas of economic deprivation such as Ballyfermot, where I live.  As well as having a high level of traffic congestion, there is an over-concentration of waste management facilities dotted around west Dublin where Ballyfermot is located.  This gives rise to an increase in the number of pollutants in the air.</p> <p> The delay in the ban on solid fuels has been caused by the companies lobbying the Minister.  This is not unconnected to the lobbying that occurred in connection with trying to stop bringing the use of fossil fuels to an end.  That sort of lobbying of the Department is highly influential on the Minister's decision and any threats of legal action send him running.  It is a real sign that there is no proper will to deal with this.  The type of air pollution to which I refer generates particulate matter, which has severe effects on the heart, liver and reproductive organs and causes stress and anxiety.  It particularly impacts on babies, children in buggies and wheelchair users because they are closer to ground level and suck in more of the particulate matter and poison their bodies.  This is clearly detrimental to people's health.  While one could argue that free public transport would be very costly, it would undoubtedly take cars off the roads.  We need to consider the cost on our health service of diseases that affect the lungs and cause asthma, COPD, etc.  We could considerably reduce our health budget by implementing free public transport across the country and removing hundreds of thousands of cars from our roads.  That would be a good start and the Minister having a bit of courage to implement the smoky coal ban would be a good follow-up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.525" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="17:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800054#HHH00200"><p>Members are being asked to consider a long list of Government failures in environmental policy today.  I want to highlight the potential social impacts of measures to ban or restrict the sale of smoky coal and possibly peat and wood as well.  The just transition should apply to everyone, everywhere.  Social justice should be at the heart of all climate policies.  We should use climate emergency policies and channel funding towards alleviating energy poverty.  Above all, we need to guarantee the right of equal access to energy for all and end policies that burden vulnerable and marginalised people.</p>  <p>  The environmental policies that this Fine Gael-led Government has supported are not improving the environmental quality for everyone.  Carbon taxes mean fuel cost hikes for people who do not have the money to retrofit their homes or buy an electric vehicle.  Most rural communities do not have access to public transport, meaning that policies that rely on carbon pricing to shift behaviour will not work and will only further burden the poor and disadvantaged.</p>  <p>  The ban on the sale of smoky coal was introduced first in 1990, almost 30 years ago.  Every Government since then has promised to extend the ban, but none of these promises has been kept.  No national air quality management plan has been introduced to ensure that Ireland meets EU directive standards for air quality.  In all that time - almost 30 years - virtually no action has been taken to provide households suffering from fuel poverty with real, practical alternatives to burning solid fuel.  This is an appalling situation.  Successive Governments have squandered opportunities to improve people's health and quality of life by investing in warmer homes and cleaner fuels.  We all know that there is a link between fuel poverty, low incomes and a reliance on solid fuels for heating.  This is a particular problem in some parts of the country, including in my constituency.  In the context, the Unite trade union estimated that 30,700 people in Donegal were suffering from fuel deprivation in 2015.  The Economic and Social Research Institute estimates that 28% of households nationwide suffer from fuel poverty and cannot afford to heat their homes adequately or pay more than 10% of their weekly incomes in fuel costs.</p>  <p>  Those in impoverished communities in County Donegal are affected by both declining air quality in towns such as Letterkenny and by being unable to afford to retrofit their homes.  Checking the EPA data for Letterkenny today, I was shocked to see that the air quality is listed as very poor with a rating of 10, which is the worst rating an urban area can get.  Letterkenny has had a smoky coal ban for six or seven years.  This is based on just one data sampling point for the entire county.  Despite Letterkenny being designated as a zone for targeted improvements in air quality management, I see no evidence that the local authority, the EPA or the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is taking any action to improve the air quality of the constituency I represent.  Have any of these authorities notified the public, especially people with respiratory illnesses, of the potential hazards that exist?  Does the HSE have an action plan?  Does the local authority have an action plan?  Does the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland have a plan to target households burning solid fuels with retrofitting grants in County Donegal?  If not, what will the Government do about our poor air quality and environmental crisis?  In reality, it is nothing.</p>  <p>  Air pollution policy in this country has clearly failed.  The Government has bowed to the whims of the coal industry, while little progress has been made in tackling fuel poverty or retrofitting.  The Government is targeting the wrong culprits here.  With more than 400,000 early deaths annually from air pollution in the 28 EU member states, there are significant opportunities to improve our health, environment and economy by aggressively tacking the problem at source.</p>  <p>  A managed transition away from solid fossil fuels is in line with the Citizens' Assembly proposals.  Some 97% of the members of the latter recommended that the State should end all subsidies for peat extraction and instead spend that money on peat bog restoration.  The assembly also said there should be proper provision for the protection of the rights of the workers impacted.  The rights of landowners who cut turf for their own use should also fall into this category.</p>  <p>  A structure based on social dialogue, consultation and inclusion will be essential if we are to engage communities and not alienate them, especially in the county that I represent, Donegal.  We have very high rates of unemployment, social exclusion and fuel poverty especially since the financial crash in 2008.  I know from first-hand experience that many families returned to cutting turf due to the sheer financial crisis that they faced after 2009.  We should not be contemplating imposing further restrictions on turf cutting without first considering human needs and how these will be met.  Social justice and environmental justice must go hand in hand.</p>  <p>  I propose that the Government establish another just transition fund for County Donegal, which would dedicate resources to home retrofitting to alleviate fuel poverty and assist bog rehabilitation.  The problem of transitioning away from fossil fuels is not confined to the midlands and we should not limit the role of the just transition commissioner to the midlands.  Only if we are serious about protecting our bogs, improving air quality and ensuring that no one is left behind in the process will we actually achieve something.</p>  <p>  The motion includes many other proposals on which I do not have time to comment.  The Sinn F&eacute;in amendment proposes to weight grants in favour of the lowest building energy ratings.  While I would like to see the economic case for this, it is a reasonably good idea in principle.  The Fianna F&aacute;il amendments are innocuous and do not serve any purpose.</p>  <p>  The Government amendment is to delay a ban on smoky coal as it carries the risk of serious illegality unless extended to peat and wood.  What is the evidence for this?  If there is illegality why would the State institutions not enforce the law and prosecute?  I do not buy this.  As I explained earlier, we do not produce any coal in Ireland.  We do supply peat and but we could address this by means of other policies.  There is definitely a strong case for phasing in a nationwide ban on coal, coupled with new grant schemes for retrofitting in specific towns and areas where solid fuel is widely used.  The Department wants to extend the ban but what is the evidence that the existing ban is even working?  On the basis of today's measurements, it is certainly not working in Letterkenny.</p>  <p>  The Green Party amendments are good regarding the circular economy but make no reference to just transition or social justice.</p> <p>Its vision will work for the better resourced middle-class communities that are already doing okay and will do a little better under that.  We must look after everybody in society.</p></speech>

We have a symbiotic relationship with the planet and the environment.  Even if we have no regard for the rich diversity of animals and plants on the planet, if we damage the planet we damage ourselves in the long run.  As a generation we have degraded the planet and the environment like never before.  For all the greenwashing, the photo opportunities and the hollow language about sustainability, we are unsurpassed as a generation in actively destroying the environment.  The numbers of insects, reptiles, amphibians and mammals are all in retreat.  We are also poisoning our own citizens.  This has been discussed here in the context of the number of people who are dying due to particulates in the atmosphere that lead to major respiratory problems.</p>  <p>  I do not have a lot of time so I will speak to just a couple of the issues as they relate to the motion.  I welcome that the Labour Party has tabled the motion.  I specifically want to refer to the quarry industry.  People may have seen the very interesting RT&Eacute; "Prime Time Investigates" programme on this sector very recently.  Perhaps the Minister could pay as much attention to the issue here because it blights many different families and communities in the State.</p>  <p>  Litigation is being used as a tool by some owners to stop enforcement of legal standards and regulations by local authorities. The initiation and maintenance of litigation is allowing unauthorised quarries to continue because the matter is in the courts.  While cases are being determined, unauthorised developments are being permitted to continue, sometimes to the point of exhaustion.  It is interesting that the RT&Eacute; "Prime Time Investigates" programme had a lot more detail it wanted to broadcast, which had to be pulled at the last minute due to threats of legal action over what the programme was about to do.  I put it to the Minister that this is key.  There is a logjam in our efforts to regulate the quarry industry.  Unless it has ministerial focus I do not believe it will change whatsoever.  Will the Minister institute legislative procedures to prevent litigation from being used as an excuse by local authorities not to enforce closure of illegal quarries and pits?</p>  <p>  I shall give an example from my area in County Meath.  A quarry in the county had an enforcement order served on it in 2013.  A judicial review was brought against Meath County Council on the pretext that another case in Mayo was being determined.  The unauthorised quarry in Meath was allowed to carry on.  Now in 2019 it is alleged that the quarry owner is continuing to extract.  What kind of rubbish system would allow a local authority to institute an enforcement order in 2013 and then have its hands tied for the next six years, while the alleged illegal practice continues unabated?  That the whole system just stands idly by at the side and watches this happening is very frustrating.</p>  <p>  One of the issues that came hopping off the screen during the RT&Eacute; programme was the that local authorities do not have the resources or the competencies necessary to be able to do the job in this area.  Will the Minister explain why enforcement notices are not enforced?  Why are there no penalties whatsoever around the contempt of those court decisions?  If there is no cost to the contempt of those decisions why would there be any interest in adhering to those court decisions?  Why is it up to private individuals and NGOs to pursue enforcement of court decisions in the extractive industry?  Why has it to be a neighbour or some environmentally aware local organisation protecting their community?</p>  <p>  There is also a major problem with the finance around planning conditions.  I would ask the Minister to have audits carried out to look at what finance is still outstanding to local authorities for the planning applications that have been submitted - or not submitted in some cases - by certain quarries.  I do not want to blight all names of all quarries in the State because there are quarries that operate perfectly legally and in sync with the needs of their localities.  Without such quarries we would grind to a halt in many areas of transport and industry.  We need an overarching statutory body that carries out enforcement in this area.  This would take it out of the hands of individuals, the NGOs and the local authorities.</p>  <p>  I shall turn now to a tangential case, which is another example of the weakness of local authorities' ability to carry out enforcement.  It applies to another case in County Meath that I have also raised with the Minister previously.  The case had been brought before the Oireachtas Committee of Public Accounts.  It surrounds an allegation of illegal dumping of possibly 56,000 tonnes of waste from road construction into a number of fields in south Meath.  Meath County Council is the authority tasked with regulation of the enforcement in this area, yet the EPA has rejected a tier 1 and tier 2 assessment by Meath County Council of the site.  I have spoken with the EPA on this.  It is seeking legal advice on how to enforce the law in this regard.  It has been, however, seeking this legal advice for a year.  Why?  It is because the EPA does not have the resources to be able to process the legal advice and the agency is hamstrung.  There is absolutely no point in having legislation, law or regulation on anything in the State if we do not give the necessary enforcement authority the ability and the resources to enforce.  It is necessary to have a national statutory body with the ability to enforce.</p>  <p>  I want to touch on one other issue.  It is very frustrating when we hear the Government talk of its environmental credentials.  As an example I will cite the experience of Meath people again.  This morning, more people left Meath to go to work than actually work in the county.  It is a startling fact.  It happens in none of the other 31 counties on the island that the majority of the workers leave their county to go to work as opposed to working in their own county.  On average Meath people commute further than any other people when it comes to work commutes.  This is because we have been left as a dormitory or commuter county that does not have the necessary industry.  The Minister is a Meath man himself so he should be able to relate to this to a certain extent.</p>  <p>  Navan is the biggest town in the country without a rail line.  People are commuting up to three hours a day into Dublin for work.  Many people are leaving Navan and County Meath before it is bright and they only get back when it is dark.  People have told me that they just meet their kids on weekends because they do not get back from work on time to see them.  Dublin and the commuter belt is grinding to a halt.  A transport catastrophe is happening in the lives of so many people, which is worsening by the day.  Proper public transportation is needed to alleviate this.  We have called for a rail line to Navan for at least 20 years so the centre of the county can have a proper, environmentally friendly and efficient way to get into the city centre.  This, however, has not been met with any positivity by the Government.  Will the Minister be able to use his influence at the Cabinet table to start to push public transport and rail transport higher up the hierarchy of this Government's objectives?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.528" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="18:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800055#JJJ00300"><p>I am very pleased on behalf of the Green Party to speak in support of the Labour Party motion, on the intention behind it, and to perhaps outline the thinking behind our own amendments, which are not contrary or disputing any of the arguments made in the Labour Party motion.  We have put forward the amendments to broaden the debate and to broaden the context we see as needed.</p>  <p>  The most critical of our amendments is the need for us to align with the sustainable development goals as agreed in New York three or four years ago.  Central to those 17 goals is the recognition that every facet of our society and economy must tie into a sustainable agenda.  In managing the ecological crises we face, we need to look at every aspect of government such as education, justice, health and agriculture.  Every aspect has a role to play and it is critical that we achieve all 17 goals, which is a manifesto for the future and for the first time a manifesto for the wealthier northern countries of the world and not just for the poor, as with the previous goals such as the millennium development goals, and the Agenda 21 goals that were agreed in Rio back in 1992.</p> <p>It may sound very broad, or we all agree and everyone wears the badge, but we have to put it into practice and into thinking in everything we do.  This is why we cite it and believe it fits in the motion.<br/><br/>Similarly, if we follow down from this, we have also introduced the concept that the national development plan drafted a year and a half ago is not fit for purpose.  We have debated the plan in the House on many occasions.  There was no assessment of climate change in its drafting.  There was no application of the sustainable development goals in the objectives we seek to achieve.  We believe the next Government will, first and foremost, have to agree a new national development plan that will reflect what was a good plan presented by the Government in the national planning framework.  This would address many of the issues Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n raised in terms of the ongoing unsustainable sprawl in our society where, as he says, parents do not see their children and people have unhealthy lives because they are stuck in traffic for hours every day.  This is vital.  The scale of our ambition should recognise that we need a completely new national development plan.<br/><br/>Central to this is the need for a land use plan.  Many of the very worthy provisions in the Labour Party motion regarding our approach to managing water and waste and a clear air strategy will come out of new and effective land use plan.  It would not tell farmers they have to do this or that but recognise that if we are to address the ecological crisis, restore our peatlands, develop forestry in a new way and make agriculture profitable, which it is not at present, then we have to look at the entire island.  Within this we will manage water quality and ensure we tackle the issue of air quality and bring back biodiversity.  It has to be a whole-of-Government and all-island approach.<br/><br/>We also cite in our amendment, and it is worthy of citing, the developments last week whereby the European Commission stated its first objective is a new European green deal.  While details are scarce and a huge amount of work has to be done to implement it, the green deal sets out the new strategy for Europe and we should and will be able to be good at this and to lead it.  It is a completely different economy.  It is not just a take economy and a winner takes all economy.  It is a more caring economy that values caring work and the environment, and has a different way of doing business, with different values in business and a different sense of what we are about as a country and what we measure as progress.  That is the scale of change involved.  We believe we can do it in the context of what is happening in Europe.  It gives us a very clear direction that a green deal is the centre of new strategy for the country.  This country can and will be good as it goes green.<br/><br/>We cite the objective of creating a circular economy.  This is a broad and woolly term that everyone uses but we know Europe is bringing through legislation, such as the plastics directive, the circular economy directive and a range of other directives.  The digital economy will help us deliver a very efficient economy that is profitable, because businesses have to be profitable to survive, but also sets completely different goals for what businesses have to do.<br/><br/>I agree with the proposal in the Labour Party motion on auditing companies for carbon.  That can and should be done under the task force established by Mark Carney for climate-related financial disclosure.  It gives us the mechanism, and research has been done to see how it will happen.  This is coming as an inevitability.  Those businesses that think they can ignore it and remain with the <i>status quo</i>will be left behind and we do not want to do that.<br/><br/>This has to be a just transition.  Today, the Joint Committee on Climate Action heard from Mr. Kieran Mulvey.  He is an excellent man but it was clear from the questions we asked that what has been established is not fit for purpose and does not match the scale of preparations, planning and engagement that is needed.  This transition must bring ecological and social justice.  While it is socially democratic, is also bigger than that.  It is a new emphasis on looking after nature and ourselves.  It is giving up the market model that has dominated politics in the western hemisphere for the past 40 years and recognises that the &quot;me&quot; story - with &quot;me, the market&quot;, &quot;me looking after myself&quot; and &quot;rising tides lift all boats&quot; - is no longer fit for purpose.  It died in the financial crash but in the ten years since we have not evolved a new mechanism or new way of doing things.<br/><br/>The new green economy is socially democratic and looks after nature at its core.  It will require all parties to be involved.  It does not belong to any one party.  If we are to get this scale of change, it has to belong everywhere.  It belongs to every person in the country, and every place matters.  It tends towards a politics of co-operation and trying to work together to make the amazing leap we will have to make if we are to face the ecological crisis.  This is why we support the Labour Party motion and present our amendments in a way we think gives a slightly broader perspective as to what the transition is about.  I very much look forward to seeing how the votes go.  It will be complicated voting with so many amendments but it is a useful and welcome debate on our last day of the D&aacute;il in 2019.  I thank the Labour Party for presenting it.</p></speech>

This is a critical issue.  Economic growth should not mean environmental degradation and damage.  It is possible to have economic growth and ensure the environment is well cared for.</p><p>I come from a rural area and peat is important to the people of counties Longford and Westmeath, whom I represent, as it is in rural areas throughout the country.  I emphasise that in no way does this motion or the Labour Party's call for a nationwide ban on smoky coal prohibit the burning of peat and wood in the family fire.  I know a good bit about this, and have done for 50 years.  We believe in the importance of allowing people to continue to heat their homes with the fuel of their choice, whether turf or wood, which are indigenous.  This can be separated from the significant issue of smoky coal.  My family utilises turf.  We harvest it from Collinstown bog, as do many other families around us.  They do so to keep their houses warm, especially in winter and early spring.  Other families use Emper bog beside us, Balallan bog, Ballinacurra bog<i>, </i>Ballymaglavey Bog, Williamstown bog, Nacore bog and many other local bogs.</p><p>Many people depend on turf and timber for their fuel requirements.  As a result, large numbers of people are trapped in fuel poverty.  The number would be even higher if they could not utilise these important sources of fuel.  As my colleague, Deputy Sherlock, has stated, what the Government is doing with regard to applying the ban to 13 additional towns is a cop-out.  The Government knows this.  If there was any legal case to answer, it would already have been made in towns such as Mullingar and Athlone in my constituency.  The ban has been in place since 1990.  Instead, we have a ridiculous half measure of banning smoky coal in certain towns.  The reality is that people can drive a few miles down the road and purchase a bag of coal in the next village.  I am afraid there are no borders for smoke.  This is why it is absolutely stone mad and ridiculous.  It makes no sense and the Minister knows it.  Smoke has no respect for borders but the Minister insists on continuing with this failed policy by extending the smoky coal ban to all towns with a population of more than 10,000 people.  It is taking in 13 towns, including Longford, instead of standing up to certain companies and implementing a nationwide ban.  As Deputy Sherlock said, what is being proposed is largely a face-saving exercise.  The Government clearly values its connection with big companies more than that of citizens' health and our collective environmental health.  A total of 1,500 people is not a manufactured figure dragged up out of someone's head.  It is a figure from the Environmental Protection Agency.  Lives are being destroyed and lost because of this.</p><p>There is a more general point for the midlands.  Carbon emissions from Irish homes are almost 60% higher than the EU average.  We are the worst in the EU.  In 2019, 80% of Irish homes and other buildings had a BER rating of C or lower.  We need to bring these homes up to a rating of at least B or B2 by 2020 at the latest if we are to meet our international obligations.  The climate crisis is an opportunity as well as a threat, particularly for the midlands, but only if we have massive investment from the State.  Peanut money will not provoke the necessary strong response and what has been proposed to date is totally inadequate.  As I have said previously, there is huge scope for semi-State companies such as Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB to lead our transition to a low carbon economy in a real, fundamental and structured way.</p> <p>We need Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB to lead the transition to a low carbon economy in a real, fundamental and structured way.  The Labour Party wants these companies to lead the green industrial revolution.  We want a State-led, street-by-street, retrofitting programme to insulate up to 100,000 homes per annum.  We could utilise the resources and workforce of companies such as Bord na M&oacute;na to create good, unionised construction jobs in counties Westmeath, Longford, Offaly, Laois and others across the midlands but instead what we have is a publicised PR stunt in the guise of the midlands just transition fund as part of budget 2020, with no specific breakdown of where the money is going or how exactly it is to be spent.  We need to consult the people on the ground, such as Mr. Joe O'Brien who brought together large numbers of people in the community hall in Lanesboro and pointed out how this can be done.</p> <p> Approximately 1,000 Bord na M&oacute;na workers face further uncertainty in the new year as the Government and management have done nothing to engage with the local community or unions with regards to upskilling workers for other jobs.  The general secretary of ICTU stated last month that management had shown no sign of engaging in dialogue about the future of the workforce and that it wanted to de-unionise the facility.  That is the threat.  This is not the just transition that people of the midlands have been promised and come to expect.  Let us stop the hot air coming from the Government, which can be toxic and creates fumes as well.  Let us introduce a nationwide smoky coal ban and get Bord na M&oacute;na management around the table with the unions so that we can work to create decent, unionised construction jobs for the midlands.</p> <p> The Labour Party is happy to accept the various amendments proposed by other parties, particularly if they strengthen the motion.  We are not precious about that.  We want to do what is best for the people of Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.532" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1301" speakername="Brendan  Ryan" time="18:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800057#LLL00200"><p>Economic growth should not equal environmental decline but this is what has happened in our country as our economy has expanded in recent years.  Our natural environment has taken a punch in the gut from industry, agriculture and transport.  The mantra of "Ireland being the best small country in which to do business" is followed by a full stop.  We know that Ireland is not the best small country in which to have secure and affordable accommodation.  We know also that Ireland is not the best small country in which to be looked after when one suffers ill-health and that it is certainly not the best small country for reducing carbon emissions and protecting the environment.</p>  <p>  In 2011, during the very depths of the economic crisis, Ireland's rivers were in improving health.  Dublin became the first capital city in the world to have three salmon rivers, the Liffey, the Dodder and the Tolka.  Salmon only run in healthy rivers with minimal levels of pollution and they are a very simple but telling indicator of ecological health.  After three years of economic decline, the health of our rivers was improving and toxicity levels were decreasing.  During the Celtic tiger years, for example in 2005, the Tolka River was one of the most polluted rivers in Europe.  We are back to square one now.</p>  <p>  Water quality in nearly half of our rivers is failing to meet a satisfactory level with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, stating that less than 1% of our rivers are pristine.  Salmon and trout levels are in decline as our rivers become more polluted.  Water systems are a key indicator of the environmental health of a country and ours is in failing health.  The lack of regulation of industry and agriculture by this Government has allowed this to occur.  We must make changes to our economic model and prioritise environmental regulation to prevent harm.  We must hold accountable those who cause environmental destruction.  </p>  <p>  We also have a major problem with air quality in our major towns and in our cities.  The EPA's Air Quality in Ireland 2018 report found that levels at monitoring sites in Ireland were well below European Union standards.  Also, several sites throughout the country were above the World Health Organization's guidelines for fine particulate matter, ozone and nitrogen dioxide.  In Dublin, the report pointed to St. John's Road beside Heuston Station as a spot where data from monitoring suggested that levels of nitrogen dioxide would exceed the EU limit value in the near future.  It also pointed to the entrance to the Dublin Port tunnel as exceeding the EU limit values.  Traffic, as well as industry, has been found to be the main contributor of nitrogen dioxide to the atmosphere around Dublin.  The increase in traffic over the last few years, leading to Dublin being one of the most congested cities in the world, has brought us to this point and it is no surprise to me that the port tunnel and motorway intersections are the worst affected areas.</p>  <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency recommends low emission zones to combat poor air quality yet investment in public transport continues to lag behind.  We need the urgent delivery of MetroLink for Fingal.  Sustainable, greener forms of transport are not only a commuting necessity, they are an environmental necessity which will help save lives.  With traffic emissions in our major cities at chronic levels, air quality is also further compromised by the continued use of smoky coal throughout the country.  The partial ban has been a qualified success but is now time to extend it nationwide.  The Labour Party call for a nationwide ban on smoky coal makes sense.  It is supported by the EPA and, most important, it will save lives.</p>  <p>  According to Ms Ciara McMahon, programme manager at the EPA, smoky coal causes the deaths of up to 1,000 people per annum.  This is damning data, which should lead directly to a nationwide ban.  We are failing to meet our carbon emission targets and we are set to miss our EU 2020 targets, at a cost to the State of upwards of &euro;150 million.  If we continue to track as poorly as we have been, we could face billions of euro in fines by 2030.</p>  <p>  The latest announcement to extend the smoky coal ban to 13 towns is another tepid measure.  If the evidence is that smoky coal is a problem, then we need a nationwide ban.  Government has talked the talk on housing, health and climate change but it has not walked the walk.  Not one decision has been made that one could say is brave or transformative.  It is tinkering around the edges of all of the major issues with one goal in mind, namely, to remain in power and avoid the judgment of the people.  It is rapidly running out of road.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.533" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1260" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="18:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800057#LLL00300"><p>I thank all who contributed to the debate and the Labour Party for raising these important matters.  My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has already demonstrated that this Government remains committed to dealing with these issues, for the health and environmental benefits of all.  I will reiterate some of the points made by the Minister and make some additional points.</p>  <p>  With regard to the enforcement of existing legislation, the EPA has a wide range of tools and powers at its disposal.  These include providing support, advice and guidance; site visits, inspections audits and compliance meetings; publishing a list of priority sites for enforcement; warning letters and compliance investigations; issuing statutory notices, directions and penalties; and taking prosecutions and-or civil actions and revocation or suspension of licences.  Some 95% of EPA site visits were unannounced in 2018 and 91% were unannounced in 2017.  Meanwhile, 1,603 notices of non-compliance were issued last year and 94 compliance investigations were opened.  This shows the proactive nature of the EPA's approach to enforcement.</p>  <p>  With regard to the polluter pays principle, the Minister has pointed out how taxation policy, such as the carbon tax, can help to bring about behavioural change.  In budget 2020, this Government committed to increasing carbon tax next year by &euro;6 to &euro;26 per tonne.  This is expected to raise some &euro;90 million in 2020.  This money will be ring-fenced and used to protect those most exposed to higher fuel and energy costs as a result of the increase, support a just transition for displaced workers and invest in new or additional climate action measures.</p>  <p>  The motion next refers to smoky coal.  I, too, commend the Government amendment to the House.  As is now well known, although it was announced by two former Ministers that the smoky coal ban would be extended nationwide, a number of coal firms have indicated that they would legally challenge such a move.  The basis of their challenge is that a nationwide smoky coal ban cannot be introduced without an associated nationwide ban on the burning of peat, turf and wet wood because these materials produce similar levels of pollution.  The legal threat is not only to take down a nationwide ban but to have the existing ban which is currently in place in cities and many towns around the country lifted.  In these circumstances, it is important that we proceed on an incremental basis and I, therefore, heartily welcome the Minister's confirmation that he yesterday obtained Government approval to extend the existing ban on bituminous coal to 13 additional towns around Ireland.  The ban is to come into effect in these new low smoke zones in September of next year.  This will mean that smoky coal will then be banned from all Irish towns with populations in excess of 10,000.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the Minister's intention to commence a public consultation process early next year on potentially extending the scope of the smoky coal ban to also include other smoky fuels.</p> <p>This signals the Government's commitment to continuing to take actions that will save the lives of Irish people, just as the original smoky coal ban introduced in 1990 has resulted in more than 350 fewer deaths each year in Dublin alone.  In the context of all these developments and considerations, I again call on Members to accept the proposed amendment to the wording of the motion.  I too can confirm that if the amendment is accepted, the Government will be happy to support the motion.</p> <p> In parallel with the incremental extension of the smoky coal ban, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is moving to the finalisation and publication of the national clean air strategy.  This strategy will provide for the formulation and implementation of clean air policies to address a wide range of air pollutants in Ireland.  These include those emanating from the agricultural, transport, and residential heating sectors.  We are continuing to work on maximising synergies between the clean air strategy and other plans, including the national air pollution control programme, the national energy and climate plan and the climate action plan.  The climate action plan, which was published last July, includes a number of measures which will help to significantly improve air quality.  Among these are: measures to encourage the changeover from petrol and diesel vehicles to electric vehicles, including further development of the electric vehicle charging network; measures to promote cycling as a means of transport and to provide better facilities for cyclists; developing a new park-and-ride strategy to encourage the use of public transport; giving local authorities the power to restrict access to certain parts of a city or town to zero emissions vehicles only; and legislating so that no new fossil fuel vehicles will be sold from 2030 onwards.</p> <p> It is now more important than ever that all sectors of society engage fully, and take all the necessary actions, to protect and improve water quality.  Current pressures in the context of water quality come from a range of sources including agriculture, urban waste water, septic tanks, forestry and so on.  This Government's river basin management plan improves upon the previous approach in that it involves a more complete assessment of the risks to water quality and an increase in the number of people working in communities to address water quality challenges.  The next cycle of river basin management planning has already commenced.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government will soon launch the overview of significant water management issues in Ireland document, which will then be followed by a six-month long consultation period.  This will lead to new water quality objectives for the period from 2022 to 2027 and to a full programme of measures to achieve them.</p> <p> The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government will soon also be taking action to help deal with the issue of unauthorised and illegal quarries by engaging with planning authorities on the need for stronger action in respect of such facilities.  The planning authorities are the appropriate bodies to take such action because it is through the planning system that quarries are regulated.  The owners of quarries need to obtain planning permission before commencing operations and must comply any conditions set down when such permission is granted.</p> <p> The Department has introduced a number of measures to tackle illegal dumping and strengthen efforts to improve waste enforcement generally.  These include: the provision of an annual waste enforcement grant of &euro;7.4 million to support the funding of 150 local authority waste enforcement personnel across the country; the establishment of waste enforcement regional lead authorities, WERLAs; and the establishment of a national waste enforcement steering committee.</p> <p> A quantified account of how the climate action plan will reduce Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions to the ultimate target of zero net emissions by 2050 involves recognising how its provisions include: establishing the 2050 target in law; making the adoption of carbon budgets a legal requirement; requiring the Government to set a decarbonisation target range for each sector; establishing the climate action council as a successor to the Climate Change Advisory Council; establishing that the climate action plan should be updated annually; establishing that a long-term climate strategy shall be published; and ensuring that the proposed arrangements are sufficiently flexible to allow them to respond to the changing technologies, circumstances and challenges in the years ahead.</p> <p> I again thank Members for raising the issues about which they are concerned and I commend the Government amendment to House.  If the amendment is accepted, the Government will be happy to support the motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.535" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="18:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800058#MMM00200"><p>I am sharing time with Deputy Howlin.</p>  <p>  As we come to the end of D&aacute;il business for 2019, it is right that the threat to our environment and to our planet's future is the focus of our attention.  We are reaching a critical point of no return for our climate, our health and our children.  This time in history is critical in the context of reaching the targets set for us on climate change and taking the necessary steps to keep the air we breathe and the water that sustains us and other life clean.</p>  <p>  The Labour Party motion has received widespread support in the House, but what we want is action.  The refusal of the Government to ban smoky coal nationwide makes no sense and the argument that it would risk a legal challenge is spurious.  Why would there be a challenge to spreading the ban to the rest of the country when such a challenge has never been advanced since the first ban in cities was introduced in the 1990s or when other areas were added to the list of places where the ban applies?  The suggestion that turf, timber and other products would have to be banned as well in order to avoid prosecution is nonsense and designed to win some kudos in rural constituencies.</p>  <p>  There has been a significant deterioration in air quality across our country in recent years.  My city of Limerick has seen measurements hitting or going beyond the EPA-permitted levels.  The same is the case for Dublin and other densely populated areas.  We need a national clean air strategy and in cities like Dublin, Cork and Limerick we need an action plan to reduce the levels of nitrogen dioxide as they are beginning to breach EU safety standards.  The burning of fossil fuels and traffic congestion are the main causes of these dangerous levels.</p>  <p>  A plan of action is no good if there is not reliable and consistent monitoring to go with it.  I agree with the Deputies who stated that there are not nearly enough monitoring stations.  The issue of monitoring air quality, with full public transparency on its frequency and results, has been highlighted in Limerick in the context of the proposal by Irish Cement to burn waste products in its kiln in Mungret in the city suburbs.  This matter is currently with the EPA for decision.  There is a lack of public trust that there would be adequate monitoring and such trust is absolutely crucial.  Furthermore, early warning monitoring is a necessary safeguard where public health is at risk.  Asthma and other pulmonary diseases are increasing and the EPA estimates that approximately 1,000 premature deaths each year are due to poor air quality.</p>  <p>  The other point we make strongly in our motion relates to the need for large polluting industries and companies to pay their fair share.  That is why we are calling for legislation to require greenhouse gas emissions to be included as a core component of company accounts in enterprises with 50 or more employees, and those of all enterprises in highly-polluting industries.</p>  <p>  As operations like the ESB station in Moneypoint and others in the midlands are wound down, there must be a just transition for workers and opportunities for alternative employment in the area.  I have also repeatedly called for the Government to immediately address the danger of fuel poverty for people who live in homes that are not energy efficient.  On Question Time last week, I again raised the need for a major ramping up of the retrofitting programme for local authority homes.  The response in this regard is far too slow.</p>  <p>  People in council homes are, by definition, on low incomes.  The Labour Party committed to investing &euro;100 million to upgrade such homes in its alternative budget earlier this year.  The Government's allocation falls far short of this.  It is essential that this is implemented, that Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland grants are made available to poorer people who own their own homes and that a minimum BER standard for privately-rented homes be required.  If these actions are not taken, vulnerable people, including the elderly and young families, will suffer fuel poverty and-or cold damp conditions.</p>  <p>  The quality of our water is in an equally perilous state.  That is why we call as well for a national clean water strategy.</p>  <p>  People care about these issues.  Young people are taking pioneering roles in highlighting climate change.  They are proud of their country but fearful for their future and want the necessary action to be taken.  We need to show the leadership required to reach our greenhouse gas emission targets of 33 million tonnes by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050.</p></speech>

Our motion calls on D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to recognise that environmental pollution and degradation are all too often the by-product of our economy.</p>  <p>We ask all Deputies to join with the Labour Party in declaring that Ireland needs to adopt fundamental changes to our economic model, and in calling on the Government to recognise that under-regulation of economic activity or lax enforcement of existing rules allows greater levels of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions to occur.</p> <p> Our vision is for a well-regulated economy.  We want rules to outlaw dangerous pollutants and to require polluters to pay the full cost of whatever pollution they create.  We also want protection for workers and consumers in order that they will not be forced to work with hazardous materials or endure the consequences of pollution.  State regulation of the economy needs to be done intelligently, with regard for productivity and efficiency.  This has been achieved in countries such as Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands, which are among the most innovative and productive economies in the world.  They also lead the way in respect of environmental protection and meeting climate targets.  I am heartened that the amendments tabled by Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Green Party all retain Labour's declaration that the best model for Ireland to emulate is a north European social democratic market economy, such as in the countries I mentioned.</p> <p> I remind Deputies of a report by the National Economic and Social Council in December 1992 - a long time ago - entitled The Irish Economy in a Comparative Institutional Perspective.  The report sought to understand the relative economic success of smaller European countries such as Denmark and Finland which have small open economies like Ireland's that were subject to many of same the international forces as us.  The report marked a period in public policy when we had a discussion on the future direction of our economy.  As history played out, the Celtic tiger economy took off, before being taken over by an unsustainable property boom and subsequent bust.</p> <p> It has been ten years since the economic crisis and we now need to have a serious national discussion on the type of economy we need and want.  International trade has become more protectionist, there is a welcome and overdue global push to reform corporation tax paid by multinationals and the climate crisis has put the current basis of our economy under threat.  The Green Party has proposed a circular economy as a model for Ireland and we need to debate that further and understand where it has been successfully implemented.  For my part, I point to the fact that in Sweden, the level of greenhouse gas emissions per person is 5.14 tonnes per year, among the lowest in Europe, whereas in Ireland, it is 12.64 tonnes per person, among the highest.  Many people in Sweden have greater challenges because of their climate, given that much of the population spends six months per year in snow.  Nevertheless, Sweden is able to deal with such issues, whereas we have a way to go.  As many Deputies noted, we need better transport, cycling infrastructure, planning, housing and services that work.  We can learn such lessons if we choose to orientate ourselves in the direction set out by social democratic countries.</p> <p> Finally, I return to the issue of the smoky coal ban.  It is not credible for the Government to extend the ban to 13 additional towns and pretend there is some impediment to extending it to the wider nation.  I have served in many Governments and chaired the European Environment Council.  There is a notion that the smoky coal ban can be extended to 85% of the population, with an arbitrary threshold of 10,000 inhabitants.  That a population of 10,010 would be okay, whereas one of 9,999 would not, because the Government will be met with litigation, is farcical.  It convinces nobody.</p> <p> I ask the Minister to let the final debate and motion in the House this year be an act of solidarity, unanimously passed, not only to set out a new environmental agenda and economic direction for the country but for us all to agree that the terrible harm being done by bituminous coal should end and that there should be a national ban on smoky coal.  I ask the Government to relent, even at this late hour, and allow a unanimous decision to be made by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

Higgins to enact the legislation, there will be a much-deserved early Christmas present for consumers, given that it will radically reform insurance contracts throughout the State.  I thank the Alliance for Insurance Reform for its input in respect of the legislation, which was doubtless strengthened by its suggestions.  It has described the legislation, which Sinn F&eacute;in and I introduced, as a game changer.  It will bring transparency to the sector and is part of my agenda of taking on the insurance industry and of ensuring that the scales will be tipped in favour of consumers.  Contracts will now need to be read in favour of the consumer.</p> <p>The insurance companies, which are fighting parts of this legislation, will have to be transparent about how much they charged on policies over a five-year period and the claims they paid out during the same period.  They will no longer be allowed to settle claims without the knowledge of the person the claim was made against.  They will no longer be able to ignore the evidence that a claim may be fraudulent, bogus or deeply suspicious.  There are many other provisions in this legislation.</p> <p> I thank the staff in my office, including Declan O'Farrell, who is leaving our employment to go to Brussels.  It is important that one of the last things we are doing before he leaves is to pass legislation that he helped me with.  I also thank Paul McIlvenny.  I would particularly like to thank the LRC for drafting an earlier version of this legislation.  I thank the officials in the Department of Finance and the Minister himself, who has helped to make sure this legislation passes in a timely manner.</p> <p> I must say that there was a step change in the Government's handling of this legislation when the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, came on board.  This Bill was held up by the Government for quite a period of time.  Given that I initially sponsored it in 2017, we should not have had to wait until the final sitting day of 2019 for it to be passed into law.  The previous Minister of State at the Department of Finance - the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy - failed to allow it to make progress for well over a year.  It was held up by a money message.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, for his help and support.  I would particularly like to thank his officials.  At least we have all come together in unison now to do something positive for consumers.  As many people have said, it should result in reduced premiums for people across the board.</p></speech>

It has had a long journey since it was introduced in 2017.  It was delayed for a long period of time.  This important legislation will modernise the law in the area of insurance contracts.  Up to now, the law has been very much stacked against the consumer.  I acknowledge the work of the LRC in publishing the initial draft Bill.</p>  <p>  There are many examples of insurance consumers needing to be better looked after.  Earlier this evening, I spoke on the telephone to a constituent who managed to get a cheaper quote elsewhere when he was renewing his motor insurance policy.  The new quote is approximately &euro;200 less than his existing premium.  When this elderly gentleman telephoned his broker to ask for a hard copy of his no-claims bonus, he was told that all the documentation had been emailed to him.  He does not do email.  He cannot print an email.  He does not have an email account.  I advised him to contact the broker again to say that he needs to have a hard copy posted out to him.  This kind of niggly, stupid little thing is a completely unnecessary and unwarranted part of the approach of some parts of the industry, which seems to involve mistreating customers.  It should not be necessary for legislation to intervene where common sense and basic good practice should apply to the treatment of customers.  Passing this Bill is a good day's work.  It will make a positive difference.  We are glad to support it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.570" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1364" speakername="Michael D'Arcy" time="18:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800060#OOO00400"><p>I thank all the Deputies who have contributed to this legislation, particularly Deputy Pearse Doherty.  He chased me and I chased everyone else.  I think we got a good Bill at the end of that process.  I thank the LRC.  Deputy Doherty and his staff have worked hard on this matter.  I thank the officials in the insurance section of the Department.  I thank our in-house staff in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.</p>  <p>  We all have a part to play in insurance reform.  There are too many vested interests who put themselves first.  It is not good enough that customers and consumers come last with regard to insurance.  This important legislation will put the consumer first and at the top of the queue instead of at the back of the queue.  The vested interests include the insurance companies.  Sections of the law profession and the legal world are looking after themselves as well.</p>  <p>  All the legislation that is being introduced in this area will put us in a better position.  As I have done on many occasions, I thank Deputies and Senators for their support in getting insurance legislation, including the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2018, through both Houses.  When the 2018 motor insurance transparency report was published earlier this week, we saw the benefit of the passing this time last year of the Central Bank (National Claims Information Database) Act 2018.  We have amended sections 8 and 14 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 to change how data can be held and how people can use that data.  Inferences can now be made against someone who does not, within a month, inform the person against whom a case is being taken that such a case is being taken.</p>  <p>  Following on from the enactment of the Judicial Council Act 2019, which is another crucial piece of this legislative framework, the seven judges started to consider this matter yesterday.  I cannot emphasise enough that the sooner their work is done, the sooner the award levels made in respect of smaller and less damaging claims will come down and we will be in a position akin to that of other jurisdictions.  The era of tens of thousands of euro being awarded in respect of incidents involving very little damage or very little impact on people has to end sooner rather than later.  The next part of this framework to come before the House will be the Perjury and Related Offences Bill 2018.  I hope we will be able to get that legislation through as quickly as possible as well.  The end of the era in which people got a lot of money in respect of false, fraudulent and exaggerated claims even though there had been very little impact on them will have a cumulative effect that will benefit consumers.  This Bill is all about consumers.  I wish everybody a happy Christmas.  I thank Deputies for all their work and for the support they have given my efforts to tackle the insurance sector.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.601" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="19:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800064#SSS01500"><p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to present the transition statement which has been published and laid before the House.  There are a number of developments even since then.  Deputy Dooley will be aware that COP 25 was somewhat disappointing in that progress was not made but many people took the view that no deal was better than a bad deal.</p> <p>That means the next conference, which is to be held in Glasgow, will have a particularly challenging agenda because there is a call for a stepping up of ambition by all countries on the occasion.  As the House will know, the European Commission recently published its green deal.  It is a very significant statement by the European Union.  This is to be the project for the European Union, not only in terms of achieving a target of net zero for Europe by 2050 but also in driving forward the agenda and seeking to leverage change beyond the Union.  I really welcome the initiative taken by the European Commission.  Europe needs a project like this to show its capacity to mobilise its citizens.  I welcome the opportunity and look forward to working with the European Union in realising the new ambitions it has set.</p> <p> On our own annual transition statement, the big initiative since the last transition statement was obviously the publication of our climate action plan, which followed on closely from the deliberations of the Citizens' Assembly and the all-party Oireachtas committee, which declared a climate emergency and unanimously supported a set of proposals.  That is significant in a D&aacute;il that is quite fractured in many circumstances.  This brought the House together.  I have been working on the proposals.</p> <p> Our carbon plan, which is very ambitious, is designed to hit our targets for 2030.  Over the coming months, we will have to evaluate, with our colleagues in the European Union, the changes required under the new ambitions set by the Union.  The plan we published provides for four times the current amount of renewable energy, ten times the amount of retrofitting of homes, and 25 times the penetration of electric vehicles by the end of the coming decade.  These are very significant changes that we need to make.  They require us to mobilise capital and, in many cases, change the habits of a lifetime.  They also require us to implement the policies in a way that is fair and just.  In recent months, we have seen, on foot of the decision to finish peat-burning in two of our peat-burning plants, the need to develop a just transition element.  That was a major feature of the recent budget.  I regard the recent budget as the first that has been significantly shaped by our climate challenge.  It is just the first of many that will be shaped in that way.</p> <p> It is important that we have agreed a carbon price.  Professor John FitzGerald, the chairman of the Climate Change Advisory Council, has said very clearly that achieving what we have set out without pricing carbon and pricing the damage inflicted by the burning of fossil fuels and by generating carbon in other ways would be almost impossible.  What is really important about the approach we have taken is that we have ring-fenced the money for just transition in terms of dealing with people who are very exposed, such as peat workers and those who are very poorly equipped to make the changes.  This year, for example, we have seen a doubling of funds for the warmer homes scheme, which offers 100% subsidies for those in the fuel scheme.  That is a significant feature.  Over time, the carbon transition will raise over &euro;6 billion.  All this will be ploughed back into helping communities and individuals to make the changes.</p> <p> Bringing more coherence into the way we develop a range of policies, with climate very much at the heart, has been important.  The national planning framework is an important element.  It creates challenges.  I have seen this in my area, where many of the more compact, higher-density developments for urban areas that we know are needed are hard to accept.  They can be very controversial.</p> <p> Another initiative that has been delivered this year is the adoption by every public service body of a climate mandate.  This process is under way.  A mandate has been adopted by every one of the 31 local authorities.  This gives us great reach into the wider community.  We can have a set of strategies agreed and developed centrally but see them implemented by agencies such as the local authorities, which have such reach within their communities.</p> <p> Electricity generation will require the major change.  We need to be 70% renewable by the end of the next decade, and then we need to head beyond that.  We have made significant changes, including the recent announcement of the new renewable energy support scheme, which will go live during the next year; the interconnection project with France; and the marine planning and development management Bill, which has been agreed by the Government and which will proceed to the committee for scrutiny.  These are important elements.</p> <p> In the building area, we are developing a retrofitting approach that will be different from the individualised subsidies that have been a feature.  We will be moving to area-based schemes so we can deliver retrofitting on a scale that is much greater than was evident before.  We have implemented the near-zero energy requirement and addressed obligations pertaining to those doing an overhaul of their homes that covers more than 25% of the area.  The new guidelines have a carbon emissions figure 70% lower than the figure it replaces.  Therefore, there is a significant change.</p> <p> In the transport sector, we are making significant changes, not only in having 500,000 people switch to public transport or active transport but also in moving towards having electric vehicles become a major feature of our fleet by the end of the next decade.  It is a matter of no longer having combustion engines newly registered at the end of that decade.</p> <p> We have built out this year, doubling the supports for public chargers.  We continue to support grants for electric vehicles so people can make the change.  The House will be aware that nearly 90% of journeys are made in private vehicles so we have to achieve the switch if we are to meet our targets.</p> <p> We are on the right track.  We have a long way to go.  The work of this House in bringing people together and achieving the required consensus is really important but I am very conscious that this cannot be solved in Kildare Street, Adelaide Road or Merrion Street; this is about engaging with every community up and down the country and with every sector of economic activity to square up to the challenges.  It is a question of considering every type of activity, not just those areas that get a lot of focus, such as transport and buildings.  We must also consider how we manage waste.  Material use accounts for nearly 60% of our carbon.  How we use materials and the efficiency of our use of energy, materials, plastics and food must be considered.  We have a poor record in many of these areas.  We could do much better in the management of our waste, thereby having a very significant impact.</p> <p> I believe we have started well.  Members of the House will be judging us on the legislation we hope to bring forward very soon, certainly to the committee.  I am convinced there is now a broad consensus.  It is true that people are pointing the finger at our generation saying it will be the first to have passed on the globe in a worse condition than we found it.  That places a great responsibility on us to take this very seriously and to deliver practical, genuine change that shifts the dial.  That is what I have sought to do.  I have sought to identify the changes we can make that impose the least burden on Irish people but that deliver on climate change while affording opportunities to have a better environment, a cleaner country, a better society and more global justice.  That is a challenge well worth fighting for.</p> <p>There is no doubt that the greatest achievements of civilisation have been when we have been faced by an existential threat.  When we look back over history, we see that civilisations rose to their highest level when faced with such a threat.  This is just such a threat and it is an opportunity for Irish and global society to rise to the challenge of creativity and collaboration that we have not achieved before.  I commend the transition statement to the House.  </p></speech>

As I said, I hope that climate action does not become the new housing, where we have endless debates.  We need to focus on the solutions collectively in this Chamber regarding climate action.  Where there is consensus, then we need to move forward and where there is not we will have division and debate.  It is important, however, similar to the Bill we had earlier today, that where there is consensus that we need to drive on with this issue.  I also mentioned earlier the European Commission's green deal, which has just been published.  I said there are elements I like and elements I do not like.  The most significant change is the one that states the targets set for 2030 and 2050 are not good enough and need to be revised.</p>  <p>  Even within its own limitations, however, that proposal, ironically, still manages to outshine this Government, a Government completely locked into the private sector and market solutions.  This is not surprising, as Fine Gael takes the same approach to climate action as it does to health, housing, childcare, insurance costs and workers' rights.  The European Commission at least recognises that the existing targets are not good enough and wants to increase the greenhouse gas emissions' targets from 45% to 55% by 2030.  This is a real problem for Fine Gael, as it has consistently failed to achieve even the current modest targets.</p>  <p>  Last week also saw the publication of the climate change performance index, in which the State went from the worst performer in the EU to the second worst performer in the course of a year.  That was actually spun as a success by the Taoiseach and his Ministers.  We are second worst only to Poland, which gets 80% of its energy from coal.  The European Commission has called for a review of the framework for energy infrastructure to ensure consistency with the climate neutrality objective.  It is hard to see how Fine Gael's love for fracked gas terminals will survive such a review.  This is an issue that has received cross-party support.  The Taoiseach and his Ministers, as is their style however, have simply ignored the views of the House and want to make out that fracked gas is somehow climate-neutral energy.  </p>  <p>  The European Commission's green deal also calls for a new circular economy action plan, including a right to repair and the curbing of built-in obsolescence of devices, the design of all new buildings to be in line with the needs of the circular economy and the climate-proofing of building stock, an increase and expansion in the use of rail, including the transport of freight by rail, a review of all current tax exemptions for aviation and maritime fuels, improved and expanded public transport, an increase in the area under organic farming in the EU, to be coupled with a farm to fork policy that will strive to stimulate sustainable food consumption and promote affordable healthy food for all.</p>  <p>  Those are just some of the proposals within the EU's Green New Deal.  It remains to be seen whether EU members can agree to act upon it, but on the face of it the document is progressive and shows real potential.  I cannot, however, see this present Government paying anything but lip service to any of it.  It is clear to me that we are not going to see any real progress on climate action until this Government is gone.  That is the reality.  Take the need for increased investment in public transport and rail on this island, for example.  The western rail corridor was originally included in the EU's TEN-T map.  That is a map of the EU core travel network, with each identified as a priority.  In the last European Parliament, Sinn F&eacute;in managed to secure overwhelming support from MEPs from right across Europe to vote for the western rail corridor to be included in the core network list.  Being included on that list means that government and regional authorities are able to draw down funding and support from the EU.  During negotiations with the European Council, however, which the Government was a party to, the western rail corridor was removed from the core list.  There was no explanation for that.  What is certain is that there has been utter failure from successive Governments to commit to the western rail corridor.</p>  <p>  There is much more that can be said and, as I said earlier, this is the second debate today that we have had on climate action.  I am sure when we come back in January that there will further debates on this subject.  It is the issue of our generation and it is an issue that we need to face up to.  The Minister highlighted the young people who sat in these seats and debated climate action only a few short weeks ago.  What they want is action.  They do not want endless talk, endless debates and endless motions being passed, which are not then implemented or delivered on.  They want us in this Chamber, collectively, to do our job, face up to our responsibilities and deliver the climate action that is necessary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.627" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="19:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800066#UUU02700"><p>The annual transition statement covers several areas, including how far the State has progressed in meeting national and EU climate commitments.  It is an excellent opportunity to take stock of how far this Government has come, or not, in responding to the climate crisis and what new measures are necessary.  I have a number of separate points to make.</p>  <p>  The statement from the Minister contains the standard overview of recent policies, but I will start by noting that it is disappointing that other Ministers will only address the statement in 2020 and not in December, as in previous years.  Ireland will fail considerably on its 2020 climate and renewable targets.  Under the EU&rsquo;s effort sharing decision, Ireland has exceeded its binding emissions allocation in 2018.  Our overall target commits us to reducing emissions by 20% by 2020, but we will reach only a 1% reduction, a truly staggering failure.  The upshot is considerable financial penalties in hundreds of millions of euro and potentially billions by 2030.  It is important that the Minister explains, in detail, precisely why this occurred in 2018, whether it will occur again in 2019 and the level of fines that will be paid on account of our failure to reach our overall target in 2020.</p>  <p>  As we approach the end of this Government, the biggest criticism of Fine Gael will not only be its failure to secure the necessary reduction in emissions and pollution in the last decade, but it will also be its endemic and deliberate failure to enact appropriate legislation and to prioritise policies that would facilitate substantive, near-term emissions reductions.  In other words, it is quite fond of making climate wishes with photoshoots and press releases, but the situation is quite different when it comes to delivering on them in the near term.  I stress near term, in that Fine Gael was dragged kicking and screaming into producing its 2015 Climate Act.  It produced a mitigation plan under this legislation, universally regarded as insufficient and which did not yield substantial emissions reductions.</p>  <p>  This year, Fianna F&aacute;il has been clear that the policy framework set out in the Government's 2019 climate action plan is an improvement.  However, it differs substantially from the report of the climate action committee.  It ignores timelines and deadlines which Fine Gael committed to in that committee.</p> <p>It is littered with reviews and consultations, along with the words &ldquo;would&rdquo;, &ldquo;could&rdquo; and &ldquo;maybe&rdquo;.  The point is that the longer we postpone climate action, the more expensive the transition will be and the greater the risk to the economy as emphasised most recently by the Central Bank.</p> <p> It is important the Government undertakes a further review of the committee's recommendations and ensures their full incorporation in the finalised national energy and climate plan.  The Government's climate plan has no statutory footing, meaning that it is not even possible to ensure accountability and properly measure progress.  Will the Minister integrate relevant policies and measures set out in the Government's climate action plan as part of the finalisation of the national energy and climate plan?</p> <p> The Minister&rsquo;s climate plan will not deliver necessary annual emissions reductions in line with the Paris Agreement.  Given ongoing increases in emissions, such an approach would also seem to imply a dependence on costly negative-emissions technology in order to meet a 2050 zero target.  Will the Minister ensure that the national energy and climate plan sets out a pathway to net zero emissions consistent with the Paris Agreement objectives?</p> <p> The deadline for the submission of Ireland's national energy and climate plan is the end of 2019.  We understand the Government will not meet this deadline, however.  The Department is currently holding a public consultation on a separate long-term strategy which was originally meant to only last 15 working days but was subsequently extended.  The Department has not communicated if a further public consultation will take place on the finalised national energy and climate plan.  Will the Minister ensure his Department allocates necessary resources to such consultations?  It is particularly disappointing that we are discussing the statement but the Minister has not even published the key amending legislation which will turn promises to actions through a clear commitment to climate neutrality by 2050, a system of carbon budgets and an enhanced advisory council.  It must be remembered that Fine Gael committed to enacting this legislation in 2019 at the committee on climate action, yet it has not even been presented.  Will the Minister clarify if the Government will support a whole-economy net zero target by 2050 in light of its analysis during 2019?  Will the Minister set out sectoral emissions reduction pathways to 2050?</p> <p> Improving the climate advisory function is particularly important.  His climate plan has made no reference to this step, however.  Will the Minister seek to update the expertise in resources available to it?  Earlier in December, the European Council endorsed the objective of achieving a climate neutral EU by 2050.  The Council also noted the Commission's communication on a new green deal.  The EU will substantively increase its mitigation commitments for 2030 and 2050.  Will the Government step up to the plate, however?  The signs are not encouraging.  Earlier this month the international climate change performance index showed that, although Ireland had climbed seven places from its ranking last year, it remained among the lowest performances globally and is ranked one of the worst performers on climate action in the EU.  With the EU now set to increase its 2030 target over the coming year to at least 55%, this is the time for Ireland to develop a 2030 pathway based on five-year carbon budgets aligned with the science and Ireland's fair share.</p> <p> The annual transitions statement also noted that Ireland has committed to a doubling of its national contribution to the UN green climate fund in 2020.  However, this is only an increase to just &euro;4 million, nowhere near that provided by other similar EU states which have reached ten times that figure.  This makes a mockery of Ireland's commitment to climate action and further harms Ireland's international reputation.</p> <p> Is the Minister aware of the policy statement released by his Department yesterday entitled, Petroleum Exploration and Production Activities as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Transition to a Low Carbon Economy?  Did he personally approve the conclusions of the report which contained some rather curious points seemingly prepared rapidly and exclusively for the benefit of the fossil fuel industry?  Several statements in the document about climate action and energy security, unfortunately, would seem to call into question the Government's own and supposed desire to consult on Ireland's national energy and climate plan and clearly pre-empt the Government upcoming energy security review.  The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, in the foreword stated, "we need to protect and conserve our rich marine biodiversity and manage the available natural resources in harmony with surrounding ecosystems".  On the same day as the release of this report, University College Cork announced research which showed that in areas of seismic surveys used by fossil fuel exploration companies, whale sightings are down by almost 90%.  What does this say about a commitment to ecosystem protection?  Did the Minister consult with energy companies prior to making these conclusions?  Did he raise these conclusions with the EPA, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities or the UCC marine research centre?  Was this document signed off at Cabinet level?</p> <p> Our emissions are driven significantly by energy and infrastructure decisions which lock us into either high or zero carbon development.  It is important this review on energy security takes as the starting point the need to meet Paris Agreement objectives.  It should address risks posed by new investments in fossil fuels, potentially locking in higher emissions.  Will the Minister update the House on the production of the terms of reference of this security review?  Will he be consulting on the matter?</p> <p> Kieran Mulvey was before the climate action committee today.  I was surprised to hear Mr. Mulvey state he was phoned two days prior to his appointment and a day prior to the closure of the two plants, Shannonbridge in County Offaly and Lanesboro in County Longford.  This showed the Government was not prepared but it was a crisis reaction, getting the press release out and appointing the just transition commissioner.  Mr. Mulvey stated at the climate action committee today that he was a one-man band and had not even secretariat support.  He is not sure about support from the Department.  While I believe he will be a credible just transition commissioner, if he has not been provided with the resources and the ground supports, his work will be compromised as a result of this failure by the Department and the Minister.  Another point Mr. Mulvey made today was that he was not consulted on the terms of reference.</p> <p> We should no longer refer to Ireland as a climate laggard as if the country were to blame.  It was the Fine Gael Government which decided in 2012 to abandon climate legislation proposed by the Green Party and Fianna F&aacute;il.  It was Fine Gael which failed to introduce any sort of coherent climate plan until this year.  It is far from certain that we will see legislation and policies sufficiently progress to reverse this trend before the end of this Government.</p></speech>

If the Government is to achieve everything that it has set out in the climate action plan, it would be useful if we could nail down the financial package involved.  Let us take targets around afforestation or the retrofitting of houses.  While I do not wish to be partisan tonight, by any objective analysis, there were only 300 deep retrofits carried out 2019 when the Government has spoken about committing to a B2 BER standard for 50,000 houses per annum.  This will require money.</p>  <p>  If the Minister is talking about ring-fencing carbon taxes to build a fund, it is arguable that those resources may not meet the demands, particularly in the transport sector and with the provision of rolling stock to meet public transport demand.  There is the issue of putting together the fund which will retrofit local authority housing.  There are issues with the just transition.  I am glad Mr. Kieran Mulvey was mentioned tonight because he is normally the person the Government of the day calls in to act as chief firefighter.  He has a remarkable record in that respect.  If we are serious about the just transition and the midlands is ground zero for this, it must be resourced adequately.</p> <p>We then need to see how that just transition is replicated throughout the State because other parts of the country would have that transition from carbon producing, particularly my area, which is the main hub for energy sources for a significant part of the island.  We are anxiously waiting to see what funding will be made available for this just transition for the remainder of the country.  Notwithstanding the appointment of Mr. Mulvey, the jury is still out on how that process in the midlands is going.  It is early days.</p> <p> I ask the Minister to address the financial elements of what is proposed.  The European Union has proposed a &euro;100 billion fund.  What is the Government's thinking on how much will be available for Ireland to draw down?  As I understand it, the package has yet to be signed off on but it is in play.</p> <p> In the context of the agricultural sector in particular, what will the permutations of the negotiations relating to the multi-annual financial framework mean for the next Common Agricultural Policy, CAP?  Right now, we are being told that the CAP negotiations could become not interminable, but could surpass the closing date of the current CAP.  There is an opportunity to invest in agriculture in partnership with farmers on carbon sequestration.  What funding measures does the Minister envisage could be brought to bear?  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, will have a view on that, but I would like to hear the views of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, on it.</p> <p> What is the status of the draft national energy and climate plan?  We had some deliberations on this matter in the committee today.  Obviously, we want to ensure the voice of the Oireachtas committee is heard when we reach a point when there is consensus - hopefully there will be consensus - on that draft national energy and climate plan.  I hope the Minister will have regard to what the Oireachtas committee has to say.</p></speech>

He is a straight talker and I have great respect for him.  He said today that he got a phone call the day before the announcement was made.  While there is an office in Offaly, it is like the captain of a team going out onto the pitch on his own; the rest of the team does not seem to be there behind the man at the moment.  Anybody taking on this project needs a significant team behind him.  He needs the resources and the funding.  The Government needs to ensure that whatever resources required are given to that man.</p>  <p>  We need to consider ideas in the way Se&aacute;n Lemass did years ago with the tax incentive area around Shannon Airport.  Eight counties, including Galway and Roscommon, are involved in what I call the midlands.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Eugene Murphy, is from the same area that I come from.  The people in the counties in question also supply peat and they cannot become the forgotten people.  The fund is approximately &euro;1.2 million to cover everything, including the wages of the team being put together.  An area involved in a town and village renewal project would nearly get that amount.  We need to make an honest effort.  In the region of 400 Bord na M&oacute;na employees have lost their jobs and there are also temporary workers.  The only solution so far is just redundancy, there is no strategic plan.</p>  <p>  We have talked about Ireland West Airport Knock.  The area surrounding that airport needs investment.  IDA Ireland should allocate somebody to that midlands transition area as well as to the airport.  Mr. Mulvey made it very clear today that Dublin is getting overcrowded.  We need to get these businesses into these areas, but we need to put the money into doing so.</p>  <p>  Some 6% of hedgerows throughout the country have not been included in our mitigation plan.  That is phenomenal when one considers that Coillte owns approximately 7% of the landmass.  All farms have some trees growing on them but not one is included as a mitigation measure.</p>  <p>  On a few occasions, I have proposed the creation of little shelter belts of half an acre for holdings of up to 50 acres, three quarters of an acre for holdings up to 100 acres and 1.5 or 2 acres for holdings up to 200 acres.  Over one year, we could give farmers an incentive in this regard without stopping them farming.  We could probably put in 130,000 acres of trees.  They could put in whatever trees they want.  If they want to plant broadleaf trees, that would be fine.  Some time ago, there were shelter belts and the EU paid farmers to get bulldozers and clear them out along with ditches.  Now we are looking to get them back again because that makes economic sense.  It would be possible to get 55,000 ha to 60,000 ha in one year if we had the money for it.  I do not know whether we have the money; that could be the stumbling block.  We need to ensure that no one is looking at a satellite image and telling a farmer that because a branch of a tree is sticking out, the basic payment or payment for area of natural constraint will be blocked.  It requires some thinking.  It could be a phenomenal success overnight without impeding the farmers in agriculture.</p>  <p>  The carbon tax is a problem in rural areas because they do not have rail or bus public transport.  They will be disproportionately affected.  We should be looking at anaerobic digestion and solar power.  People have no problem looking at different options, but it needs a kick-start.  This week, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine announced that we will remain on the same old track with the single farm payment and that we are not looking at the new system of convergence in order to ensure that farmers with smaller holdings might come up a bit and have their operations made more viable.  We cannot keep not looking at these things.</p>  <p>  Even though the farmers in this country get kicked day-in and day-out by media and everyone, they will be the saviours of the people in the cities, which is not recognised.  It is about time that they started to be shown a bit of respect.</p></speech>

I wish them and their families the very best for Christmas and the new year.</p>  <p>  A number of things strike me about the Government's transition statement.  It has the hallmarks of a box-ticking exercise in its list of achievements and aspirations.  It is as if the officials cut and pasted from the climate action plan and various PR releases made over the past year.  Missing from it is an honest assessment of what has happened, what will happen and what has not happened, both here and globally.  An honest assessment of the Government's climate action plan would have noted that last year, at the behest of the fossil fuel lobby, every trick in the book was used to stop the Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill, which articulated one key demand of the global movement, namely, to keep fossil fuels in the ground.  Stripped of the spin, the underhand trickery used to stop that Bill was astounding.  Belatedly giving in to the demand of the movement and the school strikers, the Government is claiming to ban oil exploration but not gas exploration.  Of course, we discovered in the detail that a plethora of licences that have been issued will remain good in some cases until 2035.  No one seriously believes that it is possible to ban exploration for one fossil fuel and not another.  Instead of putting the measures needed in place, the Government sabotaged the Bill and sabotaged democracy to signal to industry that Ireland would not step on its toes.</p>  <p>  At the same time, the Government made it clear that Ireland is happy to become a major hub for one of the most damaging and dangerous fossil fuels, namely, fracked gas.</p> <p>It is a complete refusal to understand the science yet again.  It ignores the evidence that the plans of companies that want to build liquified natural gas terminals, LNG, revolve around fracked gas.  This is an industry that is responsible for a huge spike in global methane emissions.  All of this time the Government has relied on a false narrative that gas is a safe transitional fuel.  It is not.  The science is clear, and holding out the idea that it is the lesser evil for the climate is a death sentence for large parts of our world.</p> <p> In general terms, the problem confronting the global movement is not that we have lots of outright climate deniers - we do not.  Most people in power and the ruling elites accept the science and make noises towards the need to cut emissions.  As we have seen with this Government's record and with COP 25 in Madrid, formal acceptance of the science is meeting an utter inability to take the steps that are needed at home and globally.  We see an almost religious faith being placed in market mechanisms and in new technology that may be achieved at some stage in the future, maybe tomorrow, next year, in ten years, or by 2050.  In the meantime we are planning for fracked gas terminals and continued exploration, for one million electric vehicles on our roads and we hope, like children playing on a beach while ignoring the ocean beside them, that the warnings of the science and nature are wrong.  This is an utterly ridiculous faith in the market mechanism and is totally misplaced.</p> <p> COP 25 ended in failure not because of the wrangles between one group of nations and another group or because of squabbles over old carbon credits.  It failed because the only attempt to deal with the threat posed by climate change has been to rely on finding some way to ensure that somebody can make a profit from it.  One commentator has noted that the proposals from some countries allow for massive loopholes that would deliver reduced emissions on paper but not in reality.  This is exactly how carbon markets work.  Their chief purpose is not to reduce emissions but to allow for the continued use of oil, coal and gas.  The so-called clean development mechanism, CDM, has been a fraud on the developing world and on the global environment.  It lacks basic social and environmental safeguards and has led to human rights violations and environmental destruction.  Like the various carbon markets, it has facilitated double counting where theoretical emission reductions can cheat the accountant, but it cannot cheat the atmosphere and it cannot cheat nature.</p> <p> Offsetting emissions will do nothing to stop climate crises and will only shift pollution from one place to another, guaranteeing only that somebody makes a profit on the way.  While countries reach their climate targets on paper, emissions continue to rise.  The full failure of carbon markets, which remain the only mechanism envisaged at COP and globally, is catastrophic for our planet.  We have seen more than 30 years of this trading market and trading permits, during which time there has been a continued rise in CO2 emissions to historic levels not witnessed in three million years.</p> <p> I am certain, unfortunately, that we will continue to see the same pattern repeated, that the demands of the movement will be ignored and that profit will be the priority over planet or people.  In 2020, and with certain urgency and determination, the global and local movement has to return to the streets.  I look forward to joining them throughout 2020, to get the radical action we need to save our planet, our biodiversity and our people from catastrophic climate change.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.636" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="20:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800069#XXX00200"><p>I am beginning to feel that climate is getting like housing with debate after debate.  It is really time that we stopped talking and started doing.  Equally, while marches and protests have their place, we need comprehensive, easy to read, easy to understand information and measures on recycling.  Most of us have our different bins but there is a lot of contamination of recycling materials because people genuinely do not know all of the details.  It is a lack of knowledge.  I am tired of people saying that we must do more and we have to tackle climate change without saying specifically what each of us can do and what each of us must do so that the individual efforts of one are not undermined by the efforts of another.</p>  <p>  I turn now to the frequent topic of what we in this House do in this regard.  We now have recycling bins in Leinster House 2000, each of which has a sign.  Still, however, the same items are in each of the three bins.  I really think that we need pictures on the bins so we know exactly what to put into the bins.  We must start here and do our bit.</p>  <p>  On a bigger scale, we could look at what the German Bundestag has done.  In 2008, they set out to become the greenest parliamentary building in the world when they made a decision to rely solely on renewable energy using water, wind and solar.  There was a lot of refurbishment there in the late 1990s, including the glass cupola, and the roof uses solar power.  In 2008, a parliamentary sub-committee set out to look for bids from renewable energy producers.  This tied in with the growing trend in zero-emission homes in Germany,  some of which are so energy efficient that they produce surplus power that owners can sell back to the grid.  We could start to look at ourselves in the Houses of the Oireachtas and how we could lead by example.</p>  <p>  I believe that the public needs more information so that individuals' homes and communities will know exactly what they have to do.  It requires comprehensive, concrete information.  This will feed into how necessary it is to have clarity on the long-term strategy with processes, on the measures and on the timeframes.</p>  <p>  We know of the need to cut emissions to limit warming to 1.5oC as in the Paris Agreement.  A total of 196 states had signed it by 2019, and it has been ratified by 183 and the EU.  That is the easy part.  We also know the United States of America's attitude.  Warming over 1.5oC significantly worsens the risk of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty.  Many states are ostrich like, burying their heads in the sand and ignoring the scientific evidence.  No matter what the EU, the island states, and the small countries do, the big polluters are getting away with what they please to do.  We know exactly who they are.  There is, therefore, a legal basis for climate justice.  Dr. Lorna Gold has said that tackling climate change at its root means untangling and unmaking that complex web of capital power and privilege.  The top 10% of emitters contribute 50% of global emissions annually.  I was incredulous when I read of oxygen bars in Delhi where citizens can go to breathe fresh air for certain periods of time.</p>  <p>  Four years on from the Paris Agreement it is obvious that current efforts are failing.  Science is being ignored and the scientists have warned that without urgent action, global warming is likely to exceed 2oC.  We know the devastating impact this would have on nature, on ecosystems and on biodiversity.  There is also the huge cost for economies and the impact on the production of food.  In his statement the Minister said that this would require an unprecedented level of international co-operation, that all sectors must step up to decarbonise, and that there is a need for radical change.  If Ireland is fully committed to implementing the objectives of the Paris Agreement, then I believe that each community and each sector should know specifically how they have to contribute.</p>  <p>  We are committed to scaling up our financial contribution to the UNFCCC and to support climate action in developing countries.  Increasing finance for developing countries is only part of the answer.  We need to ensure that the decisions we make in our developed world are proofed against the impact on developing countries.  We have to make hard decisions in our world, which is a high carbon economy.  The better off we are, the more we emit, but we cannot leave the future of the planet to the market.  Ghandi said "The earth provides enough for every man's need but not every man's greed".  We have to acknowledge excessive consumerism and do what is necessary to curtail it, and really take on board that we share the planet, we do not own it.  We need more eco villages such as Cloughjordan, more eco communities and more eco countries such as Cuba.  We need more community gardens, and all Members have these in their constituencies, and we need more tree planting.  We know what to do.  It is about getting down to do it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.637" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1366" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="20:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800069#XXX00300"><p>This is a key moment of political accountability for Ireland's action on climate change in the past year.  Despite all the consultations, plans and research papers, it is clear that Ireland is making very limited progress towards meeting its current long-term national policy position.  Policy positions and expensive consultant contracts do not bring down emissions, but action does.</p>  <p>  The 2014 national policy position set the target of 80% reduction in emissions by 2050 based on 1990 levels and an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture sector.  In 2019, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action endorsed a target of net zero emissions by 2050 and the enshrinement of this target into law in first quarter of 2020.</p> <p>In its climate action plan, the Government indicated an intention to increase the 2050 goal to a net zero target and enshrine the 2050 position into law in early 2020.  I understand the Cabinet was supposed to have discussed the heads of the Bill this morning but did not reach this agenda item.  When it comes to the crunch, climate change seems to fall off the Government's agenda every time.</p> <p> I call on the Government to explain to the House why Ireland will not meet our EU 2020 climate targets.  In my opinion, even the most recent climate action plan is insufficient to meet Ireland's obligations under the Paris Agreement and international law, since it is built on the premise that carbon pricing and electric vehicles will largely do the job.  Extra financial burdens do not deliver climate action.  They penalise disadvantaged communities and do not offer systemic change based on environmental and social justice.</p> <p> The science is clear and the message is unequivocal.  Our planet is in danger of hitting some key tipping points that could shift the global environmental systems out of balance.  More than 1 million species are threatened with extinction and the world is on track for temperature increases up to 4&deg;C and higher that would make much of the earth uninhabitable for humans.  Experts and civil society organisations are all in agreement that only a rapid and deep transition to a decarbonised global economy based on the principles of social and climate justice is now required over the next decade to prevent the spiralling of catastrophic climate impacts and to reduce the levels of risks associated with the transition to a zero-carbon future.</p> <p> The United Nations Environment Programme published its annual emissions gap report at the opening of COP 25 in Madrid a few weeks ago, highlighting that we must cut global emissions by 55% on 2018 levels within ten years if we are to stand a chance of limiting warming to 1.5&deg;C, the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.  This equates to cuts of 7.6% per annum over the next decade.  I call on the Government to take steps immediately to align Ireland's climate policies with what climate science and international law demands.</p> <p> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, special report on 1.5&deg;C published in 2018 makes it explicitly clear that limiting warming to 1.5&deg;C above pre-industrial levels must be the goal underpinning all national targets and policies.  The report concludes that global average emissions must be net zero by 2050 at the latest.  This means that developed nations such as Ireland must reach net zero sooner.  It is interesting to note that Ireland produces more carbon than 55 African countries combined.  That is the state Ireland is in.  People speak about us being a small country making no difference.  We would make a huge difference if we lived up to our aims.</p> <p> If the current rate of increase in emissions continues, we will reach 3&deg;C to 4&deg;C warming before 2100.  Ireland's current plans will only contribute to catastrophic climate breakdown unless there is a radical shift in Government ambition and urgency.  However, Ireland remains a very poor performer by EU standards and our emissions continue to rise.  Only because of the Citizens' Assembly and the report of the Joint Committee on Climate Action did we see the Minister finally start to develop concrete policies and measures.</p> <p> Ireland is far off track from meeting its current 2030 target and longer-term commitments to decarbonise the economy.  The most recent projections show that over the next decade, even with additional policy measures included in the national development plan, methane and nitrous oxide emissions from the agrifood sector are projected to increase by 3%.  Continued growth in emissions from the transport sector is also projected in the short term, largely due to the continued use of diesel cars and diesel freight and the absence of public transport in much of the country.  Energy consumption is also expected to grow, going in the opposite direction of what is needed collectively by the EU.  We need the Government to commit to phasing out all fossil fuels, including gas and LNG, and all offshore oil and gas exploration.  The current trends are unacceptable.  Climate action requires that CO2 emissions from energy and cement need to go to net zero well before 2050.  Nitrous oxide and especially methane emissions need to reduce steadily and permanently.  Therefore, increases in these emissions from agriculture must be addressed with incentives for diversification, agriforestry, hedgerow maintenance and ecosystem restoration.</p> <p> The 2019 climate action plan sets a pathway for a 2% decline in emissions per annum from 2021 to 2030.  This is not in line with Ireland's fair share of the Paris Agreement carbon budget.  Ireland will need to reduce emissions by more than 7% per annum every year to comply with the Paris Agreement but that is not the Government's policy.  Ireland's continuing delay in increasing action and ambition will drastically escalate the governmental and political effort that will be required in the future.  The annual transition statement does not show that the Government is serious about implementing the Paris Agreement.</p></speech>

It has been a year when public consciousness and desire for action has risen stronger than any time I can remember in the past 30 years of campaigning on this issue.  It came from what happened in the previous year, with the IPCC report of October 2018 setting out the differences between a 1.5&deg;C and 2&deg;C rise in global temperatures.  It came as well because of the World Wildlife Fund report published in the same month of that year showing we had lost half of all wildlife in the past 50 years by biomass weight.  This was followed by David Attenborough and the controversy about plastic and the environment.  The issue of how we are destroying nature by our actions was centre stage, particularly coming into this year.  In any review of the year with regard to climate change and any look back at the history of what happened this year, people will also think of Greta Thunberg and the climate strikes movement.  A few weeks ago, this Chamber was used for the youth parliament, which was a remarkable event, given the passion, intelligence and integrity of what was said.  The Minister said it himself in his contribution.  We have to listen to what those young people are saying.</p>  <p>  What is so strong about what Greta Thunberg is saying is that she brings us back all the time to the key science and the October 2018 report from the IPCC that states if we are to have a 66% chance of staying below 1.5&deg;C globally, we could release approximately 420 gigatonnes into the atmosphere.  We continue to release and expand the number, with approximately 41 gigatonnes a year.  This is why there is a focus on the next decade being the critical decade.  We owe a huge debt of gratitude to Greta and the students throughout the country who brought it centre stage.</p>  <p>  I want to concentrate on the good news as well as bad.  We had a Citizens' Assembly to which the all-party Oireachtas committee reacted.  If we listen to what other countries and other people say needs to be done, we have actually taken some of the steps.  We did it in a positive and collaborative manner that I hope will set us up well.  I am happy to commend the whole-of-government action plan coming out of this where I think it got it right in terms of the idea of a whole-of-government approach.  This island is small enough to be flexible and pull together but big enough to show proof of concept.  We are a capable island, country and people when we set ourselves a goal on which there is consensus.  There has been progress this year in the broadest political sense and it is because the Irish people want us to do this.  We all know this.  We all hear it when we are at the doors.  I do not believe it will change.  Irish people want us to go green.  We are tired of being laggards and we are ready to be leaders.  This is probably the most positive development this year.</p>  <p>  Despite the failure in COP, and while I was pleased to be at the talks last week, it was deeply depressing to see the lack of progress, there is also potentially good news in the fact the European Union is now clearly setting itself the strategic goal of tackling this being our economic strategy.  Tackling climate change and the biodiversity crisis is central to everything we will be doing as a continent and Union.  This will have to be matched by a significant increase in the targets we are setting ourselves in preparation for COP 26 in Glasgow next year and much more ambitious targets for reductions in 2030 and 2050.  In fact, there is a need for full decarbonisation before that date.  This brings us to a challenge because the whole-of-Government action plan on climate is clearly not going to be ambitious enough.  We cannot state we are part of the green new deal and that we really are leading if our emissions reductions are 2% per annum.  I do not mean to score political points on this but it is just a reality.</p> <p>The next Government will face a real challenge in delivering a multiple of that figure in annual reductions.</p> <p> I met Paul Allen from Zero Carbon Britain - Centre for Alternative Technology at the Conference of the Parties, COP.  He made the point that people focus all of the time on what the end goal date is for the decarbonisation and where we are at in terms of 2030 or 2050, which is true, but in terms of protecting the climate, it is what we do in the next few years that matters.  If we leave emissions high, they remain in the atmosphere for hundreds, if not thousands, of years, such that the earlier we make the cuts the more significant the reduction that will occur in terms of pollution in the atmosphere.  The curve is important.  Starting early is the right thing to do in environmental terms.</p> <p> There are two categories in terms of the Government's approach that need to change.  There are categories on which we reached broad agreement at the Oireachtas committee, as reflected in the Government's action plan.  I welcome that there is a significant ramping up or realisation of the scale of retrofitting we have to do in our domestic public buildings and commercial buildings.  We are all agreed on that.  The only problem now is how we do it when we do not have the workers in place to do it and we do not have the financing arrangements in place.  We are only doing a minute fraction of what we are committing to do.  For example, is the target 50,000 houses per annum but we are only doing a couple of hundred?  That is the scale of the challenge.  At least we know that is an area we are all agreed we want to address.</p> <p> Similarly, it is significant that we have broad agreement on the Government plan which aims for 70% renewables by 2030.  That is not an unambitious target for anyone who knows anything about how to manage this in an isolated, synchronised grid system.  That will present a real challenge.  I think we will benefit from it.  We will meet it and we may be able to go further and in the learning by doing we will surprise ourselves and gain economic advantage.  Again, nothing has been introduced yet, particularly in terms of offshore wind or in solar power, which shows us how we will actually do it.</p> <p> Similarly in terms of the switch to electric vehicles there is broad agreement, although I have a different view in terms of the nature of the mobility services we need to be providing in transport.  Again, ambitious targets are set but where are the real measures to deliver?  That is a task for the current and next Government to rise to.  In a whole range of other areas we do not have the ambition yet and we do not have consensus.  We do not have consensus on transport.  What this Government is doing on transport is utterly unsustainable.  It runs completely counter to any climate change ambition.  It is not serving our people in any way because it is just leading to gridlock.  The entire transport policy needs to change.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has been a complete waste of space when it comes to his contribution to the climate debate.</p> <p> In agriculture, the situation is different.  The agricultural system and the farming groups and others are realising that things need to change and that there is huge opportunity in re-wetting our bogs, farmers helping out in forestry and in paying farmers properly, which is not currently happening, for genuinely origin green products.  This is an area where again Government policy is not working but everyone else is starting to realise that the old game is up, even though the Government is clinging to it.  A new strategy needs to be put in place.</p> <p> Similarly in regard to waste, the Government is clinging to its mantra that Repak is working: it is not.  The Minister rightly cited the instance of how much carbon emissions come from our use of materials but we have seen nothing yet in terms of ambitious and aggressive measures to reduce our level of consumption to introduce a circular economy.  The same applies in forestry.  I welcome the Government announcement that there will be no further oil exploration.  We need to do the same in regard to gas and we need to stop the importation of fracked gas.</p> <p> Looking forward to next year, what do we need to do?  We need to put Brexit and climate together.  One of the tasks will be to ensure that regardless of the trade deal that is done with the UK we maintain energy collaboration and wide environmental collaboration with the UK because we will not be able to do this alone and nor will the UK.  We need to be part of a regional European electricity market and we need to make sure that there are common standards.  In whatever Government follows the next election, we need a programme for government that is designed around a green new deal, matching what the European Commission said last week.  It changes everything.  It involves everyone and it takes what is good in the last year and it builds on it, with far greater ambition towards a just transition of which we can all be proud.</p></speech>

What level of fines were paid as a result of our failure to reach our targets?  What level of fines will be paid if we fail to reach our overall target in 2020?  The Department has not communicated if a further public consultation will be held on the finalised NECP.  When does the Minister intend to publish the draft NECP?  Earlier Deputy Sherlock referenced the deliberations in committee today regarding the uncertainty around that date.  We would like to make a submission to that process so I would like to know if the Minister intends to allocate the necessary resources for that consultation.</p>  <p>  On the just transition commissioner, concern was expressed across the committee today about the one-man band, Mr. Kieran Mulvey.  While I have some faith in him as just transition commissioner, it appears that his appointment was a panic reaction by the Minister and the Department in that he was contacted by telephoned when the Minister got word that the two stations would be closing.  The Minister needs to provide more detail around the choreography of that appointment, including whether he had been planning it over a number of weeks because Mr. Mulvey was not consulted about the terms of reference.  It is important that we get more detail on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.649" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1341" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="20:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800071#ZZZ01000"><p>I have a couple of questions for the Minister.  On the 6% of the hedgerows and trees around the country that have not been accounted for in the emissions, will the Minister ensure it is included as it could bring emissions for agriculture down 8% to 10%?  Is the Minister willing to heed my proposal that in respect of holdings of 50 acres we would put in a shelter belt and the Government would incentivise farmers to do that work?  On the just transition, is the Minister willing to talk to the EU in regard to what was done in Shannon by Lemass years ago, namely, that the midlands area, including Galway, Roscommon and Knock Airport, would be tax incentivised areas such that new businesses could be created there?  My understanding is that other countries such as Spain were given that from Europe.</p>  <p>  It is critical that Mr. Mulvey is given the resources he needs.  I concur 100% with what has been said.  He needs the resources.  He is like a one-man band.  He is a good guy.  Let nobody say any different.  Is the Minister prepared to bring all county councils on board such that no one council is leading the posse and nobody else knows what is going on?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.650" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="20:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800071#ZZZ01100"><p>On the level of fines, they are not finally determined.  Basically, Ireland has two areas where we are likely to fall short.  In regard to the 16% renewable energy across all systems, not just electricity, we are likely to fall short and we will have to purchase statistical transfers.  The price at which they will be bought is not yet set or known.  We have to enter into discussions about them.</p> <p>Regarding the non-ETS  target, we have some accumulated credits that date back some considerable years.  The additional purchases are not that significant; the expected volume is of the order of ten to 15 million tonnes.  This will depend on the figures because they are cumulative targets in the years 2013 to 2020.  In the early years, we were below target and since the economic recovery, we have been ahead of target and these will only be known when we get to that point.  </p> <p> Detailed modelling work is going on in the Department on the NACP.  We have indicated to the EU that that work has to be completed before we provide it with the plan.  It is happy that we proceed in that way, and we will provide opportunities for people to input into it.</p> <p> The just transition commissioner is something that I worked on for a considerable period to develop a response, with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Pascal Donohoe, the details of which were contained in the budget.  There are four elements to what we are doing.  We are going to repurpose the PSO, so that money will come from the electricity system to fund enhanced restoration of Bord na M&oacute;na bogs.  We will also then have the just transition fund, which at this point has had &euro;11 million allocated to it this year.  We will also have money allocated for non-Bord na M&oacute;na bogs restoration, and we have &euro;20 million allocated for retrofitting.</p> <p> As the Deputy will be aware, a task force is in place in the midlands and we are working closely with it.  The terms of reference were decided by Government.  At that level we have an implementation group led by the Taoiseach's Department.  These are key players in helping us design this.  There is provision for support for Mr. Mulvey both in my own Department and indeed in the region.  The terms of reference have been fairly loose, in that he can come back with recommendations where we have left open an opportunity for him to shape the response.  His work will shape how we deliver the just transition across a range of areas.</p> <p> I am not an expert on how carbon inventories are calculated but it is certainly my understanding that there is not a count of the acreage of forest or of planting, and a credit attributed to such planting.  This is an aggregate credit, which I think from memory is 26.8 million tonnes, which we received for our accumulated forestry.  We will need to considerably step up our forestry coverage to maintain our calculated credits.  We need to improve on where we are.  It is not a question of counting things that are already there and thinking that we will get benefit from doing that.  We must show that we are improving from the existing base.  Deputy Fitzmaurice's idea of counting material that is already there will not give any benefit.  If we improve the carbon retention of our hedgerows or plant copses within pastureland, many measures can be taken to contribute to this.  The Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle, is probably more of an expert than I am in that area.</p> <p> The question of tax incentives has not been considered.  This is above the line.  Tax incentives have a bad reputation in Ireland because when they were given out, they proved very costly and did not have the same accountability or forensic design.  We are trying to design measures funded from the carbon fund and other sources that we believe are tailored rather than what has happened in the past where broad-based tax incentives were given that were retained beyond the purposefulness and not forensically examined.  Tax incentives do not draw support across the House generally.  </p> <p> We have achieved the inclusion of peat within the coal platform.  As part of the green deal, there is an increasing emphasis in Europe on developing just transition funds and, therefore, there is an opportunity for us to access additional funds.</p> <p> The regional enterprise strategy for the midlands focuses strongly on the transition to a low-carbon economy.   IDA, Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and all such bodies are building their offering  in respect of the regional strategy around projects like that.  They are all behind the strategy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.652" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="20:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800072#AAAA00200"><p>Even in the past six months, the understanding within the EU as to our level of ambition between 2030 and 2050 has changed in recognising that if we are to meet the Paris Agreement's targets, the overall ambition agreed three to four years ago is out of date.  I understand Denmark has just committed to a 70% reduction in emissions by 2030, believing that it will gain an economic advantage from that.  The country's officials do not quite know how they will achieve that objective.  In the recent UK election, the UK Labour Party and others said that they would decarbonise in ten years.  It is in that context I ask the Minister whether he still believes that the promise in the all-of-Government action plan for a 2% per annum reduction in the next decade will be sufficient.  It certainly will not be sufficient to meet the scientific advice but even within the EU context in the likelihood of an increased ambition in targets and an increased demand for greater effort-sharing, does the Minister believe that that 2% target will have to change?</p>  <p>  Second, a recent letter from the Climate Change Advisory Council raised doubt as to how methane is going to be counted in the process and the potential argument that the agriculture sector may not have to make as significant an effort if, for a range of complex reasons, methane is treated differently as a greenhouse gas.  Within the rule book of the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, process, it is highly complex as to how exactly different greenhouse gases are treated.  Given the advice from both the IPCC scientists who were here and our own scientists such as Peter Thorne, we cannot do what the Climate Change Advisory Council seems to be suggesting, which is to discount methane.  Does the Department or the Government have a position on that yet?  If not, how could they arrive at one? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.653" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="20:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800072#AAAA00300"><p>On the first question, there is no doubt that the Government, similar to other governments, has lifted its ambition.  When I came into office first, my target was to get us back on track.  We were failing dismally to achieve our target.  People may or may not attribute the hard work that we had to do to get all of the Departments to agree to targets that were set and that would deliver and turn that into solid projects in each of them..  I am not looking for credit, but there was a lot of work in the process.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt that the Deputy is correct.  The mood has changed.  Like most policymakers, I come from the tradition of examining what can be done and then drawing up targets based on a reasonable expectation of what the available policy tools will deliver.  That is changing and the mood is changing in the sense that people are saying that we have to get to net zero emissions by 2050 and we have to find the policies that will deliver that outcome.  If the tools we have that are tried and tested are not enough, we will have to think beyond them.  </p>  <p>  There is that shift of policy thinking, parameters or frameworks, or whatever we might like to call it.  That is a shift that was very evident even this year compared to last year in Katowice.  As the Deputy remarked, the Danes, do not know how they are going to get this done but they are making commitments without being able to say how they are going to get there.  That is a shift.  We have work through this with the EU, but it has also shifted its target from 40% to a minimum of 50% and perhaps up to 55% by 2030.  That represents a shift.</p> <p>It will have to embody that shift in a policy framework over the coming months by mid-year and we will have to respond to that because we share the need to lift the ambition.  It is a matter that we will have to work through.</p> <p> On the issue of biogenic methane, I detected a shift in the attitude of scientists towards land use.  There seemed to be a greater emphasis on the need to speed up what we do in conventional energy areas and land use seems to be greatly influenced by whether we can reduce climate temperatures.  Land use as a carbon store is very much influenced by global warming.  There is a balance to be struck in food production and food security, and how that is to be worked through.  I have read the advice of the Climate Change Advisory Council, although I get the impression that the Deputy does not agree with it.  The council spoke of a different range for biogenic methane from what would apply for other greenhouse gases.  We have not adopted a position on that, and the long-term strategy is out for consultation and will have to evolve.  We have committed to including a 2050 target in the legislation and will doubtless engage in the Chamber on the issue in due course.</p></speech>

I return to the policy statement on petroleum exploration and production activities as part of Ireland's transition to a low-carbon economy.  Such activities would call into question the Government's desire to consult on Ireland's national energy and climate action plan and pre-empt the energy security review to which the Government committed.  What the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, stated in the foreword was surprising.  How does the Government reconcile that with ecosystem protection, given what UCC and others have stated?  Did the Minister of State consult energy companies prior to drawing that conclusion and was it signed off at Cabinet level?  There has been little discussion or oversight of it.</p>  <p>  On the NECP, I seek the exact date on which the Government will publish the draft document.  It is important from the perspective of the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  There was little information in that regard prior to the committee meeting earlier and the Minister should clarify the date.</p>  <p>  Will the Government produce sectoral emission reduction pathways, and if so, when?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-18a.656" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="21:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121800073#BBBB00300"><p>The terms of reference of the security and sustainability review have not been finalised.  We have sought input from our agencies, such as EirGrid, in order that we can understand the concerns before setting the terms.  Contrary to what was stated earlier, it is in recognition of the concerns raised, such as in respect of LNG, that we want to ensure it will be assessed.  I have committed that we will not support an LNG project until we are content that the sustainability and security review has been dealt with.</p>  <p>  The petroleum review was published on foot of our decision to stop exploring for oil.  The Cabinet requested that the policy paper be put together in that context to make clear what sorts of licences could be issued.  It was endorsed by Cabinet and seeks to give clarity because we want gas to continue to be explored in our waters, just as we want offshore wind facilities to be developed in our waters, and the policy references both measures.</p>  <p>  I will have to revert to the Deputy with a date on the NECP, which is a work in progress.</p>  <p>  Emission reduction pathways for each sector are already set out in the climate plan.  The issue is that if there is enhanced ambition, such as to 2050, there will be more work to do.  We have committed that three five-year carbon budgets will be presented next year, which will then have to be disaggregated for each of the sectors.  There will be a hard and fast climate budget within a range, although it will not be dramatically different from what is in the plan.  It will be a similar type of model and the only difference will be that it will be enshrined in law.  I refer not to the individual ranges but to the five-year budget as a whole.</p></speech>

Will the Minister provide a facility for Deputies to talk to the people who do the number-crunching?  Everybody in Ireland talks about carbon and figures but no one understands how we determine the numbers.  The Minister stated in respect of forestry that we cannot add more than 26.8 million tonnes.  It is damnable that trees that have been growing since 1990 throughout the country have been left to one side because they cannot be counted.  Whoever does the number-crunching had better do it right.  Any public representative who is interested in the matter should be able to learn how it is done, to understand it better.  It has been written about in the media and everywhere else.  Everyone talks about it but does not know how the figure of 26 million tonnes was calculated.  Can that be facilitated by the Minister or his Department?  It might require compiling a list of people in the various sectors who we can contact in order that they will tell us how the figure has been determined.</p></speech>

Obviously, it is available to come before the committee to present its numbers.  The SEAI does the number-crunching for energy alone.  If we just want the energy side of things, as opposed to the wider piece, that is available from the SEAI.</p></speech>

It does the evaluation.  It calculates the emissions from agriculture that arise from methane, nitrogen, oxides, urea and so on.  It calculates the whole lot.  Teagasc has done an estimate of how we can start to reduce those emissions.</p>  <p>  The question of land use and forestry is much more complicated.  I am happy to make an official available to talk to Deputies.  As I understand it, in our inventories we do not have an accurate assessment of how land use is sequestering or releasing carbon.  The manner in which carbon is released depends on how land is ploughed and on how a lot of things are done.  We do not do a detailed inventory.  We do not track every acre of land to see what happened this year compared with last year.  We do not track how carbon is emitted depending on the way harvesting is done in a given year.  That is not done.  We do not count every tree and estimate the carbon sequestration that it might give.  We do not track the loss of carbon from the draining of bogs.  We do not do that level of inventory analysis.  It is very difficult to do.  The science is imperfect.</p>  <p>  As I understand it, a credit of 26.8 million tonnes of carbon was granted to Ireland in reference to our historic planting levels.  Part of that has to be earned over the next ten years.  I think approximately 4 million tonnes of the total of 26.8 million tonnes will have to be earned.  We will have to show that changes are being made and that we are delivering the credit.  We will have to make enough changes to justify the assignment of the credit to us.  My understanding is that the credit is not as accurate a science as the rest of the inventory.  I will be happy to get people to talk to the Deputy.</p></speech>
