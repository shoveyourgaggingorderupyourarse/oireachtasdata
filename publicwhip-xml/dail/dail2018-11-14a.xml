    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1228" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400003#A00500"><p>The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, requested the national directorate for fire and emergency management to convene and co-ordinate a task force to lead a reappraisal if our approach to fire safety in Ireland.  What is the status of the work of that task force?  The building defects and fire safety issues at Priory Hall and Longboat Quay have been well publicised.  Unfortunately, there are many more similar buildings around the country.  What plans does the Minister have to assist residents of multi-unit developments, in particular, and housing estates that do not meet fire safety standards and building regulations?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400003#A00600"><p>Primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the building regulations rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings.  As such, in general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, namely, the homeowner, the builder, the developer and-or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme.</p>  <p>  It is incumbent on the parties responsible for poor workmanship and-or the supply of defective materials to face up to their responsibilities and to take appropriate action to provide remedies for the affected homeowners.  In addition, when a building is constructed and occupied, statutory responsibility for safety is assigned by section 18(2) of the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003 to the person having control of the building.  The person having control is required to take reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire and to ensure the safety of persons in the event of fire.</p>  <p>  In multi-unit developments, the person having control is generally the owner management company.  Where apartment buildings that are defective from a fire safety perspective come to the attention of the local authority fire services, they work with management companies and other stakeholders to ensure that appropriate levels of fire safety are achieved to minimise the risk to life.</p>  <p>  In response to the many building failures that emerged in the last decade, my Department has been driving a comprehensive building control reform agenda.  The measures involved include the introduction of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014,  the establishment of a national building control management project and progressing primary legislation such as the Building Control (Construction Industry Register Ireland) Bill through the Houses.  The aim is to promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with the building regulations in the construction sector and this will continue to be the subject of focused attention in the months and years ahead.</p>  <p>  In regard to the fire safety task force, in the aftermath of Grenville in June 2017 and in recognition of the fears expressed by the fire safety services, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, under the direction of the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, the national directorate for fire and emergency management was asked to convene and co-ordinate a task force to lead a reappraisal of our approach to fire safety in Ireland.  The work of the task force has been completed and its findings are related in the Fire Safety in Ireland report.  The report acknowledges the importance of fire safety in apartment buildings.  The reply provided to me contains a detailed summary on the work of the task force, which I can provide to the Deputy.  In essence, it is estimated that up to 500,000 people live in approximately 200,000 apartments across the country.  From a fire safety perspective, the person having control of the apartment and the building-premises is the owner management company.  The key to life safety in all apartment buildings is a two-stage fire detection alarm system, together with an evacuation strategy and involving the residents in preventing nuisance alarms and knowing how to react in the event of fire alarms being activated.  There is ongoing work in this area.  We have asked the local authorities, as the local lead fire authorities, to engage directly with management companies.</p></speech>

As mentioned by him, approximately 500,000 people live in multi-unit developments.  These are the people at the coalface on this issue.  I am seeking an update on the implementation of the recommendations in the Fire Safety in Ireland report.  What is the mechanism by which the task force reports to the Department?  Do I take it from the Minister of State's response that this matter is the responsibility of the owner management companies and residents can sink or swim.  Speaking of sinking, the issue is that in many cases the sinking fund is insufficient to deal with building defects and fire safety issues.  If the bond holder, insurance company or builder does not return to fix defects, what are the residents to do?  Members of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government will be aware that this issue was raised directly at a meeting of the committee by the Apartment Owners' Network.  How often does the Department receive updates on this issue and does it have a handle on the scale of the problem in terms of building defects?  Will the Government examine mechanisms to assist in this area?  This is a ticking time bomb as many of the owner management companies are verging on insolvency and do not have the funds to carry out the works that are required.</p></speech>

The key recommendations of the task force were to have the registration of fire safety subcontractors and to outline the roles and responsibilities of building management companies, such as to review and maintain fire safety arrangements, keep a fire safety register and advise residents on what to do in the event of a fire and alarm.  All that work is very important.  Each local authority fire service should offer training to building management companies on key fire safety matters.  They should work with management companies through the process.  There is no recommendation for a full investigation of all properties as the number of defects identified was quite low.</p></speech>

The work is ongoing but the task force indicated clearly that management companies, owners of properties and resident associations need to deal with local authorities, which are the local building control authorities, to work through the issues.  We are very clear where the responsibility lies.  We understand and know there are issues around sinking funds, costs and so on and that work is ongoing.  The responsibility lies with owners and managers of these properties, including the management companies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1228" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400004#B00400"><p>It is good to know that the Department is trying to quantify the issues, as the Minister of State mentioned.  He said the level of defects that has come back is quite low.  That surprises me to some degree but I suppose it really depends on how seriously one takes the existing defects.  The primary issue is fire safety and that is where we have seen the most publicised incidence of people having to be evacuated from apartment blocks and multi-unit developments.  There are others out there and I know both the Minister and Minister of State are aware of them, with owner management companies and owners trying to work through those issues.  Nobody is working to abrogate those responsibilities but they are seeking support.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State said implementation is ongoing but has a timeline been set for the implementation of the recommendations?  Does he see this as an ongoing process?  Will we get to a stage where we would establish in the area of owner management companies a proper regulator?  This would amount to a go-to office for owner management companies that might be able to collate this information.  It surprises me somewhat that the level of defects found so far seems to be quite small, according to the response.  I do not know the percentage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400004#B00500"><p>The work is ongoing and no final decision has been made as to whether a regulator is required.  We are clear that the procedures put in place by the 2014 Act will certainly ensure this will not be an issue in future.  We are confident of this and we must ensure we can continuously enforce the procedures through local authorities as the lead building control authorities.</p>  <p>  The first interim review was in June and the work is ongoing.  It is something on which we will engage directly with each local authority and the management companies.  We are very clear where the responsibility lies.  It is with the individual owners, management companies and people who built these properties.  It is an area of ongoing work and I am conscious that the committee has done much work on this as well that feeds into some of the work we are doing through legislation.  It will be an ongoing conversation as we work through this.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400004#B00800"><p>As the Minister knows, the media widely reported two deaths this month of individuals who were accessing homelessness services and had a history of sleeping rough.  We do not know the full details of the deaths and it would be wrong for any of us in the House to try to politicise it.  Is this a matter of concern?  Does the Minister feel there might be gaps in our emergency response to rough sleeping that could be looked at, with additional provision in trying to reduce the possibility of further deaths?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400004#B00900"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  The death of any person sleeping rough on our streets is a tragedy and our sympathies go to the families who have lost loved ones in this way most recently and over the past number of years as each death occurred.</p>  <p>  Supporting individuals and families experiencing homelessness is an absolute priority for this Government.  Budget 2019 reflects this commitment by allocating an additional &euro;30 million for the provision of homelessness services in 2019.  This will increase the total budget available to local authorities to &euro;146 million, a 26% increase on the provision for 2018.  Budget 2019 also provides for an additional &euro;60 million in capital funding for the provision of emergency accommodation, which will deliver further emergency facilities for single adults and additional family hubs to support families experiencing homelessness.</p>  <p>  Providing additional accommodation for rough sleepers is essential.  In September, I wrote to the chief executives of the four Dublin local authorities requesting the delivery of additional emergency accommodation across the Dublin region.  A plan submitted to me subsequently by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive will deliver over 200 new permanent beds before the end of the year.  Delivery of these additional beds is already under way and all will be in place within the next three to four weeks.  That will be in plenty of time for the cold weather spells.  We must also recognise that many individuals experiencing homelessness require other supports to assist them to exit homelessness into an independent tenancy.  The implementation plan for Housing First, published in September, will deliver permanent housing solutions for rough sleepers and long-term users of emergency accommodation.  Building on the success of the 220 tenancies already established, the plan contains targets for each local authority, with an overall national target of 660 additional tenancies to be delivered by 2021.  As we move into winter, I have asked all local authorities to ensure that cold weather arrangements are in place for rough sleepers.  These arrangements have already been activated in the context of recent cold weather and additional outreach teams are in place to ensure our most vulnerable citizens are being engaged with and supported.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400004#B01000"><p>I thank the Minister for his response.  As he knows, it is four years since the tragic death of Mr. Jonathan Corry, a young rough sleeper, on the streets just outside this building.  What became clear from that case is that even when beds are available in the emergency accommodation system on a given night, and even when local authority or voluntary sector staff engage with rough sleepers, there can still be many significant barriers to people feeling comfortable, safe and secure in emergency accommodation.  It is particularly the case for people with complex mental health needs and specifically for those who may have gone through residential detoxification and are genuinely scared to go into dormitory-style hostels because of a fear of relapse.</p>  <p>  I am not disputing the additional spending on emergency accommodation or the availability of beds but I am highlighting a more particular problem.  There is a cohort of people with very complex needs, as the Minister mentioned.  There is emergency accommodation available in Dublin city, for example, and it does not provide them with safe, secure and appropriate emergency accommodation.  There are also people, like the young woman who died tragically in Bray earlier this month, living in a part of the country with no emergency accommodation whatever.  I am asking the Minister to consider the specific issue and see if there is a way of ensuring these people have safe, secure and appropriate emergency accommodation, which may not be available currently in Dublin and certainly is not available in other parts of the country.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400004#B01100"><p>I thank the Deputy for his question.  He pointed to a particular case from four years ago that tells us we have been living with this crisis, particularly with individuals sleeping rough and experiencing homelessness, for a number of years.  It is why we have people like Fr. Peter McVerry, Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy and Ms Alice Leahy doing such tremendous work for too many years.  There is a complexity around this and even when beds are available or when someone might even own a property, people might not be able to deal with all the complexities, even when we include all the supports.  We will keep on trying but it will not always be enough.  With regard to the facilities and hostels in Dublin in particular, we are rolling out new provisions and we are even replacing old facilities.  There is a new facility on St. Stephen's Green run by the Peter McVerry Trust that will take over from where we lost other beds in the system.  I visit a number of these facilities if I have the opportunity and the standards are excellent in those I have visited.  We have spot checks and we are working with partners on quality standards in emergency accommodation.  I know I tend to focus on Dublin but that is because the challenge is very great in Dublin, as we know.  This is demand-led where our local authority needs support and resourcing, and it gets them.  We ensure we move money in the Department around so those supports are provided where necessary.  Where a local authority feels there is a gap, we will help it plug the gap.  That is what the extra money is for.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the study will stop at approximately 2015 so we will not get more recent data.  She said there were not enough step-down beds for rough sleepers, for example, particularly people who went through addiction treatment in the city.  We also know that while some of the facilities mentioned are state of the art, an individual may have to go through several weeks, months or sometimes years of night to night dormitory-style accommodation before he or she can access those facilities.  For people with complex mental health needs or addiction issues, there is not appropriate supported temporary accommodation available straight away.</p><p>All I am asking the Minister to do, in particular in light of the study by the DRHE, is to examine this again to ensure, for example, that no one refuses dormitory-style accommodation because they believe it to be unsafe, insecure or inappropriate or because of the lack of available step-down or temporary accommodation, especially accommodation provided for people with mental health issues.</p></speech>

That morning I spoke to the people who had stayed there the previous night about their experiences.  Not everyone had a positive experience that night even though they were in a fantastic facility that is doing everything it can.  I am aware of the additional supports that we need to put in place.</p>  <p>  One of the first meetings I had when I came to this job was to discuss the need for more six-month beds.  We are funding those now with our partner organisations and it is important to do that.</p>  <p>  The Housing First model is key.  The Deputy referred to people having to earn their position.  We have to break that thinking and that is what Housing First does.  It is not about earning a right to accommodation.  It is about getting people into safe secure homes and then wrapping supports around them.  Bob Jordan is leading on this with the national plan.  The Deputy knows Mr. Jordan and the work he does.  He will do a fantastic job.  Of the 220 tenancies that have been created, between 80% and 90% have been successful.  This means the vast majority have not fallen back into homelessness.  They have not found themselves back in the cycle they may have been in for several years.  Such is the importance of bringing in models from abroad.

In that period we have seen an 11% reduction in staff.  Average completion time of applications has moved from 15 weeks to 17 weeks.

Where the board does not consider it possible or appropriate to reach a decision within 18 weeks, for example, because of the particular complexities of a case or the requirement to hold an oral hearing, it will inform the parties of the reasons for this and will indicate when it intends to make its decision.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged that there has been a reduction in the board's compliance rate with the statutory objective period during the past year due to a number of factors, including a significant increase in the number of cases it has received.  At the end of October of this year, the compliance rate for normal planning appeals stood at 38% while the rate stood at 43.5% for all planning cases.  A range of measures have been taken to address this, including the appointment of additional board members.  I am satisfied, taking account of the increased Exchequer grant of &euro;18.5 million for the board in 2019, which represents a 7% increase on this year, that the measures involved will enable the board to significantly improve its compliance rate.  The number of cases decided by the board in the ten months to end October 2018 was up 26% on the corresponding period in 2017 and the board's output is now approximately 250 cases per month.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that for large housing developments new streamlined arrangements have been introduced to enable planning applications for strategic housing developments to be made directly to the board.  At the end of September of this year, a total of 39 such applications had been made and the board had issued decisions in 29 cases, all of which were made within the prescribed 16-week timeframe, thus delivering a 100% compliance rate in these cases.  In addition, planning appeals in respect of housing developments of 30 units or more are prioritised.</p>  <p>  The board currently has a complement of 11 members, including a new chairperson, who took up duty on 30 October 2018, and an additional board member, who was engaged in June 2018, in addition to the normal complement of ten members.  The board also employs more than 150 staff, including the ten additional dedicated staff engaged in 2017 to support the strategic housing division, which has a 100% compliance rate.  My Department will continue to liaise closely with the board to ensure it has appropriate resources to support it in the performance of its functions.</p></speech>

I welcome the additional resources allocated to the board, but the figures would be even lower if the requests for additional or further information in some way masked the figures of completion.  Anecdotal evidence from throughout the country is that large schemes have been 18 months and longer with An Bord Plean&aacute;la while going through a series of requests for additional information.  In some instances, that is perfectly correct but we have seen an increase in requests for further information.  When does the Minister believe that we will be able to get back within the targets?  Does the Minister have a target date to get back within the statutory timeframe for planning decisions?  The Minister mentioned the 39 large housing developments that have been submitted directly to the board.  He will be aware of the volume of work that goes into pre-planning for these applications and the discussions with the board in advance of the applications being lodged.  Are we looking for An Bord Plean&aacute;la to do too much without sufficient resources?  The figures certainly bear that out.</p></speech>

The board has, within its statutory timeline and within the 100% compliance rate to which I referred, approved 5,400 homes and 4,400 student spaces.  Currently, a further 3,000 homes are in hand for decision.  The board will do that work within the timelines that have been given.</p>  <p>  A new chairperson has been appointed to the board.  He has come from the Department and is fully aware of the challenges we face in planning in general because he was involved in Project Ireland 2040 and more specifically in housing because of the work he has done in that area.</p>  <p>  An additional board member was appointed this year to help deal with the specific difficulties that we face in housing.  Currently, I am considering appointing another board member.  Another change I am considering involves reducing the quorum necessary for decisions to be made on smaller cases.  We do not need to have the same number of members adjudicating on smaller cases compared to larger cases, which could involve a significant number of homes.  Having said that, if an application involves more than 30 homes, it will get special attention anyway.</p>  <p>  I referred to the dedicated unit of ten people.  The unit is working with two board members and is producing results when it comes to housing.  Of course, I have responsibility for more than housing and, therefore, I am working with the new chairperson and the board to drive up compliance rates generally across the board.</p></speech>

Has the board or the new chairperson set a target completion rate within the statutory timeframe for 2019?  While the Minister's response suggests there appears to have been some recent improvement, we need to see vast improvement and delivery.  Has the board or the chairperson set a revised completion rate within the statutory timeframe for 2019?</p></speech>

This reflects what is happening in the wider economy.  As a result, hundreds more cases are being decided every month than in previous periods.  I welcome the support of the Deputy for some of the changes I am considering to help the board better manage its resources.</p>  <p>  The new chairperson took up his position 14 days ago, although he has been working with An Bord Plean&aacute;la for several years on account of his role in the Department.  He has an idea of exactly what he wants to do.  He is independent of the Department and the board is independent of me.  No doubt, he has taken up the task.  I have spoken to him informally since his appointment but in my first official engagement with him as chairperson of the board, we will discuss these issues.</p></speech>

The national student accommodation strategy was subsequently launched in July 2017 by the Minister for Education and Skills.  The strategy sets a target to facilitate 4,000 students in availing of digs accommodation by the end of 2019, thereby freeing up accommodation in the traditional rental sector.  Joint funding of &euro;160,000 for 2017 and 2018 has been committed to the Union of Students in Ireland by the Department of Education and Skills and my Department to finance a full-time student housing officer, the #homesforstudy campaign and training for student accommodation officers.  An additional provision has been made for the UCD Students' Union, which is outside the USI.  The campaign involved leaflets being delivered to homeowners in targeted locations throughout the country highlighting the potential to earn up to &euro;14,000 tax free under the rent-a-room scheme.</p>  <p>  Traditionally, students residing in digs or family homes benefit from the goodwill that exists to ensure both students and homeowners are happy with the arrangement.  It is possible for the arrangements to be formalised by way of a licence between the parties, but this is a matter of choice for the parties themselves to agree on.</p>  <p>  I do not consider that there is a need for a legal regulatory framework in this area.</p><p>Digs accommodation is an integral housing solution for students as well as an important source of revenue and, in some circumstances, social interaction for homeowners.  Any attempt at regulating "digs" is highly likely to impact negatively on the supply of this traditional and important source of student accommodation.</p></speech>

Has he asked USI whether it feels there is a need for a legal framework because, increasingly, I hear about issues and problems that are arising in the digs sector?  One in ten students lives in digs.  This is not surprising given the fact that the major student accommodation providers in city centres are charging more than &euro;1,000 per month.  Students in digs can be evicted at a moment's notice, subjected to rent hikes at short notice with no rent caps applying and have no right to appeal to the RTB if the deposit is not returned to them.  There are forms of exploitation in some digs arrangements such as students being asked to mow the lawn, collect the groceries or mind children, all of which are over and above the agreed rent, so there is a need for a regulatory framework and I would like to comment on the examples I have given.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy English, informs me that he does not recall it being raised with him during his meetings with USI.  If one in ten students currently lives in student digs, we want to increase that number.  We want to reach that target of 4,000 by the end of 2019 because it is a much-needed source of accommodation.  Traditionally, it is a cheaper source of accommodation than some of the types of accommodation being built at the moment - the purpose-built student accommodation.  We are working on possible text for inclusion as an amendment to see if we can apply rent caps to purpose-built student accommodation similar to those that apply in the rental sector today but the informality of digs work for both sides in many cases.  It is not just from a financial point of view; it is also from a social point of view.  Anything that might undermine that supply of accommodation could be much more detrimental to students.  Less student accommodation will cause further pressure in terms of prices for student accommodation and cause further problems for students who cannot source any accommodation so it will not solve the problem we have at the moment, which involves providing more student spaces.  This is happening and we know this because of the numbers that are being delivered.  A total of 5,500 have been delivered under the new strategy launched in 2016 and 4,800 are under construction.  We need these as well as more digs.</p></speech>

The last census showed that 8% of homeless persons in the State were students, which is incredible.</p>  <p>  The Minister said that he has not been asked to regulate it by either the students union in UCD or USI so I will turn that question on its head.  If they ask for some form of regulation, is it something the Minister would be prepared to comply with or give very serious consideration to?</p></speech>

We could bring in something that could as an unintended consequence undermine the supply of those types of homes completely.  To give tenancy rights to a student who might only live in the home for a number of months of the year and all of a sudden open them to the rights under the Residential Tenancies Act whereby they could be there for up to six years without serving things like a notice to quit and giving the formal periods involved in that could mean that a lot of people, for example, elderly people, who have students staying in their accommodation might not even think of that because for their own safety and security, they would want the ability to evict a student if the relationship between that person and the student, who is living in that person's home, has broken down.  We must be careful in respect of bringing in something that might end up undermining supply in the first place even though the measure is intended as a protection.  If something is brought to me for consideration, I will consider it as Minister with responsibility for this area and consult with the Minister for Education and Skills.</p></speech>

A total of 35,000 people are living in such accommodation such as hubs, hotels and guesthouses.  There are also people sleeping in their cars or trying to do so as the weather begins to turn.

My Department provides the policy and legislative instruments along with the financial supports, schemes and resources necessary for local authorities to provide the relevant housing services in their areas.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, social housing delivery targets have been set and published for all local authorities for 2018.  With regard to the four Dublin local authorities, the overall target for 2018 is for the delivery of some 10,423 housing supports, including 2,033 build homes, 377 acquisitions and 790 leased homes as well as 7,223 supports through HAP and RAS units.  Of this target, at the end of the second quarter, a total of 3,462 housing supports had been provided to households across Dublin.  This does not include households accommodated through routine re-lettings by the councils, which are not supported by  funding from my Department.</p>  <p>  HAP continues to work as a very responsive and immediate scheme delivering much-needed housing solutions for families and individuals nationwide, particularly in the Dublin region.  Indeed, the number of new HAP tenancies set up across the four Dublin local authorities at the end of the second quarter of this year was 2,482.</p>  <p>  My Department engages with all local authorities on a regular basis regarding the delivery of social housing.  This includes structured quarterly meetings to review progress and in the case of the four Dublin local authorities, monthly meetings are held.  I am confident that the actions, targets and resources available to all local authorities, including the four Dublin local authorities, under Rebuilding Ireland provide a strong platform for meeting our challenges in the housing sector and I am satisfied that overall delivery of the plan remains firmly on track.</p></speech>

Like me, the Minister is a former city councillor.  I am an avid reader of the housing and chief executive reports for Dublin city and Fingal.  Does the Minister not find those reports very frustrating and depressing?  I am looking at the Dublin city housing report for November.  From 2015 to 2017, a grand total of 300 houses were delivered on the construction side with almost no Part V houses.  The projections for 2018 to 2021 are fairly dismal against the 8,000 or 9,000 people on the housing list in Dublin Bay North.  The Minister's emphasis is on HAP and temporary and insecure accommodation.  If I look at the Fingal county manager's report for October, and I know he was with the Taoiseach yesterday, I can see that his delivery programme in social housing construction is poor.  A total of 133 units have been delivered to date while total construction comes to 745.  There is mention of tender stage and pre-planning approval.  Is this not desperately frustrating for the thousands on the housing list?  A total of 68% of all homeless people in this country are in the Dublin region.  Does the Minister not have a responsibility to do something about delivery?</p></speech>

This is why I meet with local authorities and why we provided additional money to them for next year to provide more homes.  A total of 10,000 more units will come into the stock of social housing next year because of commitments we made in the budget for next year.  The largest amount of money an Irish Government has ever spent in a single year on housing will be spent next year.  This is a very important commitment.  Delivery is key.  I was in Fingal recently and we went through delivery and what Fingal County Council is going to achieve.  My Department and I recently met with the other local authorities to talk about delivery and not just for people in emergency accommodation but the wider delivery targets.</p><p>If we look at the different local authorities, we can see that in that figure of just over 10,000, Dublin City Council will deliver over 1,000 homes on the build side, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council about 180, Fingal County Council more than 400 and South Dublin County Council just under 400.  That is on the build side alone.  In terms of acquisitions and leasing of real homes which people will move into and have security in, these will be added to by more than 1,000.</p> <p> Yes, we have to use HAP and the private rental sector because if we did not, those people would be out on the streets.  Until we have more homes built, we will use HAP to support them.  However, in 2020 and 2021 we will be supporting more people into new homes in the stock of social housing than we will be supporting through HAP in the private rental market.  That commitment continues through Project Ireland 2040 out to 2027.</p></speech>

When he meets managers, and I know he was in Fingal recently, he will be asked whether there are steps he can take in regard to the rigmarole of tendering procedures.  For example, the Dublin City Council chief executive's report for November refers to two major sites in my constituency, at Oscar Traynor Road and at Belmayne.  All these sites seem to be in a desperate, turgid, agonisingly slow pipeline.  We have been told about pipeline after pipeline.  The Minister is saying the same thing down to 2021.  People cannot live in a pipeline.  We need an output of houses coming on stream but it is simply not happening.  Yesterday, <i>The Irish Times</i>said the Minister's housing policy is failing.  What has happened with rents is a recipe for disaster because the Minister is not prepared to introduce a rent freeze.  There is real suffering here.  I know the Minister is aware of it but he needs a sense of urgency.  He needs to come in here and introduce some emergency powers.  There is no other way.</p></speech>

Of course, I am frustrated.  Everyone who is involved in trying to solve this problem at the moment is frustrated.  We wish we could build houses more quickly.  However, there are things we have done to fast-track that process, such as the fast-track planning process, an emergency response that has seen thousands of homes get planning permission in a much shorter timeline.  There are other responses, such as the new procurement framework, given we cannot get around procurement law because it is there to protect the public interest.</p></speech>

Why?  It is because we cannot solve this overnight and it requires time.  However, for the last two years we have been changing planning and procurement processes and we have been hiring more staff.  As a result of the work that has gone in over the last two years, the supply of new homes is ramping up dramatically.  That said, until we have those new homes, we will put in extra protections for renters, as we will with the Bill that is being brought forward and the regulations on short-term lettings.  Of course, we will increase funding and support and services for those who are most vulnerable - people sleeping rough on our streets and families in emergency accommodation.  That is what we did with the budget.  That is where the money goes.</p></speech>

A steering group was recently announced and the Minister of State, Deputy English, was one of the two Ministers of State who announced it.  I am looking for more information because this is an issue I have been raising in other areas, particularly with the other Department involved.  I am trying to get practical information on how to contribute to the work of the steering group.</p></reply>

The Parteen area of the Shannon is designated as a heavily modified water body under the water framework directive and it is incumbent on us to apply enhancement measures, where practicable, to improve the ecological status and potential of the river.</p>  <p>  My Department is undertaking a national analysis of barriers to fish movement through Inland Fisheries Ireland and I intend that this will form the basis of a future prioritised restoration programme.  When the steering group makes recommendations regarding a fish passage improvement project for the Shannon, it will serve as an ideal pilot to advance this future restoration programme and the project will have important economic co-benefits for communities along the Shannon.</p>  <p>  The steering group brings together all parties with a statutory remit in the area, as well as the Shannon Fishery Partnership, and it will issue its recommendations not later than April 2020.  At its inaugural meeting a fortnight ago, the group identified outreach as a key issue and, recognising the importance of securing external inputs into its deliberations, has undertaken to put in place an appropriate mechanism in this regard as one of its first actions.  I expect further information on this matter will be made available by the steering group shortly.</p>  <p>  As I said, I attended the launch of the steering group, which is made up of a core group and a consultation group.  The core group comprises the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, ESB, Inland Fisheries Ireland and Irish Water, and the consultative group around that includes the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Office of Public Works, the Shannon Fisheries Partnership and Waterways Ireland.  Everyone around that table is very interested in ensuring we get a solution.  They will be very happy to engage at the appropriate time with the public and certainly with the Deputy.  I will send all the information I have to her and will put her in touch with the relevant people.  We want to bring forward new solutions based on some new technologies that are out there.</p></speech>

He said various statutory stakeholders would be involved but the people I really want involved are the people involved in fishing.  I have seen a proposal from the Kingfisher Angling club in Castleconnell, County Limerick.  It was once renowned as an area for fishing but the stocks have reduced significantly, as they have in other parts, all the way up the Shannon.  I grew up beside the headrace and I know the structure of Ardnacrusha and the fact the salmon have a problem getting up by the headrace.  However, a man called Paddy Guerin has developed a simple plan to divert the salmon away from Ardnacrusha up the old river basin, that is, up the river instead of up the tailrace and the headrace, which are part of the Ardnacrusha structure.  I want to make sure the people presenting this plan, which is based on experience and which is supported by the Federation of Irish Salmon and Sea Trout Anglers, can get a proper hearing.  They feel the so-called experts are sometimes listened to more than the people who actually experience the river.  I want to get information that this plan can be presented and will be taken seriously.</p></speech>

We had a similar conversation at the meeting at Ardnacrusha with a view to making sure we look at any and all solutions, both the ones brought forward by engineers from all over the world and the local suggestions.  The steering group has 18 months of work ahead of it to look at all the different ideas and different solutions, but also to try to take advantage of any technical, scientific and engineering solutions that might have been brought forward over the years, as well as to engage with the experts.  We have also tried to bring an independent voice to this by bringing in experts from abroad to work with us.  The group will be led by our Department.  We are cognisant of the importance of public engagement as part of this deliberative process.  There will be a mechanism to engage with the public and to look at local suggestions.</p>  <p>  To be clear, it is not one suggestion that is being looked at.  It is a group to look at suggestions and to bring forward a proposal at the end of the process.  Naturally, it has to be based on evidence and on something that can work, not just a gut feeling.  However, if there is a possibility of doing something, we will do it.  When the group brings forward solutions to the Department, we will certainly be in a position to fund that and to give it the backing that is required.  At that stage, it will also need to go through a proper planning process.  I will give the Deputy the details of the local consultation process, which is very important.  We all want to achieve the result, which is increased salmon stocks.</p></speech>

I want to reiterate that, from the statistics I have been given, &euro;1 billion of income and 12,000 jobs come directly from angling.  I want to stress again that this is vital for anglers, both those in Ireland and those who come to Ireland through the tourism industry.  We need to get this right.  There are simple solutions that I have been presented with and that make sense to me.  I ask that they are taken seriously.</p></speech>

It is a commitment the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, gave when he launched the river basin plan in April of this year because it is an important area of work, for all the reasons the Deputy has outlined.  I again commend all the stakeholders for coming together around the table.  It is very clear to me there is a good working relationship.  ESB is a key player on this and has been very proactive in regard to the conservation of fish species over the years and has tried many different mitigation measures.  It is certainly interested in and committed to bringing forward new solutions.  Everyone around that table is committed.  I believe the group covers all the stakeholders who should be there but if we find any are missing, we will take the chance to engage them.  This is a proactive committee and stakeholder group that is trying to find a solution.  It is not to block out anybody or to turn up our noses at any suggestion.  It is to help solve the problem, which is what we are committed to doing.</p></speech>

Statutory responsibility for the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities.</p>  <p>  In the Dublin region, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive provides a shared service on behalf of the four authorities in the Dublin region, including on behalf of Fingal County Council.  The funding provided to the Dublin region for homeless services has increased significantly in recent years, from &euro;68.6 million in 2016 to &euro;83.6 million in 2017.  The latter amount is likely to be exceeded this year.</p>  <p>  While published monthly reports identify the number of persons utilising State-funded emergency accommodation at regional and county level, details on persons accessing services in a specific local authority area are not available in my Department.  The monthly report for September showed that there were 3,940 adults and 2,869 associated dependants accessing homeless services across the Dublin region.  In 2018, Fingal alone has a target to support over 1,630 households through build, acquisition and leasing programmes and through the HAP and rental accommodation schemes.</p>  <p>  Homelessness is most acute in the Dublin region.  In September, I wrote to the chief executives of the four Dublin local authorities about additional actions that are required, including increased levels of emergency accommodation for both singles and families and the greater prevention work that is needed.  I met subsequently each of the chief executives, including the chief executive of Fingal County Council, and my Department is continuing to engage with the Dublin local authorities to ensure every effort continues to be made across all the relevant agencies to address homelessness in Dublin.  In that context, while considerable progress was made earlier this year in addressing rough sleeping, with the numbers recorded in Dublin falling significantly to 110, a further 200 additional emergency beds are being provided by the end of the year to ensure that there is sufficient capacity in the system to meet any needs arising.</p></speech>

We have had eight years of Fine Gael-led Governments and nobody is suggesting that the issue could be resolved overnight.  Significant numbers of people are entering homelessness in Fingal and ending up in emergency accommodation.  In my own experience, which is why I tabled this question, there has been a spike in women presenting as homeless due to domestic violence.  I say this because they are appearing and presenting at the clinics that I hold and in my office.  They are falling through the cracks.  They are not being counted as part of the homeless figures but they have no homes.  They have no stable accommodation in which to live with their children.  If that does not constitute homelessness, I do not know what does.  Some are in emergency accommodation.  They have been given HAP but cannot find places to live.  They are often accommodated far from their home places, which presents a particular difficult for their children.  The travel distance that they have to undertake causes a problem with the attendance of their kids at school.  Their right to education is being undermined by the lack of housing.  What supports are in place at local authority level to help people who have HAP but cannot find somewhere to live?  What, if anything, is being done to make sure that people who are from Fingal are accommodated in Fingal?</p></speech>

If we look for a quick fix, we will get a quick break and we do not want that.  We want to make sure that when we provide supports for people to get housing that they will not lose it in the future and that as we build thousands of extra homes, that will not stop if there is a future shock in the economy.  The Deputy talks about us being in government for eight years but house prices were still falling in 2012.  We emerged from the bailout in 2014 and people thought we would need to avail of a second.  Since then, we have focused on some of the low-hanging fruit such as council vacancies and voids.  We have brought thousands of these back into use and that has been very important.  We have to give every care that we can.  Fingal and the other Dublin local authorities have had to do and are doing a lot of work to make sure that families and individuals who find themselves in this crisis get the supports that they need.</p>  <p>  Over the past three months, we have seen the number of presentations in Dublin decrease and we saw 44 families present in Fingal in September.  Some 27 families were prevented from entering emergency accommodation because of the work the local authority did.  Some 17 families unfortunately entered emergency accommodation but 11 families exited it.  That speaks to the amount of work that the local authority in Fingal is doing.  The net increase in September was six families.  We want no increase but for the numbers to go down continually.  Until more houses are built, we will have to continue to put in place supports such as HAP.  The additional supports for someone in receipt of HAP are the HAP uplift of 20% if necessary or the homeless HAP uplift of 50% if necessary.  We also have placefinders in place to help people source accommodation and those are doing one of two things.  They go into hotels to help people out of hotels or when people present, they go out with them to prevent them from having to enter emergency accommodation in the first instance.  Fingal needs extra resources and I have told the council it can have those extra resources.  The rent and deposit will be covered too to make sure there are no unnecessary delays in getting people into secure, safe accommodation.</p></speech>

It is a crisis created by Government policy and he cannot put himself at a remove from the actions of his Government and their results.  There is council land in areas such as Donabate, Castleland and Hacketstown.  We hear that the council wants to allocate some 60% of this for the private market.  That cannot be allowed to happen.  House prices are spiralling out of control.  They are getting further away from the people who need them.  What supports are in place to ensure that people who have HAP get somewhere to live?  How is that being deployed for people in Fingal?  Is any effort being made to ensure that the people who live in Fingal will be accommodated in Fingal and will the Minister comment on the impact this has on the lives of children who are missing school because their mother, in many instances - a mother presented to me - is fleeing from domestic violence?  Why are these people not counted in the Minister's figures?  They are homeless with no stable accommodation and their lives are in crisis.</p></speech>

I am responsible for working with local authorities, our partners in the NGO sector and all stakeholders to put in place appropriate supports and solutions for those who need them.  This crisis is complex.  It stems from a number of issues.  The supply crisis stems from the fact that our housing sector exploded in the late 2000s and would have brought down the economy too.  The crisis that people are experiencing in their lives is because in some instances there are not enough homes and in some instances landlords, which the Deputy's party continues to attack, are leaving the market.  That leads to a notice of termination and housing insecurity for them.  There are other crises from family breakdowns.  Some families present because of a breakdown in family relations.</p>  <p>  This is a complex issue.  That is why we work with partner organisations such as the Peter McVerry Trust, Simon Communities Ireland, St. Vincent de Paul and Focus, because they are the experts.  We provide funding to them from the taxpayer and work with them, with the local authorities, to put in place relevant supports.  I outlined the relevant HAP supports, including the HAP placefinder, payment of the deposit, payment of the rent and HAP uplift.  We have a responsibility as a Government to provide housing for everyone and every local authority is responsible for its own placements, including who it is placing into the stock of social housing that is in increasing in its own local authority area.  I have met too many children in family hubs and coming out of hotels and I have met their parents and spoken with them about the difficulties we are experiencing.  We know a family in a family hub will spend less time there than in a hotel.  On average, it is less than six months before we get them into a secure, safe and sustainable home.  That is what our policies try to achieve.</p></speech>

In 2019, the Government will provide over &euro;2.4 billion for housing.  All local authorities are encouraged to bring forward viable and appropriate development proposals that can be funded through the range of schemes and programmes which have been put in place.</p>  <p>  The Department, the Minister and I are in regular contact with the local authority in County Louth regarding the accelerated delivery of social, affordable and private housing.  On social housing delivery under the Government's Rebuilding Ireland action plan, 194 homes have been completed and 740 further homes are currently at various stages of progress in the social housing construction programme across Louth, which is being added to on an ongoing  basis.  Furthermore, a site at Mount Avenue, Dundalk, is approved under the local infrastructure housing activation fund for funding of over &euro;3.3 million for an access road which will support 200 homes initially and potentially up to 1,200 on associated wider lands.</p><p> In budget 2019, under the serviced sites fund, SSF, the Government is providing &euro;310 million to enable the provision of infrastructure on council lands in order to facilitate affordable housing.  The first call issued to local authorities, including Louth County Council, in June.  While Louth did not make an application, further calls will be made and the council will have further opportunities to submit applications.  My Department also hosted an affordable housing workshop for local authorities last week at which site development and affordable housing were discussed.  Further bilateral engagement between local authorities and my Department will now follow, with a view to progressing further social and affordable housing projects on council lands.</p> <p> I wish to be very clear, as far as we are concerned as Ministers, we want more progress.  I have met officials from Louth County Council.  I have also met its housing team and the county manager.  I have asked them to put in place a pipeline of projects to increase the number of houses it will provide in the coming years.  We are committed to that as well.  The council has a landbank, which means it has enough land.  It has more than 68 ha and it could bring forward proposals for up to 1,700 houses.  The Minister made the point earlier that we want to make sure local authorities bring forward proposals not just for social housing but also for affordable housing and also to work with the private sector as well.</p></speech>

It is the same old spiel every time.  The reply referred to the 50 acres of council-owned land that are lying barren of houses.  A speaker earlier referred to the fact that the Government is eight years in government.  Is the Minister of State aware that Louth County Council has been paying millions out of its budget every year in interest on the landbanks?  Is he also aware that the council has consistently asked the Department for funding for the roll-out of social and affordable housing?  What is the point in having landbanks or the Minister collating the location of landbanks if after eight years funding has not been released?  One could build upwards of 800 houses on those landbanks if the political will was there.  However, the reality is the political will is not there and the Government does not believe in social housing.  The Minister talked about the Land Development Agency.  That is the biggest farce he ever came up with, out of all the spiel he has given in the midst of the housing emergency.  It is an insult.</p>  <p>  There is one particular family of four or five sharing one room in emergency accommodation and they have been there for months.</p></speech>

There are 68 ha of land, not 50 acres, available to the local authority in Louth to develop housing.  That land could accommodate 1,700 houses.  I say it again for the record, we are very clear that funding is available to develop more schemes on lands owned by Louth County Council.  I cannot make it any clearer than that.  We have engaged with the council and I have met with officials so I am aware that the council is paying interest on debts associated with the purchase of land.  I made it very clear to the council that the best way to solve that problem is to bring forward proposals to develop the land.  The most recent opportunity was under the SSF but Louth County Council did not make an application in that regard.  I wish to be very clear.  A second call will be issued to local authorities very soon and we will work with the council to bring forward proposals under the fund.  We want the landbank to be developed.  We also made it very clear a number of months ago that we will fund some feasibility works on all the sites to enable the council to bring forward proposals.  We want the lands to be developed.  That is black and white.</p></speech>

People in Drogheda and Dundalk and elsewhere in County Louth have broken heating systems but the council cannot send anyone to fix them because it is in dire financial straits.  Is the Minister of State saying that the CEO of Louth County Council and the director of services for housing have refused point-blank to contact the Department about funding for the roll-out of projects?  I want the Minister of State to clarify the position.  Have they said point-blank that they do not want housing on the land?  Has the Minister offered them money for the roll-out of social and affordable housing and they have refused it?  I want to clarify the position on the record.</p>  <p>  I hope the Minister of State does not even hallucinate about targeting the council-owned lands for the farce of the Land Development Agency because only 10% of the 800 houses would be social and only 30% would be affordable.  In the Minister of State's thinking, &euro;320,000 is affordable.  This would mean that a person would have to have to have a deposit of &euro;32,000, get a mortgage for &euro;288,000 and be earning a salary of &euro;82,000.  Will the Minister of State get real?</p></speech>

I am very clear that we have met with Louth County Council.  It has a pipeline of projects to deliver more than 740 houses in the coming year or two.  We have been very clear that we would like more projects to be in the pipeline.  There are schemes to do that and we are very happy to engage with the council in this regard.  We are funding projects.  We are very clear as a Government that our job is to make sure social housing and affordable housing are delivered and also to increase the number of private housing development, which thankfully is happening as well.  Local authorities are involved in that.  Where landbanks can deliver all three categories of housing and help recoup some of the costs the council has expended the landbanks should be used for that as well where it is suitable.  Some of the sites are large and it would not be suitable to only bring forward social housing on them.  The local authority in Louth is very aware of that and it has engaged on the sites as well.  We will engage with the council and make available our technical teams to help it develop those sites.  There is more opportunity for more projects and for more sites to be developed.</p></speech>

My question to the Minister this morning specifically asks how many beds are available in the Dublin area for rough sleepers, how many people are deemed to require this accommodation or are classed as rough sleepers and what plans are in place for severe weather conditions during the winter?</p></reply>
    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.100.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400009#G02000"><p>As I stated previously, supporting individual and families experiencing homelessness is an absolute priority for this Government, particularly in the case of those who, without such supports, may end up sleeping rough.  Budget 2019 reflects this commitment by allocating an additional &euro;30 million for the provision of homelessness services in 2019.  That will increase the total budget available to local authorities to &euro;146 million, which is a 26% increase on the provision for 2018.  Budget 2019 also provides for an additional &euro;60 million in capital funding for the provision of emergency accommodation, including further emergency facilities for single adults and couples.</p>  <p>  Providing additional accommodation for rough sleepers is essential.  In this regard, I recently wrote to the chief executives of the four Dublin local authorities requesting the delivery of additional emergency accommodation across the Dublin region.  A plan submitted to me subsequently by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive will deliver over 200 new permanent beds across the city before the end of the year.  That will add to the existing emergency bed capacity of some 2,200 beds.  Furthermore, as we move into winter, I have also requested all local authorities, including in Dublin, to ensure that cold weather arrangements are in place for rough sleepers, including additional temporary emergency beds, as necessary.</p>  <p>  Many individuals experiencing homelessness and rough sleeping as a result also require other supports to exit homelessness into an independent tenancy.  The implementation plan for Housing First, published in September, is designed to provide this response, by delivering permanent housing solutions for rough sleepers and long-term users of emergency accommodation.  The plan contains targets for each local authority, with an overall national target of 660 tenancies to be delivered by 2021.  Crucially, implementation will be driven by a new dedicated national director of Housing First who was appointed earlier this year.</p></reply>

I will try to keep it simple.  I specifically asked him about the number of beds that are available for rough sleepers in the Dublin area.  I then asked him what is the current number of people deemed to be rough sleepers.  The reason is that I am trying to ensure there is adequate capacity.  From time to time we have, unfortunately, seen rough sleepers die on the streets.  While bad weather may be a contributory factor in some cases, neglect has always been a cause.  I am not abdicating our responsibility.  We all have a role to play to ensure that does not happen.  From the point of view of clarity, in order to understand the situation, we need the Minister to provide those figures.  What is the number of beds available in the Dublin area for rough sleepers and what is the number of people who are categorised as sleeping rough and are they a match?  Anecdotal evidence from this summer, and even today walking through town, is that we are beginning to see more people who are rough sleepers.  I am concerned that if we are seeing them on such a scale that we do not have the required number of beds.  I am very concerned about what that will mean in the winter months.</p></speech>

The most recent count was done in March of this year and found that an average of 110 people were sleeping rough on a nightly basis, down 40% on the previous count conducted in November 2017.  All of the additional beds, supports and work that we put in place last year helped to get people off the streets.  People who are sleeping rough are in complex situations and it is not just a question of providing shelter and accommodation for them.  They need wraparound supports and services as well and that is why the Housing First plan is so important.</p> <p> I assure the Deputy that there will be enough beds in place before the end of the year.  While the official numbers tell us that 110 people are sleeping rough, that count is months old and more people may be sleeping rough on our streets now.  Between now and the end of the year, therefore, 248 new emergency beds will be delivered.  Some 20 have been delivered and a further 200 are in the pipeline and will be delivered in the next three to four weeks.  In addition, 65 new beds were put in place but we do not count them as new because they are replacing 65 beds that were lost on St. Stephen's Green.  In January, another 40 beds will come on stream.  Between 200 and 300 beds will come on line while the most recent rough sleeper count told us that there were 110 people on our streets.  Anecdotal evidence from our outreach teams suggests that there are still people sleeping rough and that some new people have presented.  We do not know if the number is less than 110, given the new emergency beds that have come into the system over the course of the year.  When we do the next rough sleeper count, we will know the number involved.  That count will happen in the very near future but no matter what the number, we are putting in place at least double the number of beds that will be required to make sure that no one needs to sleep rough, particularly during the cold weather period.</p></speech>

For those of us who live in Dublin and who walk around the city, particularly in the mornings, the anecdotal evidence is that more and more people are sleeping rough.  That said, I agree with the Minister that anecdotal evidence is not enough.</p>  <p>  Seven or eight months ago, there was a spell of particularly bad weather, including Storm Emma and so forth, and emergency initiatives were put in place.  Despite all the additional emergency accommodation in the system, rough sleepers, who were out in challenging and difficult conditions, had to be accommodated in a sports hall on Marrowbone Lane.  Four or five marquees were erected and more than 100 people turned up who had never been included in the equation.  How do we determine the need that exists because as accommodation and supports are provided, more people are turning up to avail of them?  I am concerned that the scale of the problem is greater than we realise, with rough sleepers who are outside the immediate catchment area, along the canals and so forth, not being included in the official figures.  When the weather turned bad last winter, 100 additional people turned up who had not been anticipated and had to be accommodated in a sports hall.  That is my underlying concern.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.105" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="11:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400010#H00300"><p>I understand and share the Deputy's concern.  As the Minister responsible, I visited said sports hall during Storm Emma.  The Peter McVerry Trust did significant work to get that facility in place.  What was needed, primarily, was safe and warm shelter for people but they were also provided with medical attention and food.  The Deputy is correct that these people would not traditionally have been sleeping rough.  They were squatting or were in other forms of accommodation.  The most important issue was to get them to safety.</p>  <p>  As I said earlier, the rough sleeper count from March of this year showed 110 people but we will put in place approximately 250 new emergency beds before the end of the year, with another 40 to come on stream in January.  In addition, we are setting up a permanent, standing emergency solution to deal with major storm events and other natural disasters or God forbid, more malicious incidents requiring the immediate provision of emergency accommodation.  Half those beds will be in place before the end of November, with the other half to come on stream later.  This is in addition to the 250 beds I have mentioned.  It is a further contingency for incidents like Storm Emma, for people of whom we are not aware or should something else happen.  Each time these events happen, we learn from them and money is available to put in place the additional supports needed.</p></speech>

As he may be aware, the eighth report of the Convention on the Constitution recommended that a range of economic and social rights, including the right to housing, should be inserted into the Constitution, subject to available resources.  A motion to refer that report to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach was passed by the D&aacute;il on 28 September 2017 and by the Seanad on 11 October 2017.  I look forward to the committee's deliberations on the matter in due course.</p>  <p>  I have previously stated that the convention's proposal merits further thought and due and careful consideration, paying particular attention to the role of Government, rather than the courts, in deciding on the allocation of resources.  I also firmly believe that the best way of ensuring that the State fully meets its obligations to those who need a home is through continued delivery on the ambitious programme of action set out in the Government's Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness and the development and implementation of further policies and measures, as required. </p>  <p>  The significantly increased Exchequer investment in housing since 2016 is resulting in a substantial ramping up in social housing delivery and a consequential reduction in the numbers on housing waiting lists.  The wider programme of actions being implemented is also resulting in considerable increases in the supply of housing in the market generally.  This demonstrates how an unprecedented level of political and financial commitment can deliver housing supports on the ground for those who need them most, responding effectively to the housing needs of our most vulnerable citizens while positioning others in society to meet their housing needs themselves.  The Government remains firmly focused on making the further progress necessary in this regard, irrespective of what transpires following the Oireachtas committee's consideration of the Convention on the Constitution's report.</p></speech>

A total of 81 jurisdictions around the world have either a constitutional or legislative right to housing.  In Europe, countries such as Finland, Scotland and France have legislatively or constitutionally insisted that people have a right to shelter.  This right is also included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the European Social Charter.  All of this would indicate that the Government should move on this issue.</p>  <p>  The Minister seems to be suggesting that including a right to housing in our Constitution would impinge on the Government's ability to deliver housing.  However, the Government has not delivered and is only beginning to ramp up delivery now.  We are often told that Articles 40 and 43 of our Constitution lay down the right of private ownership and the general right to transfer, bequeath and inherit property and while there is a section which delimits those rights, it needs strengthening.  Surely this is something with which the Minister would like to be associated, given that housing is his ministerial responsibility.</p></speech>

In that context, I am happy to let the committee do its work, to deliberate on this matter and come back with recommendations to the D&aacute;il and the Government.</p>  <p>  Countries that have a constitutional or legal right to housing have not been able to provide the basic floor to which the Deputy refers.  Those countries with a constitutional right, including South Africa, Belgium, Finland, Spain and Sweden, all have a homelessness and housing problem.  Those countries that have a legal right, including Austria, France, Germany, Luxembourg and Scotland, also have homelessness and housing problems.  Enshrining such a right in law or in the Constitution will not necessarily provide the floor the Deputy mentioned.  </p>  <p>  I agree that people have a right to security and dignity and that the Government has a responsibility to provide housing.  That is why we have such an ambitious programme of housing delivery, starting with 50,000 homes under Rebuilding Ireland.  Under the new national development plan, the target is to provide 110,000 social housing homes between 2018 and 2027.  In addition, we will also deliver subsidised homes through various affordability schemes that we are rolling out.  The Government is working, through both policy and resources, to do everything possible to meet peoples' housing needs.  We do not need a constitutional right or a legal obligation to do that but will do it anyway.  If the committee makes a recommendation in that regard, we will consider it.</p></speech>

What is the Minister's own view on this?  What does he think about the proposition, as the Minister with responsibility for housing?  Is this an issue on which he is prepared to take the lead?  Generally, we have seen political leadership on some of the other matters to which he has referred.  The Minister may not be in favour of a general constitutional right to housing but given the fact that more than 4,000 children are in emergency accommodation, with thousands more living in overcrowded accommodation, would he at least favour a constitutional amendment to give children a right to housing?</p><p>There has been strong criticism from, for example, the Chief Commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, Ms Emily Logan, who has stated that homelessness is an acute denial of the human rights of children.</p></speech>

We are doing a great deal of work with the local authorities and through funding our partner organisations, such as the Peter McVerry Trust and Focus Ireland, to put in every care and support we can for people sleeping rough, people in emergency accommodation or people at risk of entering emergency accommodation.  Next year, the Government will spend more money on housing than it has ever spent in a single year.</p>  <p>  That is the commitment and dedication we are giving to solving our housing problem and our homelessness crisis.  We have to ask ourselves a question about the balance of power and responsibility between the Judiciary and the Oireachtas when it comes to the allocation of resources.  That is something the committee is looking at.  That said, we can find ways within the existing constitutional provisions to look at the current balance of power between the individual and the collective to see if we can rebalance it towards the collective.</p></speech>

Deputy Quinlivan is the second person to say that Limerick City and County Council cannot get money for void programmes.  That money has, however, been approved.  I understand that a claim for funding in respect of work carried out is to be submitted by Limerick City and County Council shortly and my Department is liaising with the council regarding any additional funding requirements it may have.  It is now a matter for the council to progress the refurbishment and allocation of the homes involved.</p>  <p>  A letter was sent to all local authorities in September to encourage them to bring them forward any voids they might have.  If they had those houses fixed up and in use we would be able to fund those as well.  In addition to the allocation and the work that was done, they were also told to do more and bring in more.  Many local authorities are doing that as well.  If there is any confusion, I will be happy to clarify the position.  We engage with local authorities regularly and I am sure that this local authority is aware that there is money.  If clarification is needed, I will be happy to provide it in writing to Deputy Quinlivan as well.  We have been very clear with Limerick City and County Council and it is aware that there is money available for voids.  The council also does not want properties left vacant.</p>  <p>  In addition to the voids programme, Limerick City and County Council is also actively engaged in social housing delivery more generally, including under the main capital investment programme and the regeneration programme.  It has also been proactive with the repair and lease back programme.  I have visited many of the houses that were vacant that it purchased and restored.  I think it is over 23 properties in the past couple of months.  Some of them have been an excellent success and Limerick City and County Council is probably leading that scheme as well.</p></speech>

The Minister of State is indicating that there is no problem with the money while Limerick City and County Council has informed me on a number of occasions that it is awaiting approval from the Department in respect of the void houses.  I have a list here of 70 houses.  There are always going to be vacant houses.  Nobody is disputing that fact.  These houses are in the metropolitan area of Limerick and are boarded up.  Other houses have been allocated but the people involved cannot move in because there is no funding to do them up.  They are not on this list of 70, so there are actually more houses.</p>  <p>  One family was allocated a house a year and a half ago.  Another was allocated a house in March and they have still not been able to move in.  Officials from the Department were in Limerick on 1 August and visited those two houses.  To date, no work has yet been done in respect of either.  There is a problem.  If the Minister of State is indicating that there is no problem with the money being allocated to the council, then what is the problem?  The council is stating it has not got the money.  The Minister of State is telling me that there is no problem with the money being drawn down yet the houses are still boarded and vacant.</p>  <p>  People are not allocating them.  There are more than 70 families in the mid-west region, the bulk of them in Limerick city.  The problem is that people see the boarded up houses and see their own families in hotels.  These are in areas where people would cut off their own arms to live in.  The Minister of State needs to find out what is going on.  There seems to be much bluster and bluff, with the Minister of State indicating that money is not the problem while Limerick City and County Council is telling me it does not have the money.</p></speech>

There is no confusion on my part.  We wrote all local authorities in September to ask them to bring forward any additional voids they have.  If work is completed by 14 December, this will be covered under the budget as well.  More than 1,800 voids will be refurbished this year.  Deputy Quinlivan mentioned 70 houses.  I confirm that funding was secured for 70 houses.  It has not been drawn down yet so perhaps there is some issue there.  We will look into it.  Properties should not be vacant and families should not be left waiting.</p>  <p>  An additional &euro;700,000 was allocated in the past couple of months in order for other properties to be refurbished.  The council has also done well with the repair and lease back scheme.  There is something wrong if properties are vacant.  They should not be vacant.  If there is any confusion, I am happy to bring people together and sort it out because the funding is there.  I cannot make it any clearer than that.  We want the money spent and we want people in these properties.  There is no excuse any more for long-term voids.  There will always be cases where voids will be empty for some months as refurbishment takes place.  However, there is no excuse for long-term voids in circumstances where houses were allocated a year and a half ago.  That is something we will certainly deal with as well.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.137" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="11:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400011#J01700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99, 103, 114 and 132 together.  The question comes in the context of recent issues in the Department of Education and Skills with the construction and structural integrity of certain schools.  That has caused concern for parents and families attending those schools as well for the principals and teachers who work there.  I commend my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, for the way he dealt with that so swiftly to make sure the children and schools were safe, people were reaccommodated where they needed to be and the problems identified remedied in the best way.  That work will continue.</p>  <p>  We looked at this matter as well because we are responsible for the delivery of so many houses through the local authorities on social housing sites.  We looked at the companies that may have been involved and if they had been involved in the delivery of social housing etc.  Since 2014, we have been operating under a different regime when it comes to the construction of houses.  It is a much better regime than that which existed before.  This has led to what is known as the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014, BCAR, system and the building control management system.</p>  <p>  Through that system we have been able to ensure houses built as social housing by local authorities are built to the highest standards possible.  That being said, after the Grenfell Tower fire last year, I immediately made sure that the fire authorities in each local authority, working with the local authorities, would investigate all of the social housing stock we have to make sure that it was safe from a fire and life safety point of view.  That involved doing certain checks in those buildings.  It also involved looking at any tall buildings over a certain height with particular cladding systems as well.  As that work was being done, other work involving the fire authorities, the local authorities and people responsible for privately-owned buildings has ensured that the necessary checks and secure arrangements were put in place for those buildings as well.  The interim report of that group was published in early June of this year.</p>  <p>  It referred to the work it had done and no major defects had been identified.  In some cases some remedial work was needed and that work was being carried out.  It also stated that some further checks had to take place.  That group will report to the national director of fire and emergency management as it continues to do its ongoing work to ensure that people can have confidence that their homes - whether they are living in social housing, for which the local authority has responsibility, or in private rented accommodation in a multistorey development - has been built to the best specifications and that those specifications have been complied with.</p>  <p>  I refer to life safety and fire safety being in the buildings in which people live.  Some buildings remain which have defects in the context of fire safety, balconies, etc.  We have spoken before about where the responsibility lies between the owner, the management company and the builder.  That is to be resolved.  As part of the budget for next year, we announced that a significant programme will be unveiled for people who have issues with mica or pyrite damage in their homes.</p><p>Further details will be brought to Government later this year with an announcement as well of funding to initiate a scheme in 2019.</p></speech>

The Minister said local authority schemes and social housing were built to the highest standards.  It is interesting to note, however, that over the last number of years since the issue was highlighted in schools, a number of residents in local authority housing in various schemes have indicated that they are concerned about structural issues, namely external cracks in walls and condensation and dampness.  My question referred specifically to multi-unit development schemes rather than to the traditional semi-detached or terraced block.  A number of people have come forward about this.  Is a review under way or due to be carried out to look at the structural integrity of those buildings?</p></speech>

There have been rumours, counter-rumours, statements of support and the usual statements of defiance even though the document has yet to be published.  I gather the document extends to over 400 pages.  We appreciate on this side of the House that it is necessary to give the UK Cabinet space this afternoon to consider the document and the findings it contains.  Given in particular the Taoiseach's new-found interest in dedramatising the relationship between Ireland and the UK, we understand he is possibly constrained in what he can say.  However, he should be very clear that my party considers this document to be as important for the island of Ireland as it is for the United Kingdom and the European Union and expects the Oireachtas to be given the same opportunity as the Parliaments in both of those jurisdictions to discuss and scrutinise the agreement when it is fully available.  This document is a seminal one in the history of the island and the Oireachtas should have the power and capacity to scrutinise it on that basis.  We need to scrutinise it because it affects not only economic issues but almost every aspect of day-to-day life on this island.  It is not only about the backstop for Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom, but about trade, economic, social and civic issues also.</p>  <p>  Every Member of the House wants a deal and it is in the interests of the island of Ireland, the United Kingdom and the European Union to get one.  Every business owner, farmer and worker looking at us today wants a deal which protects trade and our relationships on an east-west and North-South basis.  Nobody wants a border between the North and the South, not even the DUP, and nobody wants a no-deal Brexit scenario.  While I appreciate that the Taoiseach cannot speculate on the detail of the draft, I ask him to comment on a number of principles.  Can he confirm that the Good Friday Agreement as it stands will not be impacted negatively if the draft withdrawal agreement is ratified?  In the case that there is a further extended transition period after the formal withdrawal period concludes, the UK will continue to be a full member of the EU for the next two years.  What are the principles which will guide the relationship after that?  When will a copy of the draft withdrawal treaty be made available to Members of the House on all sides to allow us to scrutinise it and begin the process of debating an agreement which is so important for Ireland?</p></speech>

I have been in touch with Deputy Calleary's party leader this morning on the issue and around that point.  A very important and sensitive Cabinet meeting will take place in London today from 2 p.m. and I do not want to say anything here which might up-end it or make things any more difficult than they already are for the Prime Minister.  I know the Deputy will not want to put me in a position where I have to do that.</p>  <p>  At the outset, I note once again that Brexit is not our policy.  Brexit is not going to be good for Ireland.  The best case scenario for Ireland would be for the United Kingdom to remain in the European Union, but that is not a matter for us.  It is a matter for the British people and their Parliament and they have made a decision which we must respect.  Our objective from day one has been to minimise any harm to Ireland and Northern Ireland and to maximise any opportunities that may arise.  Our strategy from day one has been to be European and very much one of the EU 27 and indivisible from them.  It has been to ensure that the European Union understood our concerns and vital national interests and to ensure that our concerns and vital national interests became European concerns and interests.  Michel Barnier and his team have very much taken that on board as have my colleagues in the European Council, Commission and Parliament.  In December last, when the joint report - the agreement between the EU and the UK - was issued, I said the next step was to turn the report into a legally binding and operable withdrawal agreement.  While we are close to that point today, it remains a draft agreement.  It has yet to be agreed by the UK Government which will discuss it this afternoon.  It has yet to be agreed also by the European Council.  We may be in a position to have an emergency European Council meeting before the end of the month to do exactly that.</p>  <p>  As to the Deputy's questions, my reading is that the Good Friday Agreement is not negatively impacted by this.  In fact, it is protected by the draft agreement.  Deputy Calleary asked also about the transition period.  It is envisaged to run from the end of March next year until the end of 2020 with the possibility of a time-limited extension.  During the transition period, the United Kingdom will not be a member state of the European Union.  In essence, however, the rules, regulations and acquis would continue to apply to provide businesses and citizens time to prepare for any permanent changes which may take place and, more importantly, to give us time during the transition period to negotiate the future relationship between the EU and the UK around trade and security.</p></speech>

We have had 12 months of discussion around last year's agreement and within that discussion there has been tortuous interpretation of language.  Language meant something completely different in London to what it was taken to mean in Dublin and <i>vice versa</i>as well as in Brussels.  Is the language in this agreement watertight so that it will not be subject to another 12 or 24 months of interpretation and difficult disagreement between our nations?  Can the Taoiseach guarantee that the agreement will be time-proof so that no matter who is Taoiseach or Prime Minister, the commitments contained in it will be honoured for however long it lasts?  In the event that agreement is not reached, in particular if the draft does not get through the UK Parliament, can the Taoiseach confirm that, in line with the contingency advice of the EU Commission on preparations for a no-deal Brexit, we are in a position to deal with such a scenario?</p></speech>

As an international treaty, it would, therefore, continue to apply even if there were a change in government here or in the United Kingdom.  That is the nature of such agreements.  As to the process and next steps, there are obviously a lot of things that can go wrong.  Should the UK Cabinet be in a position this afternoon to express content with the text, it is proposed that the Commission task force might be in a position even tonight to publish the text with the probability of an EU Council meeting on or about 25 November.</p><p>As we all know, the text would have to be ratified by Westminster and the European Parliament.</p> <p> Although it is not legally necessary, my strong view and the decision of the Cabinet is that the text should be put to a vote in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and I give that commitment now.  I appreciate that Members will want to read the text and, therefore, we may need some flexibility around timing.  If we are in a position to publish the text and to give Members time to read it, it is intended to offer briefings to all parties this evening.  We have arranged for briefings tomorrow morning for the Northern Ireland parties, or at least for those which wish to partake in them.  All things going to plan, we may have a debate on the matter next week.  This can be agreed by the Business Committee, thus giving everyone the chance to read the agreement in full and to think about it and then having a vote on it in the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

After all the machinations, false starts and back and forth of the past year and a half, I welcome the fact that we might have a suitable deal on the table.  I say "might" because we have not had sight of the text of the deal.  However, we are hopeful that a deal which meets what we in Sinn F&eacute;in have consistently called for might be on the table and we await the detail of such.</p>  <p>  From the beginning of this process, we have consistently called for a special deal for the North of Ireland, reflective of its unique status and the vote that was cast there.  The agreement should ensure no hard border on our island, that citizens' rights are protected and that the Good Friday Agreement is protected and upheld.  We have put that case at home and abroad.  We have urged the Government to promote an all-Ireland view on the matter, which is what has guided our approach in Sinn F&eacute;in.  We have not sought to play party politics on this issue and I am sure the Taoiseach will acknowledge that, as both he and the T&aacute;naiste have in the past.  We have rightly called the Government out when we thought it was on the wrong track but we have been supportive it was when we assessed that it was on the right one.</p>  <p>  One of the core issues is that of the Irish backstop which, in our view, remains the bottom line in ensuring that there is never a hard border on the island of Ireland, the interests of citizens are upheld and the Good Friday Agreement is protected.  That protection remains absolutely vital and the British Government must be held to the commitment it made last December.  Perhaps sense will prevail in Downing Street this afternoon.  I hope that will be the case.</p>  <p>  The DUP has come of the traps to oppose what may be on the table.  That does not surprise any Members on this side of the House.  In opposing any positive solutions, it has aligned itself with the most right-wing elements of the Tory Party, UKIP and extremists Brexiteers in moving from an initial position of wanting no hard border on the island of Ireland to apparently actively seeking such a border.  It is living in a fantasy land when it comes to Brexit.  It has no idea what is on the table but it is certain that it is against it.  That is an absolutely reckless and irresponsible position to take.</p>  <p>  There is an onus on us all to defend our country's political and economic interests.  That should be the position of every person in every part of our Ireland.  There is now an onus on the British Government to step up to the mark.  Last week, the Taoiseach told the D&aacute;il that the Government will not resile from the fundamental position that a backstop must form part of the withdrawal agreement and that it cannot have an expiry date or unilateral exit clause.  Is that still the case?</p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach to provide detail on when he intends to bring party leaders together in order that they will be as fully briefed as possible on the detail of the deal.  It is important that takes place without delay.  The Sinn F&eacute;in leadership, namely, our party president and vice president, will be speaking to the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, after 5 p.m. this evening and it is important that there is a briefing from an Irish perspective before that opportunity arises.</p></speech>

It is not our preferred solution but, rather, a fallback or insurance policy.  The joint report published in December of last year outlined options A, B and C.  Option A involves resolving the issue of the Irish Border in a new future relationship between the EU and the United Kingdom.  We will try to negotiate that during the transition period.  Option B related to UK-wide specific solutions, but in many ways that is now the potential for an extension of the transition period if required.  Option C is the backstop which would only kick in if options A and B were unsuccessful.  The backstop must be in place and legally operable.  It cannot have an expiry date and it must not be possible for one side to withdraw from it unilaterally.  It is important to appreciate that it is our intention that the backstop should never have to be invoked.  If it is invoked, that should be a temporary measure until a new agreement is put in place to supersede all or part of it.  However, it must apply until that is the case.</p></speech>

He mentioned that in his view the Good Friday Agreement is protected in the draft agreement, which is to be welcomed.  We will examine in detail how that stacks up when we receive the published text.</p>  <p>  On the guarantee of a permanent backstop, I ask him to outline to the House the nature of any potential revisions to the backstop following a review.  What would be the role of this Parliament, which the Taoiseach outlined will vote on the agreement, in that regard?  Will it be necessary for Ireland to consent to any changes to the backstop?</p>  <p>  I welcome that briefings of party leaders will take place, but it is important that they take place in a timely manner.  Given our role and the opportunities we have had to deal with the British Prime Minister and negotiators at a European level in advocating the Irish position, it is important that a briefing from an Irish perspective takes place before the Sinn F&eacute;in leadership speaks to the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, after 5 p.m. today.  That should be taken into account in scheduling the briefings.</p></speech>

Ireland is part of the EU but will not separately sign up to the agreement.  However, any changes to the agreement will be made through the European Council of which, of course, Ireland is a member, in the form of the Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  I accept the Deputy's points regarding things being done in a timely manner and note his comments on the phone call to the Prime Minister, Mrs. May.  Members should bear in mind that Cabinet meeting will begin at 2 p.m. and may not be finished by 5 p.m.  We will have to see how this plays out over the course of the day.  We want to be able to give Members the text as well as a briefing on the text.  However, I remember the furore when the German Parliament saw elements of our budget before our Parliament did.  That must work both ways.  We have had enormous support and solidarity from other EU member states and institutions throughout this process and I do not want to put documents which members of other parliaments have not seen into the public domain.  It is very important that this is all done at the same time and done by Brussels.</p>  <p>  I wish to put on the record of the House that this is a difficult time for the unionist community in Northern Ireland.  Many unionists may be feeling vulnerable, isolated or quite worried about what may be agreed in the coming days.  I wish to say to them that the Good Friday Agreement will be protected.</p><p>That includes a recognition of the fact that we respect the territorial integrity of the United Kingdom and the principle of consent, which is that there can be no change to the constitutional status of Northern Ireland unless a majority of people there say so.  We are very happy to have that written into any agreement because it gives the unionist community a legal guarantee.</p></speech>

I want to deal with one such issue, namely, child protection.  As the Taoiseach knows, Oberstown was in the news again at the weekend when the real reason for the non-publication of the Goldson-Hardwick operational review, which was concluded almost two years ago, was revealed.  I remind the House that the operational review was commissioned on foot of a number of serious incidents, including a virtual riot by young people, a major fire that caused &euro;3.5 million worth of damage, strike action, health and safety concerns and behaviour management concerns.  It is worth pointing out that since the Goldson-Hardwick report was concluded, there have been further serious incidents, including one last year which required armed garda&iacute; to be called.  High Court proceedings looking into the unlawful use of restraints and solitary confinement at Oberstown are under way.</p>  <p>  All of this relates to a facility which deals with the most vulnerable and troubled young people in the State.  Over half of them have lost one or both parents.  Some 42% of them are at serious risk.  They have drugs and alcohol problems.  They are not going to school.  They are in care and so on.  It is hardly surprising that the authors of the report said that they have grave concerns about what they learned and that it is in the public interest for the report to be published.  It is a sad irony that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs justified the non-publication of the report on the grounds that she was not convinced that fair procedures had applied.  To whom should fair procedures apply?  It certainly is not fair to the many children who received extended prison sentences of up to five years for their role in these disturbances that a report on the circumstances leading up to the incident has not been published.  It is not fair to Professor Goldson and Professor Hardwick, who are consummate professionals who checked and rechecked.  To this day, they have not been given legal information on why the report has not been published.  I have to say that if these academics were based in Ireland, they would not be treated like this.  Instead, the beneficiaries of fairness were the board and some of the staff in Oberstown who threatened legal action and resignation.  They got away with it.  They succeeded in intimidating the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  In other words, those responsible for the operation that was being reviewed blocked the publication of the report.</p>  <p>  Sadly, this is not an isolated incident.  It was revealed to me this week that another report involving very serious child protection concerns has not been published.  This report relates to social work services in the midlands.  My questions are quite straightforward.  Will the Taoiseach provide an assurance that this review, which was commissioned for publication, will be published?  More importantly, what will the Taoiseach do about the fact that it looks like two major organisations under the aegis of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs are incredibly comfortable with giving the two fingers to the Minister and the Department so that they can carry on doing whatever they like?  Unfortunately, the two organisations in question are charged with protecting our most vulnerable children.  The report that came to light earlier in the week, when we found out that it might not be published, involves a young person who is in a serious harm situation.  Social workers were notified of this over a period of ten years.</p></speech>

As everyone in the House will appreciate, Oberstown works with and serves children who have very profound difficulties.  Many of them have had a very bad start in life and have immense needs and great difficulties.  Sadly, they are often a risk to themselves, to other people, including family members, and to their communities.  This is a very hard area to work in.  The staff who work in this area are very dedicated, generally speaking, and have a vocation to work with children who have such significant and difficult needs.  Several reports have been published.  They outline the reforms that are required at Oberstown.  Recommendations from these reports have been published and incorporated into the overall reform plan, which is being limited.  The Minister, Deputy Zappone, has the board's legal advice with regard to this and that has been accepted.  I am sure that when further opportunities arise, the Minister will be able to answer the Deputy's questions in a little more detail than I can in the course of this debate.</p></speech>

The second report I mentioned was concluded in 2016.  The allegations in the report are so serious that the Garda is investigating them on the grounds of reckless endangerment.  We have a strong belief that the report in question will not be published.  The professional people who carried out the Oberstown review and its recommendations on a contractual basis, and on the understanding that it would be published, have not been given any legal reason it cannot be published.  If there is a legal reason and if redactions are necessary, why can it not be published on that basis?  Even though there have been improvements at Oberstown - it could not really get much worse, considering the problems that have been encountered there - the reality is that HIQA reports which have been completed this year set out 38 child protection and welfare concerns, none of which have been concluded.  In a number of those cases, the person who made the complaint was not even given an acknowledgement.  These are children who are suspected of abuse.  Some of the allegations were against staff members in the facility itself.  We do not know if those staff members, and those referred to in the correspondence that has been leaked or provided under freedom of information, are still working there and still represent a potential threat to vulnerable children.  I know the Taoiseach has bigger fish to fry today, but I am sorry to say that his initial response to me was a little disrespectful to the people at the heart of these matters.</p></speech>

It is important that we allow the Garda to carry out its investigations and that we support it in its work in this area.  I have not seen these reports, but I appreciate that we must always have regard to the risk that the publication of any report could prejudice an investigation and could make future criminal prosecutions more difficult.  That must always be borne in mind.</p></speech>

On the issue more broadly, I assure the House that the Government is absolutely committed to improving child protection in Ireland.  We have established a Department of Children and Youth Affairs with a dedicated Minister at the Cabinet table.  We have amended our Constitution to enshrine the rights of children in it.  We have put Children First on a statutory footing.  Last year, after many years, we successfully introduced mandatory reporting of child abuse.  When I say that a great deal of progress is being made in this area, I do not mean for a second to diminish in any way the seriousness of the issues at Oberstown which the Deputy has rightly raised.</p></speech>

We look forward to the Taoiseach's briefing on the text this evening.</p>  <p>  Several weeks ago, I raised the issue of economic and social deprivation in County Tipperary, particularly areas of Tipperary town and west Tipperary, with the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputies Regina Doherty, and the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys.  The former indicated that far from being areas of deep concern, County Tipperary and Tipperary town are flourishing and thriving.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  It appears that the sky-high rate of youth unemployment and the Pobal index figures on deprivation are figments of people's imagination.  This assessment has created a deep sense of anger across the county.  People have taken to the streets in their thousands to highlight the reality of the situation and to try to bring home to the Government what is actually taking place on the ground, or more accurately what is not taking place.  There is a total lack of understanding and empathy.</p>  <p>  I would like to refer to a comparative study that was commissioned and written by Ms Lisa English, who is involved in the Jobs for Tipp action group.  The findings of this study, which compares deprivation levels in south Tipperary with those in the north-east inner city of Dublin, are truly disturbing.  The report finds that the districts of Tipperary east, Tipperary town, Tipperary west, Clonmel west and Carrick-on-Suir all score more highly on the Pobal deprivation index than areas in Dublin's inner city.  It concludes that deprivation levels in the towns of Tipperary, Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir are far in excess of those in inner-city Dublin.  Unlike Dublin's inner city, there are no special tax incentives or developer-led initiatives to help to regenerate towns in County Tipperary.</p><p>The Jobs for Tipp action group has made applications over a number of years to the town and village renewal scheme but they were all refused, despite the fact it has a property from Tipperary Co-Op on a long-term lease.  Added to the challenges is the fact that overall the south-east region is the second most disadvantaged in Ireland.  Despite its importance to the region, the N24 also suffers from slow journey times and substandard design and alignment, and it is congested where it is routed through a number of towns, particularly Tipperary Town, Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir, as well as villages.  It is choking Tipperary Town.</p> <p> There is one option I want the Taoiseach to consider and it would demonstrate a real commitment on the part of the Government to the county.  Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, consideration can be given to the creation of a strategic development zone, SDZ, in the south and west of County Tipperary to help tackle deprivation and to attract small-scale job creation in towns such as Tipperary Town and Carrick-on-Suir.  Such zones have been used successfully in places such as Cherrywood and the docklands in Dublin.  A Tipperary development company or task force could be established in co-operation with Tipperary County Council and central government funding.  Will the Taoiseach support this option or, at the very least, ask the relevant Ministers to create an interdepartmental group to bring some joined-up thinking to this crisis?  The message is just not getting through.  There seem to be no genuine sense of the special circumstances that are preventing areas of Tipperary from tapping into the growth that is slowly starting to materialise in other parts of rural Ireland.</p></speech>

Project Ireland 2040 is very much about making sure we have economic development in all parts of the country, that the large cities outside Dublin grow twice as fast as Dublin, that we develop new major urban centres, such as the Dundalk to Drogheda corridor, Athlone and Sligo, and that we make sure we have a growth in population in rural Ireland.  We want more than 200,000 people living in rural Ireland by 2040.  Before the end of the year we will be able to make the first allocations under the urban renewal fund and the rural renewal fund.  Deputy McGrath knows that &euro;2 billion was set aside for the urban fund and &euro;1 billion for the rural fund.  I am sure very good projects have come in from Tipperary for those funds but I am not in a position to allocate the funding today.</p>  <p>  I appreciate that many towns in Tipperary are not doing well.  I saw the media coverage of the protest that occurred in Tipperary Town.  I have been there in the past.  At the same time, we should not make the mistake of failing to acknowledge that Tipperary is a good county.  It is a good place to live and has a lot of successful industries.  It is an area we should speak about in such a way that attracts people to move there and attracts investment towards it.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will have seen unemployment fall significantly.  In north Tipperary, it peaked at more than 8,000 in 2012 and it is now down to 4,400.  In south Tipperary, unemployment almost reached 10,000 and is now down to 4,700.  A lot of work is being done by the enterprise agencies.  There are now almost 6, 000 jobs in companies supported by Enterprise Ireland in Tipperary.  There are 3,600 people working for 11 IDA Ireland client companies.  In recent months, job announcements were made by DMS Governance in Cashel and significant investment in the Lisheen Mines bio-economy project.</p>  <p>  The Deputy also mentioned roads.  The allocation for regional and local roads in Tipperary increased to &euro;21.7 million this year from &euro;18.4 million last year.  That is a big increase in roads funding for the county.  This is separate from any funding provided through the local improvement scheme.</p>  <p>  On the issue of an SDZ for the area, we are always open to consideration of this but such a zone is not necessarily the magic bullet people think it is.  I have an SDZ in my constituency and we often colloquially refer to it as the slow development zone.  There are other SDZs, for example in Knock, that may have benefits in the future but just designating something an SDZ does not mean development follows.  It requires a little more thought than that.</p></speech>

I will tell him one thing about Tipperary - we are not slow, whatever about an SDZ.  In Tipperary Town, 5,000 people came onto the streets in good humour.  I acknowledge the work that goes on there.  The voluntary sector is huge.  There is Tipperary Co-op, Brodeen Engineering Knockanrawley, the Canon Hayes centre and Moorehaven with 520 people.  We want Government support.  We do not have a fair slice of the cake.  The rural regeneration and development fund has a budget of &euro;1 billion, as the Taoiseach keeps telling us.  Six applications have been made from County Tipperary.  We are not holding our breath because we have held it before.  The Minister, Deputy Ring, has said a total of only &euro;55 million has been put away for this year so it is not happening.  Will the Taoiseach encourage his Ministers to establish a strategic investment interdepartmental group?  The people of Tipperary are ready, willing and able to collaborate and co-operate and we will show the way.  We will lead the way if necessary but we need support from the Government.  The Government has neglected west Tipperary and Tipperary Town as well as Carrick-on-Suir.  They have been abandoned by successive Governments but this Government and the previous Government have definitely abandoned them.  The Taoiseach saw it himself when he came to visit.  He saw we had no bypass.  Now he has gone off with the road from Limerick to Cork and abandoned the idea of the N24 from Limerick to Waterford that would go through Cahir.  It was &euro;400 million cheaper.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider establishing this group.  We will make sure it will not be a slow development issue in Tipperary because we will engage with it and make sure it works.</p></speech>

It has &euro;1 billion that we have set aside for the next ten years to invest in our towns and villages in rural areas to make them more attractive for people to stay in, move to and establish businesses in.  There is also a &euro;2 billion urban regeneration fund for settlements of more than 10,000 people.  Applications have been made from Tipperary but they have yet to be assessed.  We expect to be in a position to make the first allocations before the end of the year.</p></speech>

In the <i>Irish Independent</i>this morning we read about the rise in delayed discharges because of the lack of home supports.  In January, 481 delayed discharges took place.  In September, before the impact of winter was felt, there were 613 delayed discharges, which equates to 130,000 bed days lost as a direct consequence.  Last week, the Taoiseach said he believed the winter plan does not work.  Will he confirm that &euro;10 million was allocated to address this backlog in home help and home care packages?  Will it take effect immediately, that is between now and the end of the year, and will he give an assurance to those people and their families that the commitments given to them by the HSE to home support will be met?</p></speech>

That is up from &euro;306 million in 2015, which is an increase of more than &euro;100 million year in the past three years.  That is a considerable increase.  It provides 17 million home help hours to 50,000 people.  The allocation has not yet been made for 2019.  It will be part of the service plan.  In the medium term, we need to not just continue to add more money and resources to a system that is not delivering adequately; we need reform.  What we propose to do, in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare plan, is to have a statutory scheme for home help, something similar but not the same as the fair deal scheme.  The Deputy will know from the fair deal scheme that people get an assessment and a decision within weeks.  This is not happening for home help.  We believe it is the model to follow.  If we keep doing what we have done in the past, which is to keep adding more resources, staff and money to the system as it is currently structured, we will not get the results we need.</p></speech>

There are also concerns about the consistency of sentencing for sexual offences.  Our Judiciary is rightly independent, as guaranteed under the Constitution, but major reform was championed by former Chief Justice Susan Denham.  That involved the creation of a judicial council, one of the key functions of which was to standardise and promote training, deal with sentencing policy and so on.  The Bill to establish the judicial council was introduced in the Seanad last November but it has not proceeded to Committee Stage.  We talked about this for a very long time.

There has been an increase of 14% in my home city, Cork.  For tenants who have suffered rent increases of 14% and more over the past year, the rent pressure zones and the 4% rent cap are a cruel hoax.  Where is the rent control?  In the United States, housing campaigners have a slogan.  They say they are actively involved in campaigning because &quot;the rent is too damned high&quot;.  It is too damned high in this country for hundreds of thousands, including young people who are locked out of the housing market.  Given the failure of the Government's rent control policies to date, is the Taoiseach now prepared to implement real rent control measures, which in the current circumstances means measures that cut the price of rent?</p></speech>

Does the Taoiseach expect that after March of next year, as the long-term relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union is worked out, there will need to be some bilateral treaties between Ireland and the United Kingdom only - for example, in respect of a common travel area, in respect of which some academics have said the legal basis is perhaps very weak?  Will there need to be bilateral relationships given our very close economic and social relationships with the United Kingdom, particularly the part of our own country that is still in the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom?</p></speech>

What we would like to do first is resolve the EU&ndash;UK relationship and have an EU&ndash;UK treaty on the future economic and security relationships.  If individual countries need bilateral agreements that do not conflict with that, they may well be necessary.</p>  <p>  With regard to the common travel area, it is true that there is no single piece of paper that states what the common travel area is.  It is interwoven with many items of legislation, conventions and protocols involving Britain and Ireland.  I can say for certain that both the Irish and UK Governments want to keep the common travel area in place.  Our European partners are happy for us to do that, accepting that this is an arrangement between the United Kingdom and Ireland that is unique and predates our membership of the European Union.</p></speech>

The Garda is doing its best considering that it does not have enough resources but I was shocked to hear a senior garda state there is no provision in law to deal with trespassing unless it can be proven there was intent to commit a crime.  There are marauding gangs of people going around hunting with dogs without muzzles and killing hares illegally.  They are also threatening and intimidating farmers and others.  The garda&iacute; are unable to deal with them.  They do not have the tools or manpower.  Will the Taoiseach write to the Law Reform Commission to ascertain whether we can amend the law?

This is totally different from the way in which projects have been assessed to date.  In that context and given that we are no way near meeting any of our climate targets, will the Taoiseach conduct a review of the existing national development plan, which was agreed only six months ago without any climate assessment?

Access for our fishermen to UK waters is extremely valuable.  Some 30% or 40% of all the fish our fishermen take out of the sea are taken from British waters.  Indeed, some of the most valuable fish such as mackerel and prawns are taken by Irish trawlers from UK waters.  I often hear the narrative that Irish fisheries were sold out when we joined the European Union but, in fact, we take a huge amount of our fish from UK waters and, like the French, Dutch, Belgians and Spanish, we wish to continue to have access to those waters after Brexit.  Nothing will change during the transition period but during that period it will be necessary to negotiate a future relationship which would include issues such as fisheries.  Obviously, we will want to continue to have access to UK waters while the UK will want to continue to sell its fish to the European Union.  The UK will want other things as well, for example, with regard to financial services.  It will also want access to European markets and to have an open skies agreement for aviation.  All these matters are interlinked and will be part of the future relationship-----</p></speech>

In that regard, farmers throughout the country are outraged at the behaviour of the factories in how they are controlling and reducing the price of beef at will.  Farmers are coming together to see what can be done to protect their incomes.  I appeal to the Taoiseach to do something about these factories.  They have a monopoly and are determining what farmers get.  Farmers are not being paid properly for their produce and their incomes are suffering as a result.  Farmers are talking about the food on their tables because soon they will be unable to survive with the current regime.  Will the Taoiseach do something about it or not?</p></speech>

The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has examined allegations of a monopoly operating among the beef factories.  I appreciate that farmers want a decent price for the work they do, but at the same time factories need to make a profit and we also must ensure that consumers pay a reasonable price for their food.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, has established a beef forum which allows him to engage with all parts of the sector and to make progress through that.  In addition, the Deputy will be aware of the announcement in the budget of a new scheme to support beef farmers.  He will be hearing more about that in the next few weeks.</p></speech>

As my colleague said, today is World Diabetes Day.  The HSE made a decision recently to provide FreeStyle Libre for children and adults up to the age of 21 years under the long-term illness scheme.  That was warmly welcomed.  Unfortunately, for those over the age of 21 years who have type 1 diabetes, which is approximately 20,000 adults in Ireland, access to FreeStyle Libre costs &euro;120 per month per person.  My question is similar to my colleague's.  Are efforts being made to roll-out the FreeStyle Libre device to adults over 21 years?  It would significantly improve their quality of life.</p></speech>

My experience of the hospital is that it provides a very good level of service to patients who had medical conditions and older people with pneumonia or urinary tract infections, UTIs, the people who sadly might end up on a trolley in a big hospital.  They get very good care and do not end up on a trolley in Navan.  We must recognise what the hospital does well and I would be concerned about the impact any diminution in services there would have on Drogheda and Connolly hospitals, which are now performing much better than they did in the past.

Compare this with Louth where there are only two people waiting or the kingdom of Kerry where there are no people waiting, according to the figures I have.  Some of the people in Laois-Offaly who have been waiting will, unfortunately, die while waiting for a home help.  They are the most vulnerable people in society and they want to stay in their own homes and communities, which makes economic sense.</p> <p> Reference was made earlier to hospitals and hospital services.

I am aware there is a serious problem with home help hours and home care packages.  The programme for Government refers to caring for our elderly people, but it is far from the case.  I have people in my office every day of the week despairing over the fact they do not have home help hours.  I have pointed out previously in the Chamber that many elderly couples are trying to take care of each other.  These are elderly couples with health conditions and they are unable to cope.  It is scandalous.  We need something done here.  Urgent action must be taken because hospital beds are being occupied.  It is unacceptable and we must take action to ensure that Laois-Offaly is given adequate provision for home help hours and home care packages.</p></speech>

Home help and home care packages are very valuable and very cost effective.  The Deputies are correct in that respect.  The packages allow people to return home from hospital, allow people to avoid going into hospital in the first place and allow people to live at home for much longer before they require long-term care.  For that reason we have increased the budget dramatically over the past three years.  It was &euro;306 million in 2015 and it is &euro;420 million this year.  It will increase again next year, and this will be outlined in the HSE service plan.  Once again we are adding more staff, more resources and more money but not getting the results we would like to see.  This is further evidence that what we need is not just more money, more staff and more resources.  We need system change also.  This is why we propose to establish a statutory scheme for home care modelled on the fair deal scheme.</p>  <p>  There is significant variation from county to county but I ask the Deputies to bear in mind that the Sl&aacute;intecare report, to which all Members have committed, proposes that we have greater devolution and greater regionalisation of healthcare.  We need to think that through also.  People cannot demand the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare one minute and then say they are against regional autonomy and regional variation the next.</p></speech>

Today 56 people are on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick, which is an extremely high number in one hospital in one day, as I am sure the Taoiseach will agree.  It is more shocking to know that today a record has been broken in that more than 10,000 people have been on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick so far this year.  The figure is actually 10,028 people who have so far lingered on trolleys.  It is a disgraceful new record set under this Government.  When will my constituents in Limerick be provided with a health service that is not bursting at the seams with dangerous overcrowding?  When will the long promised additional beds be delivered?</p></speech>

This is a 12% increase on the same day last year, but it is down 16% on this time two years ago.  Once again we see enormous variation from hospital to hospital.  There are no patients on trolleys in Beaumont Hospital, two in Connolly Hospital, five in University Hospital Waterford and as many as 43 in Tallaght hospital.  There is also a very large number in Limerick hospital.  University Hospital Limerick, as Deputies are aware, has a new emergency department, a bigger budget, more staff and a new wing, the Leben wing, so clearly some work needs to be done there.</p></speech>

Today we had the publication of the HIQA report on the special care units at Coovagh, Ballydowd and Glenaulin in Cork.  We have had numerous HIQA reports on child protection, foster care, residential care, adoption and so on.  We do not, as yet, have an affordable childcare scheme.  We have been told it will be rolled out in November 2019.  We have serious issues in respect of Tusla and the absence of social workers and social care workers.  We also have serious issues around residential respite places for children with intellectual disabilities.  I ask that provision be made to discuss services for children across the State and across a whole range of areas.  There is a lack of urgency on the part of Government on a number of issues to do with the welfare of children.</p></speech>

The INMO does a different count that is 518.  The HSE count includes patients on chairs and trolleys in and around emergency departments but the INMO has over the years widened the count out to include patients on trolleys in other parts of the hospital and also people who not on trolleys.  They may be in day wards rather than night wards, or may be in an overflow ward.  The INMO count includes people who are in beds.</p></speech>

On 30 October this year the Department of Rural and Community Development wrote to every community service programme run by Pobal to inform them a review is to be carried out.  Will the Taoiseach consult with his Minister to confirm this review is in line with the policy, which looks to expand and support services as opposed to cutting a very fine and valuable service in many places, including in my town of Ballyheigue where a very successful community service programme is operational? The programme's continued success is critical to the success of the town itself.</p></speech>

I very much welcome the allocation of funding this summer for 70 void houses to be completed in Limerick.  I have raised this issue in the D&aacute;il on previously.  I ask that the Minister would consider a common sense approach to voids.  There are some voids in Limerick that are habitable and some people could live in them.  Unfortunately, the houses cannot be let out because they have to go through a number of upgrades.  This is quite bureaucratic because the houses are liveable.  Some scheme could be put in place so the houses could be vetted to allow people to move into them and a common sense approach could be taken.  People are on the housing lists and yet are looking at these empty houses that are liveable.  However, as they must go through some sort of bureaucratic process and be upgraded, the houses are being left idle.</p></speech>

I am well aware of Deputy Neville's interest in this area because he has raised it on a number of occasions.  We have the money available to deal with vacant or void stock in local authorities.  The call for common sense is a good one but we also have to make sure that every process we have when it comes to spending taxpayers' money is a robust process.

It takes approximately seven years to diagnose because many general practitioners are not aware of the condition and it is often misdiagnosed.  Following a diagnosis surgery is a very painful procedure that a woman might require on a number of occasions.</p>  <p>  I posed a parliamentary question on this matter but I was told there is no data on this.  The waiting time currently for one patient I know is 52 weeks minimum before she would even see a consultant.  These individuals are living in chronic pain.  They can have fertility issues also.  It is a disease that is incurable.  We do not have the specialist surgeons in Ireland, the medication is extremely expensive and there is no assistance available.</p><p>I am asking that the Taoiseach raise the issue directly with the Minister for Health, that we try to put together some sort of process for these patients, and that the wait times be reduced.  Information for patients is key and doctors must be properly briefed on the issue.  It affects far more women than is actually talked about.</p></speech>

This is the annual cycle of enhanced economic and fiscal policy co-ordination at EU level.  Each semester is commenced by the publication by the European Commission of the annual growth survey, which identifies economic priorities for member states for the period ahead.</p>  <p>  In April, Ireland, along with other member states, submitted its national reform programme to the European Commission in conjunction with a stability programme update.  The national reform programme provides an overview of structural reforms and policy actions under way, including in response to country-specific recommendations given to Ireland as part of the preceding year's European semester.  It is co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach with input from relevant Departments and agencies.  Stakeholders were consulted and submissions were received from 11 groups before the programme was finalised.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs was also invited to share its views on the European semester.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s national reform programme for 2018 reported on policies in place to respond to the main challenges and imbalances Ireland faces, including those identified in the 2018 country report published by the European Commission and Ireland&rsquo;s country-specific recommendations for 2017.  The programme also reported on progress towards Ireland&rsquo;s Europe 2020 targets in the areas of employment, research and development, climate change and energy, education and poverty reduction.

However, it completely fails to mention the disparity in pay that women in the workforce experience.  Yesterday marked the Work Equal campaign's day of action to highlight the gender pay gap in Ireland.  It was in effect the date on which women stopped receiving an income for their work for the remainder of the year relative to their male counterparts.  CSO data show that on average, women in Ireland are paid 14% less than men.  Ireland is not an outlier in its failure to address the gender pay gap and addressing it should form part of the national reform programme.  European Unequal Pay Day was marked on 31 October.  The bottom line is that Irish women, like many women across Europe, work two months out of 12 for free when compared with men.</p>  <p>  I understand the general scheme of the Gender Pay Gap (Information) Bill will be before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality next week for pre-legislative scrutiny.  While gender pay gap reporting is an important tool that will assist in identifying pay differentials and might assist in tackling the pay gap issue, there are other tools at the disposal of the Taoiseach.  The programme for Government commits to strengthening the role of the Low Pay Commission in tackling the gender pay gap as well as in-work poverty and also commits to strengthening regulation on precarious work.  Women workers are disproportionately represented in low pay sectors such as retail and hospitality.  What actions have been taken to strengthen the role of the Low Pay Commission in tackling in-work poverty, precarious work and the gender pay gap?</p></speech>

The same would be true for viable businesses, as is referenced in the reports, as well as for households.  Ireland is unusual in that there is very little evidence here of any debt write-downs at all.  Instead, the debt is being sold to vulture funds.  There is much suggestion from those in government that the vulture funds are in some way nicer and easier to deal with.  I do not think that is true.  The principle of debt reduction is to allow indebted people to get back into an arrangement with their bank.</p>  <p>  Will the Taoiseach instruct AIB and PTSB, for example, to deliver debt write-downs to their remaining customers who are in serious arrears?  Billions of euro of loans have been sold to vulture funds at a steep discount.  This is not being passed on to homeowners.  The country-specific recommendations called for better targeted measures in terms of tax expenditures and general government expenditures.</p></speech>

The national reform programme makes significant reference to the Government's plans to address the housing situation, and reiterates its targets under the Rebuilding Ireland plan.  Does the Taoiseach accept that even at this point in the year, the Government is not meeting even those completely inadequate targets?  The figures at the end of quarter 2 for the building of social housing show a total of 1,400 units and just under 500 council houses.  The Rebuilding Ireland targets were for 6,385.  The Government is way below the targets it set itself in Rebuilding Ireland, which are totally inadequate compared to the number of people on housing lists and in homelessness and emergency situations.  Does the Taoiseach accept that Rebuilding Ireland is failing even on its own terms, and that what is stated in the national reform programme in respect of it is simply not going to happen?  What is the Taoiseach going to do to address that?</p></speech>

However, there is a sense that we are not putting the resources or emphasis into further research and development to allow policy makers and others to bring forward the best possible ideas.  In resect of the Higher Education Authority, major issues have developed in how they are going forward.  Does the Taoiseach accept that there is a major issue affecting research and development?  It has been shown over the last 20 years that solid research and development has underpinned many innovative ideas but we do not seem to be putting the emphasis into getting the best possible research before we go into changing policy.  The Taoiseach might comment on that.</p></speech>

We should do it and we have a number of actions under way.  The first is the gender pay Bill, which is going to the Oireachtas joint committee next week.  I encourage all parties to work together to make sure we have pre-legislative scrutiny done next week and can progress the legislation.  It will require companies and employers with more than 250 staff initially to be phased subsequently to 50 or more staff, to produce data on their gender pay gap so we can see where it exists.</p><p>It also enables us to drill down a bit more into the reasons for gender pay gaps among different employers.  There can be many different reasons.</p> <p> We have had equal pay for equal work since the 1970s but that is different from gender pay and very often it is because it is much more difficult for women to make their way up the promotional ladder.  In higher education institutions, for example, 50% of lecturers are women, but only 25% of professors are women.  That can be seen across the public service and in private sector companies as well.  We need to push the promotion of more women in the workplace.  Deputies will be aware of the package of actions published by Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, on Monday.  We need to do those kinds of things across all parts of the public sector and in the private sector.  In the next few weeks I will be involved in an initiative to encourage the promotion of more women to the boards of private companies, similar to what has been done in the UK.  We have already made some good progress with State boards in that regard.  More than 52% of people appointed to State boards through the PAS process were female - a majority for the first time.  More than 40% of members of State boards are now women.</p> <p> Actions such as increases in the national minimum wage disproportionately benefit women because more women are earning the minimum wage.  In January, the fourth increase since 2011 will kick in.  There are many other similar actions.</p> <p> I had an opportunity to look at the Central Bank report on the code of conduct on mortgage arrears in recent days.  The percentage of people in mortgage arrears of more than 90 days is 7%.  People may often miss payments, but the number who are more than three months in arrears is now down to approximately 7%.  That is a really dramatic fall.  The number of people in mortgage arrears used to be 15% to 20% and it is now 7%.  Some 120,000 mortgage loans have been restructured, which is a considerable number.  Sometimes that means changing the term; sometimes it means a reduced interest rate; sometimes it means making it a split mortgage; and sometimes it can involve write-downs as well.  Some 93% of people are paying their mortgages and are meeting their repayment schedules.  Many of them are also struggling to do so, but are meeting them.  However, tens of thousands are still in mortgage distress and we need to put in place workable solutions for them.  Every circumstance is different and no one size fits all.  In some cases it will involve restructuring the loans.  There are many ways to do that, such as reduced interest rates and longer terms.  In some cases it may be write-downs and in some cases it may be people voluntarily surrendering the home they are mortgaging to move to a smaller home for which they are better able to afford the rent or mortgage.  There are many different solutions and it is necessary to look at each case individually.</p> <p> It is not lawful for me or the Minister for Finance to make directions to the commercial banks even where we own a portion or a significant portion of the shares.  They must operate independently and commercially.  There are many reasons for that under European and Irish law.  I would be happy to send on to Deputy Burton a primer explaining how it works.</p> <p> Core to the solution to the housing issue is the supply of new homes and apartments.  We need more homes and apartments for people to live in.  Last year, the population increased by over 60,000.  It stands to reason, therefore, that we need to be building at least 30,000 new homes and apartments every year just to meet the rise in demand of a country with an expanding population and an expanding economy.  However, we are not doing that yet.  We need to ramp up the supply of new houses and apartments of all sorts.  We need homes for people to buy, homes for people to rent and also social housing.  We need all those kinds of housing and also need cost rental.</p> <p> We are making progress.  We will build between 18,000 and 20,000 new homes this year, which is up from 15,000 last year - it was less than 10,000 the previous year and perhaps 5,000 the year before.  If we could ramp it up quicker, I guarantee that we would.  However, there are capacity constraints and limitations as to how quickly we can ramp up the building of new homes.  To have gone from less than 5,000 a few years ago to nearly 20,000 this year, with more new homes being built this year than in any other year this decade represents considerable progress.  I fully accept that it is not happening fast enough.  We will do everything we can to speed up the rate of construction growth until it gets to the sustainable level of 30,000 to 35,000 new homes being built every year which is what we need to meet and get ahead of demand.</p> <p> The CSO figures released this week speak for themselves.  A total of 4,673 new homes were built in the three months to September, which means that 4,673 individuals and families in those three months being able to move into new homes and apartments.  The big increase was in housing schemes.  The increase in one-off housing was only 26%, but the increase in housing schemes, housing estates essentially, was 40% year on year, which is a pretty big increase in the number of new housing estates being built.  It is disappointing that we have not seen a similar increase in the number of apartments being built, particularly in the cities where many single people want one-bedroom apartments and many people want to rent.  The number of apartments being built is not increasing at all.</p></speech>

A unified Government identity has been developed and adopted by Departments as part of the reform programme for Government communications.</p>  <p>  A unified identity replaces a fragmented and expensive system that saw Departments and Government agencies use, and communicate through, a multiplicity of identities, logos and brands, resulting in confusion, a lack of clarity for citizens and greater expense.  The unified identity makes it easier for citizens to understand and recognise when a Government body is communicating with them and when projects and initiatives are funded by Government as opposed to the private sector or NGOs.</p>  <p>  The experience of governments internationally and the research done in other jurisdictions, notably in the Netherlands, confirm the confusion and lack of clarity resulting from a fragmented approach.</p>  <p>  The Dutch experience and that of the United Kingdom and others is that a unified, consistent identifiable identity ensures greater clarity on the role and place of Government in society for citizens and in Government communications.</p>  <p>  All Departments have been supplied with the logos, templates and guidelines necessary to apply the identity and this application is well under way in all Departments.  This is evident in the use of the Government of Ireland identity at Government events, press conferences and at public events, conferences etc., where Departments have a presence.</p>  <p>  The unified identity has also been applied at departmental level - from departmental logos through to a consistent approach to the design of communications campaigns, reports, online activity and identifying all Government communications campaigns as being very clearly initiatives of the Government of Ireland.</p>  <p>  An example of how this unified identity provides a clear, identifiable presence for the citizen was at the recent National Ploughing Championships, where Government representation was immediately and clearly identifiable as a result of all Departments using the unified identity in the design of their units.</p>  <p>  In alignment with the recommendations from the Secretary General's report, the reformed Government Information Service, GIS, is responsible for the implementation of the single Government identity.</p></reply>

I believe many citizens would not like that because they are familiar with different elements of Government services.  For example, some Government services are well received but others are not.  As the Taoiseach knows, the Government is mired in difficulties in the areas of justice, housing and health.  Is there some discretion in that regard?</p><p>What is the spend to date on the development of the identity and what is the projected end-of-year spend?  What agency - I presume it is some ad agencies or a single agency - is overseeing the implementation?  Are departmental logos being phased out?  Is that the Taoiseach's ultimate projection?  The spirit of the strategic communications unit is still there.  Has any cost-benefit analysis been done on what outcomes this is producing in terms of better services for citizens?</p></speech>

I do not disagree with that.  The Taoiseach said all Departments have been supplied with logos, templates and guidelines necessary to apply the identity and this application is well under way in all of them.  That is a useful clarification.  Does the Taoiseach have the details to hand of exactly who put the design together?  How much has the rebranding or redesign across government cost to date?  What are the projected costs for the future?  To echo the question asked previously, has a cost-benefit analysis or any kind of value-for-money analysis been conducted to ensure this will be cost-effective?</p></speech>

The sense is there is greater emphasis given to the reform of various Departments by the single Government identity.  Statements have been made on a single Government identity and greater participation by the public and more information on Government services.  When there is a complete lack of Government services it is an issue.  The issue of home helps and kids with disabilities was raised repeatedly during questions on promised legislation earlier.  The services are not there.  If more State services are made available, the public is discerning and will find them quickly.  The emphasis cannot only be on branding.  The emphasis has to be on improving the quality of the services, particularly to vulnerable people.  There are challenges across a wide variety of Departments.  I would like to see greater emphasis in Departments on the issues affecting citizens.  Whatever branding is there, the public will be able to find services if they are available.  It is not correct to say that a single identity gives the citizen greater interaction with State services.  If State services are not there, no matter what brand there is, citizens will not get involved in it.</p></speech>

Good communication is no substitute for good services, nor is it a substitute for good infrastructure but good communication can help to provide a good service and make sure people know where to find it.  Different identities will continue to exist.  Nobody is suggesting for a second that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will cease to be the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We know from Deputy Burton's leadership in reforming the Department of Social Protection, the Intreo brand is one that is quite strong.</p></speech>

It means Departments will adopt a common and unified brand.  It is a harp.  It makes sense that Departments, which are essentially just branches of Government, should all have the same logo.  If one went to a major enterprise or company, every department or division of that company or service would not have its own website or logo.  It is one Government.  We want to have joined-up government in terms of policy, delivery and communications.  Over time, it stands to reason that doing that will save money.  We want to give people clarity around communications so they know what is coming from Government and what is not.  There is much debate in the House about online advertising and information campaigns and how often the source of that information or the people behind such campaigns is covert.  This is the opposite of that.  It makes sure people know if there is information being put out or if there is a communications campaign that it comes from the Government of Ireland so it will not be obscured by an entity they have not heard of if they are not sure the entity is a Government body, a private enterprise or an NGO, for example.</p><p>The cost incurred so far for the unified Government identity is &euro;47,000, excluding VAT.  That covers design work and the roll-out of services as well as the production of comprehensive guidelines for the use of all Departments.  </p><p>A unified identity for Government replaces a fragmented system that saw Departments and agencies use and communicate through a multiplicity of identities, logos and brands resulting in confusion and a lack of clarity for citizens, as the number of Government bodies has proliferated over past decades.  </p><p>The experience of Governments internationally and the research done in other jurisdictions, notably in the Netherlands, confirms the confusion and lack of clarity resulting from a fragmented approach.  The Dutch experience, and that of the United Kingdom, is that a unified, consistent identity ensures greater clarity around the role and place of Government in society for citizens and in Government communications.  The unified identity makes it clearer for citizens to understand and recognise when Government is communicating with them and when projects and initiatives are funded by Government.  Departments are represented online by multiple distinct websites and platforms, each providing different visual styles and user experience.  The vision for <i>gov.ie</i>is it will provide one portal for citizens to access Government services.  The site is being developed with the citizen at its centre and will provide coherent digital experiences for citizens in communicating with Departments.  The design prioritises ease of access to services provided by Government and represents a move away from today's situation where website designs are aligned to how Governments are organised internally.  These changes are being driven by the eGovernment strategy and Our Public Service 2020.  Significant advancements have been made on <i>gov.ie</i>since its launch in November 2017 both on structure and the interface of the website and on the use of the site more generally.  It is being used to host many cross-government communications campaigns, including Healthy Ireland, Be Safe Online, Sl&aacute;intecare, Project Ireland 2040 and budget 2019.  The current phase of the project entails the migration of departmental websites to <i>gov.ie</i>.  A set of guidelines has been developed, which all Departments will adhere to, in the migration to the website, leading to a uniform and intuitive experience for the citizen and its interaction across Departments.  The Department of the Taoiseach has been the first Department to migrate and this migration is due to be completed by the end of this year with other Department websites moving across throughout 2019.</p></speech>

This work is guided by the successive reform plans published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Civil Service renewal plan.  The latest plan, Our Public Service 2020, sets out the next phase of priorities with a strong emphasis on promoting innovation to enhance our public services.</p>  <p>  In the areas of shared services, my Department has migrated in line with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform requirements with HR, pensions and payroll services completed.  Preparations are under way within my Department for the next major shared services project, which is financial management shared service. </p>  <p>  The Department liaises closely with the OGP on all matters related to public procurement and monitors all areas of expenditure on an ongoing basis to ensure value for money is achieved.</p><p>The Department is currently engaged in approximately 40 OGP central frameworks for supply of goods and services, such as provision of cleaning supplies, taxis, travel management and Irish translation services. <br/><br/>In 2017, my Department was a pilot organisation for the implementation of the eCorrespondence system as part of the move towards the use of common applications across the Civil Service.We have also implemented a wide range of actions as part of Civil Service renewal since 2017, including adopting the new shared learning and development training, which makes 60 newly tailored courses available to all staff; the new service-wide mobility scheme for executive officer and clerical officer grades; a gender balance action plan setting out actions to provide a positive work environment; employee engagement and well-being initiatives in response to the 2017 Civil Service employee engagement survey; participation in senior public service initiatives, including executive leadership programmes for senior managers, as part of a new talent management initiative; and the introduction of the single Government visual identity.  Other initiatives under way include preparing a new human resource strategy to underpin the delivery of the people strategy for the Civil Service at a local level, and moving the Department website to the single Government platform, <i>gov.ie</i>, which I mentioned earlier.<br/><br/>I am satisfied the fruits of reform and renewal are evident in my Department with services and staff who are responsive and deliver high quality service.  There is a strong track record of the Department being able to adjust and respond quickly to emerging needs.  Specific programmes of work to which my Department has responded in recent years include the Citizens' Assembly, Brexit preparedness, justice reform and the social and economic regeneration of Dublin&rsquo;s north-east inner city.</p></reply>

Are public servants given enough support in advancing those specific policies in every Department?  Are they given every possible support?  When there is a gradual change in policy, they should be supported and presented with ideals.  There has been a trend, in particular among Government politicians, to say that any major crisis that occurs is the fault of the Civil Service or the public service.  We talk about public sector reform but these people give considerable service.  In general, since the foundation of the State, the public sector has given great service to the people, and there are many fine public servants across the sector, whether in the Civil Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the health or education sectors.  While a small minority of people have abused their positions, most have given great service.</p>  <p>  Significant challenges face our society as it evolves, which it has been doing at great speed over the past number of years and which it will continue to do.  There is a need to support the public service in each of its facets.  What human resource supports are in place?  How are public servants being encouraged or equipped for public sector reform?  The reform will have an impact on them and the service they are expected to deliver.</p></speech>

What progress has been made in this regard?  Has an examination been undertaken?  What is the level of engagement, to date and planned, with the men and women who will deliver this reform programme?

Did the Taoiseach get a chance to watch these programmes by Katie Hannon?  They are required viewing for anybody interested in how Irish public administration and reform work.  I expect them to be on management and university courses in the decades to come.  The key question that emerges from the programmes is whether anyone will be held accountable.  In recent days, the Taoiseach discussed the matter in regard to the former Garda Commissioner and his legal position.  The questions that stand out from the programme, however, are what happened to Tusla and how the false allegation, which for any person would be a truly dreadful allegation, namely, of violating and raping a child, was transferred to a file.</p>  <p>  This matter cuts to the core of public service reform.  How does the Taoiseach propose to deal with the issue, which has been the subject of endless inquiries?  A grave wrong was done to a particular individual and his family, which the programme shows clearly.  What are the Taoiseach's priorities for public service reform?  The need for it was shown by the tribunal and the facts of the case.  This House agreed to the establishment of Sl&aacute;&iacute;ntecare, which would affect some of these areas, but has there been any progress on that?  </p>  <p>  There was also an agreement on an electoral commission, on which I recall the Taoiseach being keen, but has there been any progress?  We are approaching another election but there is no control of political messaging and its sources on social media.  We could be in the same boat as other countries which have suffered vast interference in their electoral processes.</p></speech>

We are relatively slim on the Government benches in this D&aacute;il, with only 56 or 57 Deputies, many of whom, if not most, are Ministers or Ministers of State.  In a different context, however, with a larger or majority Government, there might be a case for giving Deputies some experience in the ministerial ranks, but it is not something with which we propose to proceed in the current Government.</p>  <p>  Ministers of State are heavily involved in policy formation in the areas for which they are responsible.  Almost all Ministers of State have a delegation order which legally prescribes functions to them, while others have a delegation letter from a Minister which assigns them certain areas.  They are the lead people, therefore, in policy formation on those areas.  They also engage with their line Minister on broader matters, as well as through the Cabinet sub-committee system, and Ministers of State often attend Cabinet meetings where relevant.  At the Cabinet meeting on Brexit today, for example, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, attended for obvious reasons.  This is not a new practice and it ensures Ministers of State are fully engaged in decision-making when decisions need to be made.</p>  <p>  I did not have a chance to watch the documentary on Maurice McCabe over the past two nights, although I saw a few clips last night.  I very much want to watch it from start to finish but, unfortunately, I have not had much time for television in the past couple of days given everything else that is going on.  Between now and Christmas, I certainly intend to watch it from start to finish.  From what I have heard, it is essential viewing for anyone involved in politics and public administration, as Deputy Burton said.  I will make it my business, therefore, to watch it.</p>  <p>  In regard to progress made in other areas, I must admit that progress on the electoral commission has been slow.  It was discussed at Cabinet on Tuesday and I asked the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, to get on with the job, the next step of which is to produce a regulatory impact assessment of the electoral commission.</p><p>However, that section of the Department has much work to do.  It is also working on local government reform and the referendums that are pencilled in for next May on extending the franchise in presidential elections to all Irish citizens no matter where they live, as well as the plebiscite.  They have a great deal on their agenda but I appreciate that the electoral commission has been on that agenda for a long time and there ought to have been more progress.  The idea is that the electoral commission could replace the Referendum Commission, in effect having a standing referendum commission which would be useful as it would no longer be necessary to set the commission and then close it down each time there was a referendum.  It would also have responsibility for issues such as the electoral register, and could take on responsibility for registering Irish citizens who live outside the State, for instance if they register for postal votes under the reformed franchise for presidential elections in the event that people vote for that, or for the reformed Seanad franchise.  It is a constitutional requirement for Seanad elections to operate by postal vote which makes them expensive.  That is something we ought to examine.  It also might have a role in the regulation of political advertising and posters.  The Referendum Commission will publish its report on the abortion referendum shortly.  It expressed particular concerns that no body was regulating poster or online advertising, but we must always be careful that in regulating these areas, we do not infringe on free speech.  We need to get that balance right.  I would never make changes on those issues without cross-party consensus, and people will understand why.  </p> <p> We are making a lot more progress on Sl&aacute;intecare.  The implementation office has been established and it has a director, Ms Laura Magahy.  On Friday, I spent two or three hours going through the implementation plan with Ms Magahy and the Ministers for Health and Finance.  Many of the measures in the budget speak to Sl&aacute;intecare, including the move towards universal healthcare, reduction in prescription charges, the reduction in the drugs payment scheme threshold, and an increase in the income threshold limit for the GP visit card so that more people pay less for healthcare.  It is happening at a slow pace but we must do it at a pace that is affordable and ensure there is sufficient capacity in the health service to deal with it.  Negotiations are under way with the Irish Medical Organisation on a new GP contract.  Were we to reach agreement on that in the coming months, it would be a significant step forward.</p> <p> The implementation of the bed capacity review is also under way with 250 additional hospital beds provided this year.  I do not know how many will be provided next year but I hope it will be more than that.  The De Buitl&eacute;ir report on whether we should, and how we might, remove private practice from public hospitals is near completion.  That would be a radical step forward.  Project Ireland 2040 provides &euro;11 billion for investment in healthcare in new hospitals and hospital extensions.  Some 120 new primary care centres are up and running and there is new equipment and ICT.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, has been given a greater role in the management of waiting lists.  Waiting lists in Ireland are not well managed.  Through the resources it has been given, the NTPF, has made progress on waiting times for operations and procedures.  The average person waits less than six months on a waiting list for an operation or procedure, but the waiting times remain bad for outpatients.  However, there are more missed appointments than there are people waiting more than three months.  That says a great deal about the need for more reform, as much, if not more, than the need for more resources, because in excess of 300,000 patients are waiting to see a specialist, whereas 500,000 appointment slots go unfilled.  All those issues need to be managed centrally.</p></speech>

Drogheda is a fabulous town of 40,000 citizens.  Moneymore is one of the finest estates with which I have ever worked.  It is a community of people and families who work together and who are fraught and distressed about what has been happening in their community.  A small number of people are engaged in this activity.  They are evil and have been targeting, in the most evil way, not only members of their own organisation.  The fact that ordinary citizens could be killed, bombed, shot or attacked at any time is entirely unacceptable.</p>  <p>  I very much welcome the response of the garda&iacute;.  They are on the streets.  All garda leave has been cancelled in County Louth.  Regrettably, what has been happening has also necessitated the armed reserve police being on the streets to protect and act in aid of the civil power.  </p>  <p>  What we need is the immediate tackling of these people by the garda&iacute;.  I and, I am sure, the Oireachtas and the Minister, will offer them all the support they can possibly get.  There is a deficit in the number of police deployed in Drogheda.  Drogheda is the same size as the town of Dundalk but while Drogheda has 107 policemen, deployed Dundalk has 159.  I accept that the number of policemen deployed is a matter not for the Minister but for the Garda Commissioner.  It is not acceptable there is this deficit in policing in Drogheda and it must be urgently addressed.</p></speech>

That is evident from the seriousness of the need to cancel Garda leave in the Louth division.  The escalation of thuggery and crime in Drogheda was foreseen and flagged by me to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and acknowledged as far back as last June.  My concern was based on meeting people who were caught up in incredible fear and intimidation.  They were sucked in, some relatively innocently, into the crossfire of these vicious criminals.  Many of these young people have never come to the attention of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na before and many more continue to be sucked into the criminal underworld.  Some subsequently have had to seek anonymity and emigrate while their families continue to be intimidated by these gangs seeking retribution for the debts which they have cleverly and deliberately made sure to accrue to secure the false loyalty of these young people and the expansion of their criminal activities.</p>  <p>  The Minister should be under no illusion that what is happening in Drogheda is not confined to there but is being experienced in all the smaller towns and villages in County Louth and beyond into which these thugs' tentacles have expanded.  These will continue to cause grief and expand unless steps are taken.</p></speech>

Since first elected, I and other Sinn F&eacute;in representatives have worked closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The victims of these attacks are victims of unscrupulous and dangerous drug pushers who are targeting them for drug debts which are not theirs.  In one particular case, one family had &euro;11,000 demanded from it.</p>  <p>  I wrote to the Minister, as well as speaking to senior garda&iacute;, about this.  In his response, the Minister said that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was reviewing its drug-related intimidation reporting programme.  Will the Minister inform us if that review is complete?  Will he accept that additional resources are needed for Garda youth diversionary projects such as the High Voltage and the TEAM Garda youth diversion projects in Dundalk and the Boyne and CABLE youth diversion projects in Drogheda, as well as the family resource network.  According to a reply to a parliamentary question, there are currently five community garda&iacute; in Drogheda and six in Dundalk.  That figure has not increased since 2013.  The position of junior liaison officer in Dundalk is now vacant.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na deserves our fullest support.  Will the Minister support the resourcing of a specialist drugs unit for Louth, which was previously promised by him?</p></speech>

I understand the concerns being expressed by the people of Drogheda and other areas of Louth which have been articulated to me on their behalf by Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd on several occasions over the past few weeks.</p>  <p>  This type of criminal behaviour will not be tolerated.  The Garda Commissioner is responsible for the distribution of Garda resources, including personnel among the various Garda divisions.  I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.  However, I am advised that Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities to ensure the optimum use is made of these resources in Drogheda, as well as in other parts of Louth and beyond.</p>  <p>  On the specific incidents referred to by the Deputies, I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is conducting full and detailed investigations into each case.  As such it would be inappropriate for me to comment while these investigations are ongoing.  However, I have been informed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that garda&iacute; have put in place a policing operation to prevent, detect and mitigate against any further escalation of violence.  In addition to cancelling all Garda leave in the Louth division for the next two weeks, the operation will entail high-visibility patrols supplemented by personnel from the regional armed support unit, community policing units, district detective and drug units and divisional roads policing unit.</p>  <p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has further advised it will continue to make every effort to disrupt the activities of any groups who may be involved in these incidents, to arrest and prosecute offenders and deny access to the road networks for those involved.</p>  <p>  On drug-related crime, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remains resolute in its determination to act against those in society who pose a significant threat to the welfare and well-being of our citizens and the communities they serve.  A core focus of the work carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is aimed at tackling drugs and organised crime.  The continued disruption of the supply of all illicit drugs remains a priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the other State agencies tasked with responsibilities in this regard.  Liaison is also ongoing between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and other relevant stakeholders, including the local authorities, Tusla, the HSE and others.</p>  <p>  If anyone has any information about these incidents in Drogheda, they should contact their local or nearest Garda station or through the Garda confidential line, 1800 666111, as soon as possible.  Any information, no matter how small, could be of great assistance to the ongoing Garda inquiries and investigations in Drogheda.</p></speech>

The fear must be in the bedroom of the criminal, not in that of the ordinary citizens who are having sleepless nights in some parts of Drogheda.  This must end.  I must point again to the inequality in Garda numbers in two towns of equal size.  It is unacceptable that Dundalk has 52 more garda&iacute; than Drogheda.  While it is a matter for the Garda Commissioner, it is also a matter for public comment in that we needed more garda&iacute; on the streets of Drogheda before these recent incidents happened.</p>  <p>  I welcome the interest the Minister has shown in this matter.  There is an open invitation for him to visit Drogheda.  It is important the Garda Commissioner visits Drogheda, as he did other parts of the country recently, at an appropriate time such as for a local policing committee meeting.</p>  <p>  We are absolutely resolute in Drogheda that there must be more garda&iacute; and that they are fully supported.  These criminals must be put behind bars for a long time.  If we need to change the law and put tougher penalties on them, we must do that.</p></speech>

Often their hands are tied due to lack of resources.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge Garda numbers have improved in the general district with nine new recruits joining recently.  It is evident from my research that what is needed is more experience in the district, however.  Manpower is one matter but there is a need for an enhanced Garda fleet and proper community policing.  These services are currently depleted and in some cases are non-existent.  This gives the opportunity of a free rein for these drug barons.  All research has shown that high-visibility community policing engagement is the best deterrent.  More uniformed Garda inspectors are needed who would be responsible for the supervision and direction of uniformed garda&iacute; and sergeants to ensure management plans and strategies are properly implemented.  However, uniformed inspectors have gone from a strength of six to zero in the past five years in the region.  We need more front-line garda&iacute; or, in other words, more boots on the ground.</p>  <p>  If this does not change, I have a real concern that there is a generation coming up who already have some involvement in this criminal underworld through their siblings.  This is a vicious circle and if the resources are not increased to deal with the insidious criminal drug culture which has grown exponentially in the region, there will be more loss of life.  We have 20 year olds who want blood and have no conscience about maiming or killing.  At times like Hallowe'en, garda&iacute; only had to deal with bangers and stones.  Now they are dealing with firearms.</p></speech>

It is not good enough that there are not enough resources for community projects.</p>  <p>  The Minister did not answer my question about whether the review of the drug-related intimidation programme is completed.</p><p>That is also not good enough.

Available resources have reached unprecedented levels with provision for 2018 standing at more than &euro;1.6 billion, including an allocation of &euro;95 million in respect of overtime.  Further tangible progress is being made on achieving the Government's vision of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021.  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, almost 2,200 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and ongoing recruitment will continue.  Additional policing hours have been provided for across the country by way of both increased numbers of garda&iacute; and the redeployment of experienced personnel to front-line policing duties on foot of civilianisation.</p>  <p>  As of 30 September 2018, there are 331 full-time garda&iacute; in County Louth.  With the reopening of the Garda College in Templemore, there are 35 new garda&iacute; on the streets of Drogheda.  However, I acknowledge what Deputy O'Dowd and others have said and will convey their concerns directly to Garda headquarters.  Unprecedented investment is being made in Garda ICT infrastructure.  The provision of &euro;342 million between 2016 and 2021 will enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver on reform, work more efficiently and deploy cutting edge technologies to deliver a professional policing and security service for the community, including Drogheda.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.327" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400026#DD01100"><p>I am deeply concerned that instead of trying to dismantle the shameful and unacceptable direct provision system, the Government is hell-bent on expanding the number of centres operating across the State.  Direct provision is the incarceration of innocent people and, with good reason, it is often referred to as the Magdalen laundries of our generation.  I received an email last week from the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, last week to invite me and others to a meeting tomorrow evening to outline its proposals to open a direct provision centre in the Grand Hotel in Wicklow town.  This was somewhat disingenuous as I am informed that 13 rooms in the hotel are currently occupied under RIA's direct provision system already.  As such, it appears this is not a proposal but is already being rolled out.  Centres are often referred to as "holding camps" and as sites of deportability.  For the Department to open another centre in the Grand Hotel in Wicklow town amid public outrage at the system is to show utter contempt for public opinion and refugees alike.</p>  <p>  There is also a great deal of concern in the country about the loss of the only hotel in Wicklow town and the impact of that on tourism.  Questions have been asked about how this fits into the recently launched tourism strategy for Wicklow.  To open a new direct provision centre in Wicklow town will not serve the vulnerable people we must serve and protect as they arrive in the State seeking international protection.  It will also not serve the recently launched tourism strategy.  The only people it will serve are those private parties who are making multiple millions from this system.  What is the Minister doing to dismantle the direct provision system?  What process is used to identify the accommodation centres used?  In this instance in Wicklow, were other centres actually considered?</p></speech>

Those people are kept locked up given the way it is done.  Media reports from the last few days suggest that some people appear to be making a business of going around the country getting hotels to access the financial gain, to put it bluntly.  When agreeing terms with a prospective person or company, does the Department check if the buildings proposed are planning compliant and does it check whether recreation facilities will be available for the vulnerable people involved?  Are the buildings fire compliant?  Does the Department check whether there are legal challenges in the background or does it simply make an agreement on a facility?  I am referring in particular to the centre in Roosky.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.329" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400026#DD01300"><p>For the State to meet its obligations as set out in Directive 2013/33/EU, which lays down standards for the reception of persons seeking international protection, and SI 230 of 2018, the State must have available sufficient accommodation to meet the demand of persons in the protection process.  Due to significant demand, my Department has sought to identify additional accommodation by publishing notices seeking expressions of interest in the national press as the current accommodation portfolio will not meet the demand.  It is by way of an expression of interest in response that the premises in Wicklow town and elsewhere were offered to the Department.  To answer Deputy Fitzmaurice in that respect, officials do not go around looking for places.  They are offered to the Department by the owners.  As with all our accommodation centres, whether they are located in rural or urban areas, my Department will work closely with all relevant State agencies such as the Heath Service Executive and the Departments of Education and Skills and Employment Affairs and Social Protection to ensure that the services the residents of the accommodation centre require will be available to them.</p>  <p>  All contractors are obliged to meet the reasonable transport needs of residents.  Where an accommodation centre is not in place where public transport is readily available, additional transport arrangements are provided in consultation with Reception and Integration Agency.  I stress that transport costs are funded through the local community welfare officer or RIA as appropriate.  The contractor at each centre will also be required to set up a "friends of the centre" group as recommended in the McMahon report to facilitate linkages between the residents and the local community to encourage integration.  My Department works closely with such groups to achieve these aims.  Planning is checked with the relevant local authority to ensure there is compliance.  Fire regulations are also checked out with the local authority.  Recreation areas are important, as Deputy Fitzmaurice points out, and they are available.  I cannot answer any questions about legal challenges.  Deputy Brady asked if other sites were looked at but it does not work that way.  Centres are offered on foot of a call for expressions of interest.  If a centre is suitable, the Department enters into discussions with the owner or contractor to agree a contract to provide for people.  We are all concerned about the people who come here looking for protection.  That is paramount.</p>  <p>  These are not Magdalen laundries.  People are free to come and go.  I ask that people do not use that kind of terminology as it is not fair to the people who live in the centres to have them described as holding camps.  That is not the case.  People are free to come and go from the accommodation which is offered to them.  They do not have to take that offer up and some do not.  Some people have friends and relatives with whom they can stay.  If somebody arrives at Dublin Airport, Cork Airport or any of the ports and applies for asylum tonight, he or she will be offered accommodation if he or she needs it.</p><p>The likely alternative is for them to be on the streets and no Members want that.  We are currently at capacity because approximately 3,500 people will seek accommodation under that process this year.  That is why we put out a call for expressions of interest under which interested parties will offer accommodation to the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA.  </p> <p> There is no current plan to dismantle our accommodation centres because there is no available alternative.  Similar systems are in operation across Europe.  The McMahon report has been published and the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children ensure that standards in direct provision are as high as possible.  As the Deputies will be aware, there was a change to the law as alluded to by Deputy Fitzmaurice to speed up the decision-making process to progress people through the system.  The number of people in the system varies with frequent arrivals and departures.  We are doing our best to move people through the system as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I did not describe the centres as Magdalen laundries.  Rather, the NGOs which deal with refugees seeking protection in this State did so.  They are right to point out that direct provision centres are the modern-day equivalent of Magdalen laundries.  The problem is that the Government is turning to the private sector to address the accommodation needs of these refugees.  We need to provide accommodation for asylum seekers but the reliance on the private sector in that regard is part of the problem.</p>  <p>  I wish to offer a short-term accommodation solution to the issue I outlined in Wicklow town. The district hospital in the town closed in 2010-11.  It is vacant and in State ownership.  It is close to all of the services the Minister of State outlined need to be in place and could be brought on stream to a high standard and meet all the needs of the refugees quickly and cheaply.  That would ensure Wicklow town does not lose its only hotel.  It would mean moving away from paying for private sector accommodation and would allow us to develop secure, safe, publicly provided accommodation that is suitable for the needs of asylum seekers.</p>  <p>  We must ensure that the process of seeking asylum is not long and torturous.  The lengthy waiting time is part of the problem, with people locked in direct provision centres for three or more years.  The process must be sped up to ensure that places in the centres are freed up for asylum seekers.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to pass on my proposal regarding Wicklow district hospital to RIA and his Department.</p></speech>

Is he or his Department concerned at what appears to be the concentration of contracts in the hands of certain providers?  He is correct that it is not the fault of the Department and that people are free to tender for the contracts.  Is there a concern that some providers are seeking the contracts for three, four or five centres?  I welcome that the Minister of State clarified that the centres must be compliant with planning law and fire certification.  If there is a concentration of supply, does the Department check what legal stipulations apply to those tendering for multiple contracts?  I presume the contracts would not be signed before that is carried out.</p></speech>

There is a significant difference.  Those in direct provision were offered accommodation.  They can come and go as they wish and they are treated very well.  Inspections are carried out by the Ombudsman for Children among others.  It is a completely different situation.  Not all of the centres are operated or owned by the private sector; some are owned by the State.  I will consider the proposal made by Deputy Brady regarding Wicklow district hospital.</p>  <p>  On legal issues, I ask Deputy Fitzmaurice to notify us in writing of any legal concerns he may have.  The centres are rigorously checked by RIA.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputies for raising this important topic.  Earlier this year, RIA published in the national press a call for expressions of interest in providing premises to meet the increasing demand for accommodation for persons in the protection process.  I emphasise that we put out a call for expressions of interest.  The Department and RIA do not go around picking places and knocking on doors.  The call sought expressions of interest from parties interested in providing accommodation and related services on an urgent and emergency basis.  It was issued in response to an unforeseen demand for accommodation and related services for persons arriving in the State seeking international protection.</p>  <p>  The criteria against which the Department assessed the offers of accommodation were availability, standard of the property, ability to provide communal and social spaces for residents, ability to cater at mealtimes and proximity to various other services.  It should be noted that the premises were offered to the Department by individual contractors across the country and the Department did not randomly choose any location over another.  It should also be noted that several centres are located in rural areas and are run successfully with all residents having access to required services.</p>  <p>  Following on-site assessments carried out by staff of the Department, the Grand Hotel in Wicklow town, Caiseal Mara Hotel in Moville and Shannon Key West Hotel in Rooskey were deemed suitable.  The premises are, or after refurbishment will be, capable of providing meals to residents, have the scope to provide the required communal and social areas and are located close to other social services with the support of additional transport if needed.  My Department has engaged with the chief executives of local authorities in each of the areas and has provided elected representatives with information regarding the opening of the new accommodation centres.  As with every other accommodation centre in the country, the Department works closely with all relevant Departments and agencies to co-ordinate the delivery of State services to residents.  The Grand Hotel in Wicklow and Caiseal Mara Hotel in Moville are contracted to accommodate approximately 100 persons for one year pending compliance with all regulatory requirements.  The indicative timeline for the opening of the centres is within the next two weeks.  The hotel in Rooskey is not expected to be available until later this year after the completion of necessary refurbishment works.</p>  <p>  The Department recently commenced a public procurement exercise under which public tenders for the provision of accommodation and ancillary services by way of independent living for persons in the protection process will be advertised to meet accommodation needs in the longer term.  This process is scheduled to continue throughout 2019 and be completed in 2020.  It will be delivered via a series of regional competitions.</p></speech>

I was contacted by residents of the area who told me that on Monday last Irish Water lifted a "Do not use" notice.  The company stated that customers could resume normal usage of the water for drinking, food preparation, brushing teeth and other domestic use.  The notice was lifted following consultation with the HSE and the receipt of satisfactory monitoring results indicating the new water supply was safe to drink.  Councillor Cathal Rasmussen and I met the residents last Monday evening after the Irish Water notice was lifted and we were given recent samples of the water.  If I could bring one of the samples to the House, I would do so.  I am not a scientist, but it was clear that the water was not suitable for human consumption or other domestic use.  It was very discoloured.</p>  <p>  It is normal practice for Members to try to work through any issues in respect of water supply or sanitary issues in our constituencies with Irish Water, but we have been going around the houses on this issue for some time and I felt compelled to raise it in the House.  Several affected families want a solution to this problem which has been going on for 20 years.  They want the restoration of a safe supply of potable water that can be used for showering and other everyday domestic use.  They want a water supply similar to that enjoyed by the rest of the country.  That is their right.</p>  <p>  Irish Water should not have lifted the "Do not use" notice on Monday because it is very clear that the water is of insufficient quality and something has gone wrong in the system.  The residents will not use the water and they have no confidence in Irish Water.</p><p>They can present evidence of the fact that the water is still very discoloured, notwithstanding the flushing of the network.  The Minister of State will tell the House that this has been done and that a pH correction has already been inputted into the water system.  I can tell him now that the water quality is not what it should be.  The "do not use" notice should not have been issued.  We want a response from the Minister of State that states clearly that there will be capital investment to ensure the residents of Belvelly have an adequate and proper water supply.</p></speech>

I am taking it on behalf of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to outline the policy and legislative arrangements that are in place for the development and delivery of water services.  I understand that the "do not use" notice in respect of water services at Belvelly was removed in recent days and that Irish Water and Cork County Council have notified consumers on the affected section of the network that normal water services have been restored.  This follows the implementation of remedial measures to deal with the standard level of iron in the supply having been exceeded, as well as the confirmation by the HSE of satisfactory monitoring results.  This means everyone can resume normal use of the water supply.  I acknowledge the patience, co-operation and assistance of the public since the "do not use" notice was put in place on 16 August last.  I realise how stressful and distressing service curtailments can be.  Any inconvenience caused to householders and the business community at Belvelly is greatly regretted.</p>  <p>  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has had statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local levels.  Irish Water as a single national utility is taking a strategic nationwide approach to asset planning and investment and meeting customer requirements.  In October 2015, a water services strategic plan was prepared by Irish Water and obtained ministerial approval.  The plan sets out a high-level 25-year strategy to ensure the provision of clean and safe drinking water, effective management of wastewater, environmental protection and support for economic and social development.  The first water services policy statement to be prepared in line with the Water Services Acts was published, following approval by the Government, on 21 May 2018.  The statement, which outlines a clear direction for strategic planning and decision-making on water and wastewater services, identifies key policy objectives and priorities for the delivery of water and wastewater services over the period to 2025.  It sets out a series of high-level policy objectives across the three thematic areas of quality, conservation and future-proofing which must be pursued when capital investment is being planned and current spending plans are being framed.  The policy statement will provide the context within which necessary funding and investment plans by Irish Water will be framed and agreed.</p>  <p>  Last week, on foot of the water services policy statement, the Minister approved Irish Water's strategic funding plan, which sets out the costs of providing domestic and non-domestic water and wastewater services and the recovery of those costs.  The strategic funding plan will feed into the allowed revenue determination for Irish Water by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, as the economic regulator of Irish Water, and will ultimately feed into future annual Estimates and budgetary processes.  Irish Water's next investment plan, for the period from 2020 to 2024, will set out the financial plan for capital investment to support its strategic objectives, as set out in the water services strategic plan and the strategic funding plan, to deliver improvements to water services throughout Ireland where they are needed most.  Irish Water will also take account of developing subsidiary programmes within its investment plan, such as those aimed at addressing the needs of smaller communities, to assist in implementing the national planning framework and the national development plan.  Irish Water will work with each local authority to develop such programmes further for inclusion in future funding requirements.</p>  <p>  Water services are essential to the daily lives of our citizens and to the economy.  We need to ensure the best and most appropriate arrangements possible are in place for the delivery of these vital services.  A substantial proportion of investment by the State through Irish Water over the next ten years will focus on programmes to improve compliance with relevant public health and environmental standards.  Deputy Sherlock was pre-empting my reply when he mentioned the flushing of the network, which is not referred to in the document provided to me.  I note his comments about the visual quality of the water.  I will make contact with Irish Water on the lifting of the "do not use" notice.  The HSE's monitoring showed that satisfactory results have been obtained.  While I have no reason to doubt the HSE or the Department when they say that the requisite standards have been met, I can recheck the reply.  I would also like to refer to the funding of Irish Water measures across the country.  Since the establishment of Irish Water, Ministers have not been able to make a direct input into decisions on the funding of projects.  It is a matter for Irish Water to make such decisions.</p></speech>

He has given me some comfort with his assurance that he will raise the issue with Irish Water.  That is to be welcomed.  Although I am not a scientist, I have seen the water samples that were presented on Monday at approximately 8.30 p.m.  The "do not use" notice had been lifted some time on Monday morning or afternoon.  The residents of Belvelly have no confidence in the water supply.  We want Irish Water to be called to account for the lifting of the "do not use" notice.  There are serious public safety and public health issues for the residents.  They are being told by Irish Water that they can drink the water now, but they see clear discolouration when they look at the water.  There are children, babies, older people and people with compromised health living in the community.  People want to have confidence that their water supply is as it should be.  We want to see an evidence base or benchmark for the quality assurance used by Irish Water.  We do not know how, or against what benchmark, Irish Water is measuring what qualifies as or what constitutes good or bad water.  The point I would make about the flushing of the pipes is that the water supply infrastructure is very old and Dickensian.  It needs capital investment.  In light of the number of people living in the Belvelly area - I have been told that up to 175 houses are affected - I am asking for a solution to be found.  If we can find &euro;500 million for a rainy day fund, I am sure we can divest a fraction of that amount to start fixing problems like this.  Notwithstanding the Minister of State's comments, there is a wider issue with how Irish Water sometimes communicates with Members of the Oireachtas.  The relationship is very positive at local level, but further up the food chain the level of engagement with Members tends to diminish from time to time.</p></speech>

This is not a question of resources.  Irish Water's capital investment plans from 2014 to 2021 have identified that &euro;5.5 billion is necessary for the upgrading of the system.  The level of funding available to allow necessary works to be done has increased significantly in the last couple of years.  I do not agree with the Deputy's categorisation of flushing as "old and Dickensian".</p></speech>

I reiterate that the Water Services Acts 2007 to 2017 give specific roles to Irish Water and to the Minister.</p><p>The Minister cannot directly interfere in the allocation of resources to specific schemes.  Smaller schemes can be devised between Irish Water and the relevant local authorities.  I know a little about the Cork Harbour area and Belvelly would fit into this.

Before I prepared for this debate, I decided to take a strong proactive and positive approach towards working with IDA Ireland to secure jobs and investment in County Laois.  All too often when dealing with this matter at local level, too many people take the easy option of attacking IDA Ireland for having a very bad record in respect of County Laois but it has its worst record in the county.  This approach on its own has not produced any results.  While IDA Ireland has a bad record, I want to concentrate on the positive reasons this can now be corrected.</p>  <p>  County Laois is an attractive place for investment and we would welcome foreign investment.  The county has an excellent workforce and, surprisingly, 11,500 highly educated people leave Laois by car, van, bus or train to work in other areas, mainly in Dublin.  Recently, the local authority conducted a major survey on them.  More than 6,000 people responded.  A total of 1,671 work in business and IT, more than 1,400 in healthcare, more than 1,000 in training and development, 1,000 in manufacturing and another 1,000 people in retail.  A number of people from Laois also work on construction projects outside the county.  The regional office of IDA Ireland welcomed the survey and stated it has increased its understanding of the skills profile of County Laois and that it will be helpful for potential investors when considering where to place their investment.  Having this insight is important for IDA Ireland.</p>  <p>  The survey also shows that a workforce of up to 400,000 people lives within a one-hour commute of Laois, which is also important.  Everybody now accepts the central location of County Laois.  It is near Dublin but not in Dublin.  Land, building, investment, rates and rent are not at Dublin price levels.  It is much more economical to set up in County Laois.  The roads are of the highest quality of any county in Ireland.  We have the M7 and M8 motorways from Dublin to Cork, Limerick and Kerry.  We have the best network of motorways in the country.  We have outstanding hotels and services.  We have a lot of zoned land, particularly in the Portlaoise area.  I want IDA Ireland to concentrate on the site it owns on the Mountrath road in Portlaoise.  As I mention Mountrath, I want to particularly mention members of the Men's Shed from Mountrath who are visiting the D&aacute;il today.  I want IDA Ireland to target the site in its ownership, together with the site that Laois County Council acquired at junction 17 on the M7 and M8 motorways as they turn into County Laois.  There is now no good reason investment should not come to the county.</p>  <p>  On 16 February, I took the first initiative of its nature when I invited Mr. Martin Shanahan, the chief executive of IDA Ireland, and Ms Julie Sinnamon, the chief executive of Enterprise Ireland, together with local businesses in Laois to have a meeting in Portlaoise.  It was the first time the two chief executives ever came to the county for such a meeting.  Its purpose was to put Laois on the map and, more important, to put it in the minds of those two key chief executives.  They agreed on the day they would return in 12 months, which will be next February, to discuss progress.  I look forward to this.  I gave them a reasonable period of 12 months and we hope that between now and then there will be substantial progress, site visits and perhaps, with a bit of luck, some good announcement for County Laois.  If it is in Portlaoise, everybody will be happy.</p></speech>

I apologise on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, who cannot be present.</p>  <p>  The Department and its agencies continue to highlight the benefits of expanding or locating in all of our regions, including County Laois.  County Laois is marketed as part of IDA Ireland's midlands region and the agency continues to work hard to create further employment opportunities in the county and to increase the number of multinational companies located there.  There are two multinational companies based in Laois, which shows the potential for the county to attract new foreign direct investment and in retaining existing multinational investment over many years.  In July, SkOUT Secure Intelligence announced it will open its new Europe, Middle East and Africa, EMEA, headquarters in Portlaoise, creating 30 high value cutting edge cybersceurity jobs in its initial phase.  During the summer, Standex Limited celebrated the 40th anniversary of the opening of its operation in Mountmellick, County Laois.  Both of these companies clearly represent the positive, enterprise-focused environment for international business that has been fostered in the county.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland actively encourages prospective investors to visit Laois and these site visits represent an important tool through which companies can be encouraged to locate in the county.  While site visits are not necessarily linked to job creation, I am heartened that there had been seven site visits as of the third quarter of 2018 compared to four site visits for all of 2017.  This positive trend reflects IDA Ireland's ongoing and intensive marketing efforts to promote Laois to as an attractive destination for foreign direct investment.  The availability of serviced land and buildings in advance of demand is a key element in IDA Ireland's ability to encourage its clients to locate in a particular county.  IDA Ireland operates a business and technology park in Portlaoise with approximately 24 acres of available land for investment.  This site is being actively marketed to IDA Ireland clients through its network of offices in Ireland and overseas.  IDA Ireland also regularly engages with key stakeholders on the ground in Laois, including local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from its client base and the indigenous sector.</p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that creating jobs in the regions is a priority for IDA Ireland and the Department.  The Department is focused on doing everything it can to deliver the fairest possible spread of investment throughout the country.  The energy and resources we have invested into regional growth is, as the evidence illustrates, now producing results.  In 2017, for example, IDA Ireland delivered 99 regional investments with 45% of new jobs created outside Dublin.  A total of 30,000 new foreign direct investment jobs have been created outside the capital over the past three years.  We will continue to do our utmost to encourage further such job growth across all parts of Ireland in the time ahead.</p></speech>

In recent times, mainly through Enterprise Ireland, Irish businesses have made announcements about Portlaoise.  These include Glanbia's cheese plant, SkOUT, as the Minister of State mentioned, and the announcement by Mr. McDonagh.  People might not be aware that Portlaoise is the fastest growing town in Ireland based on the recent census.  It has a population of 25,000.  It has outstanding new schools.  Every primary and secondary school in Portlaoise is brand new and was built in recent years.  No other town can boast this.  It is a good place for people to raise families and we want families to move there.</p>  <p>  I want to put on record the official IDA Ireland position in County Laois.  At the end of last year, there were 119 IDA Ireland supported jobs in County Laois.  By 1 million miles, this is the worst figure of any county in the country.  All the surrounding counties fare better on this front.  They also fare better when it comes to investment and site visits.  However, I appreciate and acknowledge the increase in site visits this year.  IDA Ireland needs to step it up and keep it going.  It is in their minds and I look forward to the chief executives of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland coming back to Laois, as they committed to do, in the coming spring.  I will work with them to promote the county and I ask for a positive attitude towards IDA Ireland investment in the county.  It is something we would all welcome.  I look forward to an announcement before then. I am putting pressure on IDA Ireland day in, day out.  I am not just doing it on a once a year basis, I am doing it constantly and I will continue to raise the matter in the D&aacute;il and directly and personally with IDA Ireland until we get a good positive result for County Laois.  This is what we want to see.  I look forward to this happening sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

Total employment in Enterprise Ireland supported companies in Laois now stands at 1,473.</p><p>The Deputy may say that is not an awful lot but, by comparison with the figure for 2016, it is an increase of 8%.  It is about 3% above the national average.</p> <p> It is important to emphasise that foreign direct investment forms only one part of the investment in regional locations.  As the Deputy is aware, Laois is fortunate to have a strong base of indigenous investment and employment in companies supported by Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise office.  There are 55 companies supported by Enterprise Ireland, employing a total of 1,473 people.  Last year alone, the number of Enterprise Ireland-supported jobs in Laois increased by 8%, with 94 additional new jobs added.</p> <p> My Department is always open to the Deputy.  If he needs to seek a meeting with officials to discuss further developments in County Laois, the impact of the midlands action plan for jobs and so on, he may do so.  The action plan covers counties Laois, Longford, Offaly and Westmeath.  Some 15,300 additional jobs were created in the period 2015 to 2018.  Some of these will have been created in County Laois.  I offer the Deputy an opportunity to meet officials in my Department at any point in order to discuss investment in County Laois by foreign direct investment companies.  If he needs to meet officials from Enterprise Ireland, he should feel free to contact my Department.  We will absolutely facilitate a meeting for him.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.354" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1311" speakername="John Lahart" time="14:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400030#HH00300"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  Over two years ago, in response to gangland murders in Dublin's north inner city and at the request of the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, Mr. Kieran Mulvey produced a report, Creating a Brighter Future, which contains an outline plan for the social and economic regeneration of Dublin's north-east inner city.  One of my party colleagues, Mary Fitzpatrick, made a detailed contribution to the Mulvey report.  Since its establishment, she has worked with and supported the Taoiseach's north inner city task force.  I met Mr. Mulvey as part of his consultations during the period in question.  I was in correspondence with the Department of the Taoiseach during the same period.  In parallel, Ms Fitzpatrick has worked and is working directly with residents, employers and the North Inner City Community Coalition to address the root causes of dereliction, disadvantage and addiction and to champion the regeneration opportunities in Dublin's north inner city.  This Bill results from the work I have done with Ms Fitzpatrick, residents, employers, artists and the North Inner City Community Coalition, whose members' presence in the Visitors Gallery I acknowledge.  In introducing this Bill, I acknowledge and commend the work done by the Taoiseach's task force in the north inner city over the course of the past two years and I reaffirm the commitment on this side of the House thereto.</p>  <p>  Everyone recognises, however, that the root causes of the problems that resulted in the gangland crime that erupted two years ago did not appear or emerge overnight and, as such, could never be solved overnight.  Mr. Mulvey's report was, by its own definition, an outline plan of short-term initiatives.  To address such systemic issues as housing, poverty, dereliction, addiction, mental health problems and economic development, we feel very strongly that a long-term strategic approach is needed to provide a more substantive response backed with statutory authority.  For this reason, on behalf of the north inner city community, we are calling on the Government through this Bill to make a sustained and long-term commitment to addressing the challenges and to champion holistically the unique urban regeneration opportunities that exist in our capital's north inner city.  I want to identify how this Bill will build on and enhance the work commenced by the task force.  I also want to ask for the House's support for the establishment of a statutory north inner city development authority.</p>  <p>  The geographical definition of Dublin's north inner city has been a matter of debate.  The Taoiseach's task force defines it as a small compact area extending from Bus&aacute;ras and Connolly Station to Croke Park, bordering parts of Dorset Street and O'Connell Street on the west and extending to the edge of East Wall, comprising an area with a population of approximately 20,000.  The city council, the North Inner City Community Coalition and our Bill define the north inner city as the geographical area that stretches from the walls of the Phoenix Park to the urban villages of Stoneybatter and Phibsborough, the markets, O'Connell Street, Ballybough, Drumcondra, North Strand and Seville Place and as far as North Wall and East Wall.  The local electoral districts are listed in the Bill.</p>  <p>  The disparity between the task force definition of the north inner city and what is otherwise universally accepted as the north inner city has unintended negative consequences.  It creates local conflict because it excludes core parts of the north inner city, for example East Wall and everywhere west of O'Connell Street.  In my early days as spokesperson on Dublin, I met groups that had not been included in the area delineated by the Taoiseach's initial task force.  This means that struggling inner city community services are excluded from desperately needed task force support simply because they fall outside the defined area.  One example comprises the community technical training centre and the adult and older people's services in Henrietta Street and the community services in Sean O'Casey community centre, East Wall.  These are just two examples.  This Bill would correct that inconsistency and ensure an all-inner-city inclusive approach that would address and support all the north inner city, not just a subsection.</p>  <p>  The north inner city is an important and highly visible part of our capital.  It is the first place most overseas visitors to our city encounter after landing at Dublin Airport.  The north inner city is rich with history, culture and potential.  The National Museum of Ireland at Collins Barracks, Arbour Hill Cemetery, the ancient village of Stoneybatter, the regenerated Smithfield Square, the fruit and vegetable markets, the Complex arts centre, the Four Courts, Georgian Mountjoy, Parnell Square, Henrietta Street, Moore Street, Henry Street, O'Connell Street, the General Post Office, the Gate and Abbey theatres, Bus&aacute;ras, Connolly Station, the Convention Centre Dublin, the 3Arena and Dublin Port are all located in this area.  All these places are easily recognised, both nationally and internationally.  The challenges associated with housing, poverty, dereliction and disadvantage in the north inner city are enormous, however.</p>  <p>  The north inner city appears as an area of average to affluent economic advantage but it is made up of mixed communities of affluence and significant disadvantage that, blended, appear economically healthy.  Economic disadvantage, where it occurs in the north inner city, is severe.  It is often the result of poor health, poor housing, unemployment and a lack of education.  Economic and social disadvantage is often experienced on a multi-generational basis.  Child poverty, female poverty and housing poverty are acute for some.  Poverty is obviously evident from the low level of home ownership.  Seventy-seven percent of the population in this area live in rented accommodation.  Fewer than 25% of people in Dublin's north inner city on their own home.  The north inner city has the highest concentration of homelessness services in the city.</p><p>The most recent <i>daft.ie</i>rents report again highlights the north inner city as one of the most expensive places in the country in which to rent, with the highest annual increase in residential rent charges.<br/><br/>There is zero delivery of affordable homes, available or being constructed, but there are acres of State-owned lands that have been zoned and serviced for housing in O'Devaney Gardens, Dominick Street and Se&aacute;n MacDermott Street.  The projects in these locations are progressing at a snail's pace despite being launched and championed as landmark proposals under the Government's Rebuilding Ireland plan.  Hundreds of State-owned flats at Matt Talbot Court, St. Mary's Place, Dorset Street, Constitution Hill and other complexes are boarded up and should be redeveloped and made available as quality, affordable inner city homes.  The north inner city development authority we are proposing would, if established, have the authority to drive and deliver such redevelopment at an accelerated pace.<br/><br/>Dereliction is a blight on the north inner city.  Initiatives to address and reverse dereliction are not working and are taking too long.  The Minister of State will know that more than one third of property on O'Connell Street - Dublin's main street - is unoccupied, underutilised or derelict.  The North Circular Road, Dorset Street and Amiens Street, all main city routes, look forgotten, unloved and neglected.  Similarly, the tortuously slow development by the State of the national monument site on Moore Street, the long promised city library in the old Col&aacute;iste Mhuire building on Parnell Square and the development of the Magdalen laundry site on Se&aacute;n MacDermott Street, to name but a few, are proof that the approach being taken has not worked.  The State should not tolerate or foster such dereliction.  It is unreasonable to expect private interests to invest in an area where the State demonstrates little or no obvious commitment.  The State should incentivise regeneration and redevelopment in this area and penalise dereliction.<br/><br/>A State-backed development authority would send a clear message to private interests that the State is interested in regenerating the area, and that would encourage investment.  The State-backed development authorities for Temple Bar, the Docklands and Grangegorman attracted billions of euro in private investment.  A State-backed development authority for Dublin's north inner city could do the same.  The north inner city of Dublin is arguably the most socially and ethnically diverse part of our country, with more than 40% of the its population identifying as non-Irish.  This diversity must be recognised and catered for in all social and economic development plans for the area.<br/><br/>My colleague, Deputy Curran, has more to say on this matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.356" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1298" speakername="John Curran" time="15:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400031#JJ00200"><p>Since a gang war erupted a little over two years ago, the north inner city has unfortunately become the focus of Government attention for all the wrong reasons.  I acknowledge that the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, took a personal interest in the area and that this resulted in the Mulvey report and, to this day, increased Government expenditure in the north inner city.  He should be commended on that.</p>  <p>  This Bill would not be before us but for the persistence of our party colleague from the area, Ms Mary Fitzpatrick, who has advocated for this for a number of years.  She is quite clear that there must be a longer-term vision if there is to be a meaningful role in terms of regeneration.  It cannot be piecemeal.  The development authority would lead a co-ordinated response to the regeneration of the north inner city over a longer period, probably over a decade.  Support for the regeneration of the inner city cannot be switched on and off; consistent commitment is required over the medium term.  Regeneration must empower the local community and ensure that State bodies and agencies engage fully and meaningfully with the community.  The success of the development authority will not be judged by improvement and enhancement of the physical infrastructure alone but also by developing and empowering a confident local community.  In the absence of the establishment of a north inner city development authority, Mary Fitzpatrick, Deputy Lahart and I are concerned that the commitment over a period of up to ten years cannot be guaranteed and that the programmes and processes we put in place will be piecemeal and will not be underpinned by buy-in from all the statutory agencies required and a multi-annual budget.</p>  <p>  I will refer briefly to some of the main provisions in the Bill.  Its objective is to contribute to the regeneration of Dublin's north inner city - the area was outlined by Deputy Lahart - over a timeframe of no more than ten years.  The authority, on behalf of the  Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government and Dublin City Council, shall foster the social and economic regeneration of the north inner city, improvements in the physical environment and the implementation, as far as possible, of Mr. Kieran Mulvey's report.  The authority will identify bodies, both statutory and otherwise, which may contribute to the regeneration of the area taking account of the strategies of relevant statutory and other bodies operating in the area.  It will undertake the preparation of a strategy for regeneration of the area, drawing on State lands, other statutory bodies and investment programmes, and will be responsible for the promotion and implementation of that strategy.  The business of the authority will be overseen by a board of directors appointed by the Minister.  We are proposing to specify who will be on that board.  It would include officials from the Departments of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Education and Skills, Justice and Equality, Housing, Planning and Local Government, Finance and Health, the CEO of Dublin City Council, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE and members of the local community and business community.  The authority will produce and publish an annual report.</p>  <p>  I will not go into the further detail of the Bill.  Those who are interested can read it.  The composition of the board is quite important.  We have often established boards and groups in the past but when we look at the record of engagement with the statutory agencies shortly after their establishment various agencies do not attend or commit in the way they are supposed to.  The reason for this Bill is the lack of support that has been demonstrated to our disadvantaged communities over an extended period.  The situation in the north inner city did not happen overnight.  For many people who are living in the north inner city, disadvantage is intergenerational.  The programmes that had been in place only partially worked and were insufficient.  I will point out some of the deficiencies.  By getting the people who are responsible in the various statutory bodies on board with a development authority for the area we can identify the deficiencies and we will have a chance of bringing forward a remedy and solution.</p>  <p>  Consider the role of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the north inner city and across the disadvantaged areas in Dublin in recent years.  While the national units have had significant levels of success, communities across Dublin all say that the community garda&iacute; who interact with them are no longer on the streets in the same numbers.  The same applies to divisional drug units.  The national units have had significant seizures, but drug units at local level do not appear to be impacting in the way they had previously.  People in communities across Dublin, including the north inner city, can identify where drug dealing is taking place.</p>  <p>  The funding to the RAPID - revitalising areas by planning, investment and development - programme, which was to be made available to 31 of the most disadvantaged communities in the country, has been abandoned for years.  It was reintroduced in recent times with the small funding figure of approximately &euro;60,000 being provided per RAPID area.  That is paying lip-service to the programme.  The Government knows that.  When there is a serious problem it is not &euro;60,000 that is provided but the &euro;5 million that the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, has indicated he is paying this year.  That is the level of commitment and investment required.  I am concerned that without a development authority the continuation of the multi-annual funding and the underpinning of the programme for the north inner city will not be as they should be.</p>  <p>  I acknowledged the impact the former Taoiseach had because the funding flowed from what he did.  However, we cannot have funding that is provided at the whim of a Minister or Taoiseach of the day.  The community in the north inner city needs a sustained programme with multi-annual funding, and that requires a development authority.  The Minister of State is as well aware as I am that one of the scourges in our most disadvantaged communities, including the north inner city as well as parts of the constituency Deputy Lahart and I represent, is drug abuse.  It is a blight on all our communities.</p><p>For a number of years we had established drug and alcohol task forces.  We had empowered them to work on programmes to deal with prevention and to help people who were in recovery.  In recent years, while the funding bodies such as the Department of Health and the HSE from whom the task forces received their funding were allocated increases in funding, the drug and alcohol task forces were on the same funding they were on in 2014, which is less than the funding they were on in 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010 and 2009.  I understand the historic reasons and I am aware that there was a recession but as the funding bodies received increases in funding, the task forces did not.  I set these issues out to show that if we do not have a combined programme for the north inner city in Dublin, if we do not put a programme in place to endure for a decade, if we are at the whim of programmes being switched on and off, and if we are at the whim of not knowing if funding is one-off or annual, then the objectives we have for Dublin's north inner city will not be addressed.  This is the concern.</p> <p> I understand that the Minister of State and the Government will not support the Bill.  I ask him to think about it again for a moment.  The is one of the most challenging areas in Dublin.  We are trying to see it as an opportunity to be a model.  Many of the programmes that are supported by Government would be incorporated into the activities of a national development authority.  The difference is that there would be co-ordination.  Currently the money is being spent in the north inner city of Dublin programme by programme.  It is what the local authority wants or what a Department wants.  We need somebody to oversee it.  We are open to amendments to the Bill, but I have no doubt that the authority as proposed in the Bill can be the co-ordinating body.</p> <p> We have known there is a problem for two years and there has been no response.  Two years ago, Mary Fitzpatrick clearly set out that the response needed to be co-ordinated.  We support her in that.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the co-ordinated response on the type of investment and support over the next decade.  It is not just about financial support; it is also about the type of meaningful buy-in from the statutory agencies.  They should attend meetings and provide on the ground they are supposed to do.  This can only be achieved through a national development authority.  This is about much more than regeneration of houses or the refurbishment and enhancement of the physical environment.  It is about empowering a local community and giving them the confidence to look after themselves, having come through some very difficult times.</p> <p> I urge the Minister of State to reconsider his position and support the Bill, to allow it to advance and to use the north inner city of Dublin as a pilot case that can be shown to work in disadvantaged communities throughout the State.</p></speech>

I also thank Deputy Curran for his contribution.  It is worth bringing this into focus and to review where we have been over the past two years.  The issue was known of well before two years ago.  We were clear when we sat down with Mr. Kieran Mulvey to make these plans that we are dealing with many years of neglect.  It was not just something that happened two years ago.  We were also conscious that it would not be addressed or fixed, nor would it be able to give everyone all the opportunities they need, in one or two years.  A long-term, sustained investment, kicked off with a focus and with an action-led development, is required.  We are conscious of that, as was Kieran Mulvey when he met the various residents and groups.  The Taoiseach and the Ministers in the different Departments that were involved knew we were signing up to a long-term commitment.  Everyone came to the table with long-term ambition.  It was not to be just a quick dip in and dip out.  Let us be very clear about that.  Thankfully, the stakeholders and Departments and agencies are committed to that in the long term.  The focus is being driven by the Taoiseach's office and the commitment was there from the start.  I was there from the start, involved in the meetings and with Kieran Mulvey.  It is important that we get that recognition.</p>  <p>  As Mr. Mulvey noted in his report, Dublin&rsquo;s North East Inner City - Creating a Brighter Future, the area is not just a physical entity; it is a vibrant community steeped in history and with a wealth of literary connections to Joyce, O&rsquo;Casey and Behan.  The north east inner city is also an area facing many challenges that go back many years.  Census data highlight the existence of significant clusters of high deprivation within the area.  At the extreme end, there are small areas within the north east inner city containing 80% lone parent households, where up to half of the population have attained primary education only and less than 5% with third level education.</p>  <p>  The Mulvey report notes that unemployment levels for males in these areas were double and triple the national average including high dependency on the State for housing at more than 90% in some cases.  The misuse of legal and illegal substances poses a daily challenge for young people and adults in the area.  Alcohol abuse results in major problems for young people causing them to miss days from school and training centres regularly.  Many residents were concerned at the exposure of young children to this behaviour because they can see it daily on the streets in some parts of the area.  It was stressed by some community groups that even outside their own community buildings, there is undesirable activity going on.  All of this contrasts starkly with the existence of areas of strong business and enterprise, along with affluent residential development.</p>  <p>  It is appropriate that we are discussing the north east inner city today, and that we acknowledge the challenges but also the huge potential of the area, including that of its residents, who are parents, senior citizens, students, workers and so on whose priority is to have a safe and vibrant community in which to live and the opportunity to improve their lives and those of their children.  During those early meetings and discussions much of the focus was on the opportunity and giving people what they needed to be able to avail of those opportunities.  We had a very clear discussion on this.  It was not just about providing the opportunities; it was also about helping some of the residents who are not in a position to avail of opportunities to be in a better position to take on board the opportunities and taken them forward.  This is about investment in people, in skills and in professional people to work with community groups.  It is not just the development of infrastructure.</p>  <p>  I again thank Deputy Lahart for bringing the issues of Dublin's north east inner city to the fore.  While well-intentioned, however, his Bill does not offer the appropriate vehicle to bring the kind of solutions required in the area and, consequently, I must ask the House to reject it.  Deputies may recall that in July 2016, following a spate of gangland murders, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe and others requested Mr. Kieran Mulvey to report on the challenges facing the communities of north east inner city Dublin, and to recommend specific measures that would support the long-term economic and social regeneration of the area.  I stress that it was a long-term commitment.  Deputy Kenny was clear that he wanted a long-term commitment and that it was not just a quick fix where we would arrive in with a bit of fanfare and disappear again.  The then Taoiseach visited the residents three or four times and he stressed that the Government was stepping up to put in place long-term plans.  As Deputy Curran mentioned, we recognise that there had been cutbacks in specific projects and funding for a number of years prior to this.  Nobody wanted that.  We had to make sure that when we put the money and services back in, that would be done in a reformed and structured way to make a difference and to build on what had happened in the past.  We recognised that cuts had happened for all the different reasons before that.</p>  <p>   In drafting his report, Mr. Mulvey on behalf of the Government engaged extensively with the local community, including community groups, residents and business interests, as well as with Departments and statutory service providers.  Mr. Mulvey's report, which was published in February 2017, reflected the insights he gained from this engagement.  He emphasised on many occasions how valuable those insights and engagement were.  He commended all the groups, people and residents for giving their time and commitment, and for trusting him with the work he had to do.  There had been an issue in trying to build up trust in some cases.  Mr. Mulvey was conscious of this as he made his report ready for the Government.</p>  <p>  Without any disrespect to the intention of the Bill, the actions and structures outlined in the Mulvey report accurately reflect the requirements and desires of the community for their social and economic regeneration.  Mr. Mulvey spent many months meeting people, as did many of the contributors to the debate who may also live in the area.  On behalf of the Government and the Departments, Mr. Mulvey spent time with the residents trying to engage and see exactly what was needed and wanted.  He put a shape to that engagement, which was the aim of the project in the first place.</p>  <p>  Work is well advanced in implementing the recommendations of the Mulvey report under the oversight of the Department of An Taoiseach.  While the Bill specifically seeks the implementation of the recommendations of the 2017 Mulvey report, it should be noted that the report did not recommend the establishment of a statutory authority with prescribed functions.  Rather, the introductory recommendation of the report was that an independent executive chair would be appointed and that a team would be put in place to take forward the subsequent recommendations of the report.</p>  <p>  An implementation board was established in June 2017 led by an independent chair, Mr. Michael Stone, who was appointed by An Taoiseach.  The implementation board includes representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Dublin City Council, the Health Service Executive, the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills, Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Health and the Taoiseach and the local community, including an employer and business representative.</p>  <p>  A programme office, with a multidisciplinary team, has also been established.  This office, which is headed by the independent chair, is based in the Dublin City Council central area headquarters on Se&aacute;n MacDermott Street in the heart of the north east inner city.</p><p>The programme office oversees a range of communication and community engagement initiatives as well as funding and administration across a number of priority regeneration themes.  Given that high level participation from key State bodies is already in place, it is considered that the establishment of a new statutory agency as envisioned by the Bill before us might undermine or even compete with the structures that are already in place and operating effectively in this regard.  We were very clear from the start that we did not want that competition.  The aim was to bring everybody together.  We had the one agenda here and the one driver and it was important that everyone knew who was driving this from the start.</p> <p> Deputy Lahart&rsquo;s Bill would see the establishment of a new statutory body which in essence would be a development agency.  While the section 4 of the Bill sets out some general intentions for the activity of the new agency, section 5 sets out the primary statutory functions of the proposed authority, including the preparation of detailed proposals and plans for development, redevelopment, renewal or conservation of land, the management of State-owned land for its possible future development, the disposal of State-owned land on completion of its development, etc.  This heavy focus on physical redevelopment, land management and land disposal is not necessarily what was sought by the local community and was not the emphasis of the Mulvey report.</p> <p> The Mulvey report is clear that the primary issues faced in the north-east inner city are social and economic in nature, including policing and crime prevention, tackling crime and drugs, and maximising educational and training opportunities.  I emphasise that they should be training opportunities with job potential.  There are many young people out there who want new skills development opportunities that could lead on to jobs.  Other issues are those of creating local employment opportunities and creating an integrated system of social services.  It was more about an investment in people and services.  While we know regeneration is required as part of that, we have established the Land Development Agency to work on behalf of the Government with a regeneration role along with local authorities to drive that agenda.  We do not need another agency set up alongside that.  We need to continue to focus our efforts and resources on addressing these issues within the structures currently in place to ensure the successful community regeneration of this area of our capital city.</p> <p> I thank Deputy Lahart for again bringing to the attention of the House the issues faced by these communities.  While I might not agree with the Bill, I agree with having an ongoing conversation about and a focus on what we are trying to do here.  This debate gives us a chance to do that.  The Government is committed to the regeneration of this area for the benefit of its residents and visitors.  Progress is being made and is already evident in the area.  It is vital that there are no more false dawns for this community.  Going back to the various meetings we had in the communities, the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, was very clear that he was not there to give false hope or false dawns.  He was there to put in place long-term plans with short-term and medium-term gains but with a long-term ambition.</p> <p> Community engagement and support is vital for the regeneration effort to succeed and the structures that have been put in place will continue to have this at their core.  There is no lack of Government commitment when it comes to the regeneration of the north-east inner city.  The task force led by the Department of An Taoiseach and the senior officials group chaired by the Secretary General of the Department maintain an ongoing oversight role.  Dublin City Council has committed all the necessary resources for the project office.  Other key Government bodies are all participating in the implementation board and are assigning resources, including ring-fenced funding as necessary.  While I commend Deputy Lahart, it is important to point out the shortcomings of this Bill.  The proposed development authority is not what was sought and is not what is required to deliver for the community.</p></speech>

It recognises the decades of social and economic neglect the north inner city of Dublin has endured.  Fianna F&aacute;il is no doubt acutely aware of successive Governments' failure to deliver the political and policy decisions necessary to tackle the embedded inequalities in this part of our city.  The Deputy&rsquo;s party leader was a Cabinet member for 20 consecutive years, yet did nothing to address the social and economic challenges of the inner city.  In that time, no bright light was shone on the intergenerational poverty, unemployment and blockages to education experienced daily.  There was no dogged ongoing commitment to radically changing the outcomes for children and their families.  Let us imagine the positive, life-changing interventions that could have been delivered for this community over the course of two decades.  The Bill is a welcome albeit belated recognition by the Deputy of his party&rsquo;s historic failure to grip the declining fortunes of the inner city and hopefully it signals a new and long-term commitment to transforming the lives of those who live there.</p>  <p>  There are a number of current projects and challenges within the inner city that need urgent attention.  The regeneration of O'Devaney Gardens needs to be completed without any further delays.  We have yet to receive a completion date for the Croke Villas project.  The Department of Justice and Equality and Dublin City Council have failed to deliver on their commitment to develop an appropriate memorial at the Se&aacute;n McDermott Street site to the women who survived the Magdalen laundries.  This particular failure is truly astounding and gives an insight into the sometimes shallow response by the State when acknowledging the horrific treatment meted out to our most vulnerable women and children, very many of whom came from Dublin's north inner city.  Intergenerational unemployment has not been grappled, nor have the systematic flexible approaches and supports required to redirect early school leavers to education and training.  While progress has been made at a community policing level, the impact of criminal feuds and low-level crime in the inner city continues to have a deep and detrimental effect on peoples' sense of security and happiness.  We regularly hear from individuals and families who simply do not feel safe in their homes, in their blocks of flats or on their streets.</p>  <p>  There is a lack of ambition and vision at Government and council management level for the inner city and its long-term success.  For me, the refusal of the Government to engage with Dublin City Council to purchase Aldborough House typifies this failure.  Visitors to any modern city will see how sites like Aldborough House and Se&aacute;n McDermott Street&rsquo;s former Magdalen laundry can be creatively reimagined, often as self-financing cultural and historical sites enjoyed by locals and visitors alike.  Why must government at every level and the officials always seek to limit the aspirations for areas like the inner city?  Why is an approach of tinkering around the edges always favoured above deep, transformative change?  Why have they failed to work together to deliver the radical changes the community has cried out for?</p>  <p>  If an authority is to be established, it must never become yet another underperforming quango that fails to deliver for the long term.  That is my concern.  Sinn F&eacute;in will enable the passage of this legislation to the next Stage.  However, we do this on the basis that if it is to progress through the House we will submit very significant changes and amendments.  As it stands, it is merely a superficial nod to what needs to be done in the inner city, with all due respect.  The Bill provides that the authority will deliver social and economic regeneration, and improvements in areas like the physical environment.  It is intended that the authority will prepare a strategy for the regeneration of the area and promote investment by statutory bodies.  The spirit of these commitments is welcome, although arguably we should not need a new quango to achieve on these standard deliverables if there were a collective political will to do so.</p>  <p>  Section 5 of the Bill provides for enabling the authority to dispose of land that is in the ownership of the State on completion of its development, redevelopment, renewal or conservation.  This is a significant cause of concern and a provision that we could not accept should the Bill progress through the Oireachtas.  As the Deputy knows, this Bill cannot confer such a right on the authority.  Even if the Bill could bypass existing legislation that governs the disposal of public land, I would be surprised if his Dublin City Council colleagues would support the Deputy's intention to strip them of their democratic powers in this regard.</p><p>This concern is compounded by the Bill&rsquo;s sidelining of community representation on the authority&rsquo;s board.  This is what puzzles me most.  The Bill proposes having six Government officials, three State agency representatives, three business representatives and just three persons from the North Inner City Community Coalition.  A glaring omission is the lack of an official from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Anyone who knows Dublin's north inner city will know those are critical players to have around the table.<br/><br/>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, community leaders have called for the proposed authority to have an independent chair and yet the legislation does not provide for this.  The board does not include local elected representatives or experts in the various fields necessary to deliver the transformative public policy needed to address the community&rsquo;s imbedded challenges.  It is worth noting that all of the officials the legislation provides for are already working within the implementation group of the north-east inner city programme.<br/><br/>The legislation also commits to implement the recommendations of Kieran Mulvey&rsquo;s Dublin North East Inner City report.  I am unsure why the Deputy would seek to duplicate this same work which is ongoing.<br/><br/>I am also concerned that the Bill&rsquo;s limited provisions mirror the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act, which ended in tears.  Given the many failures and shortcomings associated with that project, surely any similar project should reflect the lessons learned from the past mistakes made by the Deputy&rsquo;s party.<br/><br/>I will work with any and all political representatives and State officials to deliver social and economic regeneration and improvements in the physical environment of Dublin's north inner city.  However, my ambition for this community is much greater than that outlined in the Bill.  As a Deputy honoured to be elected to represent the constituency, I understand that transformative change is required to ensure that we are the last generation of Deputies to raise the deeply sad and entirely avoidable social and economic inequalities that are written deep into the fabric of Dublin's north inner city.<br/><br/>We must radically decrease the number of early school leavers and address poverty, which is at the root of all of this.  Fluidity and flexibility are required in the delivery of all services, in particular health care and the supports necessary to extract people from the grip of drug addiction.  The State must support lone parents in their efforts to improve their lot through education, retraining and employment.<br/><br/>Delivery of social and affordable housing to include cost-rental homes must be ramped up.  So too must the quality of the homes within existing stock and future developments.  The Deputy knows as well as I do that too many public and private tenants are living in homes riddled with damp and mould.  They are tenement buildings in 2018.  Flats are so small that children have no kitchen table on which to do their homework.  This is an abiding theme of mine.  It might sound odd on first hearing.  These are homes with no kitchen table at which to do homework, have a meal at or have a gathering of the family.  What is that all about in 2018?  Teenagers and their parents have no privacy.  Adult children are sharing bedrooms with their Mam.  Homeless families spend months and sometimes years in emergency accommodation.<br/><br/>We must also demand the development of cultural, creative and historic spaces as a staple of any future development projects.  Officialdom needs to commit to an indepth and meaningful consultation with the community in all its parts to develop a long-term vision for Dublin's north inner city.  That needs to be more than just regeneration packages.  Regeneration is an important component, but only a single component of the objective to build a safe, sustainable, vibrant and hopeful community in Dublin's north inner city.<br/><br/>The deliverables from any authority need to be properly resourced.  If not, then all of this is just optics.  It means real investment in infrastructure, supports and people.  It means a real programme to eradicate poverty.  If these commitments are not hardwired into the legislation, this will end up being yet another meaningless Bill, delivered by a political party that felt it needed to engage in empty gesture politics in respect of the people I represent in Dublin's north inner city.  We can do better than that.<br/><br/>I believe James Connolly put it best and I say this on behalf of my constituents in Dublin's north inner city:</p><blockquote>For our demands most moderate are,<br /><br />We only want the earth.</blockquote><p>Crumbs from the table, however well intentioned, however polished the legislative language, are simply not enough.  Dublin's inner city needs investment.  We need decent housing, decent education, flexibility in how we deliver our services, belief and hope in our people.<br/><br/>We will give the legislation a fair wind and will not block it.  However, I am not convinced this is the panacea and I have pointed out some of its design flaws.  If political leadership in this Chamber believes that people in Dublin's north inner city, their advocates and community leaders will be appeased or satisfied by gesture politics and continuing sweet rhetoric, they are wrong.  We want results.  We want decent homes, decent work and a decent chance.  That means the Government needs to be prepared not to invest through a quango, but to invest directly in all those things.  That is the challenge for all of us.</p></speech>

We need a discussion on what is happening in Dublin's north inner city.</p>  <p>  The first principle of the legislation is that it needs to define the area.  I know the Bill is very much inspired by the Mulvey report, but the area identified in the Bill is roughly two and a half times the area covered by the Mulvey report.  That means the same amount of money would need to be spread over more than twice the area.  That aspect of the Bill needs to be addressed.  The Mulvey report area covers the north-east inner part of the city and even there some areas are not included, whereas, based on my reading, the area defined in the Bill goes into lower Phibsborough, the Phoenix Park and the north-west inner part of the city, including areas such as Oxmantown Road, Stoneybatter and Manor Street.  Some work needs to be done on that.</p>  <p>  I know Fianna F&aacute;il cannot do this because the Government would block the Bill, but we need an indication of the proposed funding.</p>  <p>  On the geographic area we are discussing, I point out that the north-west inner part of the city has had one of the biggest regeneration programmes under way for a long period of time.  I refer to the Grangegorman Development Authority and the development of the Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT.</p><p>The authority has been quite successful in incorporating local community activities and recognition into its schedule of activities.  It is an existing authority which has been in place for the best part of a decade.  If the people who drafted up the Bill were to visit the Grangegorman campus, I am sure they would be given a lot of food for thought.  There is a great deal of development going on in terms of student building, perhaps too much.  That also needs to be considered because there is a definite need for new social units - either apartments or houses - in the north inner city.  There are many examples as one goes down towards the quays of very successful social housing which was built in the 1990s and earlier and which is extremely successful and desirable.  There are good models of success within the area to which I refer but there are also places where there is much dereliction.  A couple of these have been mentioned.  I refer, for example, to Aldborough House, one of our most important Georgian buildings, which is now a wreck.  In the context of regeneration, pride of place in the Grangegorman area goes to Stoneybatter, where our former colleague, Joe Costello, has been particularly involved with the local community in putting on a series of events.</p> <p> The proposed development authority is Fianna F&aacute;il's suggestion of a model for areas that have been left behind.  I am delighted that there has been an immense recovery in employment.  What is equally clear - the Government has turned a deaf ear to it - is that because near full employment has returned in many places, there are now stand-out areas and groups that are being left behind.  Given that there is a special focus in this Bill, the approach is probably worth examining as a template for people and areas that have been left behind right.  On the southside of Dublin's inner city, in the area served by a colleague of mine, Councillor Rebecca Moynihan, one just has to drive up the hill to see that it is full of derelict sites, some of which local people have tried - with some success - to turn into gardens and green areas.  I am conscious that while the Bill refers to the north-east inner city, or perhaps the whole of the north inner city, there are lots of areas in the city that need support to have more recovery and employment, education, training and apprenticeship opportunities for young people, and the development of community and cultural activity.  That is really important.</p> <p> Where the Bill refers to the people who may serve on the development authority, there is no mention of either the Department of Education and Skills or Tusla.  The latter are both really important in the context of the north inner city.  Belvedere College is located in one part of the north inner city.  On the other side, children are leaving school early.  They are not being helped to go on further.  The Bill needs to deal with education and opportunity issues very clearly.  I say this as former Minister for Social Protection.  At this point, the model of community employment needs to be revamped.  We need to look at something like the jobs initiative that would give guaranteed employment for ten years or more.  I introduced a provision that allowed people on community employment, CE, schemes who reached the age of 62 to continue until 66.  That has been really popular right around the country.  With a bit of imagination, a Bill such as this could be used to rethink where we go with CE schemes in terms of key employment and community activity positions being made available for communities in Dublin and elsewhere that have been left behind.</p> <p> The Minister of State might be able to confirm that the Taoiseach will turn up in Dominick Street next week - perhaps in the company of the Minister of State - to again turn the sod on the derelict site.  The site at the bottom of Dominick Street, which is one of the locations covered by the Bill, is very large.  Why is the sod going to be turned again?  I have lost count of the number of Ministers and people in authority who have turned the sod at this site, which remains derelict.  Is what is proposed just a twinkle in somebody's eye or is it actually going to happen?  We had the spectacle not too long ago of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, the Taoiseach and perhaps the Lord Mayor standing on their own in the middle of O'Devaney Gardens with a few small signs that the building of 60 houses was about to commence.  Those houses would be very welcome but it should be borne in mind that, like Dominick Street, the site in question has been lying derelict for over 12 years.</p> <p> There is another issue about which I wish to ask the Minister of State.  The part of the north inner city we are discussing contains a huge number of people who have immigrated from countries right around the world.  It is also the home of Pavee Point - which is located in Mountjoy Square - the home of the Traveller movement in Ireland.  We need to think more widely.  The area is also the home of the Abbey Theatre and the Gate Theatre.  The cultural development and growth of the area is really important to how well it does in the future particularly for young people.  The area needs community police.  One would travel far in Dublin these days to see a community policeman or policewoman walking around a locality.</p></speech>

Dublin's inner city has been marginalised by inequality and the consequences of drug addiction.  It should not be defined by those things because it is a very decent community to live and work in.  What has happened there is the result of Government policies over the decades.</p>  <p>  Most people are in favour of regeneration but what kind of regeneration are we seeking?  Regeneration of areas has not always been good.  In some cases, it has been quite bad.  For example, the Dublin docklands have been completely gentrified.  People whose families have lived there for generations cannot afford to rent or buy apartments or houses in the area.  This is happening not only in Dublin but also in other communities across Europe.  People whose families have lived in areas for generations have been pushed out by high finance in order to make way for gentrification through the building of apartment and office blocks.  That is not what regeneration is about.  If regeneration is about a social dividend for the people who live in an area, then those responsible for the regeneration of the docklands got it dramatically wrong.  Urban renewal schemes enjoyed success in the context of specific areas being physically regenerated but evidence shows that they fail dramatically to address the socioeconomic difficulties of working class communities across the State.  Any regeneration process must be community-led, not developer-led.  I will refer again to the docklands where the regeneration was developer-led.  There have been some good regenerations for aesthetic and livelihood reasons but in terms of poverty and inequality it has been quite a failure.</p>  <p>  The Bill proposes that there be three places on the authority for community representatives.  This is an imbalance that has to be addressed.  It is proposed that there will be 15 members on the proposed authority.  If there are only three members to represent the community, there will be a major imbalance.  There has to be a balance in terms of the people from the community the proposed authority is supposed to benefit being represented.</p><p>That would be good.  We must learn the lessons from the past and present that regeneration can be good but it can also be an extreme failure, as has panned out in the docklands.  We welcome the discussion over the next couple of days.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.366" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="15:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400036#OO00200"><p>I went on an interesting walk on Sunday.  I would not say it was an historical walk but rather quite current.  I walked around the Dublin docklands area, looking at the development and destruction, as I define it, of what was a vibrant populated area that gave employment to a local community and where local inner-city people grew up and lived.  One of the most shocking things I saw was "the Berlin wall", as it is colloquially known, which is an old wall behind Amiens Street that divides the people of Sheriff Street from those who live in these &euro;350,000-plus apartments.  I was given a list of what it costs to rent there and it is astronomical.  It costs more than &euro;3,500 a month for a three-bedroom property and &euro;2,800 a month for a two-bedroom property.  The wall reminded me of the peace wall in Ardoyne that divides the loyalist side of the community from the republican side.  On top of the wall in the docklands, there is a wire net, probably the length of the panes of glasses above us in the Gallery, that prevents people from the Sheriff Street side flinging objects over the wall at the people on the posh side.  It is a statement of the class divide that has been created, maintained and stabilised in what used to be the hardworking local community that lived and worked by the docks.</p>  <p>  The Bill reminds me somewhat of Groundhog Day or the popular definition of insanity, where one tries to do something again in the very same way while expecting a different result.  It is a Fianna F&aacute;il solution to a Fianna F&aacute;il problem because it was the party that established the original Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, and allowed hectares of public land be sold off cheaply to developers like Johnny Ronan, who is a contributor to Fianna F&aacute;il's coffers, and others, whom we bailed out through the National Asset Management Agency over the exorbitant loans and expenditure that were given to them to plough into the area.  Even though this is dressed up as being about renewal, economic and social regeneration and improvements in the physical environment, it is actually repeating the development-led possibilities in areas where, as there is a bit of public land, the developers can go for it.</p>  <p>  Only a small community gain results from those developments around the docks.  Where a gain exists, it was hard fought for by the local communities, not least women who occupied spaces to say they wanted social housing to be put there instead.  It is interesting to see it at first hand because one might pass through it on the Luas and think there are many modern flats but, in fact, there is a legacy and history of bad planning and one-sided economic development that completely ignored the local community.</p>  <p>  I listen to the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, on the radio quite frequently because of Brexit.  He was a Deputy in the area and the leader of the Fianna F&aacute;il party at the time that it established the DDDA in 1997.  All the local community got from that, however, was 390 social housing units out of a predicted 2,200 units, which was a real disaster for the local community.  Furthermore, the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, which was supposed to be the creator of jobs for the area, employs hardly anybody from the area.  Of the tens of thousands of companies that are located there, many of them are just brass-plated companies which nobody works for but which are located there to avail of our low corporation tax and so on.</p>  <p>  The legislation before us also reminds me of what is happening to an area where I used to live, namely, the Liberties, which is close to my heart.  It is a terrible travesty to see the oldest, most historic and once vibrant community with many marketplaces, such as the Iveagh Market, being destroyed by developer-led policies that are being repeated.  There are apartotels and student accommodation coming out of our ears, which uproots local communities who cannot afford to continue to live in the area and who are being swallowed up by all this development.  While Dublin's inner city has seen a rush of planning applications and fast-tracking of planning systems, it has been passed by by elected representatives and any meaningful engagement by the local communities, which is a real shame.  The sole interest is profit and the needs of the local community and the environment for the vibrancy and existence of our city are ignored.  What Fianna F&aacute;&iacute;l proposes will become a repeat of the past because of its connection with developers and builders.  This will be a developer-led policy rather than a community-led policy.  Unless there is development around the city that is about the people first, we will destroy what was once a beautiful and vibrant city, which is the direction in which Dublin is heading.  I will reject this plan because it is not what is needed, especially in a part of the city that has suffered tremendous vandalism by the wealthy.</p></speech>

It is in that context that I look at what is proposed today.  They agreed "the Gregory deal", although Tony always disliked the word "deal" and for him it was a programme.  He was able to negotiate a programme because he was in the enviable position of holding the balance of power and his vote would decide who the next Taoiseach, and consequently the next Government, would be.  The area he represented, which is part of the Bill, had been under-represented, misrepresented or not represented at all until then.  It took the independent voice of Tony Gregory, with the community support he had, to negotiate a programme he hoped would make a real difference to issues such as housing, unemployment, education and health that remain with us today.</p>  <p>  His proposal for housing was a major investment in the construction industry with specific targets in house building and an immediate commencement of 400 units.  The programme would provide for additional craftsmen to work with Dublin City Council and a special fund to acquire land for long-term housing purposes.  There would be a tax on derelict sites, office development, banks and financial institutions on development land which would contribute to the funding required.  In the health sector, it showed that it was not a parochial document because it proposed free medical cards for all social welfare pensioners, action for Travellers, and regular rigorous inspections of institutions caring for children, the elderly and those with a disability.  In education, it would provide for better teacher-pupil ratios, psychological services, home-school liaison officers, measures for the transition from school to work and youth projects.</p>  <p>  It also contained a proposal for an inner-city development authority, which is significant in today's context.  It would have its own fund, its own authority and specific areas with which to deal.  The initial budget envisaged in 1982 was in excess of IR&pound;2 million.  The chairperson was to have a background in public affairs or business, would have been nominated by Tony and would have had the power to nominate five other members.  There would be representatives from various public bodies, some of which no longer exist, representing industry, labour, finance, environment, the Industrial Development Authority and An Chomhairle Oili&uacute;na, as well as others who had special knowledge of the north inner city.</p>  <p>  So much of the programme was negotiated by Tony, his brother Noel, Mick Rafferty and Fergus McCabe.  It had a transformative potential and one can imagine the difference it would have made if it had had a significant lifespan.  The work began and, eventually, the Larkin Community College was established, but six months later the Haughey Government was voted out of office.  What followed was indifference and neglect from successive Governments, creating an environment in which the drug trade flourished, which devastated communities and tore families apart.  The schools, youth projects and drug projects persevered, however, and regrettably in the times of economic distress and recession they bore the brunt with the massive cuts they faced.  I do not know why communities like the north inner city suffer disproportionately in a recession but that was the result of the decisions made by the political parties here.  The statistics and data are skewed by the presence of the IFSC, but the statistics for the area itself suggest high numbers of unemployed people and lone parents.</p><p>While there have been improvements in accession rates to third level education, they are still far below the national average.  There is serious overcrowding in housing and it is inappropriate.  Then there is addiction, open drug dealing, intimidation and drug debt which all lead to violence and murders.  When I read this Bill, therefore, I must ask what difference it will make to the lives of those who live in the north inner city.  </p> <p> There is another context in which to consider the Bill, namely the programme implementation board, PIB, that was initiated by the Government following the violence.  Under the chairmanship of Michael Stone, it comprises senior representatives from Departments and the local community.  The link between the 1982 Gregory deal and the PIB is Fergus McCabe who is in the Visitors' Gallery this evening.  One possibility for the Bill is that the more formal structure it proposes could have a better chance of delivering what is necessary to bring about the transformation that the Gregory deal would have brought had successive Governments supported it and not abandoned the communities.  Unfortunately, there was no interest in doing that until the outbreak of violence and the murders happened.  I criticise the lack of elements of a social programme and there is no recognition of the drugs context out of which everything came.  There is also the possibility that it might become merely another development company with an SDZ aspect, which would facilitate inappropriate fast-track planning, much of which has not benefitted residents to date.  There is also a danger of it becoming a bureaucratic quango that will make no difference but will create more problems.  There have been enough examples of this in the past.  </p> <p> If the legislation progresses, the provisions that are required can be addressed on Committee Stage.  The serving officers from the Department will have to be senior serving officers.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla will have to be represented because we know the impact of what is happening on the young people, children and teenagers in the north inner city.</p> <p> In parts of that area, 50% of the population comprises members of new communities.  There is no reference to their integration or representation.  Three people from the local community is too few.  The North Inner City Community Coalition was mentioned but there must be a specific democratic process for their selection.  Three quarters of whatever number is agreed should be designated for those living in the area for some time, as they know what is needed.  The chairperson must also be independent.  If successful, it must build on the PIB, and include its chairman, as it is involved in the issues.</p> <p> Finally, what is happening in the north inner city is not happening on its own, so whatever emerges there can be used a blueprint for other areas of disadvantage.</p></speech>

I initially wondered if it was about promoting Mary Fitzpatrick or was it another version of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, or had Fianna F&aacute;il experience a conversion on their road from Damascus.</p>  <p>  The authority's main function is the regeneration of the local area and the implementation the recommendations of the Mulvey report.  Another function referred to in the Bill is the management of land that is in the ownership of the State which happens to be located in the area.  It smacks of the Land Development Agency.  Sadly the horse has bolted on this as a State authority, NAMA, owned the majority of development land in the area.  NAMA held an interest in 75% of the 22 ha. located in the docklands, which amounted to 15 sites, the majority of which has been developed for commercial purposes or unaffordable apartments.  It now appears that the residential building on these sites will not even benefit the local community as Dublin City Council has decided not to seek the 10% social housing allocation it is entitled to in such developments.  NAMA officials boast that the agency's social dividend will come from the &euro;3.5 billion that they will receive from the loans that they bought from the State, but they fail to mention that they have lost approximately &euro;20 billion as a result of their management and behaviour.  </p>  <p>  This looks so like the DDDA that it is rather scary.  I will give an example of what was going on there.  There was a development on Castleforbes Road where the council did not want apartments on the ground level.  The DDDA overruled the council, because it was allowed and did not have to abide by the city rules.  However, it turned out that Castleforbes Road was in a flood area and they were not allowed to put the apartments there.  To this day, the ground floor remains vacant.  It is scary what can happen.  If the city council is not fit for purpose, namely to manage the area properly, we should ask why that is.  If it not fit for purpose, why do we not fix it?</p>  <p>  I refer to the DDDA's involvement in the Glass Bottle site.  There was a partnership between the State and private sector, but only one side lost when it went belly up, and that was the State.  It is absolute madness.</p>  <p>  It would be great if this area was properly designed but this can be done through the public authority, if we fix its problems and make it fit for purpose so things can be done properly.</p>  <p>  I have heard no mention of creating indigenous industry or work in the area or anything about creating apprenticeships or getting the local kids involved in projects.  I heard nothing about the provision of affordable housing there or a fair share of social housing that would meet the needs of the community, nor do I see it on the agenda.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.370" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="16:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400037#PP00300"><p>I commend Deputy John Lahart, whose relations are all from Tipperary and who are good people, who has been instrumental in bringing this Bill forward.  I am sure that it is an honest effort by the Deputy and others to do something with this part of Dublin.  I listened with interest to the two previous speakers, particularly Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan who replaced the late Deputy Tony Gregory who was instrumental in that deal.  I remember it well.  I was involved in the Soldiers of Destiny at that time.  It is a pity to think that the Gregory deal ended after that election and that everything was thrown to the wolves or lions and left there.</p><p>The Bill seeks to make provision for the regeneration of the area of Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city, although I must admit that I am not fully <i>au fait </i>with that part of the city, and for that purpose to provide for the establishment of a body to be known as the Dublin inner city development authority to oversee that regeneration.</p><p>There has been regeneration in Limerick and other places which badly need it but, unfortunately, it takes a long time  Funding and commitment are needed as well as inter-agency involvement but, most important, the involvement of the community.  The daoine &oacute;ga, as Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan observed, comprise such a significant proportion of the population that they must be brought with us.  Mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;.  They must be brought with us as well as the volunteers and people on the ground.</p><p>I recognise that there are many areas of Dublin, particularly in the inner city, that demand immediate attention.  We are all aware of the impact of the horrendous gangland feuds that continue to make life a misery for entire communities.  They were allowed get far too out of hand.  We must be careful in areas such as my own county and that of the Minister of State.  Issues relating to drugs and gangs are festering and gaining strength.  If they are not dealt with, we will also experience many of these issues.</p><p>I am not sure how the gangland issue should be addressed given the recent ban on Garda overtime but perhaps that is a matter for another day.  I welcome the new Garda Commissioner and wish him well but the first thing he did was banned overtime.  The news reports and spin doctors tell us there is no cut in overtime in Dublin for dealing with these people, and rightly so.  They should be followed to the ends of the earth, for 25 hours a day if there were that many hours, and sat on, but we must also think about those who need resources to follow young people who often have connections to these gangs in Dublin.  There are certain famous families whose names we all know but we cannot utter their names, like the song &ldquo;Michael Collins&rdquo;; while we must respect and nurture young people, these must be rooted out.  Yesterday I met a young friend of mine, whose 15 year old has been offered drugs in the form of tablets in her school in Cashel.  It is so sad.  This is all linked to these gangs, from whom it percolates down to youngsters, people younger than this 15 year old who would offer her those tablets or drugs.  It is a lucrative business.  It is shocking and it is happening in rural and urban Tipperary.</p><p> I raised a similar matter on Leaders' Questions this morning when I referred to a comparative study commissioned by Jobs for Tipp - a new organisation set up to try to something for Tipperary town and west Tipperary of which I am a member - and written by Ms Lisa English.  The study compares levels of deprivation in south Tipperary and the north-east inner city of Dublin.  The findings are quite startling.  I could not believe them.  They are truly disturbing.  The report indicates that Tipperary east, Tipperary west, Clonmel west and Carrick-on-Suir - which is located quite close to the Minister of State's constituency - all score highest on the Pobal index of deprivation, above some of these places in Dublin.  I am not anti-Dublin and i am not trying to take from this Bill.  However, we must recognise deprivation wherever it exists, whether it be in urban or rural Tipperary or Dublin's inner city.  The report also concludes that the levels of deprivation in the towns of Tipperary, Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir are far in excess of those which obtain in inner city Dublin.  That is startling.  We have excellent communities and volunteer groups in those towns.  In Tipperary town, for example, there is the MooreHaven centre for people with disabilities which employs 130 people.  We have a wonderful Tipperary co-operative that has remained small and local and that employs more than 100 people.  There is also the Canon Hayes community resource centre and the Knockancrawley resource centre.  We have a great community involvement in all of these and the spirit of the late great Canon Hayes lives on.</p> <p> If a special vehicle such as that to which the Bill refers is to be established, as I informed the Taoiseach earlier, we have community people ready and willing to participate.  They are doing the work, filling out application forms and looking after those vulnerable communities and assisting them will all kinds of issues ranging from the cradle to the grave.  I asked the Taoiseach to approve one option which I believe would demonstrate a real commitment on the Government's part to County Tipperary.  It is similar to what Teachta Lahart is trying to do in his Bill in the context of this city.</p> <p> Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, consideration can be given to the creation of a strategic development zone in south and west County Tipperary to help tackle deprivation and to attract small-scale job creation in places such as Tipperary town.  It is the same as what is to be found in this city.  We have to deal with it and we have to take a focused approach.  As we know, such zones have been very successful, as an Teachta&iacute; Maureen O'Sullivan and Lahart would know, in places like Cherrywood and the docklands.</p> <p> I can certainly see the merits of the proposals contained in this Fianna F&aacute;il Bill introduced by Deputy Lahart.  We are seeking ways to create structures that will advance our communities and, in particular, those communities which have consistently levels of high deprivation.  It is no different from this city.  It is alarming to think that, but there is no difference between the part of this city on which Deputy Lahart's Bill focuses and areas in some of those towns in Tipperary.</p> <p> We have the community infrastructure in place.  The Knockonrawley, Canon Hayes and MooreHaven recreation centres in Tipperary town have been in operation for decades.  They have shown us the roadmap of how to look after communities, vulnerable people, those with disabilities and individuals who are poorly educated.  There is an excellent school system, both at primary and secondary level, in Tipperary town and Carrick-on-Suir.  The Carrick-on-Suir Development Association, CoSDA is a wonderful organisation.  It is timely that I speaking on this Bill and support this work in Dublin but I also want a smattering - a smithereen - of the money to go to these designated areas.  I am referring to designated areas, not the entire county.  We are a proud people in Tipperary.  We do not all put out our hands and beg.  We want bang for our buck.  We want a bit of equality.</p> <p> Deputy Wallace referred to some of what was done wrong by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  These things go on with the big super quangos.  We do not want that.  We want ownership of these special vehicles by the community and to have bottom-up development and not to be talking of all those agencies.  I am referring to the daoine &oacute;ige, the volunteers in the communities and the development organisations.  I am sure those in Dublin are no different from their counterparts in Tipperary.  Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan and Lahart will know of them.  They are ordinary people trying to better themselves and make their lives and those of their families a little better despite the horrendous pressure they are under from drug gangs, etc.</p> <p> We know what NAMA is.  I am not happy with what it has done.  NAMA controls 75% of the available land in the Dublin City Council area.  It should not have that control.  It should be disposed of at this stage.  NAMA should never have been set up, as far as I am concerned.  History books will be written about it and there will be investigations into it.  People who has properties in Clonmel that were in NAMA now have them back again and they are laughing all the way to the bank.  They will be huge question marks over NAMA when the history of the Minister's time in office and that of his predecessors is written.  On the night NAMA was established, I stated that it was like a wild animal - a wild deer - being released into the woods and no one would know where it would end up.  We still do not know where NAMA is going to end up and there are major questions about it.</p> <p> The focus must be on setting up what is proposed in the Bill, which I support, and then to consider extending it to other areas - not only Tipperary, although I have focused on the country - and establish specific task forces to deal with the issues.  People will help themselves if they get a bit of cabhr&uacute;, a small leg up on the ladder.</p></speech>

For too long, the communities in the north-east inner city did not receive the supports that were needed.  In that context, the view was that what could work in certain placed would always work elsewhere.  That approach has not worked and it is one to which I am committed and determined to change.  Like Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan and my constituency colleague, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, who spoke earlier, I have a deep sense of privilege in and commitment to representing those citizens and to doing more and doing better on their behalf.</p><p>This leads me to my first point, namely, what has happened since the community that I represent was wrecked by a cycle of murder and mayhem.  When gathering information for his report, Mr. Kieran Mulvey went through an extensive and non-political consultative process.  He then made a set of recommendations and proposed a structure that has been honoured and implemented by the Government.  A process was undertaken that led to a particular recommendation that was delivered, which, fundamentally, was specific to the communities of the north inner city and which recognised that their involvement in this work is the only way in which sustainable progress can be made.</p><p>I do not need the words or work of others to remind me why we need to make this progress.  When I meet schoolchildren and the elderly and see how proud they are of the areas in which they have grown up or are growing up and the fear but also the hope they have about the future, it is a reminder of why we cannot lose sight of what we need to deliver for these communities.  We have not yet delivered.  The work of the American social thinker and writer, David Brooks, could not be more relevant to the work we are doing there.  He states:</p><blockquote>It could be that the neighbourhood, not the individual, is the essential unit of social change.  If you're trying to improve lives, maybe you have to think about changing many elements of a single neighbourhood, in a systemic way, at a steady pace.</blockquote><p>That is my second point.  That is what we are working so hard to do.  </p><p>I draw the House's attention to the progress report for the north-east inner city for 2017.  There is a second report on the way for 2018.  The value of this report is not what is contained in the main text but, rather, the information in the appendices, which lay out, by policy area, the detailed interventions that are happening, along with the funding that is needed in order to make a difference to the citizens who I am privileged to represent and to respond to their needs in a new way.  I could go through all the different points of intervention that are laid down.</p><p>I could go through how they are funded and delivered but I have a limited time.  However, I will make one point that the most important interventions we can make are the ones that are not always visible.  It is what we do in schools, in parishes and in the family home.  The breadth of work on this already under way through community involvement and co-ordination from the Dublin north-east inner city task force is happening.  I can understand why this might be not good enough for some because invisible change is always the easiest about which to be sceptical.  However, one must look at the physical changes under way such as the new primary care centre in Summerhill, the redevelopment of St. Mary's Mansions, Sean McDermott Street, and the significant investment in upgrading the Lourdes day care centre on Lower Sean McDermott Street.  Only this week, the new plans for Rutland Street school were shared with the groups and the staff at the school.  There is work under way in all the schools in this part of the city.  This is physical and visible work.  New childcare facilities have been put in place on Oriel Street.  This is physical, tangible and real change.</p> <p> This is happening through a structure that is independent of me as Minister for Finance.  It is independently chaired by Michael Stone with community involvement and with all relevant State bodies and agencies represented on it.  This is a structure specific to Dublin&rsquo;s north-east inner city.  Nobody should kid themselves if this legislation goes beyond Second Stage.  Every Deputy who has a similar area in his or her constituency would come forward with amendments to change the legislation to say that this group should be specific to their area.</p></speech>

The reason I am so concerned about this approach is that we have had it before with the docklands in this constituency.  We have had new bodies put in place whose main role over time has become themselves.  I do not want to see that happen for this part of Dublin city and a community which I am lucky enough to represent.  Even if such a body did not repeat the mistakes similar bodies made for which too many individuals and communities in my constituency have already borne the cost, we may still end up with an organisation whose breadth is so broad that it will have priorities which may stretch well beyond the north-east inner city.</p>  <p>  I appreciate the intentions and the good faith of those who brought forward this legislation.  It is a source of regret to me, however, that the bipartisan approach we have used to date to support this part of our city could not have been maintained.  It is a source of regret to me that those on the north-east inner city task force were not consulted or made aware of this.  It is also a regret to me that we did not look at what is honouring a recommendation in the Mulvey report and, based on the work already under way, see how we can improve it further.</p>  <p>  We have statutory bodies and many different State agencies already in place in this part of the constituency which I am privileged to represent.  The job is how we can integrate them and lead them in such way that does not squeeze the community out.  If we are not doing that properly, then that should be the source of scrutiny and debate.  Before we go down the route of assuming the answer to this is a new agency, we have many steps to evaluate before we get to that point.</p>  <p>  I am optimistic about the progress we can make.  We can point to what has been achieved to date and what more we want to achieve.  I am committed, as a Deputy and a member of the Government, to ensuring we put in place the resources needed to respond to the needs of the community.  We have done this.  Next year alone, on top of the funding and support already in place, a further &euro;6.5 million will be made available to the body in question to respond to the needs it has identified.  That is the work we are committed to doing.  I, for one, as I know will be the case with my other public representative colleagues, remain committed to working with all in our community to ensure the citizens there, young or old, get the chances they deserve and the opportunities in their lives which reflect the resilience, the strength and the positivity of a rich network of communities and families in the Dublin Central constituency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.379" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1311" speakername="John Lahart" time="16:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400039#RR00400"><p>I thank the Minister for attending.  I thought he was overly defensive but I do not want to get into a tit-for-tat with him because I want to focus on the Bill.  On consultation, if this Bill goes to Committee Stage, as I hope it will, there are many opportunities for consultation through public representatives.  It does not end here and did not end before it came in here.  This has emerged from consultation with people who feel excluded from the process.</p>  <p>  The Minister was concerned that this is a model which people will want to replicate.  One of the reasons I have been enthusiastic about it is that I represent a constituency which is not unlike the Minister&rsquo;s.  However, while most people in Ireland have, at some stage, travelled through the Minister's constituency, few have travelled through parts of west Tallaght or north Clondalkin.  I would love to see a model like this where a statutory agency was brought in - not just transplanted - to meet the needs of the people in my constituency.  I would love to see a Mulvey-like investigation into areas in my constituency and others.</p>  <p>  What is wrong with replicating that?  One of the lessons we have learned is the cost of not doing it is significant.  The Minister is right to be proud of the work of the former Taoiseach, as well as the personal interest he took in this.  That was precisely what it was, namely, a personal interest.  The Minister should not underestimate the fact that this is his constituency and that, as Minister for Finance, he controls the Government&rsquo;s purse strings.  What happens when he is gone, however?  What happens if his successor does not have as a big an interest in Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city?  That is the fundamental question that the Bill is trying to address.  It is trying to ensure that for a period of ten years - not forever - that whoever comes and goes, this body will not be subject to the whims, passions and interests of any particular politician but is put on a statutory basis.</p>  <p>  Deputies Maureen O'Sullivan, McDonald, Burton, Br&iacute;d Smith and Gino Kenny highlighted the flexibility for what needs to be done with the board.  They are the experts and have come through this, particularly Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan.  This is not coming from this side of the House exclusively or from one political party.  This has arisen from the community.</p><p>Everyone keeps talking about the bad old days and the DDDA.  While it did some work, it ran into controversy and I cannot, and will not, defend some of the things it did.  However, I attended a function recently at which the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, spoke passionately about the great regeneration taking place in another part of his constituency, namely Grangegorman.  That is one of Bertie Ahern's great legacies to the city, but no one ever mentions that.  People always talk about the stuff that went wrong.  Any city would be proud of what is happening in Grangegorman, which was previously a derelict and run-down site.  It is backed up by a statutory agency to ensure it achieves its potential and that development would grace any city.  It is a spectacular space and it is only getting better.  That is what we want to do under this Bill.  We want to ensure that everything is driven by a statutory agency.</p> <p> A number of issues were raised by colleagues and I would be the first to put my hands up and say that there might be some clumsy language in the Bill.  However, it is easy to overcome that.  One or two Departments may have been omitted, including the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, but all those issues can be rectified as they are not insurmountable.  The geographical area mentioned is much larger.  Kieran Mulvey did great work but he is gone.  Deputy Enda Kenny took a particular interest in it as Taoiseach, but he is gone.  Meanwhile, the Minister does not appreciate fully the importance of his role and the power he has as both Minister for Finance and a Deputy for the constituency.  I would love to be the Minister for Finance and in a position to back up commitments for west Tallaght by pulling the purse strings.</p> <p> The anxiety of the community in this case has been expressed by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan.  People want to know what can be done to ensure this is not just a passing phase.  They want to avoid a situation where those who have invested a great deal of time and interest in this move on and something else takes precedence.  The current Taoiseach is not as committed to this as the previous Taoiseach.  That is not a criticism.  I can see clearly that the Minister for Finance is committed to it but the current Taoiseach has other items on his agenda.  In summary and without rehearsing everything again, the fundamental objective of the Bill is to put regeneration on a statutory footing, broaden the area to ensure people are not excluded and to ensure it is driven for a period of ten years.  It not just a matter of economic regeneration but of social, educational and welfare improvements for the benefit of the people of this particular area.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.388" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" time="16:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400040#SS00900"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  The main purpose of this Bill is to provide the legislative framework for the implementation of the social protection measures contained in budget 2019.  These include the &euro;5 increase in the maximum rate of all weekly social welfare payments as well an important reform of the increases for qualified children to allow for a higher rate of payment in respect of children age 12 and over, as well as a significant increase in both payment rates.  The Bill reflects the ongoing strong commitment of the Government to restoring and maintaining the value of core welfare payment rates.  Equally, the Bill demonstrates our commitment to introducing changes that can deliver an impact in the alleviation of poverty for those groups most at risk.  That is why we have again increased all core weekly payment rates by &euro;5.</p>  <p>  Crucially, we have also focused on measures for families with children.  Provisions are included in the Bill, which provide for the continued payment of the domiciliary care allowance, DCA, for three months in cases where the child being cared for passes away and for increases in the weekly earnings disregard for recipients of the one-parent family payment.  While some budget measures are not covered by legislation, they will also have an important impact.  These include the increase of &euro;25 in the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance, for instance, as well as the introduction of a disregard for maintenance payments for the working family payment.  These measures will provide a great deal of help to families.  Other important measures announced in the budget, including the extension of jobseeker's benefit to the self-employed and the introduction of a paid parental benefit scheme, will be legislated for next year and prior to their formal introduction before the end of 2019.</p>  <p>  Some other matters are also being legislated for in the Bill.  The most significant of these concerns changes which will have a positive effect for many of those who were awarded less than the maximum rate of the State contributory pension following changes to the rate bands introduced by the Oireachtas in 2012.  It is a project we call T12 and a great deal of work has been undertaken over recent months on it.  My Department has begun to issue letters to more than 70,000 resident contributory pensioners and plans to issue a further 8,000 letters to non-resident pensioners in December.  The letter will explain the review process and inform pensioners that the Department will contact them directly with the outcome of their individual pension review.</p>  <p>  The House will recall that the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill was published in May 2017 and contained key measures relating to defined benefit pension schemes.  These measures will act to support existing provisions in the Pensions Act and will provide for further protection for scheme members' benefits and enhance employer responsibilities for their schemes.  The defined benefit pension provisions are technical and involve complex policy issues.  With a view to ensuring we end up with a solution that is resilient and effective, it has been necessary to carefully consider various aspects of these policies.  When these matters have been resolved and amendments approved by Government, an early date for Committee Stage will be requested.  In the interim, we are providing in the Bill before the House for the essentially technical issues covered by the earlier Bill to progress them.</p>  <p>  An important amendment to the Pensions Act is being provided for, which I expect will be welcomed by all Members.  Section 20 contains provisions to provide a right of entitlement to spousal pension benefits in certain circumstances to same-sex couples where the scheme member could not have entered into a legally recognised relationship such as marriage or civil partnership, with his or her partner because the relevant legislation, namely the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 and the Marriage Act 2015, had not been enacted.  The purpose of the provisions is to deal with an issue highlighted in a case brought by Dr. David Parris to the Labour Court, which was then the subject of a reference to the Court of Justice of the European Union.  Dr. Parris retired prior to same-sex relationships being legally recognised within the State as the relevant legislation to provide for legal recognition of such relationships had not come into force.  I take this opportunity to thank publicly Dr. Parris, the members of the Pensions Equality group and Members for their work in highlighting the position of same-sex couples in this regard.</p>  <p>  The Bill also includes some largely technical changes, which had been provided for originally in the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017.  The amendments provide for the implementation of administrative efficiencies within my Department.  I stress that I remain committed to proceeding as soon as possible with that Bill.</p>  <p>  I turn now to a brief outline of each of the provisions contained in this Bill.  Section 1 provides for the Short Title, its construction and citations and the commencement provisions.</p><p>Section 2 provides for definitions of terms used in Part 2 of the Bill, which relates to amendments of the Social Welfare Acts.</p> <p> Section 3 provides for an increase of &euro;10, from &euro;376 to &euro;386, in the reckonable earnings threshold for employees where employer PRSI contributions are paid at the lower rate of 7.8%.  This change reflects the increase in the minimum wage from &euro;9.50 to &euro;9.80 per hour from 1 January 2019 and will ensure that the same proportion of employers&rsquo; contributions is paid at the lower rate.</p> <p> Section 4 provides for the necessary changes in respect of PRSI collection to reflect the introduction in January 2019 by the Revenue Commissioners of a real-time system in place of the current monthly-annual return system.  Under the new system, a return to Revenue will be required on each occasion a worker is paid.  The amendment will take effect from 1 January 2019.</p> <p> Sections 5 to 7, inclusive, provide for the increased weekly rate of maternity benefit, adoptive benefit and paternity benefit with effect from 25 March 2019.</p> <p> Section 8 sets out the proportionate increases in the rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit which are payable where the average reckonable weekly earnings are less than a prescribed amount.  The new rates take effect from 21 March 2019.</p> <p> I mentioned that the Bill contains the necessary legislative basis to allow us to proceed to apply an alternative method, entitled the aggregated contributions method, for determining entitlement to the State pension (contributory) for persons who attained pensionable age on or after 1 September 2012, and who, under the existing yearly average method, are not entitled to a State pension (contributory) at the full rate.  These are set out in section 9 of the Bill.  I will be introducing a minor amendment to the provisions of section 9 to ensure that these positive changes can be applied to those in receipt of mixed insurance records, that is, people who have worked in both the private and public sectors.  This amendment is currently being finalised with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.</p> <p> Sections 10 and 11 address a gap in the current legislation to ensure that a person who was in the care of the State on attaining the age of 18 is fully exempted from the age-related reduced-rate payments of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or supplementary welfare allowance.  Currently, the exemption expires when the claimant concerned attains the age of 25, while the age-related reduced rates continue to apply until age 26.</p> <p> Section 12 of the Bill responds directly to an issue which was raised with me at the pre-budget forum some months ago.  It provides that domiciliary care allowance will continue to be paid for three months in those cases where the child in respect of whose care the allowance is being paid passes away.  We already have a similar provision in the case of the carer&rsquo;s allowance and I am pleased to be able to extend that approach to recipients of domiciliary care allowance under the Bill.</p> <p> Section 13 is one of the technical amendments which we are lifting from the 2017 Bill and simply provides that decisions to award a social welfare benefit or payment which is to the benefit of a claimant, that is, a positive decision, may be made by an automated information system.  Just as importantly, it also provides that decisions which deny entitlement to a benefit or payment may only be made by a deciding officer.</p> <p> Section 14 provides for the formal repeal of the prescribed relative allowance, a legacy scheme which has been closed to new applicants since the introduction in 1990 of the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  The last claim for this payment closed in 2017.</p> <p> Section 15 and Schedule 1 provide for the necessary amendments throughout the Act to cater for the introduction of separate rates of the qualified child increase for children aged under 12 and those who are 12 years or over.  This approach reflects the fact that research has consistently identified that older children have additional and different needs to children in younger age groups.</p> <p> Section 16 together with Schedule 2 provide for new rates of social insurance benefits.  All maximum weekly insurance-based pensions and benefits, including State pension (contributory), widow&rsquo;s pension (contributory), widower&rsquo;s pension (contributory), surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (contributory), invalidity pension, carer&rsquo;s benefit, maternity benefit, paternity benefit, health and safety benefit, adoptive benefit, illness benefit, injury benefit, jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, guardian&rsquo;s payment (contributory) and disablement pension are to be increased by &euro;5, with proportionate increases for those in receipt of reduced-rate payments.  Proportionate increases for qualified adult dependants are also provided for, along with an increase of &euro;2.20 for children aged under 12 and &euro;5.20 per week for children aged 12 and over in the qualified child increase.  These measures come into effect on dates between 21 March 2019 and 29 March 2019.</p> <p> Section 17 is one of the measures taken from the 2017 Bill and responds to a recommendation in the Make Work Pay report published last year under the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities.  In practical terms, the section dispenses with the practice of distinguishing between employment of a rehabilitative nature and work more generally for recipients of disability allowance, blind pension and some recipients of supplementary welfare allowance.  In addition to making it easier for recipients of those payments to take up employment opportunities, this measure will also reduce the administrative workload for GPs and some staff of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p> <p> Section 18 provides for an increase in the earnings disregard for one-parent family payment from &euro;130 to &euro;150 per week with effect from 28 March 2019.  The effect of this measure will be to increase the amount of money that a lone parent will receive from employment without it reducing his or her social welfare payment.</p> <p> Section 19, together with Schedule 3, provides for new rates of social assistance payments.  All maximum weekly allowances, including State pension (non-contributory), widow&rsquo;s pension (non-contributory), widower&rsquo;s pension (non-contributory), surviving civil partner&rsquo;s pension (non-contributory), jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, disability allowance, carer&rsquo;s allowance, one-parent family payment, guardian&rsquo;s payment (non-contributory), farm assist and supplementary welfare allowance are to be increased by &euro;5, with proportionate increases for those in receipt of reduced rate payments.  Proportionate increases for qualified adult dependants are also provided for, along with an increase of &euro;2.20 for children aged under 12 and &euro;5.20 per week for children aged 12 and over in the qualified child increase.  These measures come into effect on dates between 20 March 2019 and 29 March 2019.</p> <p> Section 20, as I mentioned, provides a right of entitlement, in certain circumstances, to spousal pension benefits for same sex spouses and civil partners who are members of occupational pension schemes.  These transitional provisions provide that where a defined benefit pension scheme has set as a condition for entitlement to a spouse&rsquo;s pension that a scheme member must have been married or entered into a civil partnership prior to reaching a certain age or date of retirement, the scheme member will be deemed to satisfy that requirement where he or she satisfies certain specified conditions such as: the scheme member must have been in a committed relationship with the beneficiary at the time he or she reached the age or the date of retirement set out in the scheme rules; the scheme member must have entered into a civil partnership with, or married, the beneficiary within the specified period; and any contributions required for the purpose of obtaining entitlement to such benefits have been paid into the scheme.</p> <p> Sections 21 to 23, inclusive, relate to the Civil Registration Acts and provide that the terms of office of the chief registrar and his or her deputy will be three years, renewable.  These sections also provide that the chief registrar or his or her deputy may resign his or her office at any time.</p> <p> Section 24 provides for an amendment to the National Training Fund Act 2000 to provide for a 0.1% increase, from 0.8% to 0.9%, in the national training fund levy payable by employers in respect of reckonable earnings of employees in class A or class H employment from 1 January 2019.</p> <p> The Bill will provide for an increase of &euro;5 per week in social welfare rates for the third year in a row.  It reflects the determination of the Government to ensure that the benefits of the continuing economic recovery should be shared by every citizen in the country.  The additional resources being applied to the qualified child increase and the particular focus on the greater needs of older dependent children reflect my commitment and that of my colleagues to prioritise the needs of families, especially those on low or fixed incomes.</p> <p> I hope and expect that the Bill will enjoy the support of Members on all sides of the House and look forward to hearing the contributions of my colleagues on it in the coming days.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.390" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="16:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400042#UU00100"><p>We will not oppose this Bill.  As the Minister has outlined in some detail all of the favourable measures contained in the Bill, I do not see any need to rehearse them.  I note that this year's increase in provision for the social protection budget is approximately 1.5%.  That has to be measured against economic growth of more than 5%, which is what I understand the figure to be.  As I will try to illustrate, I believe that with some administrative adjustments, some legislative changes and a small increase in expenditure, we could get much more value for the more than &euro;20 billion we are spending on social protection.</p>  <p>  I deeply regret that the old narrative about social welfare was resurrected during the recent presidential election campaign.  Certain people sought to get cheap votes and attract popularity by saying that the source of all our ills in this country is the amount we spend on social protection.  The depths of ignorance from which those people were talking were surely reflected in their failure to realise that jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's allowance now account for less than 10% of total social welfare expenditure.  The main forms of social welfare expenditure are payments to people who are too disabled or too sick to work, single parents who cannot go out to work because of the lack of childcare facilities in this country and pensioners who are too old to work or whose working lives have expired.  We cannot forget that more than &euro;2 billion in child benefit payments comes from the social welfare budget.  I find it disgusting that anybody would suggest that by reducing payments such as the disability allowance, carer's allowance and State pension - we know about all the additional expenses faced by the elderly - or even by eliminating them, in some cases, we would suddenly have nirvana in this country.  It is not the case that all our economic and social problems would suddenly end if we reduced the fairly meagre payments that such people receive.  I remind the House that the weekly disability allowance payment for a single person is &euro;198.50, although it will increase by &euro;5 in March 2019.  The weekly carer's allowance payment is &euro;214 and this is also about to increase by &euro;5.  As I said last month, I certainly would not like to belong to a political party which includes a member who voices such sentiments.</p>  <p>  The Minister and I did not get a chance to finish the discussion we had yesterday on foot of a question I tabled about young jobseekers.  As politicians, we have to be careful not to say or do things that feed into the false narrative to which I have just referred.  The Taoiseach played his part in promoting this narrative when he went after so-called fraudulent claims.  As we know, the reality is that the vast majority of payments recovered by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection can be attributed to overpayments.  In the vast majority of cases, those overpayments are not the fault of the person who is ultimately forced to repay the money.  Of course, fraud should be pursued and people who deliberately defraud the system should be subjected to the full rigours of the law, but the figure for fraud is minuscule.  I regret that during Question Time yesterday, the Minister seemed to feed into the sort of false narrative.  I asked her to explain the present rationale for the distinction between the rate of jobseeker's payments paid to people over the age of 26 and the rate paid to those under the age of 26.  I admit that this distinction was first introduced in 2010-----</p></speech>

The door was open a long time in Northern Ireland and the UK as well.  When I asked the Minister for the rationale for the two rates of payment, she more or less told me that all the people in this country between the ages of 18 and 26 are the sort of people who would prefer to sit at home watching "Judge Judy" than to go out and get a job or take on training.  That feeds into the narrative.  She should withdraw the remark in question.  While we are on the subject of jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit, I ask the Minister to use her response at the end of Second Stage to set out what Turas Nua's future will be.  My understanding is that its contract is due to expire in 2019 or 2020.  Will she assure the House that Turas Nua will end at that stage?  The organisation has been well paid to achieve its objectives, but it is no longer relevant.  The people coming to me now illustrate very clearly that it is now more of a hindrance than a help to those trying to join the workforce.</p>  <p>  How many self-employed people have qualified for the invalidity pension?  What is the position with regard to self-employed people who become ill, disabled or incapacitated for a short period?  Are there plans to extend the illness benefit provision to the self-employed?  If someone is to qualify for the invalidity pension, he or she must prove that he or she is more or less permanently incapable of work.  Not everybody who becomes temporarily disabled can prove that he or she is permanently incapable of work, not least because not everyone in these circumstances will be permanently incapable of work.  I welcome the Minister's announcement that jobseeker's benefit for the self-employed will be introduced from the final quarter of next year by whoever happens to be the Minister at that stage.  Even though the amount of PRSI being paid by the self-employed is less than half of that being paid by workers, it is proposed to give them the same benefits.  I am aware of a number of surveys among the self-employed which have found that approximately 85% of them are enthusiastic about making a contribution to the new system, rather than letting the cost of it be borne by the taxpayer.</p>  <p>  One in 20 people in Ireland is caring for a family member.  Collectively, they provide approximately &euro;10 billion in unpaid care work to the State.  We have to come to grips with and start planning for this.  All the studies show that by 2030, which is not far away, demographic changes will require one in five people to take on a caring role.  That will be a fourfold increase.  Some 73,000 carers are paid carer's allowance or carer's benefit.  This means that 75% of those who undertake caring duties do not get any payment at all.  While the amount they are paid is more generous than jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance, the difference is just &euro;16 a week.  The eligibility criteria for carer's allowance are too strict.  One or two people who receive carer's allowance have come to me in the past few weeks.  They are caring for a family member who happens to be a child in each case.  Both of them are self-employed on a part-time basis but have had to turn away a few hours of extra work, thereby depriving themselves of the ability to earn a decent income in addition to what they receive as carer's allowance as they seek to lift their families out of poverty.  I realise why there must be a limit on the time a carer can spend working outside the home.  If someone is working outside the home all the time, he or she cannot provide caring facilities.  There should be some flexibility in this regard.  I recently came across the case of somebody who is working irregular hours outside the home.  This person works 17 or 18 hours some weeks, but just ten or 12 hours other weeks.  On average, this person works less than 15 hours a week.  This person has been told that they have no entitlement to carer's allowance because they work more than 15 hours in some weeks.  This indicates that there is significant rigidity in the system, which should be examined.</p>  <p>  Many people have complained to me that when caring ends while the carer is still of working age, there are a number of barriers to returning to work which often result in carers being locked out of the labour market.  I would like to mention Family Carers Ireland, which is an excellent organisation, in this context.</p><p>My colleagues and everybody else read the very useful suggestions it put forward for changes to the system that would cost very little in the overall scheme of things but there is no sign of them being implemented.  For example, it suggested that carer's allowance be disregarded in the calculation of differential rent, medical cards for carers, a reduction in prescription charges, the reintroduction of the transport support scheme to which I will return presently, improvement to the senior alert scheme and flexibility in the conditions.  It suggests simple things that would not cost anything extra, such as an early alert system for entitlement to the old age pension when a carer is three months short of 66 years of age, as applies for people in receipt of other social welfare payments and, of course, a review of the rules generally to provide more flexibility.</p> <p> The association put forward another initiative at which the Government should look very carefully.  There are a number of services relating to carers that are funded but not uniformly or evenly throughout the country.  The amount of assistance a person receives under various schemes depends on where in the country he or she happens to live.  It is the postcode lottery.  The proposal from the organisation in question clearly shows the requirement for some rebalancing of existing local budgets and an overall increase of approximately &euro;3 million per annum, which is not a fortune, to guarantee services such as respite, individual supports, training of carers, information and advocacy in a fairly uniform way throughout the country.  Surely regardless of where people live they are entitled to the same service as everybody else.</p> <p> Disability is an area where poverty seems to be increasing rather than decreasing despite the economic growth we have enjoyed in recent times.  More than one in three, that is, 39.1%, which is, in fact, almost one in two, of people who are unable to work due to disability live below the poverty line.  In its pre-budget submission Inclusion Ireland highlighted the lack of workplace supports for people with disabilities.  It is not enough to identify a job for a person with a disability.  In many cases the people must be supported in the workplace, at least in the initial stages.</p> <p> The national disability inclusion strategy includes a target to increase public sector employment for people with disabilities from 3% to 6% by 2024.  At the rate of increase we have at present according to figures produced by the National Disability Authority it will be 2041 before the 2024 target is met.  I urge the Minister, as I have urged the Taoiseach on many occasions, to let us have the motorised transport and mobility allowance back.  It was frozen in 2013.  Thousands of people have qualified for it since but every time I or anybody else asks when it will be restored we are told it is very complex and detailed, that it involves legislation and that this person is looking this and another person is looking at something else.  For heavens sake, it has been more than five years.</p> <p> Advocacy for families with disability is virtually non-existent so the personal advocacy service provided under the Citizens Information Act 2007 should be commenced immediately.  Will the Minister comment on why 73% of decisions on disability allowance cases are overturned on appeal?  There is almost a knee-jerk reaction to refuse disability allowance applications.  Do not give me the old story about holding back documentation for the appeal.  In my experience that is not a widespread practice among people applying for disability allowance.  They provide all the documentation and anything to support their claims.  In 73% of cases appeals are partially or wholly successful.  If up to three out of every four decisions of a judge at whatever level were reversed we would surely conclude there was something fundamentally wrong.</p> <p> I welcome the increase in the disregard for lone parents although it is far short of what was sought.  As the Minister is aware, the committee on social protection did a lot of work and research on how to improve conditions for lone parents who were very adversely affected by Deputy Burton's changes in 2012.  The reaction of the Department to the report was most disappointing.  The report makes several very good suggestions that would cost relatively little, peanuts in many cases, and would substantially improve the position of single parents.  I cannot understand why the Department does not take them on board.</p> <p> Yesterday, we discussed the idea of a maintenance recovery unit.  Will the Minister comment on the fact that at present if somebody goes to court for maintenance and the recalcitrant partner decides not to pay, some social welfare officers at least insist on assessing the maintenance against the individual even though that individual is not being paid any money.  Surely this discourages people from pursuing maintenance.  They open themselves to a terrible risk.  If they get the order but the money is not paid a social welfare official will state that according to the information available the person has maintenance of a certain amount per week and therefore it will be assessed against the person.  That is a practice and make no mistake about it.</p> <p> With regard to pathways back to work for lone parents the situation is still very unclear.  There is a lack of co-ordination between various Departments.  For example, financial support appears to be available only for full-time courses, which does not facilitate the caring responsibility of single parents.</p> <p> With regard to pensions, I note section 9 of the Bill and we will return to this in more detail on Committee Stage.  I realise the 40 year baseline is only for the calculation of what is due to post-2012 pensioners but when the new system that will replace the total contribution system is being established we will urge the Minister very strongly to use a baseline of 30 years.  We will also very strongly recommend reducing the huge hurdle to qualification of 520 paid contributions back to 260 contributions.</p> <p> I note from my brief perusal of section 9 that if somebody claims home carer credits and separate credits, such as for periods when they were unemployed or on disability, there is a cap.  The cap on home carer credits is 1,040.  A person can have up to 539 non-home carers credits but if he or she has both he or she is still restricted to 1,040, which is extremely restrictive.</p> <p> There are a number of other issues.  For example, recently a colleague brought to my attention an anomaly in the provisions of the domiciliary care allowance.  What happened in the case in which she was involved was joint custody was granted and each parent was spending equal time each week with the child.  They have both been refused domiciliary care allowance on the basis the relevant legislation states the parent must spend at least five nights per week with the child.  I will send the details to the Minister.</p></speech>

There was practically no change.</p>  <p>  These are some of the issues we will raise on Committee Stage.  As I said, we will not oppose the legislation on Second Stage.  I have no intention of opposing increases for people on disability allowance and jobseeker's payments.  The one point I will make is these changes only kick in from the end of March whereas the tax changes kick in from 1 January.  This is fundamentally inequitable.  It means that although the Minister said at the end of her speech that she is giving a &euro;5 a week increase she is not.  She is giving an increase of approximately &euro;3.75 per week because it will not kick in until the end of March.</p>  <p>  These are the main items.  We will be looking more carefully at section 9 and a number of other sections.  We will table amendments on Committee Stage in so far as we can.  We are still constrained by the crazy rule that we cannot table an amendment that will cost the Exchequer an extra cent because it will be ruled out of order.  Within this constraint, while we will not oppose the Bill on Second Stage we will do our very best to make it even better on Committee Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.402" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="17:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400044#WW00100"><p>We cannot discuss this Bill this evening without referring to the 2017 Bill, which has been at a complete standstill for over a year.  This is ridiculous.  That Bill was debated here 13 months ago, on 4 October, yet it still has to progress to Committee Stage.  I understand the Minister has attributed this to provisions in the Bill concerning defined benefit pension schemes and protections for members of those schemes.  Whatever the legal and complex policy issues, there are certainly no excuses for leaving members of defined benefit schemes any longer without basic protections.  When previously asked about the 2017 Bill, the Minister said the key priority of her Government was to provide additional protections for scheme members.  There are no protections for scheme members and that is the crux of the problem.</p>  <p>  We have seen employers who are not in any financial difficulty walk away or make a decision to walk away from their pension obligations to their employees for absolutely no reason whatsoever.  We saw that most recently with Irish Life.  This has happened over and over and, if the truth be told, the Government just stood idly by.</p>  <p>  In the OECD review of Ireland's pension system, published in 2014, Ireland was criticised for its weak legislation on the protection of defined benefit scheme members.  The report recommended that the legislation be strengthened but that call has been ignored.  We have to make it illegal for companies that are financially sound to walk away from their pension obligations.  At the very least, the Government needs to end the current practice.  The Minister will be aware of three Opposition Bills that would achieve this.  In fairness, they have not been pushed in the hope that the Minister will step forward and put in place the protections.  She has failed.  We are not talking about companies in financial difficulty but about profitable companies that make a choice to remove the risk on their books and place it firmly on the employee alone.  I ask the Minister to examine this as part of the solution.</p>  <p>  Most of the sections of this Bill allow for increases in social welfare payments or introduce technical and necessary measures, including some taken from the 2017 Bill.  These are welcome.  It is a pity this year again that payment increases will not be made until the end of March, especially given the increased costs for households, particularly energy costs over the winter months.  It appears the delayed increase is becoming commonplace.  I urge the Government to try to avoid this in the future.  Where increases in payments are necessary and announced as part of the budget, they are needed immediately, not five months after they are announced.</p>  <p>  What is the basis on which social welfare increases are decided?  I am aware the Minister engages with organisations in a pre-budget forum.  That has to be welcomed.  One of the key findings brought to the Minister's attention at the pre-budget forum was benchmarking in respect of adequacy.  The Minister should examine the Social Welfare Commission Bill 2018, which I recently sent to her having introduced it in the D&aacute;il.  That Bill would take the political football out of the budget process every single year.  It would ensure that vulnerable households receive an income that is adequate to meet their needs and would result in an adequate standard of living.  This is a very basic objective to meet when it comes to our social protection system and what it should aim to achieve.  I urge the Minister to consider the Bill I have introduced.  I have engaged with many organisations on it.  They see its merit and the need for it.  I hope the Minister will examine it and agree there is a need to remove the political football from the setting of social welfare rates.  I hope she will help to make progress on the legislation.</p>  <p>  I note that the extension of the jobseeker's payment for the self-employed is not included in this Bill.  I am aware that there were reasons for this and that the provision will be included in separate legislation next year, or so I am informed.  I would like the date on which the Minister envisages this will happen.</p>  <p>  There is also no timeline included in this Bill for the introduction of the differing rates, based on age, that will be introduced for the qualified child increases.  The Minister mentioned the end of March.  I would need that to be confirmed.  The recognition by the Government of the increased cost of raising a teenager and subsequently the increase in qualified child income for the over 12s was probably the most welcome measure announced as part of budget 2019.  Again, however, we need a date.  I believe the Minister mentioned the period from 22 March to 29 March.</p></speech>

I questioned the Minister on this yesterday.  She does not agree with me.  In not agreeing with me, she does not agree with the organisations that represent real people.  I do not understand why the Minister insists that child maintenance should be calculated as means towards an array of social welfare payments.  This is totally unfair and it should stop.</p>  <p>  I welcome the full exemption of age-related jobseeker payments for young jobseekers in State care.  This was an important move by the Minister.  It has been requested for some time and it is a welcome move.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to consider the age-related jobseeker payments and the impact of the reduced payments on those between 18 and 24, in particular.  These reduced payments are leading to homelessness.  We can see that from the homelessness figures.  It has been stated by numerous organisations representing homeless people that this discrimination in the system is having an impact in terms of homelessness.  It is ensuring young people are trapped in homelessness.  Therefore, I urge the Minister to consider this.</p>  <p>  The Minister ignores the simple fact I have outlined.  Every year the gap between jobseekers is widened based on age.  This makes it increasingly difficult to close.  It is deeply regrettable that the Minister continues with this failed policy of discrimination, introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il, and it ignores the impact it is having on young people.  It was interesting to listen to Deputy O'Dea.  Yesterday he tried to defend his party's introduction of the arrangement and blamed the current Government for presiding over it.  It was unacceptable when introduced and it is unacceptable now.  The discrimination needs to end.</p>  <p>  With regard to JobPath, Turas Nua was mentioned.  There is another private company involved, Seetec.  I have raised concerns about the 15,000 people who have been referred to JobPath for a second time.  This has been referred to as a hindrance.  It is a waste of money.  I have stated the two companies are rubbing their hands with glee.  They are making millions upon millions of euro from the State through the privatisation of the system.  It needs to end.  My party and I are not the only ones with a difficulty with this.  Members throughout the House, from all political parties, have raised serious concerns about it.  I speak to real people on a daily basis, as I am sure does the Minister.</p><p>I query whether the Minister has not had issues brought to her directly in her constituency from people who have been referred to JobPath, whether it is Turas Nua or Seetec.  There are major issues with it and I am not dreaming them up.  They have been presented to every Member.  Sticking one's head in the sand and ignoring them is wrong.  It is particularly wrong on the part of the Minister, who has direct responsibility and is presiding over this system, to stick her head in the sand and continue to have people referred to this privatised industry that is making millions of euro.</p> <p> Finally, the 2017 Bill is in limbo.  Crucial provisions in it must be implemented.  It appears we will not see the 2017 Bill this year, which is unacceptable.  Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us on whether that Bill will be taken off the shelf, dusted down and brought forward.  The Bill before us contains nothing that will have it held up or delayed.  I assume that is intentional.  Certainly my party will not stand in the way of letting this Bill progress.  However, we cannot have a trend where difficult provisions are left behind and the nice provisions giving people entitlements and increases are welcomed and progressed.  The Minister has to deal with the difficult issues such as the DB schemes.  People are crying out for this.  Schemes are closing down and people are getting knocked out.  The Minister must confront and deal with that, and I urge her to do so as a matter of priority.</p></speech>

As Deputy O'Dea said, the Bill gives legislative effect to the various measures announced in the budget on 9 October and deals with increases in weekly rates of pensions, benefits and allowances, including the qualified child increased payment which we especially welcome.  I support the extension of the period of payment of DCA for an additional three months when the child being cared for passes away.  The increase in the weekly earnings disregard for the one-parent family payment will be of assistance to lone parents and help to make work pay and with incentivisation.</p>  <p>  I note the amendment to the Pensions Act which provides for the right of entitlement in certain circumstances to spousal pension benefits for same-sex spouses and civil partners who are members of occupational schemes.  I salute that important advancement.  The Minister will acknowledge that this issue has been championed by my colleague, Senator Bacik, for a long time.  The Labour Party supports this enabling provision in terms of equality of treatment in respect of pension entitlements.  It is clearly related to the case of Dr. David Parris which was brought to the ECJ.</p>  <p>  Significant parts of the Bill are devoted to contributions and the pensions entitlements arising therefrom.  It deals with the significant problem caused by changes in entitlements made in 2012 whereby people who attained pensionable age on or after 1 September 2012, due to the new averaging system that was introduced, lost their entitlement to a full rate of State contributory pension.  My Labour Party colleagues and I are pleased that this issue can now be addressed by the Minister and that the additional resources, which will be available as a result of the strong economic growth that was fostered during that time, can be allocated to remedy the situation for once and for all.  I am glad this is now right.  However, I wish to raise an issue with the Minister.  I was contacted by a former Member regarding the pension equality review.  It will only benefit people born after 6 September 1946.  That date should be 6 April 1946 as the changes were introduced on 6 April 2012.  This is a very smart former Deputy.  He said that the creation of the inequality happened on 6 April 2012, but the Minister is setting the date at 6 September 2012.  He is a retired Deputy but he has given me the case of a woman who was born on 10 April 1946 who was negatively impacted by the 2012 changes.  It appears she will not benefit from the current review.  I ask the Minister to take that into account and amend the date.  It probably affects only a handful.  Unfortunately, these old Deputies never retire, and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is the same.  The boots are always on.</p>  <p>  It will be no surprise to the House that I have taken a keen interest in pensions, State pensions and the protection of defined benefit schemes, particularly against unscrupulous employers who have left their employees short or deprived of their rights at the stroke of a pen.  I spoke about the delay with the 2017 Bill on Question Time yesterday.  I have delved into the history of pensions and I have spoken on it previously in the House.  When the first old age pension scheme in the world was introduced by Bismarck in 1889 in Germany, the pension was payable at 70 years of age.  At that time only 10% of Germans lived for more than five years after receiving their pension.  The cost of old age pensions was, therefore, only a small part of government spending.</p>  <p>  Today life expectancy in Ireland at 65 years of age is 18 years for men and 21 years for women, and these expectancies are rising rapidly.  Until recently Ireland has had a low age dependency ratio because, sadly, many emigrants of the 1950s who should be growing old in Ireland are growing old in the UK, the USA and other countries.  At present, the old dependency ratio in Ireland is 21% compared to an average of 29% for the EU.  We are fortunate to still have a relatively young population, but the birth rate is declining and this combined with increased longevity will cause a rapid increase in the old dependency ratio over the next 20 years.  This increase in the dependency ratio is being referred to as the pensions time bomb.  I hate that term.  It is as if increasing life expectancy is a bad thing.  Increased life expectancy is only a problem if a large proportion of the population is inactive or requires care.  A leading English geriatrician recently suggested abandoning the terms associated with ageing and simply classifying people as active or inactive adults.</p>  <p>  An ever increasing proportion of the population over 65 years of age is in good health, thankfully, and capable of working, but many are required to retire at 65 regardless of whether they wish it.  Those dependent solely on the State old age pension which is payable at age 66, and that age will increase, are often forced into the humiliating position of having to claim unemployment benefit until they reach 66.  The legislative intervention in recent weeks dealt with the public sector retirement age and means that public sector employees have the option of working until they are 70 if they wish.  However, many private sector workers do not have that option, and there is a strong argument for putting arrangements in place to enable all private sector workers who will be solely dependent on the State old age pension to work until 66 years of age.  Again, it would be voluntary, not mandatory.  Japan has increased the age at which workers can draw a state pension to 70 and there are proposals to increase the pension age to 75.  Some workers who do hard physical work should be allowed to retire at 65 or even 60.  It is hard, physical, manual work on building sites for construction workers.  However, many workers may well be in better shape and able to work beyond 65 and they should be facilitated to do so.</p>  <p>  The pensions time bomb lobby argues that providing a State pension will be unaffordable in the future because of the numbers of people who will eligible to receive it.  Pension reform is part of the free market economics consensus of organisations such as the OECD and the World Bank.  The OECD, in a report on the Irish pension system, ominously states: "Pension reforms are part of many austerity programmes and seen as a key element in reassuring markets that future commitments to pay back explicit and implicit public debt are credible".  In these discussions there is no mention of the fact that in Ireland employer PRSI contributions are among the lowest in the developed world.  The solution to the crisis is always to make workers pay more and to privatise as much of the pension system as possible.  A major so-called reform of Irish pensions was the introduction of personal retirement savings accounts, PRSAs.  Although they have been in operation since 2003, only 50% of employers provide access to PRSAs and only 4% of employees and 10% of the self-employed are contributing to them.  While an attempt was made to cap the costs of PRSAs, the charges are higher than in the UK, USA and Sweden.  The UK has several PRSA-type schemes and none has been successful.  The only beneficiaries of the UK schemes have been the insurance companies and their agents who provide them.  There have also been mis-selling scandals.  Despite these failures, the main proposal for private pensions is a continuation and expansion of these schemes in Ireland.  Now we are discussing automatic enrolment so it is an important issue.  There are generous tax reliefs for PRSAs but, as with most tax reliefs in Ireland, those on the highest incomes benefit most.</p>  <p>  The proposals for existing private pension schemes include measures to improve governance.  If this to become a reality, the light-touch regulation operated by the Pensions Board will have to become a great deal tougher.  Although Ireland has only 1% of the EU population, our 164,000 occupational pension schemes constitute 50% of such schemes in the EU.  There are significant economies of scale in pension schemes and the Pensions Board should consider how these schemes could be consolidated.  Despite the plethora of occupational schemes, only 35% of private sector workers have private pension cover even with the generous tax reliefs.  That is what the Minister is trying to tackle now.</p><p>All the countries that have a higher level of cover have mandatory or quasi-mandatory schemes, but they are mainly large schemes with low management costs and good returns.  The main development in private pensions in Ireland in recent years has been the shift from defined benefit to defined contribution schemes.  This is why the 2017 legislation is so important.  This shifts all the risk to the employee.  While some defined benefit schemes may have been over generous, the shift to defined contributions is likely to mean more people partly dependent on the State pension to survive in old age.  The Government&rsquo;s main role in the area of private pensions should be to reduce costs and investment risks.  The continuation of tax reliefs should be contingent on providers delivering defined benefit promises and defined contribution providers delivering a guaranteed lump sum on retirement.  This lump sum should be the amount generated when contributions and investment returns grow at a nominal rate of 2% per annum.  Reducing risks would, in time, also reduce the possibility of the State having to rescue failed private pension schemes as happened with Waterford Crystal and SR Technics.  I hope to be making a contribution to what is going to happen in a few years' time when I have left the House.</p> <p> For the foreseeable future, the State pension will remain the main income source for most pensioners.  Currently the old age pension replaces 35% of average earnings.  This, with the additional non-cash benefits, is adequate to keep pensioners out of poverty but will only do so in the future if it is maintained at this level in real terms by adjusting it to average earnings.  I am concerned that the Government seems eager to push a greater number of people into private pension schemes to reduce public spending on pensions.  The policy of increasing coverage of private pensions has failed.  It has increased subsidies to higher income earners, substituted individual pensions for occupational pensions and shifted risks from employers to employees.  The focus on increasing private pension coverage through an auto-enrolment scheme is the primary objective of national pensions framework.  This ignores the failures of the private pension system and ignores the significance of State pension as most important source of income for pensioners.  The main policy goal for Ireland's pension system should be to improve the coverage and adequacy of the State pension.  The State pension should be a universal scheme and the replacement rate should be increased to 40% of average industrial earnings.  Immediately there will be cries that we cannot afford to implement these proposals but a well-researched study by Social Justice Ireland that estimates the costs of a universal pension scheme shows that in the long term paying for a universal scheme would be no more difficult than funding existing arrangements.</p> <p> I shall now turn to my favourite topic.  Perhaps this time next year this could be over for the likes of me, but I will certainly go out on the topic of caring in Ireland today and the plight of carers.  Unashamedly, and with great energy during my time in political life, especially in the D&aacute;il, I have been a strong advocate for carers.  My aim and objective is to continually improve their lot.  They are genuine and wonderful people and they are the unsung heroes.  There is a crisis in family carers.  That was the message that emerged from the RT&Eacute; "Prime Time" special programme in December 2017.  Five family carers bared their souls to the nation in the hope of highlighting their plight and representing thousands of carers across Ireland.  Many carers in crisis have told their stories since with little or no response.  Sometimes they tell their stories to us in private.</p> <p> Family carers such as Anne Quinn, who won carer of the year in Westmeath, and many others throughout counties Westmeath, Longford, Meath, Offaly and Laois and so on do not want to be patronised.  They do not want our praise or pity nor do they not want to be canonised.  They are not saints and they will tell anyone that.  They are ordinary people who are struggling to care for their loved ones without the supports they desperately need.  They are angry at a system that exploits, and sometimes abuses, their family bonds and that only pays lipservice to the demands of caring safely for their loved ones.  They need respite, they need training and some need a downstairs bathroom.  Others need home help hours when they need them and not when the system decides they can be give them, if indeed ever.  Thousands of family carers are living in crisis and urgently need a break.  Their own physical and mental health is suffering, and they cannot secure respite care, even emergency respite, when they can no longer provide care.</p> <p> In Ireland today, all home care supports are discretionary and, therefore, the service is resource rather than needs-led.  This equates to a system which is inequitable, inconsistent and flawed.  I understand that a statutory entitlement to home care is coming down the tracks but that is two, three or four years away.  Family carers cannot afford to wait that long; they need support now.</p> <p> Deputy O'Dea made a good reference to the postcode lottery for carer supports and services.  Where a person lived often determines what supports he or she will get and this has to change.  If I am out in the sticks in a simple village such as Ballinacarrigy, I should be able to get the same service as in a large town like Mullingar or Athlone.  People who live in Emper, Ballinacarrigy, Sonna, Rathowen, Castletown, Moyvore or Ballymore or wherever should get the same service that is available in the larger towns.  Carers must have access to key supports in their community throughout their caring roles such as timely information, in-home and residential respite care, peer support groups and ongoing training in line with the demands of their caring roles.  Family Carers Ireland presented the Government with a solution to eliminate the postcode lottery.  For an additional &euro; 3.5 million per annum, the organisation can provide access to core supports for carers in their community, including emergency respite care, essential training and peer support.  This proposal, however, appears to have fallen between the cracks and disappeared.</p> <p> One in twenty of Ireland&rsquo;s population is a family carer.  I obtained some figures from Family Carers Ireland prior to coming to the House, and as Deputy O'Dea said, by 2030, demographic patterns predict that this ratio will have fallen to one in five people.  International evidence is clear that the burden of care increases with time and without appropriate support, carers slide from capability to coping to crisis.  After almost ten years of cuts to services - some public and overt and others covert and hidden - too many individual carers in Ireland have moved from coping to crisis.  To avoid crisis, family carers must be supported throughout their caring journey and in accordance with their individual needs.  These needs will be minor for some.  They need a few more hours of home support, but others require more extensive support as their role intensifies.</p> <p> I recall the Government&rsquo;s response to RT&Eacute; "Prime Time - Carers in Crisis" programme.  It was swift but it was probably not adequate.  There was an announcement on 15 December of additional funding to improve respite care services and to ensure that all carers could access GP services without charge.  We must welcome any measure that is brought forward.  We cannot be churlish and we have to be constructive and they were certainly steps in the right direction but they go nowhere because of the depth and the scale of the crisis.  Despite this announcement, the figures for respite service provision in the first quarter of 2018 were down on figures for the same period in 2017.</p> <p> Pension entitlements is another area of concern for family carers.  There remains in Ireland today a small number of long-term carers who have cared for in excess of 20 years who do not qualify for a State pension, contributory or non-contributory, due to their caring responsibilities and the assets of their partner, and, therefore, receive no acknowledgment from the State of their years of care and the enormous contribution they have made to our society.  I understand that the Minister is trying to tackle this with her recent announcement that she is moving to address this inequitable situation.  I look forward to her reply and confirmation that carers will be duly acknowledged in the total contributions system that is being prepared.  Carers have saved the State tens of billions of euro.  The entire system would have collapsed, including the hospital system, the accident and emergency system, all the home care packages and everything else.</p> <p> Thousands of family carers remain in crisis and they are battling all the time against a system that requires carers' allowance recipients to provide full-time care, which Deputy O'Dea referred to as a minimum of 35 hours a week.  They receive just &euro;16 more than recipients of the jobseeker's allowance for doing a minimum of 35 hours per week.  They are being paid buttons.  Recipients of carer's allowance, carers benefit or the carer support grant are prevented from working or studying more than 15 hours per week.  Admittedly the carer has to be in the home, but they are there.  They are there right throughout the night, with the alarm switched on.  An in-law of mine sleeps with the alarm in the ear.  It denies carers the right to a break.</p><p>It consistently reduces the number of home support hours available for an older person or someone with a disability in circumstances where there is a family member in receipt of carer's allowance.  It very often expects a carer to carry out essential tasks single-handed where health and safety regulations prevent paid care workers from undertaking such tasks due to risk of injury.</p> <p> Deputy O'Dea referred to the failure to replace the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant, which were withdrawn.  The system means tests carers' access to the GP visit card - they feel very hurt by this - by offering it only to those in receipt of carer's allowance, while providing universal, non-means tested access to people aged over 70 and children under six.  We should do the same for the carers.  As for the rigorous system of means testing, I think the time has come to abolish the means test for carer's allowance altogether.  I have held that view and never changed it.  This was one of the recommendations I, as Chair of the then Joint Committee on Social Protection, brought forward in 2003.  It was the only one of the major recommendations we made that did not get through.  More time is spent on administration of the carer's allowance.  If the person being cared for is deemed medically to require care, that should be enough.  People who are very rich are able to buy in care in any event.  It is a universality issue. </p> <p> I am asking the Government to invest in home care now.  For too long, home care has been underfunded, inconsistent and inequitable, leaving families with little choice but to choose care homes over home care. In its pre-budget submission, Family Carers Ireland called for an investment of &euro;102 million in order to increase the number of home support hours by 25%, from 17.09 million to 21.4 million.  Ireland&rsquo;s first national carers&rsquo; strategy was published in 2012, signalling the Government&rsquo;s commitment to respecting carers as key partners and supporting and empowering them in their caring roles.  The strategy has now come to the end of its timeline and I am calling for ring-fenced funding to be provided for phase 2 of the national carers' strategy for the period 2019 to 2022.</p> <p> Family carers are propping up our struggling health service.  They save our State &euro;10 billion each year.  The question should not be whether we can afford to support them but whether we can afford not to.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.409" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1367" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="17:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400047#ZZ00200"><p>We are debating the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill of 2018.  I had hoped and thought that this might be somewhat similar to the 2017 legislation, which is still before the relevant committee.  That version contains some of the measures the Taoiseach used to scapegoat the unemployed - naming and shaming them.  The latter is a theme he seems to have left behind since he became Taoiseach, although it was recently taken up with glee by a candidate in the presidential election.  The 2017 legislation contains some measures to deal with the onslaught on the defined benefit pension scheme for workers.  I am continually amazed and amused at how this Government is so slow and unwilling to speed up the protection that might be afforded by that Bill.  It is looking after companies and that is the reason the Bill from last year is stuck instead of being before the House.</p><p>We know there are 700 schemes still in place, but hundreds have been savaged and closed.  The most recent, which we discussed at the committee and in this House, is the scheme relating to Irish Life, a hugely profitable company that looks after other defined benefit pension schemes.  The scheme was well in surplus and very healthy but the employer just decided to walk away from it.  We have been waiting over a year and half for the legislation to which I refer and which, weak and all as it is, could have done something to protect workers on defined benefit schemes.  The Minister stated that it is complex - I am sure it is - but given the changes in the original general scheme of that Bill and the current proposals, it is clear that it is not just a question of the proposals' complexity, it is also the lack of political will to challenge the companies that are decimating their workers' defined benefit schemes when there is absolutely no need for this.</p><p>It would be possible for the Minister to introduce some simple measures to help retired workers who were employed by semi-State companies.  This could be of assistance to pensioners who have not had an increase in their pensions for over ten years, thousands of whom were employed by semi-State companies and who are faced with real problems as a result of decisions made by those companies not to fund their scheme to the degree that was needed and by rules relating to minimum funding standards.  The underfunding of those schemes is often tied in with Government underfunding of the companies - such as, for example, what has happened with CI&Eacute; in the past ten years of austerity - or with decisions made as a result of overall Government policy.  It is the Government's fault that these people do not qualify for State pensions and suffer as a result of decisions and regulations made by the Department.  We should try to remedy the suffering and injustice for these pensioners.</p><p>I want to make a few observations on the Bill before the house and then I will shut up.  On the contributory pension schemes, I am happy that we have made progress in redressing the cuts implemented in 2013 by the former Minister, Deputy Burton, in respect of those who qualified for State contributory pensions.  Not only did those changes mean thousands received reduced pensions, but they did not remove the blatant discrimination that women who had raised their families before 1994 faced.  I congratulate the campaigners who revolted against those cuts by the previous Fine Gael-Labour Party Government, but it is still only a partial reversal as the deepest cut, the increase in the qualifying bands, remains.  Even the proposed new method of calculation will not address that or the reduction that many suffered.  We will still need to campaign to reverse all those cuts.</p><p>I am curious about the section that will remove some young people from the blatant discrimination they face when accessing jobseeker's allowance.  It is outrageous that we still have three tiers of payment for young people.  From the age of 18 to 24, a person gets &euro;107.70; at 25 years old, he or she gets &euro;152; at age 26 and over, he or she gets &euro;198.  Section 10 extends the existing legislative provisions in order to ensure that someone in the care of the State on attaining the age of 18 is not subject to age-related reduced rate payments.  The same applies in respect of the supplementary welfare allowance.  A person who has been in the care of the State is not subject to the reduced rate payments.</p><p>I note what Deputy O'Dea said about a sort of &quot;Judge Judy&quot; syndrome whereby young people are kept impoverished and just stay at home watching telly all day.  That seems to be the object of this provision.  Someone in the care of the State cannot be accused of sitting around watching telly all day, although perhaps that is exactly what one does when one is in the care of the State.  I do not understand the logic of reviving it for some sections but not for others.  It shows utter contempt for young people and sends out all the wrong messages in a society that speaks very frequently and proudly about how we are in recovery and how it is great that we are coming out of the dark ages, that we are all doing well and are sl&aacute;n abhaile.  If that is the case, then we should scrap this injustice and also the discrimination that the previous austerity regime has inflicted on young people.  It is shameful that we are maintaining this.  It says a great deal about the snobbery of a Government that thinks a certain cohort of young people do not need as much money to live on as others who are close in age to them.</p><p><b>Deputy Mick Barry:</b>I thank Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith for the extra three minutes and 43 seconds.</p></speech>

However, Social Justice Ireland&rsquo;s verdict on the budget is that it lacks any serious initiatives to begin to significantly reduce poverty and that the Government&rsquo;s choices and priorities have given the least to single, welfare-dependent households and those on the lowest earnings.  Nobody is going to get too excited about a fiver but when we put it in context of the scale of poverty and inequality in this country, it is even less impressive.</p>  <p>  I will provide some information on the scale of poverty and inequality.  Some 780,000, including 250,000 children, are poor.</p><p>That is one in six of the population and almost one in five children.  Nearly half of those, 8.3%, are living in consistent poverty.  Some 100,000 of those at risk of poverty are workers with jobs.  One in five workers is on low pay.  Students, mainly young people, have nearly twice the risk of poverty of the general population at 30% as opposed to 16.5%.  Disgracefully, 39% of people with disabilities are poor.<br/><br/>The latest available figures for 2016 show rents so out of control that 14.3% of private sector renters paying market rents are living in consistent poverty.  This is a massive increase compared with 2011 when 6.8% of private renters were in consistent poverty.  As those are 2016 figures, I suspect it must be even higher now.  Some 22% of people renting below market rate or rent free - mainly people paying differential rents in council housing or HAP - are living in consistent poverty, showing the failure of the Government&rsquo;s social housing and social welfare policies.<br/><br/>Some 42% of unemployed people are living below the poverty line.  An extra &euro;5 a week will do little to change this, especially for those aged under 26 who continue to be discriminated against.  From March, they will be still getting only &euro;112.70 a week in jobseeker's allowance.<br/><br/>Social Justice Ireland has been calling for social welfare payments to be benchmarked against average incomes.  There has been no attempt to match social welfare increases even to the small rises in wages, let alone the massive increases in rents, profits and wealth.  I want to focus on this.  For someone on jobseeker's benefit, &euro;5 extra a week is a 2.5% increase from &euro;198 to &euro;203.  For someone under 25 on jobseeker's allowance, it is a 4.6% increase.  That needs to be compared with the following.  To match the increase in rents in the past year according to the latest <i>daft.ie</i>report, social welfare payments would have had to increase by &euro;31, or 11.3%.  To match the 9.2% rate of annual increase just in profits on rents of dwellings, according to the latest figures from the Central Statistics Office, jobseeker's benefit would have needed to have increased by &euro;18.20.<br/><br/>Corporate trading profits, increased by 9.7% from &euro;87 billion in 2016 to &euro;95 billion in 2017, which is more than &euro;9 billion more than all the wages and employers&rsquo; social insurance contributions paid for all workers.  The amount of profits declared here have more than doubled since 2010 when it was &euro;41 billion.  If the same had happened with social welfare rates, jobseekers&rsquo; benefit would now be &euro;454 a week.<br/><br/>Household wealth increased by 9.2% or &euro;62 billion between quarter 1 of 2017 and quarter 1 of 2018, according to the latest figures from the Central Bank.  According to the Credit Suisse annual global wealth report for 2018, Ireland had the fourth highest percentage wealth increase of 52 countries, with 118,486 dollar millionaires, 15,000 more than in 2015, including 14,353 people worth more than &euro;5 million.<br/><br/>The CSO household wealth and consumption survey 2013, published in 2015, was the first and still the only in-depth analysis of the distribution of household wealth.  That report found that the top 1% of households owned 15% of net wealth; the top 5% had 38%; the top 10% had 54%; and the top 20% had 73%.  However, the bottom 20% of households owe more than they own and the bottom 70% own only 15.4% of the wealth.  That is the scale of inequality and social injustice in Leo Varadkar's Ireland.<br/><br/>The failure to increase social welfare rates by anything close to the increases in wealth, profits and rent reproduces at the level of the State how the profit share is rising at the expense of the wage share.  Workers are being increasingly exploited in the workplace while continually receiving less of the value of the goods and services they produce with only small wage increases while profits skyrocket.<br/><br/>Simultaneously, capitalists, especially bankers, corporate landlords and developers, are doubly exploiting workers and the unemployed by using their accumulated profits to invest in the housing market.  This is driving up house prices and rents, and transferring even more wealth from workers&rsquo; pockets to wealthy people&rsquo;s bank accounts.  The Government can dance a jig, rub its hands and claim credit for increasing social welfare payments by &euro;5.  Social welfare recipients will have to wait until next March.  When this is viewed in the context of the massive profits, the massive rent roll and the massive increase in the wealth of people at the top of Irish society, we can see that in reality this is a mere pittance - a drop in the bucket. </p></speech>

The Opposition cannot table amendments that would be a cost to the State.  It is a case of put up and shut up; this is the Bill and that is it.</p>  <p>  Social welfare payments are increasing across the board by the small amount of &euro;5, but not until March 2019.  As a previous speaker pointed out, when that is averaged out over the year it comes to &euro;3.80 a week.  This anomaly of delaying increases in social welfare payments was introduced during the austerity years.  It used to be from 1 January, but in the past six or seven budgets the increases have been brought in later in the year at the end of March.  This has to change in future.  I could try to change it by way of amendment, but as it would not be accepted there is no point.  Therefore we need to make the point here in the Chamber.  This can be contrasted with the tax cuts that come into effect on 1 January to benefit mainly people at the top end of the wage structure.</p>  <p>  The fuel allowance is to increase by 84 cent per week which hardly reflects the amount people are now spending on fuel, gas and electricity where prices have increased recently.  A whole layer of people will continue to experience fuel poverty.  There has been a general welcome for the full restoration of the Christmas bonus.  The spousal pension benefit for same-sex spouses and civil partners who are members of occupational pension schemes has been also generally welcomed.</p>  <p>  Section 10 which extends the existing provisions contained in the Act to ensure that a person who is in the care of the State on attaining the age of 18 is not subject to age-related reduced-rate payments of jobseeker's allowance.  This amendment will come into effect on 1 January 2019.  The Minister cannot argue that a person aged between 18 and 26, who is not in State care, should not get the increase.  That needs to be the next step.  This is pure and utter discrimination against a section of young people.  The Minister will need to bite the bullet in the next budget and increase that payment to the full amount of jobseeker's allowance.  How can the Minister regard one section of 18 year olds as not equal to another section of 18 year olds?  It just does not make sense.</p>  <p>  The problem is that the increases do not address the structural effects the austerity cuts inflicted on people.</p><p>The Bill and budget have failed the one in every six people in Ireland who live with an income below the poverty line, which is 16.5% of the population.  This means 780,000 people live below the poverty line, 250,000 of whom are children and more than 100,000 of whom have jobs.  People who are working are included in those figures.  The Government has made a number of statements that the way out of poverty is into a job, yet 100,000 people who have jobs live below the poverty line.  Poverty levels reached their lowest point in Ireland in 2009 when 14.1% of our population was considered poor.  Since then the rate has increased.  The budget lacks any serious initiatives to begin to significantly reduce poverty.  At rates of near full employment, the simple policy solution to create more jobs no longer stands.  Targeted measures aimed at high risk poverty groups, including children, people with an illness or disability, and people trapped in long-term unemployment, are needed.  Social welfare payments must be increased to meet the cost of living.  Budget 2019 has failed to start this process.  The figures from Social Justice Ireland, some of which have been referred to already, show that 5.6% of people at work are at serious risk of poverty and 41.9% of unemployed people, 33.3% of students, 25.7% of people at home, 11.8% of retired people, 39.1% of ill and disabled people and 19.3% of children from zero to 17 years of age are at risk of poverty.  The Minister has not even attempted to try to address those crucial issues in the Bill.  The budget has failed to ensure that Ireland meets its child poverty target of lifting 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020.  In 2011, 107,000 children lived in consistent poverty.  The 2016 figure was 142,000.  The budget and the Bill have introduced small measures but they are not enough to ensure Ireland meets its 2020 target on child poverty.<br/><br/>The budget and this legislation failed to deal with the restoration of the jobseeker's allowance rates for under 26s.  I made the point already.  Lone parents and other parents are still waiting for the Nordic childcare model since the former Minister, Deputy Burton, made her austerity cuts for lone parents in the last Government.  <br/><br/>When many of us heard the title of the Bill, we expected before we were briefed that the long-awaited legislation on the defined pension scheme was included in the Bill.  We were advised yesterday in our briefing that no date or indication could be given as to when that legislation will be introduced.  Can the Minister give a date for it?  The outline of the legislation was introduced last year and in the meantime a number of companies, such as Irish Life, have stopped paying the defined benefit pension scheme.  If that legislation had existed, there could have been some protection for those workers.  A number of Deputies and I received emails from semi-State retired staff associations such as Bord na M&oacute;na, ESB, RT&Eacute;, CI&Eacute;, Bord G&aacute;is, Eircom, Coillte and aviation staff.  I know the Minister also received a letter because they said so in the covering note they sent with the email.  The email I received states:</p><blockquote>It is not commonly understood that many thousands of Irish citizens do not have a state pension or any of the associated benefits (medical, optical etc).  The paradox is that a high proportion of these retired people have devoted their working lives for the benefit of the State.  They provided the nation's electricity, gas, peat, radio and television, telecommunications, aviation and myriad other state services which we all take for granted.</blockquote><p>The letter continues:</p><blockquote>They do have company pensions, none of which have delivered any increase in pension for ten years.  Furthermore, many pensioners in this category had their pensions reduced as a result of Minister Noonan's levy.  These are NOT private pensions - they are semi state pensions under ministerial control.<br /><br />The Retired Pension Associations of these companies have formed a united group to provide a single voice and we have written to Minister Regina Doherty explaining our case in detail.  While we have received an official acknowledgement, we have not had a response from the Minister.  We had the opportunity to present our case to the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection after which we were asked to present our case for legislative changes.  This is our response to that request.  It is most important to us that you understand fully the reality with which so many former state servants are living.</blockquote><p>I could make a few points about their proposals.  Some of their proposals are very good.  I cannot understand why the Minister has not replied in more detail to some of the proposals.  They call for a review of the minimum funding standard to potentially include flexibility on funding measures where necessary to avoid the overstatement of liabilities in pensions funds.  They state that binding arbitration by mutual consent is essential and that definition of ultimate responsibility for funding deficits in public sector company pensions funds is needed.  They state that the extension of employer debt to include a balance of funding proposal beyond a walk-away 12 month period is required in amendments to the Bill.  <br/><br/>Some of their points are very progressive.  Have they been taken on board?  Are they being discussed as part of the legislation for which we cannot get a date because it is so complicated?  We can reject the Bill.  Many pensioners have told me that while the &euro;5 is an increase, it is meaningless in terms of what they can buy with it.  We are talking about a sliced pan and a box of tea bags per week.  They might be able to afford that with the &euro;5.  The Government's policy of not addressing the fundamental structural issues which faced society before the austerity measures were introduced, but particularly after austerity measures were introduced, does not go far enough.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.415" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1361" speakername="Tommy Broughan" time="18:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400049#BBB00200"><p>I am delighted to have a brief opportunity to comment on the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2018.  There are welcome features in the Bill, including the increased maternity, adoptive and paternity benefits; the increases and proportionate increases in social protection payments; and the measures to address the budget 2012 pension anomaly, to which my colleague has referred.  In my pre-budget submission to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, which I entitled A Budget For All Our People, I asked for at least a general rise of &euro;7 per week, which the Department costed for me at &euro;485.94 million, which is nearly &euro;500 million, among other general increases, some of which I will touch on later.  It is regrettable that the increases provided for in the Bill will not take effect until March 2019.  Households will be under extreme pressure during the Christmas and New Year period and the March provision, as in 2018, is simply to push necessary Exchequer expenditure into the future.</p>  <p>  Sections 10 and 11 extend the provisions in the Act to ensure care-leavers receive the full rates of jobseeker's allowance and supplementary welfare allowance, rather than age-related reductions.  That is very welcome.  </p>  <p>  Section 12 sets out that domiciliary care allowance will be paid for three months after the death of the child being cared for.  I welcome that the Minister has introduced that in the Bill.  </p>  <p>  The total budget 2019 package for the Department was &euro;20.5 billion, about 46% of which is composed of the social insurance fund.  The budget office gave us a brief note on it.  It is &euro;9.3 billion from social insurance and &euro;10.8 billion of actual additional Government expenditure.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Finance has rigorously suppressed social welfare spending to the &euro;19 billion to &euro;20 billion range over the past eight years of austerity.  The expenditure ceiling included &euro;14 million capital expenditure and allowed for savings of &euro;50 million due to increasing employment figures which meant fewer people on the live register.  With the big surplus in the social insurance fund, the Minister could have been more expansive.  There are many other issues she could have addressed or paid back for longer periods such as the 2012 people.  The Minister had more than enough money to have gone to &euro;7 a week.  That is the reason I proposed it.  </p>  <p>  I also called for the income disregard - I give the Minister credit for this - for the one parent family payment to be restored to &euro;146 per week and the Minister has brought it to &euro;150 per week, which is noteworthy and creditable.  Recent research by the ESRI funded by our excellent Parliamentary Budget Office on the gender impact of Irish budgetary policy shows clearly that women were most adversely affected by the austerity budgets from 2008 to 2012.  Some of those budgets were supported by the Minister.  I welcome the increased focus on the worrying trend of the feminisation of poverty and homelessness.  I would have liked to have seen the Minister read out an equality budget statement on budget day, which is what we called for on the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.</p><p>Perhaps the Government will consider working towards it if there is another budget during this D&aacute;il or if there is any other opportunity.  The most vulnerable are always targeted because they are the least likely to have the time, energy or money to stand up for themselves.  I spoke recently on the excellent gender budgeting report produced by the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and I await the Department&rsquo;s social impact assessment of budget 2019.<br/><br/>I welcome the increase in the qualified child payment and I hope it will have a positive impact on child poverty.  As my colleague said, youth unemployment is still concerning.  More than 14,000 people under the age of 26 are on the weekly jobseeker&rsquo;s payment of &euro;107.70, while more than 2,000 are in receipt of &euro;152 per week.  Given the resources at the Department's disposal, it could have moved towards equalisation in this regard.  I am also disappointed to see the age-related discrimination in social welfare payments continue.  I notice the Minister abandoned the Action Plan for Jobs.  She said she is bringing forward a new programme, but at least with the Action Plan for Jobs there was a programme we could use to measure whether the Government was achieving what it set out to achieve over the past number of years.<br/><br/>The increase in the national training fund levy from 0.8% to 0.9% is welcome, although I advocated an increase to 1%.  Promoting apprenticeships, in particular among women, is important.<br/><br/>In regard to fuel poverty, I proposed an increase of &euro;7 in the weekly rate of fuel allowance, at a cost of &euro;72 million, and an extension of the season by four weeks.  While the one week extension is welcome, additional resources were again available to the Department to do more.<br/><br/>Section 9 provides for the long awaited and much-debated aggregated contributions method for contributory State pension calculations, which will address the anomaly introduced in budget 2012.  Two thirds or more of the pensioners are women, and I am glad the significant anomaly is finally being addressed for the 70,000 pensioners concerned.  At last, they are being contacted and they will, I hope, be entitled to a higher pension rate with payments backdated to March 2018, although some of them have complained that they cannot see why it cannot be backdated to the period when they began their pension.  Nonetheless, it is being rolled out for everyone from 2020, when the old averaging approach will be replaced by the new method.<br/><br/>I welcome section 20, whereby same-sex spouses and civil partners will have a right and entitlement to spousal pensions.<br/><br/>Section 4 provides for the new PAYE modernisation system that is coming into effect on 1 January 2019.  It is a real-time system which seems to offer important advantages for workers and employers to ensure, as Revenue states, the right deductions are made at the right time, deducted from the right employees and paid by employers, which is a welcome development.<br/><br/>I also welcome changes to the principal Act in section 17 relating to earnings disregarded for disability allowance, blind pension and certain supplements payable under supplementary welfare allowance whereby the phrase &ldquo;of a rehabilitative nature&rdquo; is deleted.  General employment will no longer be distinguished from employment of a rehabilitative nature.<br/><br/>The budget 2019 allocation for the disability sector was disappointing and I note the criticism from disability advocacy groups.  In the press release at the time, the Minister stated she was providing funding of &euro;300,000 to commission research into the cost of disability.  As she will know, throughout my career in this House I have repeatedly suggested the introduction of a disability allowance because people with a disability bear an extra cost in their lives due to their disability.  While a serious study on the matter is welcome, I wonder if it is just a sop to the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, who failed to start the programme this year and who may well be jettisoned by the Government during or after the next election.  The Disability Federation of Ireland costed a payment of &euro;20 per week and estimated it would cost approximately &euro;130 million.  Again, with the resources available, surely the Government could have begun this programme this year.<br/><br/>While partial restorations in the public sector have begun, following years of austerity, increases will not be paid until the end of March, a point which almost everyone has made.<br/><br/>The social protection system is a floor income to protect many citizens and it is known that social transfers reduce the risk of poverty.  Pre-budget briefing papers reported: &quot;In 2016, social transfers (excluding pensions) reduced the at-risk of poverty rate from 33.6% to 16.5%, or 17.1 percentage points in absolute terms.  This represents a poverty reduction effect of 51%&rdquo;.  The Think-tank for Action on Social Change did much good work on this issue, showing that social transfers have a significant positive impact on low-income families.  It is still the case in the social protection system, however, that applicants for so many benefits and forms of assistance must jump through various bureaucratic hoops.<br/><br/>It is time to look seriously at a basic income for all citizens.  A few years ago, I tried to introduce a High Pay and Wealth Commission Bill which would ascertain levels of income and wealth at the higher end of society.  My colleagues, Deputy Joan Collins and the Solidarity-People Before Profit have entered the same territory.  We are talking about dividing the pie.  We are supposed to be the second wealthiest country <i>per capita</i>on the planet after Luxembourg, according to the most recent World Bank figures.  Perhaps looking at the concept of a basic income as a right for every man, woman and child of our nation is the way that a Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection should proceed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.417" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1347" speakername="Mattie McGrath" time="18:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400050#CCC00200"><p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2018.  It is designed primarily to give legislative effect to a range of social welfare measures announced in the expenditure report of 9 October 2018, including increases in weekly welfare rates and pensions.  It will also provide for the continued payment of the domiciliary care allowance for three months in cases where the child being cared for dies, and increases in the weekly earnings disregard for recipients of the one-parent family payment.</p><p>Section 16 and Schedule 2 provide for new rates in relation to carer&rsquo;s benefit.  In my pre-budget submission, I supported the budget priorities of Family Carers Ireland, FCI.  I salute the organisation, its manager in south Tipperary, Councillor Richie Molloy, Ms Catherine Cox and all the carers for the invaluable and unquantifiable work they do in keeping people out of hospitals and in their own environment, where they are happiest and where they make better recoveries.  The organisation calls for the home care crisis to be urgently addressed pending the introduction of a statutory home care scheme.  It is a crisis because people cannot even afford to get sick, they cannot get time off work and they cannot get basic rights.  As we know, there are many categories of care, but it is astonishing how much &quot;juvenile care&quot; there is, about which I have cited figures <i>ad nauseam.  </i>Young people, who should be doing their homework or enjoying sport, are caring for loved ones in their home.  It is unfair and illegal.</p><p>FCI called for an increase in carer payments of &euro;20 per week and the carer support grant to be increased to &euro;2,000.  It also recommended increasing the income disregard for the important carer's allowance from &euro;332.50 for a single person and &euro;665 for a couple to &euro;450 and &euro;900, respectively, and extending allowable deductions.  While the Minister went some way to meeting those recommendations, she knows the job carers do as well as I do and she should not have to be told.  I also called for the Minister to address the anomaly affecting carers who have no State pension entitlement and to extend eligibility for carer&rsquo;s benefit to include the self-employed, as well as the extension of the free travel scheme to children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance, which is vital.  FCI also called on the Government to disregard carer's benefit and fair deal contributions in the assessment of student universal support, SUSI, grants, reduce processing times for carer's allowance and establish a centralised medical assessment unit.</p><p>It takes too long.  If anyone becomes sick, especially the self-employed, and they need a carer, the process is too slow and cumbersome.  The Minister needs to make efforts to speed that up and make the process more transparent and more relevant to the situations in which people find themselves.  I sincerely hope progress can be made on all of those issues, notwithstanding the changes made in the current Bill, some of which I welcome.  The Government kept talking about recovery during the last election campaign and paid a price for it.  The recovery is timid, feeble and very slow.</p> <p> One aspect of the budget is discrimination in allowances.  There are some people aged 18 who get them and others who do not.  That is unjust and not right.  According to official statistics, 100,000 in work are on the poverty line, which is bizarre.  Work must be viable and it must be profitable for people to work.  They do not need huge profits but it make sense that people who are working are not in poverty, if they are working 40, 50 or 60 hours a week.  The Taoiseach, the Government's great leader, is always talking about the man who gets up in the morning but 100,000 people go home in poverty.  It is a shocking figure.  Work must be rewarding and there must be incentives.  We need to correct these anomalies.  </p> <p> Earlier I was contacted by a man from County Wexford.  An employer approached him last week who had a job for someone in the retail trade.  Ten minutes into the interview the gentleman told him that if he could not earn &euro;600 in take-home pay, he could forget it.  Thee employer told him that he would pay him a good rate for every hour he worked but the man said that it did not matter, that he could forget it if he did not take home with &euro;600.  He explained that he was on a CE scheme, and earned &euro;200 odd on that, and was able to work an additional 19 hours a week through which he earned another &euro;350, mostly cash.  He also qualified for a medical card and, through that, for school books, the school bus, medicines, SUSI grants and everything else.  Above the 100,000 employees in poverty, people earn &euro;40,000, &euro;60,000 or &euro;70,000 who do not qualify for the medical card or any grant.  There is an inequality there and it gets worse by the year.  That must be dealt with.  These people are being discriminated against.  They go out to work, and want to work, but it is not right that the gentleman I mentioned could say that to an employer.  It is clearly wrong.  I do not begrudge him a medical card or anything else if anybody is sick but what about the working man who is barely above the thresholds for everything?  They are the new poor and they are ordinary working people, including small farmers, shopkeepers and the self-employed.  They are getting tired of this.  We must look after them because they get up in the morning.  They are the makers and shakers and if they are self-employed, they also provide jobs.  We must do something.  Some 33% of students are at risk of poverty and 9% of young people.</p> <p> The legislation also relates to defined pensions.  Many people, from many Government agencies, have contacted us.  They worked tirelessly all their lives for the State in Bord na M&oacute;na, RT&Eacute;, the ESB, county councils and so on.  They worked, paid their stamps and everything else and now they are being discriminated against, which is totally unfair.  These people did some service to the State, they built up this country and did the work.  </p> <p> I welcome the extra week of fuel allowance.  Under section 9, I want the anomaly where 70,000 pensioners, mainly women, are being punished to be rectified.  Section 4 provides for the real time payment of deductions by employers.  As an employer, which I should have declared at the beginning, that is welcome but we must give some supports.  The self-employed must do this weekly.  Where are they to get the man or woman power to do this?  In my case, my wife is the business secretary, but it is so onerous.  I agree that every penny which has been deducted must be paid over and the employees looked after; most small businesses have a good relationship with their workers, it is a two-way street.  They work diligently and the business owners look after them. However, making these decisions is very well, but the more onerous these schemes are, the more paperwork and bookkeeping that has to be done by the self-employed.  There is no allowance for the extra paper work.  Then each letter that arrives from Revenue contains a threat of significant penalties and fines, and even imprisonment.  The Government is driving people out of self-employment, and thereby losing jobs.  These are the people who made the recovery, small as it is.  They do not get foreign direct investment grants, although I also welcome those companies.  They do not get the IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland grants, they just give sweat and blood, and work hard on a 24-7 basis.  The Minister should think when she makes these sweeping changes every week.  It takes a great number of man or women hours with no allowance.  There is also the matter of cashflow.  The Minister said that deductions should not be used for cashflow but there is an overall system in business where they pay wages, insurance, PRSI and everything else.  Before there were VAT cycles of two months and sometimes 12 months.  It is more onerous, difficult and time consuming and is unfair to self-employed people who we should encourage.  Mol na daoine agus tiocfaidh siad.  They will keep giving, but they cannot keep giving if the Government is going to penalise them day in, day out in the budget with little care given by officials for the painstaking hours and sweat and blood they put into their businesses to provide those jobs, for themselves, in the first instance, and then others in their communities.  We cannot always make it too onerous on them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.419" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1263" speakername="Michael Collins" time="18:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400051#DDD00200"><p>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate, which gives legislative effect to a range of social welfare  measures announced in the budget.  It is important that I mention homemakers.  These women have stayed at home to care for their children.  While the homemaker's scheme introduced in 1994 went a long way to increasing the rights of homemakers by making it easier for them to qualify for contributory State pension, a generation of women have still been forgotten.  A group of women are in limbo and have been actively discriminated against by the introduction of the homemaker's scheme.  It is an issue I raised immediately after my election and I have continued to do so since.</p>  <p>  Earlier the Minister said the Department wrote to some of these women last week and will write to more of them this week.  I strongly believe that every woman who stayed in the home to care for her children should not suffer a loss in their pensions and they should be compensated.  The Fine Gael-Labour Government caused much distress to women and it is imperative that the Government writes to every one of these women without delay.  </p>  <p>  I cannot go on without mentioning carers who provide more than 6.5 million hours of care each week in Ireland.  They care for their loved ones for almost the equivalent of a full 40-hour working week.  Almost 9% provide 24-hour unpaid care, with no break at all.  Carers are waiting months from the time they apply to receive payments.  It is outrageous as, in many cases, the carer has given up employment to care for a loved one, yet they are expected to survive on nothing until their payments come through.  It is clear as day that this is not feasible for any carer.  It must be the case that on the first day that it is proven, with medical evidence, that a loved one requires care, a social welfare payment should be made to the carer.  That would cut out entirely the shambolic carry-on of leaving a carer five, six or seven months without any payment, something which is nothing short of outrageous.  </p>  <p>  I realised something only recently that the Minister might look into.  There could be a situation where a mother is looking after a very sick child and the child ends up in hospital.</p><p>Thirteen weeks might seem a long time for a child to be in hospital but that happens in some cases the child may be there even longer.  In most cases, the parent stays with the child throughout that time but he or she, whoever is the carer, will lose his or her carer's allowance after 13 weeks and if the child is discharged, he or she must reapply for it.  That is very cold and callous.  Surely medical evidence can be brought into play to ensure that is no longer the case.  People are in extremely difficult circumstances if they are at the bedside of a loved one for 13 weeks but for them to lose their carer's allowance and perhaps reapply for it is very unfair.</p> <p> In December 2017, I and my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group tabled a motion on home care packages.  In that motion we called for a home care package scheme to be established in law to allow everyone an automatic right to the service under the scheme.  We are still waiting.  I met a man in my constituency whose elderly mother was unable to avail of any home care despite her age and frail demeanour.  That person requires constant care and her family are only able to provide so much.  They were refused any home help hours.  That is a disgrace and appalling treatment of an elderly person who deserves more from our State.</p> <p> Regardless of the way this Government devises the budget, we still see that old age pensioners are left scrambling for pennies having worked all their lives and having paid taxes in this country.  Those people believe they have been forgotten and rejected by the Minister as well as by the previous Government.</p> <p> I was approached recently by a constituent of mine who sadly lost her husband and is suffering following that bereavement.  For any widow, it is an extremely difficult time and no widow should have to suffer undue stress.  It has come to my attention that a widow on a contributory State pension is not entitled to the six week payment but if that person was on a non-contributory pension, they would be entitled to the six week payment after the death of a spouse.  I understand that has always been the rule but the guidelines around the rule were highlighted recently to social welfare staff in a bid to tighten them up.  This is a rule about which there may have been some leniency in the past.  I argue that all widows should be entitled to this six week payment regardless of whether they have a contributory or non-contributory pension.  We need to support widows in what is a terrible time in their lives and we need to make their lives as stress-free as possible.  They lost the death, or bereavement, grant.  This is the only little bit of compensation they have to try to get their lives back to some level of normality.  It reminds me of a Minister in a previous government who said they would follow people to the grave.  The Government seems to be going about that in a professional way.</p> <p> Since August of this year, there has been a constant footfall through my door of very distressed constituents who are affected negatively by the change in regard to illness benefit.  It changed recently to a new online GP certification system that was introduced without adequate consultation with GPs and which, in turn, left thousands of people on illness benefit without payments for weeks on end.  When they eventually got paid, their payment amounts were irregular and they were underpaid.  That is an absolute disgrace.  People were coming into my office in despair, crying and stressed out, as they had no money in their bank accounts to pay their bills.  Some even had direct debits rejected, which, in turn, cost them money in the form of a penalty from the bank.  That should never have happened.  The Government owes more than just a simple apology to those people.</p> <p> It is important to mention a point I raised following the last budget because it is clear to me that I am not being listened to.  School children over the age of 18 and their parents receive no assistance from the State.  Second level education is very expensive and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance does not extend far enough to cover the year-long costs older students face, especially as many of them may need additional classes or grinds in the leaving certificate cycle.  We need to invest in the children of today as they are the future.</p> <p> I raise another important matter raised with me on several occasions by many people, namely, the community employment, CE, and the T&uacute;s schemes.  I have been contacted by a number of constituents who are on these schemes.  They are happy to be on them because it gets them back to work and, from that, they may get further employment.  As the Minister is aware, they get &euro;22.50 a week onto their payments while on these schemes.  That is very little for someone who is willing to go out and work hard.  They deserve a far bigger reward to encourage them to stay working.  I wrote to the Minister in July asking her to consider raising the &euro;22.50 social welfare payment in the budget as it is not sufficient in the current economic climate when one considers the extra costs such as travel costs, etc., people on these schemes incur.  I welcome the fact the budget provided that from March next year, social welfare payments will increase by a maximum of &euro;5, which includes the payments under the CE and T&uacute;s schemes.  However, the people on those schemes, who are willing to travel to work, and God knows they do brilliant work in their community such as doing meals on wheels or working on the local Tidy Towns association or community council, deserve much more than they are getting.  This has been an issue for some time; it is not something that started yesterday morning.</p> <p> I dare not start talking about Turas Nua because the issues with it will be the subject of an inquiry this country will face in the future because the way people are treated is nothing short of appalling.  I am aware of one man living on an island who was told he had an appointment at a certain time in the morning but the ferry did not leave on time.  He would have had to swim to make the appointment with Turas Nua but what did it do?  It cut his welfare.  He was making a 26 mile journey.  He was trying to make his way from an island but there was no understanding or consideration shown to him.</p> <p> I know another gentleman who did a year with Turas Nua only to be told how to shower.  That is appalling in this day and age, but, of course, it docks the figures for welfare so it looks good.  We have to look into that scheme.  The Minister has stood idly by and accepted it as being a solution but I do not accept it as being one.</p></speech>

It is a mixed bag in many ways.  There are measures to be welcomed, measures that have been omitted and other areas where the Minister has not gone far enough.  There is no doubt the situation this year is less tight than it was in previous years, and that is to be welcomed.  More funding is available within the social protection budget, and that is a good thing.  What I do not get from this budget is a clear strategy as to how the Government intends to proceed in respect of providing supports to people to ensure they are raised out of poverty and, to the greatest extent possible, facilitated and supported in getting back into the workforce and not only into any job but into a decent job.  That is much more complex than simply the approach, which the previous speaker mentioned, we are seeing from Turas Nua and Seetec, which is more about box-ticking than identifying a young person's needs, particularly in respect of training and education.</p>  <p>  From my experience of having spoken to people working in this area and following on from the experience of the Youth Guarantee initiative in Ballymum, the reality is that the level of need on the part of many young people who have dropped out of school is such that it is not just about sending them off to pack shelves in the local supermarket.  The approach should be much more complex in terms of identifying the basic educational needs many young people have.  Many young people who find themselves on a reduced rate of the jobseeker's allowance and without many choices in life are in a situation where their needs are extremely basic.  They often have literacy needs and needs in terms of being able to get themselves organised to get up in the morning to get out, where they may be coming from a family situation or a community where it is not norm for people to get up and go to work or to have a longer-term ambition to develop a decent career.  It is much more complex.  It is essentially a reflection on our social policies, in particular our education policies in that many young people have been failed by the education system.</p><p>It is due to myriad reasons obviously.  However, there must be a recognition of the basic needs of young people who are on jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit at a young age.  There must be an earnest attempt to match those people with the kind of training and education opportunities which exist.  They may find themselves in a job where they are only earning money within a matter of months or even years.  It can be much more beneficial to the individual concerned and to society if that person can be trained up and their educational gaps filled to ensure they are in a position to access a better paying and a more satisfying job.  A mistake was made in forcing young people into situations which do not hold out much prospect of developing themselves and their careers into the future.</p> <p> Getting back to the point about the lack of a strategy, at a point when we are close to full employment, it has to be recognised that children have borne the brunt of austerity over the past ten years.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has managed to put the focus on children in this budget.  That is a good development.  The increase for a qualified child is important but should have happened a few years ago.  It is good it happened this year, however.  Improvements in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance are also good.  The two weeks&rsquo; paid parental leave for each parent is good.  I welcome the Minister starting a pilot programme in respect of hot meals for children in DEIS schools.  It is quite incredible when one considers that all schoolchildren having access to hot meals has been standard practice in the UK for donkey&rsquo;s years but we are at the stage of talking about a pilot project in some DEIS schools.  It shows how far behind most other countries we are in that regard.  I recognise it as a start, even if it is only a pilot, however.  The focus on children is good but it needs be ramped up quickly.</p> <p> Sections 5 to 8, inclusive, 15, 16 and 19 deal with payments and rate increases announced in the budget.  The &euro;5 a week increase across the board is to be welcomed.  However, if we are serious about tackling the issue of poverty, a whole strategy needs to be pursued to address it.  It has been a long time in this country since the issue of poverty was addressed in any serious evidence-based way, particularly regarding children.  We know the rate of child poverty doubled during the recession and the years of austerity.  That significant figure of between 8% and 9% is a terrible reflection on our society and the Government.  It indicates the extent to which children and families got left behind during the austerity years and bore the main burden of austerity at a time when it could have been shared much more fairly and equally across society.  That was a big mistake.</p> <p> For many years to come, as a society and an economy, we will pay the price for the fact that so many children are now living in poverty as a result of government policies over the past ten years.  We see that at its most dark in terms of children who are homeless.  However, it is there in so many other ways such as lack of access to decent food and clothing, a warm house, as well as being able to participate in sports.  These are all basic items which most of us take for granted.  These will have a real, severe and lasting impact on children's lives to the extent that they lose significant parts of their childhood.  The likelihood is that they will never make up for these.  Whatever about adults living in poverty and putting up with hard times, when it comes to children doing that, they lose years, opportunities and learning periods which will never be recovered.  That kind of child poverty leaves lasting scars on people, does lasting damage and has a lasting impact on society.  The current level of child poverty is shameful.  It cannot be described in any other way.  We need a clear strategy to tackle deep ingrained child poverty which tends to be area based.  We need clear strategies to deal with that through income support, as well as ensuring good quality services for children living in those circumstances.  It is not just equality of opportunity.  It is not just about the services available to every other child living in a family that is in a position to nurture and care for them.  It is about compensating for the gaps in those children's lives.  That must not just be done through income support but really good services.  Unfortunately, poor children, in the main, have access to much poorer childcare, educational, housing and health services.  We should be reversing that and ensuring children who are living in dire poverty have access to good childcare and health services in order to counteract and compensate for those other shortcomings in their lives.  We have not done that, however.</p> <p> That is why we need to develop quickly an ambitious anti-poverty strategy.  We have waited too long for that.  It should be all encompassing with an all-of-government approach.  I recognise work is going on with early years but it has to be a whole-of-childhood approach to ensure that current levels of child poverty are eliminated.  They also have to be eliminated in a short time.  While governments might take that longer term view, that does not apply to children.  We owe it to these children to ensure they are lifted out of poverty and provided with the kind of compensating services as soon as possible.</p> <p> An issue which has been raised with me several times this year relates to increases across the board in social welfare payments, particularly where an individual or a couple have a State pension, an occupational pension and an entitlement to a medical card.  Several people have spoken with me who are concerned that, as a result of the &euro;5 increase in their State pension, it will take them above the income limit for a medical card.  Medical cards for the over 70s involve gross income with no disregards.  I have put down parliamentary questions on this but I have got vague responses from the Minister stating she would keep it under review.  The likelihood is that it will be a real situation for people.  The medical card income limits have not changed.  As a basic, they should keep up with inflation and reflect increases in welfare payments.  I am concerned that when the increases kick in that we will have this issue where some over 70s are in danger of losing their medical cards.  Will the Minister address that issue?</p> <p> We need to ensure the long waiting times for access to some social welfare benefits are eliminated.</p><p>They are extremely long for certain payments.  For example, it takes 17 weeks to process a carer's allowance application which means a person must wait four months for a payment.  It is similarly the case in relation to carer's benefit, the State pension and disability allowance.  In this day and age, with computerisation and improved technology, we should be able to reduce those unacceptable waiting times.</p> <p> For some time, there has been a dire need to increase the number of medical officers available to assess applications for medical-based payments.  There is a very high rate of refusal for some medical-based payments but when those refusals are appealed, the appeals are upheld at a very high rate also.  Something is critically wrong there.  It is costing the Department in administration terms and it is also imposing a cost on the individuals concerned.  This has been a stand-out area that needs attention and I urge the Minister to look at it.  It is clear that something is wrong when payments are awarded at such a high rate on appeal.  As such, the initial review appears to be merely a desk-top exercise before one has all this back and forth and paperwork.  I ask the Minister to consider tackling that at its root source.</p> <p> There are a number of anomalies in relation to pensions.  People who attained pension age on 1 September 2012 or after are not entitled to a full State pension as a result of the yearly averaging method.  The Bill seeks to amend this 2005 change, which is welcome but there is an issue.  While the changes announced are fine and deal with a lot of the cases concerned, there is an issue about failing to backdate payments.  If it is wrong now, it has been wrong over the years since 2012.  It is going to be a real problem once the payments start and people are told about their entitlements.  I would have thought we should be seeking to go back further.  A pathway should be set out to restore most of that.  As others have said, letters are going out and it is a matter that must be addressed very quickly.  It was a real slap in the face, in particular to the women concerned who took time out of the workforce.  I hope the matter will be addressed, that those letters will go out quickly and that people will be put on the payment.  I also hope, however, that the Minister will review the matter of backdated payments.</p> <p> Sections 10 and 11 close a loophole which saw those in State care receiving a lower level of jobseeker's and supplementary welfare allowance in certain circumstances, which is welcome.  However, one must also ask why it has taken so long.  There is a concern that the provisions do not address the scandal of the fact that, according to Focus Ireland figures, 15% of individuals exiting State care this year are homeless and face the myriad problems that involves.  I accept fully that HAP is not within the Minister's area of responsibility but more work must be done to ensure that those exiting State care move into housing.  There is a requirement for a much better level of co-ordination between the Minister's Department and Tusla and local authorities.</p> <p> Section 12 of the Bill provides for domiciliary care allowance and its welcome continuation for three months after a child passes away in those tragic circumstances.  It is a very important measure.  There is some lack of clarity, however, around the respite care grant and whether it is payable for a person who passes away before the point in the year when it is paid.  It arises now in respect of domiciliary care allowance, but there is also an issue in relation to other people because of the fact that the payment is claimed early in the year but is not paid until June or thereabouts.  If a person dies in the meantime, there is a lack of clarity about the payment.</p> <p> In relation to the earnings disregard for disability allowance, blind pension and SWA, section 17 ends the stipulation that those working part-time while in receipt of those payments could only engage in work of a rehabilitative nature.  That is a very good thing as we should encourage people to get out and work without this back and forth to a GP.  As such, I welcome the measure strongly.  Section 18 deals with the one-parent family payment and this applies to some extent also to the working-family payment.  The Bill provides for an increase in the earnings disregard for one-parent family payments and I welcome very much what the Minister has done in that regard.  However, we also have a situation in respect of childcare.  The Minister will recall that when a predecessor of hers was making those cuts, it was promised that they would not kick in until we had a Scandinavian style of childcare provision.  Unfortunately, we are still very far away from that.  This is something that needs constant attention.  We must ensure people are supported and facilitated to return to work.  A great deal of the work lone parents who return to the workforce do is low-paid yet they are expected to meet very expensive childcare costs.  While a start has been made in that regard, a great deal more must be done.</p> <p> While a number of measures in the Bill are welcome, the main thing is to ensure a strategy is put in place to tackle child and adult poverty.  We must have a clear way to get from where we are now to a situation in which everyone is assured of support in work or on welfare such that their basic needs are cared for.  I acknowledge the work of the Vincentian Partnership.  I am sure the Minister is familiar with it.  When one considers the basic things people need to live a life with dignity, we are still a way from providing them for certain categories of welfare recipients.  The aim should be to reach those levels of provision.</p></speech>

I will allude to that in a couple of moments.  I thank the Minister's officials who ran a briefing session for Members yesterday which was helpful and informative.  It is important to note that.  I will not go through every section of the Bill given that I am sharing time, but I acknowledge the main provision in the budget which was an increase of &euro;5 across most payments for those in receipt of full payment amounts.  It would be remiss of me to fail to acknowledge the earlier contribution to the debate of my colleague, Deputy O'Dea, who has since left the Chamber, and I do so now.  He always strikes early on behalf of pensioners with his call for an increase in pension payments.  He is first out of the blocks on that one on an annual basis.</p>  <p>  As I said last year, the Minister is the one sitting here and she is getting the brunt of my contribution, but many of the issues I will raise are not referable to her Department in isolation.  This is about joined-up thinking in government.  The people we are here to serve, represent and look after do not look at the Department and at Opposition, they look at Government and how they are being served and dealt with.  As we go through programmes, it is important to look at things from that perspective and not in isolation.  I acknowledge that I have only the Minister here tonight and that she cannot be held responsible for every other Department but it is important that the public has a sense that there is a joined-up approach to what we do.  Specifically, I make the point that it seems somewhat unfair and unreasonable that the people who will benefit from increases in social welfare will only receive those increases in March.</p><p>However, workers who receive an increase as a result of a tax adjustment will benefit from that in January.  Somewhere along the way, the Government must get its act together.  Benefits being given to people who are finding it difficult to survive on social welfare payments or who are in low-paid jobs should be delivered at the same time.  I understand that the Government only has a certain amount of money, but this is an important point.</p> <p> I acknowledge that some of the budget day announcements did not require legislation.  I particularly wish to mention the Christmas bonus which was announced but which is not referred to in the Bill.  It is important that there is clarity and understanding regarding the extra week paid at Christmas.  People have begun to rely on it and it should be established as a regular annual payment rather being treated in a discretionary manner year after year.</p> <p> I wish to refer to statistics because sometimes when we discuss increases in social welfare payments, people not in receipt of them fail to realise the importance of the payments and the difficulties experienced by some of those who do receive them.  Incrementally, there has been there has been a slight improvement in the rates year by year.  Some 11.1% of children were in consistent poverty in 2016, an improvement from 11.5% in 2015.  Some 25.2% of children experienced deprivation compared to 31% in 2015.  Those are improvements but the figures are still high and I doubt that the Minister is happy with them.  I wish to put on the record the importance of each social welfare Bill.  Those figures will improve as a result of the measures being brought in by this year's budget.  However, it is important that we are constantly mindful of the outstanding issues.</p> <p> When the Minister appeared before the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection last year, she asked what are the most important issues for the committee.  The two issues highlighted to her were the 2012 pensions anomaly and lone parents.  The issue of lone parents will not be solved as quickly as the 2012 anomaly.  It will take consistency over several budgets to do so.  We know that the rate of consistent poverty is far higher among lone parents than the general population.  I acknowledge that improvements are being made on an annual basis.</p> <p> Organisations such as St. Vincent de Paul are receiving twice as many calls this year as they were a decade ago.  The Minister heard the figures referred to by other Members.  Some 780,000 people in Ireland live below the poverty line.  That is the context in which the Minister is bringing forward the Bill.  It is important that we do not think of it as a giveaway.  It is a lifeline and a necessity for those dependent on social welfare.</p> <p> I wish to again refer to sections 20 to 23, inclusive.  Section 20 provides a right of entitlement in certain circumstances to spousal pension benefits for same sex spouses and civil partners who are members of occupational pension schemes.  Sections 21 to 23, inclusive, relate to the Civil Registration Act.  I support the amendments and am glad they were brought forward.  However, I am disappointed that the primary Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017 has not been advanced.  As I stated, it is a bit of a mess in the sense that the heads of the latter were published but then the Second Stage debate commenced without some critical elements regarding defined benefits being in place.  However, the Government's hand had been shown.  No progress has been made on the Bill for a year.  Although I acknowledge and support dealing with those issues now because they need to be dealt with, I encourage the Minister, insofar as is possible, to try to advance the 2017 Bill in regard to defined benefits in order to bring clarity.  The longer it is left open, the more opportunity there is because the heads of the Bill have been published.</p> <p> Last week, the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection began to examine bogus self-employment contracts and so forth.  Although a representative from the Department commented that the number of self-employed as a percentage of the total workforce is diminishing, the self-employed still account for a significant 15% of a total workforce.  That percentage is greater than it was one, two or three years ago.  I acknowledge that the Government has improved the lot of the self-employed.  I was self-employed for several years before I was elected to the House.  I understand that the issue of jobseeker's benefit for the self-employed will be advanced at a later date but I would like it to be dealt with as quickly as possible.</p> <p> Last year, there was much debate on the State pension, which is addressed in section 9 of the Bill before us.  Section 9 deals with a matter which was discussed at committee and was the subject of a Fianna F&aacute;il motion in the House.  There was complete agreement that the matter had to be dealt with.  I welcome that section of the Bill.  As I stated to departmental officials at the briefing, I am glad that there is clarity on a date to which the payments will be backdated.  I acknowledge that other Members have asked why they are being backdated to 2018 rather than 2012.  The Minister will say that she does not have the money to backdate them to 2012.  We were bogged down on the issue for a considerable time.  People were very unfairly dealt with and this section affords an opportunity to remedy that.</p> <p> As I informed the Minister on Question Time, that issue should not be seen as setting a precedent for the separate issue of the new total contributions system.  While I acknowledge that the aggregated contributions system is on a 40-year basis with up to 20 years provision for caring, the new total contributions system may not employ the same mechanism.  I ask the Minister to consider the issue of people keeping their own records.  When a person applies for a contribution statement, the period of caring does not clearly show on it as a credit and it is difficult for people to ascertain the extent of the Department's knowledge in that regard.  The Minister should examine that procedure from an administrative point of view and consider a situation whereby the credits for a person who takes time out of work to care for children for two or three years appear as they go on his or her statement and he or she receives the disregard at some point in the future.  That does not currently seem to be the case.</p> <p> I welcome section 12, which deals with the domiciliary care grant.  I welcome that the grant has been extended for the families of children who die during the relevant period.  Deputy Shortall raised the issue of the accompanying respite care grant.  The respite care grant is generally paid if one is in receipt of this payment in the month of June and I assume that will continue to be the case.  My experience is that there are higher levels of appeals of application for the respite care grant in certain areas and it seems to be more difficult to get the grant in such places.  I ask the Minister and the Department to examine that.</p> <p> Section 3 rightly deals with the employment contribution.  It provides for an increase in the reckonable earnings threshold for employees from &euro;376 to &euro;386 where employer PRSI contributions are paid at the lower rate.  In the light of the earning threshold increase, the Minister is ensuring that the situation remains neutral.  As I stated, the Minister cannot do everything.  The logic behind the section must apply everywhere.  The point made by Deputy Shortall is that people who would previously have been eligible, whether through a medical card, GP card or over-70s medical card, may now not qualify based on increases they will receive.  The Minister has recognised that and taken appropriate action in the Bill.  I ask her to work with colleagues to ensure that the same principle applies across the whole of Government.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for her attendance.  I wish to touch on some of the positives in the recent announcement which result from the Minister's input and the confidence and supply agreement, such as the &euro;5 per week increase in social welfare payments, including the old age pension.  The reinstatement of the 100% Christmas bonus is very welcome, as are the reduction in prescription charges for the over 70s, the extension of the fuel allowance payment to 27 weeks and the increase in the back-to-school allowance which affects many people in that category of need.</p><p>However, I would like to mention some areas it might have been better to have looked at in a more positive light.</p> <p> It is disappointing that the living alone allowance has not been increased because those who receive it feel somewhat disenfranchised.  Obviously, they are extremely vulnerable.  They would have liked an increase in the living alone allowance.  Even though many people who live in urban and remote environments rely on their phones, there was no further enhancement of, or attempt to reinstate, the allowance to help such people.  Those who live alone depend on their phones to contact the outside world when things go wrong.  They also need phone connections to facilitate panic and security alarms.  The mobile phone network is not always reliable or consistent and can vary from location to location.  I am asking for the phone allowance to be looked at because it is of great importance for elderly people who live on their own and need their phones for contact and especially for security.</p> <p> Self-employed people need to be able to access better supports when they are out of work.  Many of them create employment in their own right and thereby create vibrancy in the local economy.  If they end up out of work for any reason - perhaps because of a slowdown in their jobs or because they are out sick - they continue to have to contend with outgoings like mortgages and living costs.  They cannot access the State payments or supports that can be accessed by others who are not self-employed.  This is something that needs to be examined because, for reasons with which we are familiar, self-employed people who create employment are the lifeblood of local economies.  They should get better supports.  We should seek to roll out support mechanisms to them over a phased period so that they are not disenfranchised in the way they have been up to now.</p> <p> I would like to mention two other issues, the first of which relates to defined benefit scheme pensions.  A number of people in my constituency have brought to my attention an issue that arose when a defined benefit scheme closed down.  The retired members first made a claim under the insolvency payments scheme in respect of unpaid employers' contributions as long ago as 2010.  Eight years on, no decision has been made on that.  I ask the Department to consider the need for a body or organisation to which these grievances can be referred.  The pensions organisations do not have the resources to challenge pension schemes or well-financed companies.  That is causing a major problem for people who have done the right thing by making contributions, but in whose cases returns have not been made by their employers.  Such people are finding a major negative.  There are considerable time delays in having such issues dealt with.</p> <p> I wanted to raise an issue relating to the T&uacute;s scheme with the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty.  It is a pity that she has left the Chamber.  I am well aware that she has been here all evening.  I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, will bring the point I am about to make to her attention.  There is a lack of flexibility in the T&uacute;s scheme.  As public representatives, we all see this in our communities.  People who have been on the T&uacute;s scheme for 12 months have to move to the JobPath scheme.  When they have moved to JobPath, they are not allowed to pursue, or engage actively with, the T&uacute;s scheme in parallel.  This is causing major problems.  As unemployment decreases and employment increases, fewer people are coming through from the social welfare system to fill positions on the T&uacute;s scheme.  I have worked closely with my colleague, Deputy O'Dea, on this issue.  The Minister accepted the proposals made by Deputy O'Dea regarding the CE scheme.  The flexibility that was afforded in that case should also be afforded in the case of the T&uacute;s scheme.</p> <p> People who work with voluntary groups and organisations all over the country - the list is endless and it includes football clubs, athletics clubs and tidy towns committees, etc. - have to finish up with the T&uacute;s scheme after 12 months and go into JobPath.  As we know, JobPath involves meeting a team leader or case worker once a week to get help in putting CVs together as part of the effort to access full-time employment.  That does not take up 19.5 or 20 hours a week.  I have raised this with the Minister and her officials.  I hope she will consider the introduction of some type of flexibility in this scheme.  There is no cost to the State.  I am well aware that we cannot make changes that would impose a cost on the State.  To the best of my knowledge, having spoken to and received information from officials in the Department, there is no cost to the State.  It is clear that after people have done a T&uacute;s scheme for 12 months, they have to move to JobPath.  They should be afforded some flexibility so that they can continue on the T&uacute;s scheme while engaging with their JobPath case workers in parallel.  The coaching they receive in the context of JobPath helps them as they try to get into full-time employment.  I understand that meetings with case workers take up approximately two hours a week.  This means that community groups and clubs could get 17 hours a week, as opposed to the 19.5 or 20 hours a week they currently get.  This would be extremely welcome because they are getting nothing in these circumstances at the moment.</p> <p> I have contacted the Department and tabled parliamentary questions to ascertain why people are not coming through in various areas to fill vacancies.  As we all know, the reason is that some people are ineligible and others might not meet particular criteria.  As the rate of unemployment decreases, the numbers are not there.  The fact that someone is on a T&uacute;s scheme or a CE scheme for one or two years - I am focusing on the T&uacute;s scheme at the moment - will not prevent him or her from seeking out full-time employment.  I do not see a negative here.  Participation in a T&uacute;s scheme is not a negative against a person.  It does not prevent him or her from getting full-time employment.  That will not happen.  If he or she is driven by the search for full-time employment, he or she will seek it out in its own right without engaging with JobPath.  I understand the policy that is there.  I understand the regulation which provides that a person in these circumstances must engage with JobPath after a year.  That is fine, but I ask the Minister to look at making the regulation more flexible so that people can engage with JobPath while working on a T&uacute;s scheme at the same time.  That would be of considerable benefit to JobPath participants, especially those who are socially excluded for the time during the week when they are not involved in any scheme.  It would also be a major advantage for host groups, such as sports clubs, and for the community.  The added value that these schemes and those who participate in them bring to host groups and communities is underestimated.  Without this extremely valuable work, we would not have the wonderful organisations and communities that we have.  I hope the Minister will consider this point.</p></speech>

This debate gives us an opportunity to reflect on the contents of the Bill and to examine the complexities of the entire social welfare system.  I welcome the &euro;5 increase in various weekly social welfare payments.  People who depend on social welfare for their entire income are being pushed and put under enormous pressure, particularly with the cost of living going the way it is.  At a time when the cost of everything is escalating, it is only right that we should look after those who are most vulnerable.</p>  <p>  I would like to raise a number of issues.  There has been a great deal of talk about the disproportionate effect of the cuts that were made in 2012 on the pensions of those who spent a number of years out of the workforce.  One of the most difficult things I encounter in my constituency office and my clinics is when people - predominantly women, but men in some cases - tell me that their weekly pension payments have decreased considerably because they do not have enough self-employment contributions.  The changes in the system that came into force in 2012 are extremely unfair.  During the Order of Business this morning, the Minister outlined what she hopes to do.  It is not before time.  It is vital that we deal with this matter urgently and adequately.  We must make sure everything possible is done to make sure people get fair and adequate pensions.  These people have worked all their lives and have contributed significantly to society in all the roles they have played.</p>  <p>  There are a number of ongoing issues in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.</p><p>These include the very long delays in processing applications, particularly for those benefits with medical elements, namely, disability and illness benefit, invalidity pension, carer's allowance and carer's benefit.<br/><br/>To go back to the carer's allowance, many people must make a decision about taking time off work to care for an elderly relative or a relative who requires full-time care and assistance.  These people can work for up to 15 hours but they must go to their employer and state they are either giving up work completely or reducing their hours.  I will take the example of somebody applying for the carer's allowance today who will give up work completely.  The application process will take 14 or 16 weeks and, in some instances where there are issues with the application, it could take anything up to five or six months.  The Department will state that the payment will be backdated to when the application was made but it is not much good to tell an electricity supplier, a bank or anybody else that a decision will be made in four or five month's time.  That is simply not acceptable.  We meet many people who consider their family circumstances when making decisions.  They go to their employer to state their intention to leave work.  They must then be without income or work for a certain period.  There are issues with how people will pay their bills during this period.  Carer's benefit has been availed of by many people in order to care for children, parents or siblings.  The position regarding carer's benefit, which was introduced in 1999, should be examined.  It is to be availed for a period of two years and extending it needs to be examined because people need care for a long time.<br/><br/>There are massive delays with carer's allowance applications and these are unacceptable.  I have come across instances where families make decisions and there are major delays.  The State is always trying to protect its financial resources but, by and large, carer's allowance is granted and backdated to the application date so there is no financial gain high up or low down for the State.<br/><br/>Is there a shortage of medical assessors in the Department?  Is there an issue with the constant backlog relating to applications?  When we follow up on applications, we are told the Department is dealing with a particular week.  What is the position with the backlog?  Can additional resources be made available?  These applications are made on very sound grounds.  Claims are also made on medical grounds.  People submit their applications, medical assessments are made and, where they occur, refusals are reviewed or appealed.  The appeals officer will hear about the exact care being provided and he or she will grant the application.  If a decision is made to refuse an application, there should be a simple way of dealing with it rather than going through an appeals system for a year or a year and a half.  In some instances, we have had carer's allowance applications that were ongoing for almost two years.  This is simply not acceptable.  Action needs to be taken.  People making applications for carer's allowance has the best interests of their loved ones at heart.  They are also saving the State an awful lot of money.  In today's edition of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, there is a story in respect of the famous &quot;bed blockers&quot;, which is a terrible phrase but it is the language that is used.  Carers free up services and beds to allow people to use them.  The position in this regard should be considered.<br/><br/>I have examined the costs and other aspects of JobPath and it is completely beyond its sell-by date.  It is time the Minister examined it.  JobPath was introduced at a time of high unemployment, which we do not have at present.  People on JobPath are not available for CE schemes or any other schemes through which they could enhance their lives, contribute to their communities and return to the workforce in a meaningful way.  All of the people on CE schemes take huge pride in the work they do in their communities because they get recognition from local people.  JobPath is a joke at this stage and should be seriously examined.  We have had many debates about CE supervisors.  The Department will state that they are section 39 workers but this is not the case.  What has happened to the review?  A Labour Court decision was made in 2008.  Why has it not been followed through on?  What can be done to ensure proper pensions for people on CE schemes?  This is very important.<br/><br/>As we are discussing social welfare, I want to raise another issue.  We have spoken about the absolute delay regarding illness benefit.  It is very difficult to understand what advice or information the Department received.  My understanding is that the new software is not able to deal with the application forms.  Many people have been left without payments since June or July this year.  No one can do without an income.  Illness benefit should be examined.<br/><br/>The new carer's allowance form is 40 pages long.  The disability allowance form is 36 pages long.  The farm assist, invalidity pension and non-contributory pension forms are each 20 pages long.  The form for the family income supplement, which is now the working family payment, is 16 pages long.  For a carer's allowance application the details of the applicant, the details of their spouse or partner and the details of their children are required as are details of their financial resources and those of the person for whom they are caring and the medical report of the person for whom they are caring.  In the name and honour of God, it takes 40 pages to do this.<br/><br/>Many people completing these forms go to public representatives seeking assistance.  This morning, we had a discussion about public service reform to try to bring Government closer to the citizen and ensure every citizen of the State can get their benefits or access to the State when he or she requires it but we have introduced a new application form that is 40 pages long.  Looking at the bureaucracy, and I will stick with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, every form has been made more complicated.  Applying for something gets more and more complicated and the services of the State are thereby made less accessible to citizens, particularly people on the carer's allowance in their time of trouble or, for that matter, those on any other social welfare payments in their time of need.<br/><br/>The disability allowance form, which is a means tested payment, is 36 pages long.  One could write a great deal in 36 pages.  We need to simplify the bureaucracy.  We need to get the information and simplify it.  We need to make sure that if these applications are to be made online that it is simplified.  For carer's allowance, so long as there is a detailed medical report and the income details of the applicant it should not be so complicated as to require the use of a form that is 40 pages long.</p><p>Many have applied to participate in farm assist in 2018.  It has been a very difficult year, particularly in the spring.  There was an escalation in farming costs this year.  Farmers have been submitting accounts for 2017.  The system needs to be able to assist farmers or fishermen, through farm assist or fish assist, when there is serious or immediate pressure in a particular year.  Farm assist is to help farmers when they experience financial difficulty.  They should be eligible when they are in financial difficulty, not the following year or the year after that.</p> <p> There are anomalies associated with farm assist payments that we have addressed through appeals and a meeting of minds with social welfare officials.  Farms now exist in many forms.  Partnerships are featuring whereby two members of a family may be involved in farming.  Farm assist should be able to take account of their circumstances.  One partner might be very seriously ill or have dementia.  In such cases, it becomes an awful struggle to get farm assist for that person.</p> <p> There needs to be genuine flexibility.  I acknowledge that the Department will want to protect itself and ensure the moneys in the Vote for any scheme or measure are spent in the best way possible.  There is a simpler way of proceeding.  The system could not be more complicated and difficult.  People who depend completely on social welfare for their income feel isolated and challenged enough already.  We hear about the growing economy but there are many who, through no fault of their own or through ill health, for example, need assistance.  A huge Vote is put through for the Department every year.  Public sector reform is fine but the service of the State should be brought closer to the citizen.  The citizen should be empowered to get the desired information.  If an individual encounters complications on websites, be it that of the Department or Citizens Information, he or she might not apply for assistance.</p> <p> The working family payment has been great, particularly where there is but one member of the family working.  It has been examined.  Although the application form for the working family payment is 16 pages long, the new system is operating reasonably well.  We cannot find fault with it.  We should, however, encourage people to apply for the payment because, even if the amount of money received every year is small, it is beneficial.</p> <p> Let me return to the issue of JobPath.  There is a challenge associated with the rural social scheme because of the growing employment opportunities.  We all welcome these.  The rural social scheme has been very good around the country.  There are also the T&uacute;s programme and CE schemes.  For as long as I have been here, there has been an aversion to the schemes, particularly at certain times.  They have always been challenged.  I believe we need to simplify the system by having just one or two schemes.  T&uacute;s, the community employment schemes and rural social scheme need to be simplified.  There should not be JobPath or any other diversions.  The Minister and Department should seriously examine JobPath and its development over time.  They should determine the benefits to the individual participant.  What have participants gained from it?  Serious questions should be asked about it, particularly in regard to 2018.  Going into 2019, I believe it is well past its sell-by date.</p> <p> When will the new home-care credit system for calculating the contributory pension be in place?  People currently applying for pensions may benefit under the new scheme but have to proceed under the current rules.  When the rules change, what will be the position of somebody who has not made enough contributions to get a full pension?  Are such individuals in limbo?  Should they apply under the scheme?  Will there be backdating?  Will individuals be facilitated?  There needs to be a very clear, simple leaflet to show exactly what people should be doing.  When people are approaching 60 or 65 years, they look for the records.  I thank the Department and the Minister for their actions in this regard.  I refer to going online to get records.  The Department did open up and allow us to get our records again.  I thank the Department for this because many people looking for their records do not have broadband and would be the least likely to have computers or the Internet at their disposal.</p> <p> I welcome the overall thrust of the Bill and some of the schemes referred to in it.</p> <p> Every Deputy is inundated with questions on the contributory pension.  The sooner we have factual documentation on it, the better.  For God&rsquo;s sake, will the Department get to grips with the delays in processing applications?  They are causing considerable undue hardship, particularly in respect of the carer&rsquo;s allowance, illness benefit and disability payment.  People who are very vulnerable and their families are being put at a disadvantage because they are not getting the answers they require as early as possible.  I am thankful for the opportunity to speak on the Bill.</p></speech>

There are many things that need to be addressed.  One of the disappointing features of the recent budget has been the lack of basic reform.  There had been talk of introducing a working-age payment whereby, rather than having a myriad of schemes, there would be one working-age payment.  That seems to have died a death.  There was also the concept of partial capacity, which was partially introduced.  The idea was that it is unhealthy for people to be idle when they could do some work.  There are many in receipt of disability payments, the disability allowance or the invalidity pension &ndash; long-term disability payments &ndash; who could do some work.  The idea was to encourage as many people as possible to get work, even if it was not paying a lot of money.  That is why one has to leave the welfare in place.  It is well proven medically that idleness leads to more morbidity, higher mortality and more frequent visits to the doctor.  I am disappointed that there seems to be no wide vision.  There are some small changes but there does not seem to be a wide vision in terms of the reform of social welfare.</p>  <p>  The way people who claimed illness benefit in recent months were treated was terrible.  It is fine to say there was only a certain amount and that there was only a few hundred euro or whatever but I am referring to when people are depending on a weekly payment and have very little else.  A couple approached me recently about this.  The man had a small farm and a job in a factory but got seriously ill.  The payments came erratically but the bills do not come erratically.  One has to keep paying the bills.  In the old days, one would have gone to the local community welfare officer and got the payment made up, and then one would have paid it back.  To go to a community welfare officer now, one has to fill out an eight-page form.  It takes two weeks to proceed so one is still caught.  The old days of instant solutions in the circumstances in question are gone.</p><p> The idea of a basic wage has a great attraction, that is, one pays a basic amount to everybody and if people earn money beyond that it is taxed.  There is a completely linked-in system that does not have many crinkles in it.  From the minute somebody starts earning money he or she gets money to take home.  Our system is based to an extraordinary degree on a Victorian model of social welfare, that is, we will only pay somebody the money if the person is available for work but does not work.  If I earn &euro;200,000 per year the maximum tax is approximately 55% if I am self-employed.  In PAYE employment it is 4% for PRSI, 40% for tax and 7% for USC over &euro;100,000.  That is 52%.  We will call it 50%, give or take.  It is 50% if I am on &euro;200,000 per year and if I earn another &euro;100,000 I get to keep the guts of 50% of it.</p> <p> However, because our attitude towards welfare is that we are generous to people on welfare and that people are sitting with their hands out rather than not being able to get a job for one reason or another, we take a totally different approach under the social welfare code.  Depending on the scheme somebody is on, a person can be penalised up to 100%.  Some 100% of everything somebody earns can be taken in a means test.  If a couple falls beneath the threshold of &euro;300 per week and one person earns &euro;100 per week, the Department takes &euro;100 away.  That is the highest tax rate in the country if one considers taking money a form of taxation.  As it is a reduction in one's welfare it is not seen that way, but when somebody's money is taken away he or she does not care about the guise under which it is taken.  All the person knows is that he or she sweated to earn &euro;100 and somebody just came along and took it.</p> <p> Farm assist is considered a generous scheme, but 70% of everything the farmer earns on the little farm in Connemara or on the hills of County Wicklow is taken away.  The person on &euro;200,000 does not pay 70% of everything he or she earns.  Then we wonder why these people do not have an incentive.  That is why I am attracted to the basic wage.  Under that system people get their payment and when they earn money they pay tax at the same rate as everybody else.  As they earn more, they pay more tax.  However, they would not find that when they fall beneath the magic threshold of the social welfare rate suddenly the effective tax rate, called a means test and a reduction in the payment, becomes 50%, 70% or 100%.  That is not the experience of many people.  Most people who have had PAYE jobs never face this.  They go on illness benefit or jobseeker's benefit for nine months and, if they are lucky, they get back into the system before they get caught in the jobseeker's allowance.  However, for many people in many areas in this city and in places such as Connemara, east Galway and Wicklow, this is the wall they face, and we appear to make no progress.</p> <p> There are two ways of tackling this without jumping to a basic wage.  Going to a basic wage immediately would be a big step that is probably too radical for the system.  Let us start with a basic premise of what can be done to reform the system.  First, one could state that no means test reduction will be at a rate of higher than 50%, that is, no matter what one earns one always gets to keep 50% of it.  That would still be equivalent to the highest rate of tax, including PRSI and USC.  That incentive, given where people are now, would be a great leap forward.  One could justify it being 20% but let us start with 50%.  One has to move forward in slow steps because the system and particularly the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform do not get these concepts.  One must lead them by the hand, show that the sky will not fall in and that it is just and fair.</p> <p> I wish to discuss the new change the Minister introduced for those who got caught by the decision made by the then Minister, Deputy Burton, to reduce the payments for those who had a low average amount of contributions paid or credited to entitle them to the State pension.  Before doing so I will address an issue that also causes many problems for people, namely, how capital is assessed.  I will spell out how capital is assessed in the social welfare system.  In most schemes it is quite simple, although there are exceptions such as the carer's allowance which is much more generous.  The first &euro;20,000 of savings are ignored.  That is not too bad.  The next &euro;10,000 count as income of &euro;10 per week, which one can live with.  With the next &euro;10,000 the system says the person is earning &euro;20 per week, which is &euro;1,000 per year plus two weeks.  It is &euro;1,040, to be precise, on that &euro;10,000 in the bank.  If somebody has savings of &euro;50,000 the last &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;40 per week on that amount.  That is an interest rate of over 20%.  Please tell me what bank in Ireland is paying 20% interest rates on deposits these days.  One might say it is a large amount of money to have in the bank.  I know people who live in very poor circumstances who save money.  They work very hard and spend very little.  I have seen people living in very poor circumstances but, unfortunately, I could not persuade them to do up the house and get rid of the money so they could get a proper social welfare payment.  That is the reality.</p> <p> Let us consider another scenario.  Due to the change made by Deputy Burton when she was Minister, many people depend on the increase for a qualified adult, IQA, or what was the adult dependant allowance.  In other words, the person gets the State pension based on his or her spouse's or partner's contributions.  When one is considered a dependant adult one's income cannot be greater than &euro;100 per week.  That looks fine until one encounters certain scenarios.  One is where a person works in the public service all his or her life, ends up on a finishing salary of &euro;80,000, does not read the rules of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and retires and gets the lump sum of one and a half times his or her salary, which is &euro;120,000.  In the first scenario the person puts it in the joint bank account of the person and the spouse.  In that case, the person has just disqualified the person and the spouse from the adult dependant allowance because when one works the magic formula one finds it is over &euro;100 per week.  The person will not get the full adult dependant allowance.  That applies even if the couple has no other savings.</p> <p> However, in the second scenario the person read the small print on the tin and knew not to put it into a joint account but into a personal account.  Since it was the personal money the person had earned, not the spouse's, the couple will legitimately get the full adult dependant allowance.</p><p>This is reality.  I have cases of people who are getting caught in this.  Consider the couple who always had joint bank accounts.  If they have any extra property over and above, even if it was totally paid for by the one working income and not the dependant's income, and if they are stupid enough to put it into two names thinking they were being very wise and doing what the State has always said to do which is to put everything in both names, they will suddenly find the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection writing to them asking them what they have in the bank.  If they knew to put it just into the one name of the person who had earned it then they could not be touched.  It is quite farcical.  The whole way of assessing capital needs to be reformed.</p> <p> I will move on to JobPath.  I believe JobPath is a total waste of money, and I say that as someone who has had the advantage of employing people in the past.  I do not know why we keep following these schemes that come in.  It used to be said "T&aacute; na Francaigh ag teacht thar s&aacute;ile, arsa an tSeanbhean Bhocht", but what we have nowadays is "T&aacute; na sc&eacute;imeanna ag teacht thar s&aacute;ile, arsa an tSeanbhean Bhocht".  The schemes are all coming in and we look at somebody, but we never analyse whether it is in anyway sensible or not or whether it actually does anything.  I ask Members to think about this.  If there is an employer out there, and if there are people who are very employable, then I can guarantee those people will get employed, but without JobPath.  Obviously, if they are forced onto JobPath they will go onto JobPath and then JobPath will claim that it got them the jobs.  That, however, has not been my experience and I am interested to hear Deputy Fitzmaurice's comments because he too has worked in the real world and has employed people.  I do not know if he goes to JobPath or through CVs or if he finds out through interviews or some other method where a good and likely person is to give him or her a job.  One looks for someone who will get the job done.  In my previous life as a co-op manager I had a fair number of people working, and some of them have since become hugely successful in their own private lives.  Some of them did not get many educational chances, but they had the magic factors: hard work, a good personality and drive.</p> <p> I do not believe that JobPath is doing what it is supposed to be cracked up to do.  It is driving a lot of people around the twist in the way it is rigidly applied.  Companies only get paid by putting on the churn so even if a person does not need them he or she is forced into them.  Even if the companies are doing nothing for the JobPath people they are forced into them.  Even if a person is never going to get a job he or she is forced into them.  I know plenty of people who were called into them and they went along because their payments would have been stopped otherwise.  They were put to doing things that they were convinced would never serve them on any great path.  The reality is that the normal problem with unemployment is that there are more people than jobs.  There is another aspect that we seem absolutely reluctant to admit exists, namely there are some people who will never get commercial jobs.  I stress that there is nothing wrong with them, except that they will never get a competitive commercial job no matter how long one is at it, just as I could never be taught music.  I hope nobody faults me for that.  I just cannot do it.  This is a reality that we seem absolutely blind to.</p> <p> This leads me to the scheme jobs.  We are so cruel and mean, because there are people who will never get commercial employment.  All they ask of us is the opportunity to go on a scheme and to stay on a scheme.  They keep doing the Tidy Towns and the janitorial work in local halls.  They perform a whole lot of services that we urgently need in our communities and they do so for a minimal cost to the State.  T&uacute;s placements cost in the region of &euro;5,000 or &euro;6,000 per year.  When people are earning in that way it does not take into account all the other intangible benefits to the State, including on the health service, of a person getting up in the morning and going out to work.  What we say to these people is you get a year and then it is good luck.  This is in a situation where we cannot fill the T&uacute;s places.  Recently I asked for the figure, and I will check it, but I believe we now have some 100,000 people who have been long-term unemployed for more than one year.  Yet, we will not allow those people to stay in the T&uacute;s scheme where there are no other people who are eligible, especially in rural communities, to continue to provide the very necessary services we all enjoy.  In the Aviva Stadium on Lansdowne Road or in Croke Park, people are paid to keep those places and the dressing rooms spick and span and they will get wages.  In rural Ireland our other Croke Parks are fantastic sporting facilities.  There are also fantastically well maintained community centres.  I doubt any other country has the sporting facilities in as many rural areas as we have.  We have fantastic dressing rooms and everything kept as Croke Park is kept with regard to goalposts, lines, grass cut and the whole lot.  That is all being done by people working on schemes.  Do we not think this is important work?  Our kids have the great luxury these days of growing up and finding these well run and well organised facilities, but we do not think this is important.  I find this absolutely extraordinary.</p> <p> When I introduced the T&uacute;s scheme I had never intended for it to be a one year scheme.  The Department of Finance at the end of 2010 said I could either take the scheme with that codicil, which I did not agree with, or have no scheme.  So I took it and I am still glad that I took it because now at least there is the T&uacute;s scheme on which to build.  It was supposed to be the match of the then rural social scheme that has been madly and meanly cut in various ways, including a means test.  The T&uacute;s scheme was supposed to be the match of that where urban people, or non-farmers in rural areas, could get onto a scheme and stay on it for a lifetime if they never got anything better, and they could continue to do the useful work we all need done.</p></speech>

I will not hold the House too long.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I welcome the increase that will apply to pensioners and others in receipt of social welfare.  There are some worries, however.  As every Deputy is aware, there are people in the State who might have worked for a few years and put up a few stamps or they may not have put up stamps and got back into work later on.  When they apply for their pension they are basically cut because their contribution is averaged out over the number of years.  This is a problem for them and it needs to be addressed.  I am aware that a scheme was brought in, and rightly so, where if a person in the farming community had paid in for the past ten years he or she could get that pension.  We need to address the anomaly.  There will be another Bill to address the issues of women in the State who had to give up work, and those who stayed at home to care for their children.  Instead of being rewarded for the service and for what they did for their country they are now being penalised, which is absolutely disgraceful.  I am aware that the Government has a Bill coming in to address that, but I hope it is not just tightened up and left in a way that is impossible to get to.</p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v referred to employing people.  I would say that 99.9% of employers do not phone JobPath.  They try to suss out someone in a local area who is fit to do a job and they employ that person.</p><p>That is not the way it works in the SME sector or in small businesses around the country.  A lot of them would not even be registered with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to get this.  As was pointed out, there is a major problem.  It happened a year ago and it is coming again this year now that Christmas is coming.  I remember speaking to the Minister about it.  We cannot put a price on it.  It is great that our tourism figures are gone up.  It is great that the number of people coming into the country is rising.  However, we must tackle a problem that is happening right around the country and especially in the rural areas, in the community employment, CE, schemes and the T&uacute;s schemes.  That problem is not having people to do work in the Tidy Towns.  We talked about sports facilities but a great amount of work is done by Tidy Towns.  Tourists drive around Ireland and look at our towns.</p> <p> Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said we have 100,000 long-term unemployed.  It is a sad damnation on the Department that there are Tidy Towns committees that have to pay people to do the work because Joe, Mary, Tom or Pat does not qualify because their year is up or for whatever reason.  That should not be allowed.  I am a firm believer that if people are unemployed, for the sake of their own mental health and feeling involved in a community, for the &euro;20 a week or whatever they get they would be better off out doing something than being inside a house.  It would cost more because we would need a few supervisors or whatever but the payback to the country in all those areas - cities, towns and small villages in rural areas - would mean we would be gaining from what had been achieved.  It is good that people are getting more work.  There is no-one criticising that.  It is good that the economy is picking up but with that comes situations such as what we are dealing with now.  Five or six years ago, we would have had plenty of people for CE schemes or F&Aacute;S schemes but now the criteria are beating us.  At the moment if a committee has not got somebody and it makes an application for Joe who is a great fellow, or Mary, saying it wants to keep them on, Joe or Mary do not qualify.  That one thing would help so many people.</p> <p> On top of that there is the well-being of those people to be out talking to someone, doing a bit of work.  It is absolutely crazy that we do not give that opportunity to them.  If that was the only thing we looked at in the next few weeks I ask Ministers to do so.  Especially in small rural villages, people are crying out trying to keep their villages in good nick.  They are volunteers and they cannot get someone on the CE schemes.  The rural social scheme has been a great success.  We need more people on it.  It keeps a lot of family farms viable in rural areas and a lot of work done.</p> <p> There is one part of social welfare that I can never understand.  If somebody was working, in Dublin or anywhere else, and for the love of his or her mother or father, if one of them got sick, the person would go home to help care for that parent.  Say the woman's husband was on whatever amount or on the income threshold, and she wanted to look for carer's allowance to mind her loved one, she will be refused carer's allowance.  By the way, giving it to her could save the State probably &euro;800 a week even though it cannot see that, because if the parent was in a nursing home it would cost that.  If the woman shows she is giving something up, I cannot understand for the life of me how she would be refused when the State is saving money.  If they decided to bring the parent to Dublin to a nursing home, what would the figure be then?  It would probably be &euro;1,200 or &euro;1,400.  I cannot understand why we are doing stuff like that.</p> <p> There is a need to take care of the self-employed as well, for example if they get sick.  Generally we have seen down through the years how an employee would rightly qualify for some provision but the self-employed person would have to go through the rigours of everything to try to keep food on the table.  We need to respect those who are self-employed.  I welcome the tax measures in the budget for self-employed people and see that we are starting to move another bit in the line of balancing it.  I think it has gone up &euro;230 and one more round might get it level with the tax credit for the &euro;1,650.  That is welcome.  We need to make sure for those people who take risks that if something goes wrong there is a back-up plan.  </p> <p> I am not going to hold the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, all night.  I believe the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, is looking to get in.  I ask the Minister of State to look at those CE and T&uacute;s schemes because they are crucial.  We are going to see this backfiring because there will be towns that will do less well than they are doing at the moment.  Ireland is relying a lot on tourism, especially in the west, and we do not want to have anyone saying a place was dirty or there were papers lying around, or the flowers were not done.  A great amount of work is done and I cannot fathom how it does not cost an awful lot extra.  Let us look at ways of making sure it is efficient in the way it is done but for people who are unemployed there should be a system in place so that they are given that facility.  What it does for them as well down the road is a help.</p></speech>

I would like to thank Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Fitzmaurice for their contributions this evening and Deputies on all sides of the House for their contributions to this Second Stage debate.  Unfortunately, the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, could not be here for all of the debate this evening and has asked me to convey her apologies but I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this very important legislation.</p>  <p>  The Bill reflects the ongoing strong commitment of the Government to restoring and maintaining the real value of core welfare payment rates and to delivering measures which can have a tangible impact in terms of alleviating poverty for those groups most at risk.  The increase of all core weekly payment rates by &euro;5 for the third successive year, the targeted reform of increases for qualified children, and the enhancement of earnings disregards for lone parents are all aimed at delivering on those commitments.</p><p> I appreciate that Deputies acknowledged that the Bill contains a number of very positive measures.  I would like to respond to a few of the specific issues raised in the course of the debate.</p> <p> I confirm that the increases in the age-related qualified child payment will be introduced at the same time as the increases in the primary rates on dates between 20 and 29 March 2019.  These new rates are specifically included in sections 16 and 19, and in Schedules 2 and 3 of the Bill.</p> <p> Separately, section 15 and Schedule 1 provide for the changes that must be made throughout the Bill so that where, up to now, the reference was to a qualified child, in future we will be referring &ldquo;to a qualified child who has not attained 12 years of age or a qualified child who has attained 12 years of age&rdquo;.  These changes will be introduced by commencement order in tandem with the rate increases in March of next year.</p> <p> Many of those who spoke pointed out that the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2018, including key measures relating to defined benefit pension schemes, has yet to reach Committee Stage.  I understand the frustration of Deputies in this regard and I know that it is shared by the Minister.  In July, Government approval was obtained to draft additional provisions to be included in the Bill on Committee Stage, including provisions relating to defined benefit schemes.  In developing these, it is essential to recognise the current pension landscape in Ireland in order that a balanced, proportionate approach is developed and that unintended negative consequences do not arise.</p> <p> Under existing pensions law, there is no legislative obligation on the employer to make contributions to a scheme.  The provisions of the 2017 Bill, however, will introduce a new regime into the Pensions Act 1990 that, among other things, will ensure an employer cannot walk away at short notice from the pension scheme it is supporting by providing a 12-month notification, and will enable the Pensions Authority to make a funding obligation direction specifying payments to be made by a sponsoring employer to the pension scheme where no agreement is reached, within a specified time period, to resolve a funding deficit.</p> <p> The defined benefit pension provisions are very technical and involve complex policy issues.  It has been necessary to consult and obtain numerous legal advices from the Office of the Attorney General on various aspects of this policy to achieve a resilient solution.  When these matters have been resolved and amendments approved by the Government, the Minister will immediately look to proceed with Committee Stage.</p> <p> On the 2012 pensions issue, I am glad that the provisions at section 9 of the Bill have been generally welcomed here.  These are designed solely to address the position of those affected by the changes to the rates band introduced in 2012.  The changes involved took effect from September 2012, when the rates of State pension (contributory) paid to those who had a yearly average of less than 40 contributions were lowered, as a step towards a more proportionate system.</p> <p> The House will be aware of the separate process under way to develop the formal total-contributions approach which is planned for 2020, drawing on the extensive public consultation the Minister has undertaken.  To ensure that a clear distinction is drawn between these two approaches, the terminology employed in the Bill to provide for the 2012 issue is &ldquo;aggregated contributions approach&rdquo;.</p> <p> Alongside the legislative provisions being provided for in the Bill, significant preparatory work has been undertaken within the Department, for example in designing and developing the necessary ICT system changes.  The latest data identified approximately 79,000 pensioners to be reviewed, of whom just over 70,000 reside in Ireland.  The first 11,000 information letters issued last week to Irish residents and it is expected that the remainder will issue by the end of this week or early next week at the latest.</p> <p> The letter informs pensioners that the Department will contact them again directly with either the outcome of their individual review, where sufficient information is already available, or to request further information regarding gaps in their social insurance records.  The examination of social insurance records is under way.  Reviews and payments will commence in the first quarter of 2019.  Where an increase is awarded, it will be backdated to 30 March 2018, or the person&rsquo;s 66th birthday, if later, and arrears paid.  Pensioners who do not qualify for an increase as a result of this review will continue to receive their existing rate of pension.</p> <p> The level of child poverty among children was raised in the course of the debate.  This issue has been a priority for the Minister since coming into office.  All sides of the House recognise and accept that it must be a priority.  Under the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures Framework, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, in collaboration with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and other relevant Departments, is taking a whole-of-Government approach to tackling child poverty.</p> <p> The years 2015 and 2016 saw the first reductions in the number of children in consistent poverty since 2008.  As new figures are produced by the CSO, I am hopeful that the impact of the economic recovery will be reflected in those figures, given the strong link between unemployment and poverty.  The Government continues to focus on activation to help people back into the workforce.  The measures contained in this budget, particularly the increase in the qualified child payment, will also contribute.</p> <p> Social transfers play a crucial role in alleviating poverty and inequality.  Ireland is among the best-performing EU states for reducing poverty through social transfers.  In 2016, for example, social transfers more than halved the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children, from 40.3% to 19.3%.  It is worth reiterating the point that reducing child poverty is not just about income supports and welfare.  Rather it is also about supporting parents to make the transition into employment and assisting families through the provision of quality affordable services in areas such as education, health, housing and childcare.</p> <p> Deputies O&rsquo;Dea and Brady, among others, commented on the increase in the weekly rate of social welfare payments to come into effect towards the end of March next year.  The Minister would have liked to have been in a position to introduce these with effect from January, but this would have meant that the amount of the increase, which will of course continue into future years, would have been reduced or some category of social welfare customers would be excluded altogether from the increase.  I am certain that the House would not have wished to see that happen.</p> <p> The Minister will be introducing legislation in the coming months in good time to ensure that the legislative base for the extension of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit to the self-employed and the new parental benefit scheme will be in place before these important reforms are introduced before the end of 2019.</p> <p> Deputies raised a considerable number of other issues which could not be addressed in the budget or in this Bill, including matters relating to carers and people with disabilities, in which I have a special interest.  The past three budgets have introduced major increases in services for carers and for people with a disability.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, have played a major part in that.  In addition that requires a whole-of-Government approach.</p> <p> As is always the case, the Minister had a limited amount of resources available to her in framing the 2019 social welfare budget.  It was simply not possible to address everything that the Minister and the Government would wish to address but there are, of course, areas which will be considered in the future.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.448" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="20:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400063#QQQ00500"><p>I will endeavour to continue from where I stopped when I began my contribution.</p>  <p>  I propose to bring forward a number of amendments to the main provisions dealing with the Cork boundary alteration following consultation by the Department with the Cork implementation oversight group and comments received from the Cork local authorities since the Bill was published.</p>  <p>   I will now go through the main provisions of the Bill in detail.  The Bill is set out in five Parts made up of 32 sections and the associated Schedule.  Part 1 contains standard provisions dealing with the Title, collective citations and commencement.  It also provides for interpretation of key terms, regulations, orders and directions as well as a technical provision for expenses.  </p>  <p>  Part 2 alters the boundary between the county and city of Cork as indicated on the deposited map with effect from the day it is appointed by the Minister, which is intended to be a week after the local elections are held in mid-2019 when the new councils take office.  It goes on to deal with a number of consequential matters, including the transfer of staff, land and buildings, property other than land, the transfer of rights and responsibilities, the continuation of leases, licences and permissions, the financial settlement that the transfer will require between the two authorities and the preparation of maps of the new local authority administrative areas that will apply after the transfer day.  Any land and buildings in the transferring area owned by the county council will automatically vest in the city council with effect from the transfer day, apart from any exceptions that might be agreed between the two local authorities before that day.  When it comes to staff and non-land property, the two local authorities will need to jointly agree and designate the property and the staff numbers and grades that should transfer.  The usual safeguarding of employment terms and conditions will apply to the transferring staff of the county council.  All rights and liabilities attaching to anything that transfers to the city council will automatically also transfer.  There are also provisions to establish the Cork boundary alteration oversight committee to assist the two councils in performing their functions under the legislation and a key part of this will be an implementation plan that the committee will be required to prepare.</p>  <p>  The final sections in this Part deal with arrangements between the two authorities for the performance of functions in the transferring area and the obligations on the councils and their staff to facilitate compliance with the legislation.  A boundary alteration on this scale generates considerable work for the local authorities involved and the Cork implementation oversight group, which the Bill establishes on a statutory basis as the oversight committee, was set up just over a year ago to engage with the two authorities and oversee the implementation process.  I have already provided financial support in the region of &euro;1.2 million in 2018 to Cork City Council and Cork County Council and intend to make similar allocations next year towards additional staffing requirements to carry out the significant work required to prepare for and implement the reorganisation of both administrative areas.  As well as preparing the implementation plan, the oversight committee will be able to provide advice and recommended solutions to any stumbling blocks that arise in agreeing the terms of the financial settlement that should apply or what staff posts and property should be designated for transfer.</p>  <p>  Part 3 contains other consequential provisions, such as data sharing requiring the county council to give the city council all the information, including personal information, which the city council might require for the purpose of performing functions in the relevant area.  For the local financial year 2019, the Bill provides that the relevant area remains part of the rating area of the county council until 31 December 2019 and the county council&rsquo;s budget and the municipal districts&rsquo; schedules of works for 2019 continue to apply for the rest of the year as if the boundary alteration had not happened.  The city council will, however, during 2019 set the municipal rate and decide any variation in the local property tax rate for 2020.  This means that the basis on which the 2019 budgets were prepared will remain valid for the year.  </p>  <p>  The Bill provides that the registers of electors to be used by the two Cork authorities for the 2019 elections will be based on the post-boundary alteration position so that the electors in the relevant areas can participate in the election of the councillors who will represent them when the boundary changes take place a week after the election.  Interim polling district and polling place arrangements to cater for the new administrative areas are also provided for.  It is intended that the development plans, local area plans and also the local economic and community plans relating to the relevant area will continue to apply after the transfer day until such time as Cork City Council makes replacement plans or variations.</p>  <p>  When it comes to planning, the Bill provides that the county council will complete any planning enforcement proceedings commenced before the transfer day and conclude any planning application cases already under way at that time, while the city council will be responsible for new enforcement proceedings that arise after the transfer day.  The city council&rsquo;s development contribution schemes will apply to the relevant area and the transferred development contributions applicable to infrastructure projects in the relevant area will continue to be ring-fenced for infrastructure and facilities in that area.  </p>  <p>  The remainder of this Part provides for the interim continued applicability of any rules, regulations or by-laws applicable to the relevant area, together with a general saver for Acts and instruments done before the transfer day and for arrears of rates, rents and housing loan repayments continuing to be collectible by the county council.</p>  <p>  Part 4 deals with amendments to the Local Government Acts of 2001 and 1991 and an amendment to the Valuation Act that will mean the city council will not be able to request a revaluation of the transferred properties on the basis of the boundary alteration.  The 2001 Act amendments are consequential to the boundary alteration and the amendments to Part V of the 1991 Act are to provide that future boundary alterations can be effected by ministerial order only where the local authorities concerned are in agreement.  This will mean that boundary alterations in future will require to be effected through primary legislation where the change is not something that the two authorities agree should happen.  However, where they are in complete agreement about the need for a change to the boundary, the quick and simple procedure for effecting the change by way of an order under the 1991 Act will continue to be available.  The Committee Stage amendment providing for joint structures to facilitate local area planning for urban areas that span county boundaries, which I mentioned a number of weeks ago, will provide an alternative way of ensuring the appropriate future development of towns and cities that straddle two local authority areas without changing the local authority boundaries.  </p>  <p>  Part 5 amends the Local Government Act 2001 by inserting a section to provide for a single chief executive with dual responsibility for Galway City Council and GaIway County Council.  This will facilitate administrative integration of the two local authorities in advance of the merger recommended by the expert advisory group.  Similar dual management arrangements were put in place in Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford ahead of the mergers of councils in those areas and they worked well.  This approach, which was recommended by the GaIway expert advisory group, will see two separate elected councils being retained for the 2019 local elections and, at the same time, facilitate the decision in principle that has been taken to merge the two authority areas by 2021.</p>  <p>  I will, as I mentioned two weeks ago, bring forward several amendments on Committee Stage, which I hope will be taken well in advance of the turn of the year.  Chief among these will be amendments related to plebiscites for directly elected mayors and to committees for cross-boundary urban areas.  Other Committee Stage amendments that I will propose to sections of the Bill dealing with the boundary alteration mainly arise from the consultation with the Cork oversight group and comments received from the two Cork authorities that I referred to earlier.  </p>  <p>  I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.449" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="20:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400063#QQQ00600"><p>I will share time with a number of my colleagues.  I thank the Minister of State for the detail provided this evening.  I am pleased to speak on the Bill and its implications.  Any document that has at its heart the issue of boundaries will elicit much passion, interest and debate.  Debates about boundaries in this country, whether they are international, as we see at present, or county boundaries, have always generated passionate debate.  Debates about boundaries in today's Ireland have more to do with planning and the results of how populations have sprawled beyond old urban boundaries than about marauding forces breaching boundaries.</p><p>Nonetheless, the passions can be just as high.  As a part of this initial boundary review, the results of which we are now debating, my home county of Meath was subjected to a review and a concerted campaign by Louth County Council's elected members and executive to seize part of Meath and take it for the town of Drogheda.  This land grab was fought back with even more passion by Meath County Council and our inhabitants who sought to stay within the royal county.  </p> <p> Leaving aside the issues of this land grab that concern the heartfelt desire for one's children to play for a good footballing county, what was really at play here was the key issue of resources.  Officials from Louth County Council gazed across the border into County Meath and saw thousands of homes and the potential for local property tax income, coupled with the potential for the rates income of large businesses located across the border, which was a highly motivating factor. </p> <p> Having been involved in a boundary extension a decade ago in my town following an order by the then Minister, John Gormley, I know there are many officials in Meath who can suddenly become the most talented map-makers one would ever see.  In my town of Navan, we have the largest zinc mine in western Europe and there was no way that mine's rates base was going to move from the county council area into the town area.  Lines were drawn in Meath County Council headquarters that one could compare only to the division of Africa by the colonial powers and they were ultimately endorsed by the Custom House.  In the long run, however, that did not matter because Fine Gael killed local democracy in towns anyway and, therefore, the budgets were all merged onto the county council books.</p> <p> The point we are debating in respect of Cork is the same.  When we consider the Bill and address the need for the transfer of assets, income and expenditure from one authority to another, it is the issue of money that always arises and is the overriding concern.  At the time of the review in all of these counties, be it Meath, Louth, Kilkenny, Waterford, Roscommon, Westmeath, Galway or Cork, the people themselves only wanted authorities to provide good service, as evidenced by the submissions received, and for the county to which they belonged to be the authority providing it.  We in Fianna F&aacute;il believe that respect for county boundaries is essential and should be respected.  </p> <p> The extension of the city boundary in Cork is being done to ensure the orderly expansion, continued prosperity and growth of Cork city, and to reflect the true nature of the area the city encompasses.  This will not, therefore, have any impact on the integrity of county boundaries.  Ensuring we have a strong counterbalance in the south of the country to the ever growing over-concentration of high-tech development, industrial development, infrastructure and housing in Dublin is essential.  In Cork city, the people's republic, there are the skill sets, dynamism, third level colleges and infrastructure to do this.  The city council must be able to capitalise on that foundation.  It needs to be supported by these legislative changes and we in Fianna F&aacute;il are happy to support that process.  The extension of the city council boundary to places such as Ballincollig, Blarney, Glanmire, Little Island and Cork Airport into the city, and the expansion of the city's population from 125,000 to approximately 250,000, will allow the city expand and grow by attracting investment as a city on a European scale.</p> <p> In Galway, also, the Bill provides for the creation of a chief executive officer, CEO, to administer the local authorities of the city and the county.  The current city manager in Galway, Brendan McGrath, with whom I had the pleasure of working for many years, is a former senior official and manager of Meath County Council.  He is a credit to the local government service and one will find no finer county or city manager.  I am sure he will do an excellent job in the transition period. </p> <p> As I mentioned in my opening remarks, it is the issues of finance, assets and debt that have exercised most minds.  There needs to be much more clarity in respect of these arrangements for the Cork expansion to provide real certainty for both authorities and to allow them prepare financially in a proper fashion for 2019 and thereafter.  While there are big headline issues that will need to be addressed quickly, there is a myriad of services that cross over the councils and need detailed examination to be resolved.  Some 400 services are being transferred from the county to the city council, ranging from the big issues such as housing, roads, rates, rents, local property tax and so on, to more nuanced and emotional issues such as burial grounds looked after by the council.  I accept that there is a timeline for the transfer of the big headline items, but will those other issues be worked out also?</p> <p> There is concern from members and officials in Cork County Council in respect of this.  As local government spokesperson for Fianna Fail, I have met the mayor, Patrick Gerard Murphy, the CEO, Tim Lucey, and the leaders of the respective party groups, Councillors Seamus McGrath and Kevin Murphy.  The Minister of State said the liabilities will transfer to the city council, but there are concerns from that delegation that in sections 9 and 11, there is an apparent anomalous situation whereby property and assets could potentially transfer to the city but the related liabilities would remain with the county after the transfer day.  The representatives from Cork whom I met requested that the Bill would clearly state that on the transfer day, when property and functional areas transfer to the city, all pre-transfer day liabilities attaching to that property and functional area shall also transfer to the city.  Furthermore, they seek Cork City Council to be obliged to indemnify Cork County Council in respect of any other potential and unknown liabilities.  In the Minister of State's closing remarks, will he address and explore this issue?</p> <p> Section 17 deals with the financial settlement, which is of key concern to ensure there is a smooth transfer.  There are some technical issues which need to be looked at as the Bill progresses, such as the activation of the review after the financial settlement.  Whether this takes place not later than three years after the making of a settlement, as proposed, or not earlier than three years, as sought by Cork County Council, can be discussed.  The Bill contains no reference to the continuation of the financial settlement period beyond ten years.  Cork County Council members previously stated their strongly held position, however, that the financial settlement should be a fixed annual sum, index-linked on annual basis and payable from the city to the county, that it should not cease after ten years and that a further review beyond the initial ten-year period could be considered as deemed necessary and appropriate.  As one can see in section 17(5)(b), there is no provision for a fixed amount on an annual basis in terms of the financial settlement, which has caused concern on the behalf of the Cork County members.  </p> <p> I raise these concerns because they were raised with me.  I wish to see the Bill's smooth passage and discuss these matters and others with the Minister of State.  As he stated, it is necessary for the legislation to be enacted this year to enable all the necessary provisions in time for the local elections next May, but I would appreciate examination of these concerns.  My party and I wish to be supportive to his work in achieving that goal in order that we achieve the bigger goal of a more prosperous city and county in both Cork and Galway.  I hope that whatever issues need to be ironed out are, ensuring a smooth, swift and efficient passage of the Bill.  </p> <p> Finally, I am interested in the amendments which could be tabled on Committee Stage, in particular in respect of committees for cross-boundary urban areas.  The matter was problematic in the Minister of State's region and it is problematic in mine.  We must seek to address that for the benefit of citizens around the country where there has been urban sprawl which does not serve our people well. </p></speech>

It has dragged on for long enough and, as the Minister of State will be all too well aware, we face local elections next May.</p><p>These represent delays on the preparations by incumbent and prospective candidates, which straddle several Cork constituencies and local electoral areas.  While I understand the thinking behind the extension of the boundaries as it would allow the city to grow by attracting investment to a city on a European scale, this cannot disadvantage Cork county, and especially its peripheral areas in west Cork that I represent.  This boundary change will result in large losses in revenue for the county.  Adequate remedies must be put in place to counteract these losses.  I do not want to see Cork South-West lose out from this Bill.</p> <p> My colleague, Deputy Cassells, spoke of the concerns that we raised at our meeting with Cork County Council, so I will not repeat them.</p> <p> The confidence and supply agreement clearly sets out a commitment to local government reform.  However, it must be done properly and fairly.  Phil Hogan's actions in 2013 put rural Ireland back many years.  It was less a case of putting people first than putting people last.  These decisions mean that public representatives who live and work in the heart of constituencies were made powerless in local politics.  It was a big mistake which affected many towns in west Cork.  I was a proud member of Bandon Town Council for ten years and know first-hand the work done by town councils.  The bottom rung of local democracy was removed then.  The situation was made worse by slashing the number of councillors.  It will take many towns and villages years to recover from this.  Were it not for the many voluntary groups and committees, many towns and villages would have fallen into rack and ruin.  I commend the Trojan work done by these committees and applaud their volunteerism.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il's proposal of a community council model would build on the work carried out by these volunteers.  It would formally recognise the work they have been doing, give them credit for it and build on it to develop stronger communities.  These changes must be implemented as soon as possible.  Further procrastination will damage the progress of rural Ireland.</p></speech>

I am very attached to the role of local government, and I commend the role that it has played in rebuilding this country and its infrastructure.  Historically, our local authorities were associated with water and sewerage services, but those have gone from their remit.  Even the delivery of roads is now sanctioned by Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  The delivery of housing has been diluted by the use of voluntary associations.  Now all they are left with is the housing list.  Even refuse collections are gone.  They are responsible for amenities, including parks, libraries, and burial grounds, as noted.</p>  <p>  The role of Cork County Council must be acknowledged.  It has played its part in the greater good of Cork county over the past 100 years.  This Bill is contradictory in its nature and purpose.  I come from the county of Cork.  There is talk of a balanced separation of city and county, yet there are people in other parts of the country, including Galway, who oppose amalgamation.  The implementation group came about under a previous Minister, Deputy Kelly, and was followed through by his successor as Minister, Deputy Coveney.  It is another example of where Deputy Coveney upped and left a mess, like with housing.  He had promised that there would be no more people on the streets of Dublin by July 2017, but now he is gone and the Minister of State present is a sweeper, tidying up the problem he created.</p></speech>

The mapping undertaken by the implementation group was questionable.  The people who mapped Ireland 1,000 years ago had better co-ordination than the implementation group.  Anyone flying over Cork could see the lack of co-ordination in the geography undertaken by this group.  Deputy Cassells referred to international borders.  What happened here was that once the likes of Cork Airport was inside the boundary, they did not care what way the boundary went in extending Cork city.</p>  <p>  I will not dwell on the boundary but I want to raise the matter of compensation.  It is dealt with in section 17.  The Minister of State needs to tie down a commitment on this because I have no faith in Cork City Council following through on its commitments.  I recall many years ago, when I was a member of Cork County Council, when this country was very well advanced in recycling, the local authority, supposedly in conjunction with the then Cork County Council, agreed that it would convert its landfill on Old Head of Kinsale into a recycling unit.  We in Cork County Council facilitated a landfill in turn.  There were major protests and we were landed with a bill of &euro;30 million.  Cork City Council never honoured its part of the agreement since.  I urge the Government to tie down the question of compensation, the review and the indexation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.456" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1284" speakername="Aindrias Moynihan" time="20:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400065#SSS00500"><p>When people in Ballincollig in particular saw the Government's decision late last year to extend the boundary, they were taken aback.  There was great surprise that it was proposed to extend the boundary so far west.  There was also surprise in Blarney because they did not think it was necessary to extend that far.  It was well recognised that it was necessary to extend the city boundary to allow it to grow, but for many people the biggest issue is that they feel they had no say in the decision, which they feel was pushed on them.  They have many real concerns that must be addressed.  For instance, people in business in Ballincollig are concerned whether rates or payment for parking will be introduced.  People would like the Powdermills to be developed.  Spike Island is a tourist opportunity.  Similarly, they would like to see the regional park being developed.  They want all this to be done right.  They are worried that the city will not recognise these things.  They want to have a say about these things and to be heard.</p>  <p>  Some 400 services from the county will be transferred to Cork City Council.  It is important that this is done in an orderly and timely way and that it does not drag on.  After next summer's local elections, where people have been elected to City Hall and the city manager is responsible, who do people approach about services not being handed over properly?  There needs to be a time limit and a proper, orderly transition made in the interests of the people in the area which is transitioning.</p>  <p>  The point about the loss of resources to the council has been well made, with an estimated loss of &euro;30 million.  It is crucial that is made up to the county.  The original understanding of the implementation group was that that type of payment would last far beyond ten years.  However, the proposed legislation features a review as early as three years and a second only a few years after.  Therefore, this funding could be gone within ten years, which is not adequate.  It must be dealt with in amendments.  There are many issues which concern people in Ballincollig and the area that will move, as well as people who are based further west.</p><p>They want to make sure that the county will not be disadvantaged.  I will raise a number of those issues on Committee Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.458" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="20:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400066#TTT00200"><p>As I prepared my remarks I reflected on the fact that the very first contribution I made at a Sinn F&eacute;in meeting after I joined the party was to ask a councillor what was the state of play with the expansion of the city boundary.  That was in 2007.  Talk of it has been rumbling on for years at that stage with little progress being made.  I was informed by councillor Fiona Kerins that it was dragging on and unlikely to be resolved any time soon.  That proved to be correct.  I asked that question at the time because it was been discussed then and the boundary had always seemed to me to be nonsensical and completely out of date.  When I looked into it years later as an elected representative, as a member of Cork County Council, that proved to be the case.  The last boundary revision had been in the 1960s with that revision only going east and west.  The northern and southern extent of the city dates from the 1940s.  It dates from a time when Rochestown was a quiet village on the way to Passage West and when Grange, Togher and many other places were farmland.  The status quo was unsustainable, and the possibility of no change would have been disastrous.</p><p>This clearly needed to be addressed, but it proved impossible over the years for the council to come to any agreement, under successive managers and sets of councillors.  It proved necessary to operate via national policy and national legislation.  At first, the proposal from the then Minister, Deputy Kelly, was a merger contained in the Smiddy report, which was followed by the McKinnon review, which ultimately proposed an expansion rather than a merger.  I believe that was the correct decision.  Sinn F&eacute;in, for its part, throughout this process has played a constructive, informed, active and pivotal role, which has significantly influenced the process.  It may be speculation, but I suspect that if Sinn F&eacute;in was willing to accept a merger, the Government may not have instituted the McKinnon review.  It became apparent after our opposition, as well as significant opposition from Fianna F&aacute;il and some Independents, that it would not be possible to get legislation for a merger through these Houses.  We were the only party that maintained a consistent position of opposition to a merger across both councils.  We were firmly of the view that a merger of the city and county council would be disastrous.  That was my view when I was a county councillor.  It would have constrained the growth of the city and it would make no sense for a major city like that not to have independent local government of its own.  By the same token, I do not believe that places in west, north or east Cork such as Adrigole, Shanballymore or Rockchapel would have benefited from an enormous so-called local authority for a population of 500,000 that would still, even in an unfocused way, have been driven largely from the centre.  I do not believe it would have been in the interests of either city or county to have two competing sets of interests and priorities in that way.  I strongly believe Cork needs two local authorities with two separate executive and two separate elected bodies in order to be in a position to provide services to a satisfactory standard and to focus on the differing priorities of city and county.</p><p>We believe that there is a need for a separate county council based on the core rural areas, the large county towns and market towns, with a strong focus on agriculture, agrifood, fisheries, rural development and tourism.  It goes without saying that the focus and priorities of the county will be different from that of metropolitan Cork.  We believe there is a need for a separate, strong metropolitan council, with considerable focus on industry, investment, urban services, transport with a focus on commuting, and a strong strategy for support of the areas in the commuter belt with a key emphasis on public transport.  This will also need a joined-up strategy for retail and commerce, and ensuring there is a balance between adequate provision for industry and retail on the fringes of Cork city and, on the other hand, protecting and reinvigorating the city centre, which is a priority for all parties.  Our city centre is a valuable and prized possession.  A strong focused metropolitan council is the best vehicle to deliver this.</p><p>I note in Galway, where there has been a proposal for a merger, that it is the districts in more peripheral areas further from the city that are most opposed to the proposition of a merger.</p><p>Some of this is about coherent planning because the pattern for development, to a large extent, has already been set.  The manner in which the city and its suburbs and nearby towns will develop over the next 20 years is already relatively clear.  We already have a relative sense of what it will involve.  The county council's plans have long foreseen development in the new areas.  The towns outside the city, as they are properly called, are clearly under urban influence but I believe they can and must retain their own distinctive identity within an city council.  That is a challenge for the city, and I urge the city council to engage properly with these areas coming in, to delegate decision making to the most local level possible, and to value and promote the separate identity and sense of self that these localities have.  These are places such as Ballyincollig and Blarney but there also needs to be a focus on some of the urban villages that have been a little neglected such as Blackpool which has suffered from a lack of focus.</p><p>I also urge the city council to maintain some of the key programmes that have been a success in the county.  Both councils have initiatives from which the other could learn.  The city council should try to keep the best of what happens in these localities supported, and that includes local community funding.</p><p>It is clear that for the city, its suburbs and the outlying towns, the major development that will happen will be to the west of the city towards Ballincollig, Carrigrohane and to the east of the city towards Carrigtwohill.  Regardless of who governs it, those areas will be significantly transformed.  The key focus needs to be the infrastructure being put in place and coherent planning.  There has been some talk in media circles and among some commentators that this expansion will lead to sprawl.  On the contrary, it the last 20 years that has given us sprawl.  There has been significant sprawl, perhaps too much, in some of the areas immediately outside the existing city boundary.  If we are to develop the kind of density of development that we need to see, I expect that would come better from a single authority properly focused on the development and planning of an urban area of a city council.  The most important element is that they are well planned and planned in a co-ordinated, sustainable way that is in the interests of those communities.</p><p>There is a big focus on Cork in Project Ireland 2040 and Cork is planned to be the fastest growing city in Ireland.  There is only so much more growth that Cork can take if we keep asking people to travel everywhere in their cars.  Cork city is already under serious pressure in terms of traffic.  There is a serious need for investment in public transport.  That should start with intensified bus services, including a bus rapid transit.  We need to move in the medium term to having a light rail system.  I recall a debate in January during which the Minister, Deputy Ross, promised me that the Cork metropolitan strategy would be published in February but we still have no sight of it, nor an indication of any sight of it.  That needs to be progressed.  Regardless of whoever governs, we need to ensure that people can live in sustainable communities that are not choked up by traffic and that attract further inward investment.  We need to see that strategy published. </p><p>There are issues with this Bill.  I note it is silent on the McKinnon proposal for a Cork economic development and planning board.  Perhaps that is contained in the amendments to which the Minister referred and he might clarify that.  That is quite curious.  Our submission had a proposal that was not dissimilar, albeit it was proposed for the entire county rather than an area including the city and its surroundings.  Our submission states: </p><blockquote>there are aspects of our local economy, transport infrastructure, employment, and land use &amp;amp; population growth which are of concern and interest to us all.  For example, the future of Cork Airport matters to ... [the entire region] , and we will all benefit from the Port of Cork reaching its full potential... <br /><br />Sinn F&eacute;in proposes a County Wide, &lsquo;Cork Strategic Authority&rsquo;, above...County and City Councils.<br /><br />That would be given...responsibility for areas such as...regional strategic planning...co-ordination of cross county local services...infrastructural planning...economic development [and] tourism...<br /><br />[We felt] A Cork Strategic Authority would be a new start for Local Government in Cork, it would ensure two Local Authorities not in competition with each other, but entering in to a new area of cooperation, ensuring minimising of duplication, while retaining distinct identities...two financially sustainable entitles.  The benefits of a merger, without the loss of identity, or reduction in Democratic Representation, loss of focus, and reductions in services we fear a merger would mean.<br /><br />[We also] believe that it would set an example which could be followed in other Parts of the Country, and would be a potential solution to many [other] challenges facing other Local Authorities. </blockquote><p>We were encouraged to see the proposal for a Cork economic development and planning board, but where is it in this legislation?  The Bill only refers to a threadbare implementation oversight group.  Will it be addressed later?  The purpose of the economic development and planning board was more than just managing the transition expansion.  It was also about enhancing co-operation and ensuring co-ordination on areas of shared interest and joint policy.  The two local authorities have developed joint strategies in areas such as housing and tourism.  The board would also be a suitable body for managing potential disputes about financial aspects.  Where is it?  Perhaps it might be included in an amendment on Committee Stage, but it was not referred to in the speech, although it would be the subject of a substantial amendment.  I appreciate that there are time constraints.  However, it is not quite ideal that we will be dealing with substantive amendments on Committee Stage on matters such as the plebiscite.  It would have been preferable if the Bill published in the autumn had contained these details as it would have allowed for greater discussion and consideration.  That being the case, we will engage on the substantial amendments on Committee Stage.</p> <p> The other significant issue is finances.  This legislation will not cover the quantum involved in equalisation.  It does not govern the amounts that will be involved or the exact formulae which will be used.  However, it does govern some of the frameworks such as timeframes for reviews, frequency of reviews, how disputes will be resolved, debts attached to assets, the transfer of assets and so forth.  Careful consideration needs to be given to these matters.  The framework at which we ultimately arrive in this legislation will have a significant impact on finances.</p> <p> I have consulted the city and county councils, my other Cork colleagues and Deputy &Oacute; Broin and we will be engaging on the basis of evaluating both sets of views.  It has long been our position that there is a need for financial fairness which we proposed in our 2015 submission.  There is a need for local equalisation.  Responsibility for the administration of this formula would rest with the strategic authority which would review it periodically.  This would allow both councils to set their own rate of valuation, taking into account the differing needs and commercial realities in both authorities, while also ensuring the county council would remain not only viable but well funded and prosperous on a permanent basis.</p> <p> Concerns have been expressed by representatives in county council areas that there will be implications for these communities if the financial package is not arrived at properly.  There are legitimate concerns which I recognise and acknowledge.  There are also concerns on the city side.  In reality, local government is generally underfunded, but these arrangements have to be got right.  We are anxious that the Bill be fair to both local authorities.  For our part in Sinn F&eacute;in, we will analyse and decide upon them based on our view that we need both Cork County Council and Cork City Council to be financially viable and that we have thriving and well supported communities.</p> <p> Some concerns have been raised about the issue of county and city sheriffs and whether the legislation properly accounts for necessary changes in their powers.  Will the Minister of State address that issue?</p> <p> Cork needs to be a thriving city, county and region as a counterbalance to Dublin which is increasingly coming under pressure.  The country needs this to complement Dublin, not to be a threat to it.  To do this, we need strong independent and well funded local government, with significant capital investment in transport infrastructure and public transport.  I hope the Government will prioritise these matters.  If we get it right, this legislation will be important and assist.  Committee Stage will be key, given the amendments on the financial framework.  The planning board issue also needs to be reconsidered.</p></speech>

I am proud that I served on Middleton Town Council, the East Cork Municipal District Committee and Cork County Council.  Team Sinn F&eacute;in in Cork County Council has put much work into this issue.  I acknowledge all those councillors who have worked on it for the past year and a half.  The Minister of State referred to new polling stations and arrangements.  The Department took one out of Ballinacurra in east Cork a long time ago and we would like to have it back.  Will he include that in his notes?</p>  <p>  As we say in Cork, it is a Cork thing, but we need the Cork brand to grow.  We also have to be conscious of those on the outskirts.  In east Cork there was a concern in county boundary areas such as Youghal which is on the tip of County Waterford that they would lose out on local funding.  As Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire said, we need to fund local government properly.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State said he would bring forward amendments on Committee Stage on directly elected mayors.  Compensation was referred to.  It is like a single payment about which I am concerned.  We have looked at the issue of equalisation and it is a fair and important point.  It is like having our own Cork Brexit.  We have reached the crunch point and now have to get down to the nitty-gritty.  In this case, I hope it will not run to 700 pages.  I hope we can get through it faster than they are across the water.  It is important that we go through the legislation with a fine toothcomb.  Committee Stage will be interesting.  We need Cork as a brand to grow in order that it will complement the rest of the country.</p>  <p>  I congratulate all those who have been involved in this exercise.  It is only the start of the Minister of State&rsquo;s job.  As has been said, one will never see anybody hunting with a Labrador or a St. Bernard but keep an eye on the little terrier.  We will be watching the Minister of State.  I look forward to the deliberations on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

This is something that requires a great deal of consultation and a great deal of public information must be provided.  A lot of discussion must take place and the relative benefits for a city and county arising in these situations must be examined carefully.</p> <p> I have consulted with my Labour Party colleagues, some of whom are based in the city and some of whom are based in the county, to get a sense of their concerns.  They are similar to the concerns which have been expressed here already.  Residents of places coming into the city council area, including Douglas, Glanmire, Ballincollig, Blarney and other suburbs, want a service delivery plan in order that they know exactly what will happen with the variety of services they have been used to receiving from the county council.  The Minister of State has gone through some of the issues and they are complicated, in particular as they relate to planning.  The Oireachtas Library and Research Service has kindly provided us with graphics and documentation around what exactly will happen where, for example, planning permissions have been granted by the county council but implementation will take place following the transfer to the city council area.  While I have very little time tonight, I would like to go into that in a bit more detail when more time is available on another occasion.  In particular, I would like to tease out some of what the Minister of State said about next year and the financial arrangements in that regard.</p> <p> In the time I have left tonight, I make a general point about the importance of planning.  While we are talking specifically about Cork now, there is a bit of a mismatch nationally in relation to our cities under the national planning framework.  In Dublin, one has for local authorities.  In Cork, one is going to have two.  In Limerick, Waterford and Galway, there will be combined city and county councils.  It is not very coherent on a national level.  We need to put some thought into longer-term planning and what exactly we are doing about cities.  In my own area, the city mayor might be from the back end of the country.  While that is not the case this year, it has been in previous years.  It does not make for a great degree of coherence.  These are the kinds of issues which need to be looked at.  I agree with what has been said about a counterbalance to Dublin.  That must include a number of cities, namely, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  I put in a word again for the M20 in that regard.  The road linking Limerick and Cork must go ahead because the combined relationship across Cork, Limerick and Galway has real potential to be a counterbalance to Dublin.  Obviously, that is a matter for broader national planning.</p> <p> We must look at the broader context because things have been somewhat haphazard.  We have been moving from one thing to another and trying to find a solution that works in different areas.  For a long time in Limerick, we were talking about a boundary extension.  We were talking about going into County Clare, which idea was abandoned very quickly.  The Minister of State will know all the reasons why.  Deputy Cassells has already outlined them.  Things can look very different from one side of a line than from the other.  That causes a lot of problems.  It is not something which arises in the case of Cork but it certainly rises elsewhere.  We need that broader view of what exactly we are going to do in future about coherent national planning, in particular in the context of preventing Dublin from swallowing up all of the opportunities at the expense of the rest of the country.  That is not to leave out other parts of Ireland, including the south east and the north west, which often feel neglected.  We have had broader planning debates in the House before.  Tonight, we are speaking specifically about the Cork area, however.</p> <p> We must also talk about directly-elected mayors.  The Minister of State has indicated that he will be bringing forward amendments in that regard.  In an answer to a parliamentary question from my colleague, Deputy Sherlock, it was indicated that it is intended to include provision for the holding of a plebiscite on the question of directly-elected mayors with executive functions in cities other than Dublin in the Local Government Bill 2018 to provide primarily for the alteration of the boundary between Cork City Council and Cork County Council.  While that provision is not included in the legislation we are dealing with tonight, I understand amendments will be proposed on Committee Stage.  It is a matter we need to tease out.  We must look generally at providing more powers to local authorities.  Other Members have spoken about the need for more funding for local government but the issue of powers is equally if not more important.  All of these issues arise in the context of the Bill before the House.  However, a lot of what needs to be done will have to be provided for by way of amendment because the provisions are not in the Bill as drafted.  There are also issues regarding the number of public representatives in a given area.  That is a matter of concern in the Cork context also.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-11-14a.467" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="21:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018111400068#VVV00600"><p>Given the way this debate has been organised, there is an extent to which it feels like eating one's Christmas dinner at the end of January.  I have no alternative but to eat this Christmas dinner at this time because unfortunately the budget debate was not continued when it should have been, namely, when it was fresh in everyone's mind.  I admire the versatility of the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, tonight.  He was here earlier to deal with social welfare matters and he is here now on the budget.  I hope he wields as much power in government as it appears he does tonight.</p>  <p>  When the current D&aacute;il was formed, there was a great deal of talk about fundamental reform and how we do our business.  It is amazing, but old habits die hard and the budget day charade goes on.  There was a time when budget date was a very exciting day here.  A big parcel of surprises was unwrapped for the electorate, some of which were good and some of which were bad.  The place used to be thronging with people, but the people are always ahead of us.  On budget day, we were warned about only getting two tickets each and about the overflow space in the coffee dock.  However, nobody turned up.  The people have realised that the show we put on for budget day is a bit of a charade.  On the other hand, we have not gone where I would like us to go.  I would like us to go to a truly iterative process.  It is an iterative process in the Cabinet where things go over and back, one looks at scenarios, rejects things and takes things on and I would like that to happen in committees of the D&aacute;il too.  While we have set up a budget committee, it is like a lot of committees here and is not iterative.  These committees do not propose various scenarios and then tease them out.  They listen to all sorts of groups who come in, take down what is said and publish a report.  That is not a real debate in the way a debate should take place between politicians.</p>  <p>  I spoke earlier about fundamental changes in welfare and I want to speak now about fundamental change in something which a lot of people talk about but in respect of which very little action is ever taken.  That is fundamental change in respect of climate change, carbon taxes and all of that.  Climate change and carbon taxes are normally approached in a very anti-rural way.  The idea is that if people are living in rural Ireland, the cost of diesel will be put up until it is sky high to force them to live in towns.  If one is raising beef cattle, one will be forced to go into tillage, even if one's land consists of rock and bog.  That is not the way to deal with an issue.  There are always positive, win-win approaches to issues but we never think.  In particular, environmentalists seem hell-bent on the idea that there must be a great deal of pain in everything they propose rather than a lot of gain with little pain.  As a rural Deputy, the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, will know about something I have been harping on about for a long time.  I accept that public transport has a major role to play.</p><p>I accept that, particularly if environmentally-friendly vehicles are used, public transport can be more environmentally friendly than private motor cars, especially those with an internal combustion engine.  It is also an efficient way of transporting people.  Although we tend not to debate it, we spent &euro;60 million on buses for Dublin and &euro;40 million on buses to serve the 3 million people who live outside the capital.  One would think it would be very expensive to provide buses but if one adds in rural buses such as Rural Link, the total cost might be &euro;50 million.  That is a ratio of at least 3:1 in terms of per capita spending in favour of the urban area around Dublin which has a population of approximately 1.1 million.  If one were unaware of the figures, one would intuitively think it was the other way around and that far more would be spent per head of population in rural areas.  If the Minister, Deputy Ross, decided to invest in public transport in order to make it practical for all, he could begin in a county such as that of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Letterkenny is by far the biggest centre of population in County Donegal.  Many people living in a 35 mile radius of the town work, go to hospital or attend the third level institution there.  In the south of the county many people travel to Sligo for similar reasons.  I would bet that there are very poor morning and evening commuter services between Letterkenny and places such as Dungloe and Gweedore.  If it is anything like the situation in Connemara, the last bus to Dungloe or Gweedore probably leaves Letterkenny at 6 p.m.  If one is a student in a third level college, one does not want to go home at 6 p.m..  The student's parents are forced to drive in and out like yo-yos.  In planning for the budget, we must be clear that we must tackle this problem and that there are certain positive ways we can direct the money which would improve the lifestyles of many people and also achieve another target, namely, the reduction of our carbon footprint.</p> <p> I wish to raise an issue which arises in the context of the Estimates.  There is some curious thinking going on in the Government.  I admire the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, because he manages to get a significant amount of money for his Department.  However, it frustrates me greatly that he never spends it.  Year after year, he gets a wad of money for his Department but cannot spend it and it is returned to the Exchequer.</p> <p> The Minister pulled the coup to end all coups this year as he managed to get &euro;55 million for the rural regeneration scheme.  However, there is not a snowball's chance in hell of him spending that &euro;55 million between now and this time next year, no matter how much talk there is of shovel-ready projects.  He must first approve the projects and will then find that many of them are not as shovel-ready as he thought they were.  He will then have to seek tenders for the projects.  The Minister of State opposite, Deputy Doyle, knows the delays involved in that process.  There are cooling-off periods and arguments and one must get bonds and so on.  Most of the projects will not begin until June of next year, if they begin at all.  There is no way that &euro;55 million will be spent in time to have a mature liability by this time next year.</p> <p> On the other hand, bh&iacute; pr&iacute;omhfheidhmeannach &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta istigh linn anocht.  We had the chief executive of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta in with us tonight.  One must remember that up until 2009-10, at a time when we were spending a lot of money on infrastructure in the Gaeltacht, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta was responsible for spending over &euro;25 million in public funds in addition to money it had from its own resources.  It was selling factories to owners who were and always will be based in the Gaeltacht because it suited the purchasers to have &uacute;dar&aacute;s factories on lease and be able to develop them.  Its overall annual spending amounted to up to &euro;30 million.  Its funding was increased in this budget.  However, the total capital expenditure announced for the Gaeltacht, including &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, was &euro;13.7 million.  If &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta had been given &euro;15 million or &euro;20 million it could begin refurbishing its buildings, achieve the mature liabilities and spend the money.  If it was given the modest amount of &euro;8 million rather than the &euro;30 million for which it was responsible in the past, and the allocation to the Minister's rural regeneration scheme was decreased to &euro;50 million, the Minister would still end up with far more money than he could spend for the third time in a row since his Department was established.  That money could be spent on the Gaeltacht.  It seems that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, is allergic to the Gaeltacht, the Irish language and spending money where we know it can be spent in a profitable way and on an agency that successfully creates jobs in the most disadvantaged and peripheral parts of the country.  I do not understand what is going on in that regard.</p> <p> It is very strange to be speaking on the budget after having spoken on the Finance Bill.  The normal sequence is for Deputies to have the opportunity to contribute on the budget and then on the Finance Bill or social welfare Bill.  I spoke on the social welfare Bill and the Finance Bill before I got the chance to speak on the budget.</p> <p> Our tax system is extremely complicated.  Deputies fill out forms for a living.  Very few ordinary small taxpayers fully understand the tax system.  I refer to people earning &euro;30,000, &euro;40,000, &euro;50,000 or less, not those earning big money.  If ordinary taxpayers were asked which social welfare payments are taxable and which are not, very few would answer correctly.  Many ordinary people are missing out on allowances because there are so many and it is so complex.  The Revenue has admitted that.  I am not talking about extraordinary allowances involving big accountants who are paid hundreds of thousands of euro by multi-millionaires.  There is such a fear of filling out forms that people do not claim allowances.  For example, a non-standard tax allowance is available to those employed in certain professions.  How many people know about or receive it?  I am not talking about the employee allowance of &euro;1,650.  We need a radical simplification of our tax system.  It should be accessible to and understandable by all.</p> <p> As I stated in my contribution on the Finance Bill, I am convinced that it is time to abolish the USC.  The Minister of State will point out that it was introduced by Fianna F&aacute;il.  Yes, we introduced it at a time of crisis but it was always intended to be a temporary measure.  Having USC, pay-related social insurance and income tax is wrong.  I have always believed that there should only be two such charges.  It should be very simple for the ordinary punter to claim allowances.</p><p>I always said at Cabinet that we should abolish all the small allowances and use the saving to give a better basic allowance to everybody.  Otherwise, it is those who are good at understanding the complications of the system who gain and it is those who are afraid of inquiring and who do not read into these things who lose.</p> <p> The other thing that is amazing is the lack of interaction between our tax code and our social welfare code.  That catches many people.  In that context, I would like to mention something that is creeping up on people now.  The age exemption used to be &euro;20,000 for a single person and &euro;40,000 for a couple.  That was very handy because when people got to a certain age, they did not owe any PRSI.  If their main income was welfare, they did not have any USC liability as long as their income was under &euro;12,000.  If their combined income as a couple was under &euro;40,000, they did not have any tax liability.  This meant that most of the people in question were exempt from filling in tax forms.  During the downturn, the &euro;40,000 threshold in the case of a couple was reduced by &euro;4,000 to &euro;36,000 and the threshold for a single person was reduced to &euro;18,000.  The reality is that we increase pensions by &euro;5 every year.  The increase of &euro;10 in the case of a couple amounts to &euro;500 a year, or &euro;1,500 over three years.  As a result, more and more pensioners are coming back into the tax bracket.  It would have been very simple this year to have raised the threshold to the previous level of &euro;20,000, or &euro;40,000 in the case of a couple.  The amount of additional tax that is collected because of the move from &euro;40,000 to &euro;36,000 is small.  The change is a nuisance for people who were not paying income tax but now have to do so.</p> <p> I welcome Revenue's decision to require employers to make returns in real time every week.  I hope this system is used to the benefit of the taxpayer.  This can be achieved by giving back the information.  Most people who ask get a pre-printed form from Revenue.  If a self-employed person or somebody who has a PAYE income gets a pre-printed form 12, form 11 or form 11S in June, for example, Revenue will already know how much PAYE income that person has, or how much is being declared by employers.  I can never understand why Revenue does not tell people it knows that.  If it were to provide the relevant figures, people could compare them to the figures on their P60s.  Revenue already knows how much social welfare people receive.  This is facilitated through data matching.  Revenue knows exactly what taxable income people are being paid as social welfare.  Rather than making life easy for people, Revenue requires them to write to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to get the relevant figures again.</p> <p> To sum up at this late hour, I think this has been a standing-still budget.  There is nothing radical in it.  There is nothing in it that will lift the country.  The two big fundamentals remain with no resolution in sight.  The first one is the whole housing crisis.  Nothing that was announced on budget day recognises that not enough houses are being built.  Nothing is being done to streamline housing and make it attractive.  Nothing is being done to make it affordable for people on reasonably good incomes - &euro;40,000 a year, or &euro;80,000 in the case of a couple - to buy a house.  It is amazing how we have gone so much against house ownership.  Some years ago, one could get tax relief at one's marginal rate of tax in respect of the interest on one's loan.  The first-time house buyer's grant that was available some years ago was worth the equivalent of &euro;15,000 in today's money.  I appreciate the point that could be made about a tax break in that context.  The first-time house buyer's grant was great because it was paid at the end.  There are always extra costs when one is buying a house or building a new house.  It was useful to get this money in such circumstances.  Traditionally, there was a very big social value on house ownership for those who had jobs.  We seem to have lost that ethos.</p> <p> Last month's budget did not do anything philosophically for carbon.  In other words, it did nothing to deal with climate change in a positive way rather than in a negative way.  It did nothing significant with regard to social housing.  It did nothing to make it affordable for people whom one would expect to be able to buy their houses to do so.  It did nothing on the health crisis.  It provided for no reform to make the bureaucratic machine, which is getting more complicated by the minute, easier for the people to approach.  It was not a good budget.</p></speech>
