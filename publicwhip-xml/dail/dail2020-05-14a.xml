T&aacute; n&iacute;os m&oacute; t&aacute;bhachta ag baint leis na r&eacute;amhch&uacute;raim&iacute; seo n&aacute; riamh roimhe seo.</p>  <p>  As an Oireachtas and a nation, our thoughts are once again with the families of loved ones who have lost their lives to Covid-19.  As of last night, 1,497 people have died in our State and 449 more have died in Northern Ireland.  Our thoughts are also with those who are working to fight this virus every day, as well as those fighting with the virus.  In total, 23,400 people in the Republic of Ireland have been diagnosed with Covid-19.  Some 78%, 19,470, have made a full recovery.</p>  <p>  Thanks to the majority of people across our country following the guidelines, we have slowed the spread of the virus.  It has not been easy but it has had an impact on all of us in many different ways.  Some have lost loved ones.  Others have missed out on events which strengthen the ties of family and friendship, such as weddings, birthdays and the birth of a new arrival.  Many have lost their jobs or fear losing them and others wonder if their businesses will ever reopen.  This has been a test of our solidarity and resilience, and it is one that we are passing as a nation every day.  We are seeing what we can achieve when we put the needs of the many above the needs of the few.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 has had a devastating economic impact.  Our mission is to get people back to work, get businesses open again and get the economy humming so that we have the resources we need to build a better society, a great society worthy of the great people we have proven ourselves to be.</p> <p>The first steps to reawaken our economy will be done in a slow and gradual way.  At all times we will maintain an intense focus on the virus and follow four guiding principles: isolate, test, trace and treat, so that we can quickly react if things go wrong and if there is an increase in cases.</p> <p> As we are seeing around the world, this is not a straight path.  Sometimes progress is halted and there are setbacks.  We have seen examples of this in Germany, South Korea and again most recently in Wuhan.  The crucial thing is to keep doing the right things, to stick to the strategy and maintain our focus and to expect and look for new clusters and flare-ups.  This virus is a fire in retreat.  We must quench its every spark and stamp out every ember.</p> <p> While every new case and death is a cause for serious concern, over the last seven days we have seen the lowest daily number of cases and death since March.  As a result, we are increasingly confident that we will be able to move to phase one on Monday.  NPHET is meeting today to conduct its assessment and the Cabinet will make its decision tomorrow after we receive its advice.  It is worth remembering that we are still in phase zero.  All things going to plan, phase one will begin on Monday, if and only if it is safe to do so.  The moment we assume that our progress through the phases is inevitable, we risk going backwards.</p> <p> I acknowledge that as we open workplaces we will see more workplace clusters and we need to be vigilant about that.  The Return to Work Safely protocol has put measures in place that will prevent the spread of Covid-19 in the workplace.  It is a living and evolving document that ensures we protect those at work as well as customers and clients.  The Health and Safety Authority will help business to achieve compliance in a co-operative manner but will close workplaces if necessary.  I extend my thanks to the unions and employers' bodies for working with the Government to develop a protocol for playing their part in this time of national crisis.</p> <p> In the coming weeks, as we ease restrictions, we may see an increase in the R number, as Germany has, so after 18 May we need to be more disciplined and act more responsibly than ever before when it comes to vital public health actions.  There must be no handshakes.  We must keep a physical distance of 2 m wherever possible.  We must wash our hands regularly, sneeze or cough into a tissue or our elbow and stay at home and self-isolate if we become sick.  Face coverings, visors and sneeze-guards, while they have a role, are not a substitute for any of this.  I have every confidence in the Irish people to embrace this new normal.</p> <p> As we know, extensive travel restrictions are in place.  We are requiring that all people arriving in our ports and airports must complete a public health passenger locator form and self-isolate for 14 days.  There are exceptions like supply-chain workers or people stopping over in one of our airports before travelling onwards, or of course people on their way to and from Northern Ireland.  We are examining means to strengthen these actions in the next few days.  However, we must also remember that we have a land border with Northern Ireland that we want to stay open, a common travel area with the UK that we want to preserve, and our right as European citizens to travel, study and work anywhere in the European Union, which we want to uphold.  While these rights may be restricted for a time due to the pandemic and public health emergency, it is our policy to resume normal travel for business, leisure, study and visits to friends and relatives as soon as it is safe to do so but not before.  This is something the European Commission is currently working on.  However, it is going to be months not weeks before this is possible.</p> <p> Testing is ramping up and more than a quarter of a million tests have now been carried out.  The target of 44,000 tests has been reached since we last met in this format.  We understand that we are the first country after San Marino to test all nursing home staff and residents.  This is now being recognised as best practice and other countries are following suit.  Testing is now under way in care homes for people with disabilities and also mental health facilities.  It is now an emerging fact, sadly, that across the developed world a very high percentage of deaths with Covid have involved residents of care homes, with a very high percentage also in countries where total numbers are low, like Norway, Canada and New Zealand.  As the numbers come in, those percentages continue to rise, including in Ireland.  While it is an easy analysis to blame nursing homes affected or the HSE, HIQA or the Department of Health, it might yet prove not to be fair or factual to do so.  It does not seem that any country has been wholly successful in keeping Covid out of its care homes and we are not alone in experiencing this tragedy.</p> <p>That, however, is no comfort.  No matter what their age, every life shortened is a life lost.  Families grieve and many have been unable to say goodbye in person or to have a proper funeral.  While measles and meningitis target the young, coronavirus targets older people, the frail and those with pre-existing conditions.  It has been suggested by some that the best way to protect our care homes is to lock them down, residents and staff, for months on end to ensure they have no contact with the outside world.  I am not sure this is the model of care we want for our seniors in the long run.  </p> <p> We need to consider alternatives, for example, more and better home care.  This Government was able to afford to increase the home care budget by 40%.  It is unlikely the next Government will have such resources so we will need to find a new funding model and place it on a statutory footing.  The outgoing Government did some excellent work in developing alternatives like supported housing and housing with care and the new Government can and should build on and operationalise this work.  We also need to consider a move away from large, modern, newly-built, 150 to 200-bed, single-room nursing homes towards smaller units, as we have done in the disability sector.  We also need to re-examine clinical governance.  We must integrate care homes better with the health service and enable therapists, geriatricians and infection control nurses to reach in.  We must avoid hospitals as much as possible and ensure that there is a medical director as well as a person in charge.  </p> <p> I do not have all the answers but I am thinking about them every day.  I know other Deputies are also doing so.  There are many examples of good practice already.  We need to identify them and mainstream them.  This will be a major challenge for the new Government.  It should be approached in an open-minded, non-judgmental, evidence-based way that respects the dignity and agency of older people.</p> <p> This emergency has hit our country very hard.  As we re-open our country and rebuild our economy, we have the opportunity to reshape our society in ways that will benefit our citizens for generations to come.  We should seize the opportunity to have greater levels of working from home, online education, ehealth and telehealth, reduced unnecessary domestic and air travel, lower greenhouse emissions and cleaner air.</p> <p> As always, I look forward to hearing the comments, observations and questions from Members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="12:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400006#D00200"><p>As of this week, 1,500 people in the Republic and close to 450 in Northern Ireland have lost their lives due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  As the Taoiseach has said, our first thoughts must be with them, their families and those who are today still struggling to overcome the virus.  It remains a serious threat and there is no basis whatsoever for arguing for a rapid lifting of all restrictions.  There are, however, significant questions to be asked about actions on particular issues.  The restarting of basic parliamentary accountability is welcome.  I acknowledge the constructive approach of the Covid-19 committee and its elected chairperson, Deputy McNamara.  We wish it well in its work and expect that all who are asked to assist it will do so.</p>  <p>  We should increase discussions about what can be done to bring the Oireachtas to as close to normal working as possible while remaining consistent with public health advice.  There are many critical areas where public oversight and debate is required and Deputies are eager to fulfil their mandates more effectively.  As I have said here over the last two months, during a fast-moving and unprecedented crisis, the last thing we can afford is to be defensive when issues are raised.  The most comprehensive and effective emergency responses always involve making space for challenging voices and a willingness to quickly and comprehensively admit the need to adopt different approaches.  Mistakes have undoubtedly been made and are being made but it is important to reassure everyone across our public sector involved in the response that no one expects it to be free of error.  We must respect and honour the expertise of the professionals involved.  There are judgment calls to be made and broader public policy must play an increasingly central role.  As long as these judgment calls are based on full engagement with the science and an inclusive and transparent procedure, we should acknowledge the good faith involved.  This is why, when we reach a stage where we must turn to planning future responses to either a second wave or a new pandemic, we will need to adopt an approach of learning lessons rather than seeking to apportion blame.  We need a more inclusive and multidisciplinary approach to how measures are developed and agreed.</p> <p>I especially say that in the context of reopening and lifting restrictions.  I get a sense that the multidisciplinary dimension is not as evident as it might be.</p> <p> During these debates, Fianna F&aacute;il's spokespeople are setting out a range of questions based on the input of people from every sector and every part of the country.  I acknowledge the constructive and helpful way in which individuals and organisations have been contacting us to give their observations and concerns.</p> <p> As has been said here every week over the past month, the deal regarding private hospital capacity has to be reviewed.  It is now a full part of a system-wide problem of the collapse in diagnostic and treatment activity for non-Covid-19 cases.  There is a significant underutilisation of vital hospital capacity that is no longer justified.  My party believes that as we move into a wider challenge, there is a need to more systematically engage sectors and general expertise in the discussions.</p> <p> As we pointed out last month when it was announced, the failure to include childcare professionals in the discussions on the design of childcare supports for front-line workers was a fatal weakness in the Government's approach.  As such, no one was surprised by yesterday's announcement that the main scheme was suspended because only nine providers were willing to participate.  I acknowledge the difficulties in this area around the public health dimension.</p> <p> Similarly, the internal proposals concerning the leaving certificate, which are outlined in the media this morning, show a process that in our view should have led to a much earlier announcement of the cancellation of exams.  Deputies were inundated with calls on this from parents, teachers and students for a long period.  These documents show there was no credible way under discussion to maintain social distancing, employ enough invigilators or even to examine more than half the of the normal range of topics.  The uncertainty and public disagreements about what should be done could have been avoided if this information had been shared much earlier.  Instead we had a debate based on the false premise that there was a confidence that the exams could be held.</p> <p> The private hospital deal was an emergency response to the need to create a surge capacity.  For nearly a month it has been clear that this surge capacity is not likely to be required.  In recent days, it was suggested that extra capacity might be used now to treat public patients - about 30% of the private hospital capacity the Minister set up.  Others from the private hospital sector are saying only 30% of the capacity is being used right now.  We believe in general hospitals in the public systems that over 1,000 beds are vacant or underutilised.</p> <p> Overall the situation is a mess.  I have been pointing this out for six weeks.  The failure to get a proper consultants contract negotiated has gone on too long.  The deal with the operators was one of mutual convenience.  The State needed surge capacity.  The operators have their expenditure sorted in the initial phase probably where their revenue was not coming in.  We need a comprehensive strategy - there is none at the moment - to get that hospital capacity back as comprehensively as possible.  It has been a very expensive deal.  I understand, and I am not criticising, the rationale behind it, but it is being coupled now with a wider underutilisation of vital capacity.  We are hearing stories about cancer patients, heart patients and other patients who could have had treatment and earlier procedures but have not had because of this prolonged paralysis in reaching a comprehensive agreement.</p> <p> Many proposals are emerging and it is important that they are engaged with in a proactive and systematic way.  For example, the number of people who need early diagnostics has not declined - the Taoiseach referred to this - and yet the number accessing diagnostics has drastically fallen.  Some have suggested that if we pretest every diagnostic patient in advance, it will allow many facilities to operate at close to normal capacity.  It is a perfectly legitimate question to ask about why we are spending many millions of euro on hospital capacity we do not believe we will need and which we could quickly recontract were an unexpected surge to happen.</p> <p> The situation with meat plants is gravely serious and it is not obvious that these clusters are being dealt with comprehensively.  Without calling for the shutting down of the sector, it seems very surprising that the blanket testing of a facility is followed by no interruption of work until the results are returned.  Would it not be reasonable to halt production for a deep clean and putting in place of new control measures while waiting for the results?  Simply sending workers back to work and, indeed, not testing their families does not make sense, particularly given the Minister's assurance that testing capacity is not an issue.  There has been a significant lack of transparency on this issue.  I have dealt responsibly with it.</p> <p>I alerted the authorities six weeks or two months ago about the dangers of what could happen.  The numbers are high in towns across the country where, ordinarily, there would not have been a high incidence of Covid-19.</p> <p> More needs to be done on this issue.  The authorities need to visit factory floors to see the reality.  T&aacute;im buartha faoi na monarchana feola, faoin easpa soil&eacute;irithe agus faoin easpa comhairle.  T&aacute; na huimhreacha an-ard ar fad de r&eacute;ir na bhfigi&uacute;ir&iacute; at&aacute; ag teacht amach i ndiaidh na t&aacute;st&aacute;lacha.  N&iacute;l s&eacute; seo s&aacute;s&uacute;il in aon chor.  I mbailte timpeall na t&iacute;re, t&aacute; deighilt&iacute; soil&eacute;ire agus t&aacute; fearg agus m&iacute;shuaimhneas ag m&eacute;ad&uacute; an t-am ar fad.  Thug m&eacute; comhairle maidir leis seo c&uacute;pla seachtain &oacute; shin agus t&aacute; s&eacute; in am do na h&uacute;dar&aacute;is dul ar url&aacute;ir na monarchana chun an r&eacute;iteach a aimsi&uacute;.</p> <p> We should acknowledge the excellent work of many journalists at national and local levels who have been willing to ask tough questions.  Many issues fundamental to the response have only been fully explained to the public because of their persistence.  The simple fact is that testing and tracing is fundamental to increasing our options and it is happening faster in other countries.  In recent days, an issue about the lack of integration of records and the impact of errors in data inputting has been revealed.  It has been stated that we need the entire testing and contact tracing continuum to be completed within three days.  However, information supplied to journalists yesterday by the HSE indicates that the median time the process is taking in the community is five days, with many examples of much longer times.  It must be acknowledged that much has been achieved since the issue of capacity delays and missed targets for testing was dominant.  However, we need clarity on what is to be done to bring down testing and tracing times such that we can quickly identify and respond to new clusters.  We hear much about plan, plan, plan.  We need a national strategy on testing to encompass whom we test and where we test to use our capacity to the optimal degree and benefit.</p> <p> The issue of face coverings has gone on for too long.  There is broad scientific acceptance of two basic findings.  First, basic coverings do no harm in practice and appear to limit the spread of the virus.  Second, they are an important part of encouraging appropriate behaviour in public and are critical to getting public confidence to a stage where public transport becomes a viable mass transit option again.  Fears that the introduction of a face covering policy would undermine the supply of personal protective equipment, PPE, seem overblown when one considers the impact of such a policy in many other countries.  The issue has dragged on for far too long and it is time for it to be definitively addressed.</p> <p> We need much more detail on the exact financial impact of the crisis on our public companies and institutions.  The D&aacute;il will soon have to have a substantive debate and vote on financial matters, so we need to start having an informed discussion about what emergency measures may be required to support these companies and institutions.</p> <p> Fianna F&aacute;il acknowledges the ruling of the High Court yesterday on the validity of emergency measures the D&aacute;il agreed in recent months.  Aside from the legal position, there is no doubt about the strong public support for these measures.  I believe that support will continue.  We now need a more inclusive and transparent process for discussing how to proceed.  We are out of the acute phase of the response and a much broader range of voices need to be brought into the discussions.  Only then will we retain public support and ensure that policies are soundly based and effective in opening up our country and ensuring that we limit risks to public health.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="12:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400008#F00200"><p>Today we again acknowledge those who have been lost to the virus, now almost 2,000 souls across our island.  We extend our sympathies and solidarity to their families, friends and communities.</p><p>The Taoiseach correctly set out that we will gradually unwind the emergency measures we have asked people to live with in recent weeks.  I think we all agree that is the sensible, prudent and only way to proceed.  It is worth acknowledging that the heroic efforts of those on the front line will need to continue for some time to come.  We need to find a <i>modus vivendi</i>, a way of living with this virus, and that will be extremely challenging.  People look to the future with anticipation and hope as well as with a level of anxiety because their health and that of their families must come first.</p><p>I wish to ask the Taoiseach specifically about the mooted childcare support scheme for front-line workers.</p> <p>Nurses, doctors, health care assistants, and others we rely on at the front line of the Covid-19 pandemic, had a legitimate expectation that, as and from Monday, they would avail of childcare under the scheme the Minister announced last Thursday.  Last night, however, it was announced that this scheme would in fact be cancelled, and those who would rely on this childcare discovered this fact through the media.  The stakeholders across sectors discovered it by way of press release.  The primary reason for the collapse of this scheme is that the insurance industry says it will not underwrite or cover Covid-19 related incidents.  It says it has been making the Government aware of this for weeks on end, yet this scheme was announced.  It seems extraordinary that the Government announced a scheme that was sure to fail.</p> <p> Was the Taoiseach aware of this insurance issue?  Was he aware that the insurer Allianz was saying it would not cover Covid-19 related incidents?  Why, therefore, did the announcement go ahead?  Why did the Government announce a scheme that was so fatally undermined and flawed?  Was the Taoiseach aware that this would prove unworkable because of the stance of the insurance industry?  We can fix this but why is it that the Government has not sought to indemnify childcare workers in this Covid-19 emergency to provide that support and assistance to our front-line workers?  Why will it not extend the indemnity that applies already to some 200,000 workers - that scheme exists - to cover those childcare workers who are now needed to support the front line in a very direct way, and to indemnify them for that Covid-19 risk?  That seems to be the solution in the here and now for this dilemma.</p></speech>

It is a matter of great regret that the childcare scheme for healthcare workers cannot go ahead.  The focus of the Minister, Ms Zappone, and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs for the next couple of weeks will be to get cr&egrave;ches and childcare facilities open by the end of June for all essential front-line workers first, and then more broadly after that.  I know that the Minister and the Department put a lot of work into developing this scheme.  They developed it, and there was consultation, perhaps not enough, with the sector, and they secured the funding for it.  Ultimately, for lots of different reasons, not just insurance, the uptake from the childcare sector was very low.  It gave numbers of reasons beyond insurance, including issues around Garda vetting or the general concern that a childcare provider would have in being responsible for an employee who is not on their premises but is in somebody's private home.  The sector gave lots of reasons it was not willing to sign up to it in the numbers we would have needed.</p>  <p>  I was not aware of the insurance issue.  The first I heard about that was on the RT&Eacute; news.  That is not to say that others were not aware of it in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs or even in my Department.  Unfortunately, given the nature of my job, it is not possible to be aware of everything.  I am sure the Deputy would appreciate that.  I am actually not sure that insurance is quite the issue it is being made out to be.  There are tens of thousands of workplaces in Ireland open today, private and public sector.  There will be tens of thousands more workplaces in Ireland open next week.  They will open notwithstanding the fact that they do not have insurance against a virus because the truth is this is a new virus.  It is a deadly virus but it is not the first virus we have dealt with and not the only deadly virus we have dealt with.  I am not sure it has ever been the case that insurers have indemnified employers for the possibility of being sued over getting a virus.  That is something that needs to be considered but I am not sure it is the barrier that perhaps it is being made out to be because there are already so many workplaces in Ireland open now this week, and which will open next week, that are potentially a higher risk than a childcare facility, and yet that insurance does not exist.</p> <p> I am not sure that it is possible to indemnify someone against getting a virus or that one would have much of a case if one tried to sue.  I could go into any house, office or workplace tomorrow and pick up a virus, bug or bacteria.  For me to prove that it was someone else's fault would be an unusual case to make.  One would only have a case if somebody deliberately tried to infect one or was totally negligent in his or her actions.  I would not like to indemnify anyone who deliberately tried to infect someone or was negligent in their actions.  This requires some thought but I am not sure that the Deputy's analysis is correct.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1466" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="12:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400010#H00200"><p>I have correspondence from a childcare provider from the Arachas childcare insurance team, dated 7 May.  That was the day on which the Government scheme was announced.  The correspondence makes two things absolutely clear: that the insurers were in constant contact with the Government for some six weeks and that they set out very clearly that they would not cover Covid instances.  They made that clear, and I am alarmed to hear that the Taoiseach did not know that this problem existed.  He should have known, notwithstanding his busyness.  The correspondence sets out that potential exposure to the Covid-19 virus - they say - represents a material change in circumstances, it heightens risks and they are not prepared to cover it.</p>  <p>  I am sure the childcare sector and the more than 25,000 early education and childcare workers across the land are very alarmed at what happened for front-line workers.  The Taoiseach will recall that last December, many childcare providers were put under huge pressure because their premiums had gone through the roof.  They had ballooned to the extent that it threatened the existence of these services.  Many questioned whether they would be able to open their doors again.  Now there is a scenario where insurers say they are not prepared to cover Covid risk.  Childcare providers have said very clearly that was the main reason why this scheme collapsed.  </p>  <p>  I have two questions.  First, I have asked the Taoiseach step into the breach in this emergency situation and indemnify now those workers who are required to support and care for the children of our front-line workers, as otherwise, the front-line workers cannot go to work.  I want the Taoiseach to ensure that people who put their lives and their safety on the line for the rest of us have the childcare that was promised to them.  That means the State has to intervene where the insurance industry will not.  </p>  <p> Second, what are the implications of the stance taken by the insurance industry for the childcare sector and workers and for parents more generally?  Might we face a situation in June, heaven forbid, where the Taoiseach announces the reopening of childcare and cr&egrave;che facilities but insurers either refuse to cover the risk or insist that the premiums of childcare providers balloon again?  This must be about ensuring that every parent has the childcare cover he or she needs, that childcare workers have jobs to return to and, immediately, that the Government must act.  The Taoiseach promised workers on the front line that they would have the support of childcare; he can act now to make sure that is the case.</p>  <p>  Incidentally, it has happened in the North.  In the North, because the Taoiseach likes to talk about the North occasionally, the Department of Health has conceded that insurers will not cover Covid risk so in these emergency circumstances, it now will cover those workers.  The Government should do the same.</p></speech>

It is a matter to which we will have to give consideration as we work with the childcare sector to reopen cr&egrave;ches and childcare facilities by the end of June.</p> <p>We will examine, of course, what is being done in other countries and other jurisdictions, including Northern Ireland, to see if there are things we can learn from those because there are other parts of Europe where cr&egrave;ches and nurseries did not close and others where they have reopened.  The question I would ask is whether insurers are covering Covid-19 related risk in the tens of thousands of workplaces that are already open today - offices, factories and shops - and the tens of thousands more that will open next week.  It might be that this is not an insurable risk and before we were to take on any indemnity from the State, we would have to make sure that we are not indemnifying people who are negligent in their actions in knowing that there is no consequence to that because the State or the taxpayer will cover their bills.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400011#J00200"><p>The ongoing tragedy of the loss of life in this country and the potential for that to continue means that the Taoiseach was absolutely right when he said that as we lessen the restrictions, it will be done in a slow and gradual way.  That makes sense.  Mike Ryan, from the World Health Organization, says that we will also have to be very fast in our response so that if clusters appear, we have got to quickly identify them, isolate everyone and manage that part of it.</p>  <p>  I hope that application of being fast in our response can apply in other ways.  I sense from the public, particularly around the education area, for example, that if we find that international experience, and we need to know this quickly, shows that there is the potential for a safe reopening of educational facilities, we should be quick to respond to that because mental health and a range of other issues have to be taken into account.  There are specific areas, and the Taoiseach mentioned people in the disability sector in education, which tends to have smaller groupings that are much more easy to manage.  The parents involved in that area, if they are looking after a child at home, can often be doing so in very difficult circumstances so if there is the ability for us to open up such facilities quickly, we should act quickly, while listening to all the health expertise.</p>  <p>  Similarly, we will have to be fast when it comes to managing the economy recovery.  I had intended to ask a series of questions but if the Taoiseach does not mind, I will use my remaining time to make a wider statement on the need for speed in the economic recovery because the scale of the shock in that respect is beyond compare.  I was slightly encouraged yesterday when I heard some figures showing that our manufacturing output had held up slightly during the downturn.  I checked with some contacts overnight who were directly involved and have a good idea in terms of what is happening and they reported back to me that, unfortunately, the figures are masking an incredible contraction, even in that area of international manufacturing and the high-tech sector.  While ostensibly the figures look as if they are holding up, they say demand is crashing across the world and that the prospect there is not as strong as it might seem from the figures of recent months.</p>  <p>  Similarly, there is concern when one hears talk of what is going on in the Brexit negotiations.  The economic implications of that adding to the shock we are experiencing is something that possibly could hit in the next year, just at the time when we do not want it.  Figures were reported in the newspapers today of large numbers of people, particularly younger people, remaining unemployed until the end of this year and into next year.  One newspaper quoted a figure of 300,000 people.  Those sort of figures raise real concern because the consequences of that in terms of mental health is not insignificant.  </p>  <p>  We have to act fast to get our younger people, in particular, back working, to get the economy lifted and for that to be part of our health strategy.  As to how we can do that, we can look to previous periods when we managed our way out of economic difficulties.  We have to be careful not to apply lessons from the past in this case.  I do not believe this is similar to what happened in the management of, and recovery from, the financial crash because that was due to an underlying structural problem in our economy where our property sector had bubbled up, and private debt and the loss of tax revenue meant that a restructuring of the economy was needed.</p> <p>That is not where we are today, because our economy going into this was in relatively good shape.  If anything, the structural problem, as identified by Danny McCoy and IBEC a number of months ago, was that the State needed to expand its capability in housing, public transport, water and other infrastructure to support the economy.  The underlying problem was not that we needed to contract anything; in fact we were in an economic situation where we were going to have to expand our State enterprise and capability.  Similarly, we should be careful to avoid the experience of the 1980s, when - for those of us old enough to remember - youth unemployment was a damaging and disastrous consequence of that economic recession.  We managed to get out of that in the late 1980s by getting our budget in order but this will not be the same because that is not the problem now and therefore we should not revert back to that as a solution.  The circumstances were very different then.  Our mortgage interest rates in the early and mid-1980s were at 16%, whereas now, the State's creditworthiness and the underlying strength of our economy before this crash mean the circumstances are very different.</p> <p> That leads me to the economic analysis that our response must be an increase in borrowing.  It would be a fairly dramatic initial increase, which would continue as the economy lifts and we could reduce the deficit.  We should not be afraid this autumn and over however many years it will take us to effectively provide the correct economic response to this crisis.  Our ability to do that is contingent on having low interest rates, and we are right not to just rely on the ECB in that regard.  We should be maintaining our creditworthiness but that will be best achieved when we are seen to be acting quickly in using this economic strategy to address the underlying fundamental problems, namely, the need to increase our public infrastructure, to get our young people back working and to protect against any Brexit shock.  Anyone looking at a country doing that would say that country is on the right path and is a good safe haven in these difficult international times.  The question is how we can practically use that borrowing, in real terms, to manage those three difficult and amazing challenges, that is, to improve public infrastructure, to get our young people back working - which was not a problem six months ago but sure as hell is now - and in so doing to stimulate demand, while managing any Brexit risks at the same time.  It is important that we do it at speed.  If someone is on the dole for six or nine months, and I have been there myself, it very quickly saps one's confidence and ability and people would only hunker down and increase their savings, which would bring us into a worse position.  Therefore, we need to be quick.</p> <p> We need to be quick in the building of public housing.  I am glad that our construction workers are going back to work next week.  They have a good record and the ability to practice good health and safety.  We should all be enterprising, in both local authorities and Departments, to get housing supply back quickly, including high-quality housing close to town centres.  We can do something similar in transport.  In Dublin, for example, we are using this opportunity of empty streets to reconfigure it.  We should be getting every engineering company and every capability in the State to make this quick transition and do what we have to do to improve bus, cycling and walking infrastructure.  That is not a huge employment centre but it would be one aspect of the economy.  We need to act quickly to do it and in that it would be an immediate economic stimulus.  Similarly, in health, we need to make sure our procurement rules are flexible in order to employ every Irish online computer consulting systems company to make sure we get real efficiency in our health system as we move towards a much more online system in these coming months.</p> <p>We are talking about months, not years, when it comes to turning the economy in the latter part of this year into next year and the year afterwards.</p> <p> With regard to retrofitting, why not have 20,000 apprenticeships starting this autumn?  If I am correct, these are the numbers ICTU estimates we need to meet our retrofitting targets.  Let us start now.  There will be work in this for the next 20 or 30 years so this is good work to get started on but we should start with 20,000 apprenticeships because that is a very productive and good use of money that will produce savings in a range of different ways.</p> <p> I could go on in terms of employing people to re-wet our bogs.  Deputy Fitzmaurice and others have spoken about a farming scheme that would involve going to every farm, asking the farmer to put aside a hectare and telling him or her that we will pay him or her for that to be a native woodland area.  Let us start fencing it out this autumn and getting the agricultural adviser visiting and paying people because this is a better direct protection against any Brexit shock to the farming community than any other and has significant benefits down the line.  We need to be quick in terms of getting that sort of thing going.</p> <p> It is the same with the food sector.  The real problem will be in our retail and leisure sectors and creative industries so we could be quick in the food sector and decide to ramp up our organic scheme.  Some of the empty retail spaces will come forward so let us convert them using our community enterprise schemes, local enterprise offices and local authorities to say we are setting up a new market retail community and new distribution systems for local food to get to local people with local cooks being involved in new ways of doing business.  We must be quick here.  It must be on every street of every town and in every way create a vibrant new economy out of this downturn.</p> <p> I am sorry.  I have gone over time.  I have not even given the Taoiseach a minute to answer a question.  I apologise.  It is important.  We must be quick with regard to the economy now.</p></speech>

I join the Taoiseach and other leaders in offering the Labour Party's collective sympathies to those who have lost loved ones this week, although I must acknowledge that the trends we are seeing are very positive.  I thank everybody for their collective work across the country on this.  I also pay tribute to our front-line heroes.  This week saw International Nurses Day.  We all acknowledge the incredible work done by nurses across the country.  However, it is not enough simply to thank our nursing fraternity, which is made up of incredible public servants who are doing so much at the moment.  Real commitments were made to all our nurses last year that need to be honoured, but are not being honoured.  Approximately, 6,000 healthcare workers have been affected by Covid, of whom over 2,300 are nurses.  This figure is the one of the highest in Europe.  They need to be protected and they need to get their PPE.  I had to deliver some PPE in the past number of weeks and have helped to organise PPE coming in for a number of weeks.  They need the best protection available because they really are the front line.  That figure is very frightening.  I hope I have everybody's support when I say we need to do more for them.</p>  <p>  I also want the Taoiseach to ask the Minister for Health to ensure he signs an order that all payments due to nurses across the country are paid.  This dates back to March 2019.  It might surprise the House that a considerable number of nurses have not received their due and many of them are due an awful lot of back pay.  A total of 890 nurses in the mid west are due &euro;1.6 million so it is not insignificant.  There is also agreement with regard to setting up a group on nurse management pay, which will conclude this week, but it has not even sat.  We are talking about nurse management pay so perhaps the Taoiseach could embellish and bring that along.</p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach is aware, I have raised the issue of transparency with him for a number of weeks.</p> <p>I received a letter from the Taoiseach and, just before I came in here, I received a letter from the Minister for Health acceding to a lot of what I have requested and hopefully that will transpire.  However, I want to point out that, when I started raising these questions, I did so because transparency is not a luxury.  The minutes of the six most recent meetings of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, have still not been published.  That is not acceptable, given the commitments the Taoiseach gave on the matter.  We are being ignored and that is not acceptable.</p> <p> There was a pretty embarrassing situation yesterday.  This is not, and is not meant to be, a slight on the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach made some pretty honest comments yesterday about schools and childcare that related to what he had been told by Dr. Michael Ryan of the WHO and representatives of HIQA.  Those comments were subsequently shut down by the Chief Medical Officer, CMO.  That was a critical moment for all of us in this House.  It was not good for the body politic and is something on which we all need to reflect.  The Taoiseach definitely needs to reflect on it because it was not good.  I do not say that in any personal way.  For the public to hear one message coming from the Taoiseach and, a couple of hours later, to hear the opposite message coming from the CMO is not good.  The chronology, the way in which messaging is done between NPHET, particularly the CMO, and the Government needs to change.  There needs to be one voice, that of the Government.</p> <p> I want the Taoiseach to publish the letters from the HSE to the Minister and Department of Health of 19 and 20 April regarding governance issues.  They still have not been published although I understand they will be soon.  I hope that a lot of these governance issues will be dealt with by the Covid committee, which we asked to be set up at the first outing of this D&aacute;il, something that everybody shot down at the time but have now come around to.  I am delighted that my good friend and colleague, Deputy Michael McNamara, took up our suggestion to put his name forward and has been supported as chairperson of that committee.</p> <p> I want to concentrate on issues relating to competency in the context of how we are coming out of this crisis.  I want particularly to concentrate on what has happened with the leaving certificate examinations, childcare and how we are going to get our health services back.  I also want to point out that we need an intervention from the Minister for Finance as to how the banks are performing, particularly as it relates to mortgages.  Mortgage approval is being denied or put back for anybody whose employer has put them on a Covid payment.  That is an unacceptable action that has been taken by many banks.</p> <p> I turn to the botched childcare situation.  Was that the original scheme that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, said he had nine weeks ago when he showed it to me under his arm?  I am not sure it was.  Any of us who looked into this scheme knew that it was not going to work.  I found the way it was announced strange.  Schemes do not fall just before the 9 o'clock news as they did last night.  It was amazing, after the statements of the Taoiseach and the CMO, that the scheme fell by 9 o'clock last night.  We all knew that scheme was not going to work.  Issues relating to insurance must be dealt with.  The issues relating to this scheme, whereby the Taoiseach did not consult with the providers or those who needed it, meant that it was always going to fail.</p> <p> I do not agree with the Taoiseach's commentary on insurance.  I respectfully ask him to look at this again.  We are the first party to come out and say that we need an indemnity scheme that will be levied on the insurance industry.  My colleagues and I are talking to people all the time.  It is not just across the childcare sector that businesses cannot open.  There will be a number of businesses in other areas that will not be able to open either.  This needs to be looked at in an intricate way because otherwise the roadmap will not happen.  We are not talking about insurance for those who act in a reckless way.  In fact, we are saying that people who would act recklessly should not be insured in any way, shape or form.</p> <p> I have two specific points to make about the leaving certificate.  School profiling has to go.  It is completely wrong, as my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, has made clear in the Chamber in the last couple of days.  We also have a question mark over the legality of what is happening.  Put simply, will somebody who passes the exam this year be able to join An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, where it is mandatory to have a leaving certificate?  I would like the Taoiseach to reflect on that because I do not think they can unless subsequent legislation is passed because such a person will not have a certificate.  The State Examinations Commission will not be sitting.</p>  <p>A separate section is being set up in the Department to deal with this, the reason being that it is not the leaving certificate.  Will the Taoiseach deal with that point?</p> <p> An issue I have been talking about for some weeks now is that of preventable non-Covid-related deaths, which I believe will surpass Covid-related deaths if the trajectory goes on the way it is going in the coming weeks.  We have 42 people on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick, UHL, as I stand here.  That is not very good for infection control.  What is the plan for the roll-out of a roadmap for the health services?  What I have heard from the Health Service Executive to date is not inspiring, probably through no fault of its own.  From where will it get the capacity it needs?</p> <p> We will have to continue with private hospitals in a different way because of rostering requirements.  How will we fit in appointments and screening when everything is going to take longer?  Diagnostics will take longer.  How is work in the community going to happen for people with disabilities or mental health issues?  All of that will take longer.  Nurses, doctors and other healthcare staff will have to be provided with PPE.  Scheduling will take longer and people will have to sit in their cars because there will not be waiting rooms.  How is all this being planned for?  We need a plan quickly and for it to be implemented.  We had 2,000 nurses brought in from non-EU countries each year in recent years but only some 600 came in this year.  How are we going to increase that number and ensure we can deal with the situation?  When will screening be brought back, for example?  The figures given by RTE in the past week are quite scary as regards the potential outcomes if we do not bring back screening in the coming weeks.</p> <p> In producing a roadmap, we cannot just substitute or push out the volume of beds we will require by using Citywest or the new camp that has been set up in UHL.  They are not sufficient for the level of patient activity there will be under many of the scenarios given.  I am dying to see what plan will be put in place that will be able to deal with the situation.  As a country and as a Government - the Taoiseach and his Cabinet and we, as a country, working collectively - we have got to a certain phase in dealing with Covid-19.  That is thanks to many people across the country, including, dare I say it, the Government.  However, we are now at a different milestone and there are issues regarding the roadmap and how we deal with that roadmap, how we interchange and make decisions, and how we deal with those decisions competently.  I believe competence has dropped over recent weeks in relation to a whole range of issues I have just outlined.  We need to deal with insurance and the issues relating to education.  Most of all, and I am begging the Taoiseach on this point because I believe it will have a life or death impact for many people, we need a plan that is considered, resourced and which will work for the roll-out of non-Covid services across the healthcare service.  It cannot wait any longer and the plan that is being envisaged, which the Minister for Health will talk about later today, is simply too long and will not work.</p></speech>

Those deaths are an individual tragedy for the families themselves and it is all the more incumbent on us to make sure we minimise the risk into the future.  We all agree that we want to move forward as quickly and as safely as possible to a situation where we reopen as much as possible of our society and our economy.  The numbers are encouraging and we hope the trend continues in that direction.  There is a significant job to do in terms of the testing and tracing regime, which still requires some work to build confidence.</p>  <p>  The five phases of the plan are welcome, but we need to understand that it is vitally important to successfully navigate between one phase and the next and ensure each phase works well and as it should.  The first phase will be critically important and we need to get it right.  Should the decision be made to move to phase one, the construction sector will be really important in terms of both the protections that are put in place and how that pans out.</p> <p>There are significant health and safety issues.  The protocols for the construction sector differ quite a bit from other industries.  This poses a risk not just to those working in the sector but also to the rest of us, and there is a potential impact on how we roll out the five-phase exit plan.</p> <p> Since construction was effectively thrown under the bus in 2009, there has been little in terms of support for the sector in respect of employment and conditions.  Many sites are substandard and are not represented by the CIF or ICTU.  Some of the protocols that have been put in place, which it is hoped will work, will not apply to the whole sector.  I have raised the issue of an all-island approach because a significant number of firms and workers in Northern Ireland are part of our construction sector.  </p> <p> Orla Hegarty has raised a number of issues.  She stated that 100,000 people will be on the move from Monday, that 80% of the sector works in Leinster and that it is common for workers to share vehicles.  We all see that happening.  These workers are with their families at weekends.  They also have weekday families, whereby they live in a location for a few days but cannot permanently reside in the area where construction is taking place.  Many are subcontractors and financial penalties and pressures are building due to projects not being completed on time.  Taking time to do something may not be an option. There is also the sharing of things like huts, toilets, vehicles and so on.  The CIF protocol is advisory, but it is not represented in all locations.</p> <p> I want to concentrate on the capacity of the Health and Safety Authority, HSA.  There were elevated protocols over the weekend, but capacity and resources are required to implement them.  It was stated recently that there are as many dog wardens in the country as there are HSA inspectors.  Capacity is limited and will have to be elevated if there is to be oversight.  There will of course be very good firms who will do things properly, but we all know that it is a sector that is very informal and, with the best will in the world, the HSA will not be able to cover the entire sector. </p> <p> A resource is available, which is the trades unions.  They train their members in health and safety and could be positively engaged with to ensure the necessary oversight.  We are in a very dynamic situation.  Guidance, advice and direction will not be enough.  There needs to be more than that.  In a reply to Deputy Paul Murphy regarding the 200 complaints that have been made to the HSA, it was stated that none has been processed so far.  That gives us an indication of the kind of backlog and problems that we will face in the future.</p> <p> I have two specific questions for the Taoiseach.  One relates to the powers and resources that will be available to the HSA and the second concerns the arrangements between Northern Ireland and the Republic in terms of an all-island approach to this sector.</p></speech>

She raised the issue of the capacity of the HSA.  Environmental health officers in the HSE will play a role.  Capacity is a very real issue.  We have had discussions about that at Government level.  The Ministers for Health and Business, Enterprise and Innovation might be able to give the Deputy a more comprehensive answer than I can because they have been dealing with this issue.</p>  <p>  It is acknowledged by the Government that the HSA will need more staff and more resources.  The plan, which may or may not be operational - I understand it is - is to redeploy people from other parts of the public service and Civil Service to the authority so that it has the additional resources it requires.</p> <p>This is something that has not been done before though, so there will be teething problems.  We all acknowledge that.  One of the welcome aspects of the protocol agreed by the Government, unions and employer bodies is that there is a protocol.  I appreciate there will be workplaces where it might not be followed, but I think it will be in most of them.  In each area there is a designated worker or staff member who is responsible in that workplace or on that site for ensuring the protocol is implemented.  In many cases, that person is going to be a shop steward or a union official.  Unions working together with business and Government will mean we can make this work, because I know unions and employers want people to get back to work and everybody wants that to happen safely.  Tripartite co-operation between the Government, unions and employers on this issue, and other issues, can be a good example.  I am not sure of the specific question.  I think it is on North-South issues?  </p></speech>

There is a regular quad meeting involving Ministers from the Northern Ireland Executive and Ministers from the Government here.  Under our memorandum of understanding, MOU, there is ongoing contact and co-operation between the Chief Medical Officer, CMO, in Northern Ireland and the CMO here.  Certainly, anybody coming from Northern Ireland to work here in construction will still be bound by the protocol and by our rules and regulations.  People are, however, free to travel to work.  I do not think anybody would want to stop people coming from Northern Ireland to work here on construction sites but the same standards and rules that apply in this jurisdiction will apply to everyone, no matter from where they are coming.</p></speech>

There are additional financial resources and additional staff, mainly redeployed from other areas in the public service.  There are also real consequences.  The approach that is going to be taken by the HSA, as is always the case, is one of compliance and working with employers to enable them to comply.  The HSA will, however, be able to close businesses and sites, if necessary, and prosecute employers under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, if needs be.  The approach that will be pursued will not be about closing businesses and prosecuting people but one of helping businesses to comply.  The powers to close business and prosecute people do exist, however, and will be used if necessary.</p></speech>

I urge the Government and this House to start working immediately on a new deal for workers facing the prospect of protracted or long-term unemployment.  I hear that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, briefed the Green Party and Fianna F&aacute;il about potential economic devastation and a return to a 1980s-style depression with long-term unemployment.  I do not think we should sit back like astrologers and wonder which way the stars are moving or which way the wind is blowing.  We need to proactively act to ensure we do not return to a period of mass, protracted unemployment.</p>  <p>  We need a new deal for workers, we need to be ambitious and we need to think outside the box to ensure that people get back to work, have decent incomes and are not thrown on the scrapheap.  I refer to arts workers.  </p> <p>In the foreseeable future, live entertainment is in deep trouble.  That is the reason I asked for the debate tonight.  We need answers for workers in the arts.  We need answers for taxi drivers, 20,000 of whom have had their industry decimated, and where for the foreseeable future that is likely to be the case.  Two thousand Debenhams workers thrown on the scrapheap by a cynical company could be the first of many who will face that situation.  How are driving instructors to do driving tests or driving lessons in the foreseeable future?  There are many others.  I believe that this House has to act urgently to work on a new deal for these workers.  Indeed, this relates to the issue of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response.  We cannot wait weeks for these discussions to happen.  We need committees set up immediately to discuss and bring in people from these affected sectors to hear from them.  We got it wrong on childcare because we did not listen to the childcare providers.  We need the Debenhams workers in here next week to hear from them.  We need to hear from the arts workers.  We need to hear from the taxi drivers.  We need to hear from the driving instructors.  We need these people in here to help guide us as to how we will prevent a return to mass unemployment and develop a new deal that ensures that does not happen.  I would like to hear the Taoiseach's response to that.  We must respond and not let ourselves return to a period of mass sustained unemployment.</p></speech>

One of the issues we agree on is that the best economic policy and the best social policy is high levels of employment and full employment where that can be achieved.  That is the best economic policy.  It is also the best way to reduce poverty and to reduce disadvantage.</p>  <p>  The best new deal for people who have lost their jobs is job creation.  Something the new Government, and this Government for so long as it lasts, will have to do is to make sure that we create new jobs, whether through public investment the likes of which Deputy Eamon Ryan spoke about earlier, whether through private investment - we need to make sure that we continue to be a country that is a good place in which to do business - or whether through foreign direct investment, which creates good, well-paid, pensionable and secure jobs, and of which we need to make sure we as a country get more than our fair share in the years ahead.  Job creation policies are essential.</p>  <p>  What is essential as well is education and retraining opportunities because economies are always changing.  This pandemic will cause economies, not only here but across the world, to change quickly and dramatically and we need to make sure that we quickly institute programmes to allow people to return to education to engage in training, particularly for those jobs that will exist in the future about which nobody knows for sure.  One might call it astrology - one can only estimate to the best degree possible what the economy will look like in the future - but it is reasonable to say that there will be many more jobs in care, in the public service and, for example, in construction.  There will probably be fewer jobs in retail and perhaps in transport and the entertainment sectors because of the way the economy will change, not only hear but across the world.  We need to think about that and make sure that we prepare people and educate them and train them for those jobs of the future in the new environment, which will be a green, but also digital, recovery and which will have impacts on some jobs that basically cease to exist.  It has been done previously.  When the party that I lead came onto these benches in 2011, we had 15% unemployment and over 30% youth unemployment.  As recently as 29 February of this year, we were very close to full employment.  It can be done and we will do it again.</p></speech>

That is 200 groups of workers potentially working in unsafe conditions and 200 appeals to the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, falling on deaf ears.  BAM and JBC Construction workers on the Intel site were told to return to work on Monday last despite the clear guidelines that it was not safe to restart work this week.  They have been on-site this week doing excavation, fitting telecommunications ducting and other non-essential and non-preparatory work.</p> <p>I have photos and videos.  If they blatantly broke the rules this week, what rules will they be willing to break next week?  Workers reported this to the HSA, as Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith and I did, but no site inspection has taken place and the works continue today.  More than two weeks ago, a complaint was made regarding Moyvalley Meats, this time to the HSE, with information from inside the plant that sick workers were working and living alongside other workers.  There have been several confirmed cases of coronavirus in the factory.  There are even reports that some workers are doping to keep temperatures down while clearly sick, with management turning a blind eye.  There has still been no inspection of Keelings, though I made a complaint with documentation on 20 April.  These big businesses are breaking the rules.  Why are they being allowed to do it?  Will the Taoiseach intervene with the HSA now to ensure there are on-site inspections where there are complaints?</p></speech>

I will make inquiries with the HSA about it today.</p></speech>

Are workers who are asked to return to work next week expected to have confidence in the system when those who have complained have had no inspection?  It appears that the HSA and the Government have been asleep at the wheel, carrying out no inspections at precisely the time strict enforcement is needed.  Will the Taoiseach intervene now to ensure on-site inspections, starting with Moyvalley Meats, the Intel site and Keelings?   Considering the fact that individuals who break the guidelines can face a fine or a prison sentence, does the Taoiseach agree that companies and CEOs who are consciously flouting the rules should similarly face sanctions?</p></speech>

As I said earlier, I will have to make inquiries with the HSA.  Before coming to any judgments, I would like to hear its side of the story.  I have heard the Deputy's in this Chamber but I have not heard the HSA's.  I will make inquiries with the HSA and find out what the factual position is.  As the Deputy knows, employers who breach the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 can be prosecuted and fined.  If it is appropriate to do so, they should be.</p></speech>

The HSA is not intervening or doing the job it is meant to do.  I have it in black and white from the Minister that there have been more than 200 complaints and zero on-site inspections related to Covid-19.  As such, unions need to prepare and stand alongside their workers.  Safety committees must be elected by workers.  Fundamentally, no worker should go back to work unless he or she feels confident that he or she will be safe.  Workers can only do that if their own representatives say that the proper measures have been put in place.</p></speech>

It is also quite rare for a recently retired member of the Defence Forces to get to address the Taoiseach, who is also the current Minister for Defence.  I would like to focus my comments this afternoon on Defence Forces issues and how they impact on the Covid-19 emergency.  As always, my comments will be constructive.  I come here to solve problems rather than to cause them.</p>  <p>  I have three points to make.  First, I thank the Taoiseach and Deputy Martin for their worthwhile response to the Labour Party's submission in the past few days, in which they promised to establish an independent statutory and standing pay review body for Defence Forces personnel.  This is a hugely significant development and has the potential to transform completely the defence experience in this country between now and Christmas if it is established and structured properly.</p> <p>I take this opportunity to thank every party and person in the Chamber, and indeed members of the media in the Gallery who have advocated so powerfully and effectively for the Defence Forces over recent years.  It is rare that there is any consensus on any issue in this Chamber, but there is virtual unanimity on the issue of Defence Forces pay and everyone deserves thanks in that regard.  I point out to the Labour Party that its stance on this issue has not gone unnoticed by the defence community all over the country, in every constituency.</p> <p> I see my role here as being informative with regard to Defence Forces issues.  I have read many press releases and statements in the last couple of months which are more like fairytales.  They bear no resemblance whatsoever to the reality of what is happening on the ground.  For example, we all voted for emergency legislation on 26 March.  A sizeable chunk of that legislation related to the Defence Forces and re-enlisting and rehiring former members of the Defence Forces.  Seven weeks later, it would be reasonable to assume that 40, 50 or 60 soldiers have been rehired, but the reality is that not a single one has been rehired to date.  We are not even close.  No interviews, medicals or Garda vetting have taken place.  It is an issue we need to focus on.</p> <p> There are a number of reasons that no one has been rehired, but the main reason is that the terms and conditions are pretty appalling.  If a fully trained former soldier wishes to return to the Defence Forces to fight Covid, he or she will be offered a three-year contract.  Incredibly, if he or she does not stay for the three years, he or she will be fined &euro;300 by the Department of Defence.  As incredible as that sounds, I guarantee everyone in this Chamber that it is absolutely true.  I have signed off on thousands of these forms over the last 23 years.  It harks back to Van Diemen's Land 200 years ago, where one had to purchase one's freedom from one's employer or master.  It needs to be changed.  I am sorry to have to bring such mundane and routine housekeeping issues to the Taoiseach's attention because this is definitely below his pay grade, but this is the only option.  There is no internal mechanism to resolve these issues within the Department of Defence itself.  If the Taoiseach could look into the matter, it would be very much appreciated.</p> <p> Some 300 of our troops are currently stranded in Lebanon as a result of the Covid crisis.  I fully understand the UN Secretary General's letter.  The letter states that we should, as a general rule, keep all our peacekeeping troops in location until at least 30 June.  That is all well and good.  Exemptions are allowed and Ireland has submitted an application for an exemption.  I totally accept and understand that.  There are six issues that the Taoiseach and people in the House are most likely not aware of.  There was advance warning that this letter would be issued.  There was a window of opportunity to rotate our troops and that opportunity was not seized.  It took Ireland 17 days to apply for an exemption, which is 17 days wasted, and we are further down on the list.  Our troops, who should have been home on Tuesday, might now have to wait for another six or eight weeks in-theatre in Lebanon.</p> <p> The real issue while our troops are still in Lebanon is that we have no military air transport.  This is not normal.  Every one of the EU 27 states, even tiny Malta and tiny Luxembourg, has military air transport to move its people around.  That is how we got people out of Mali.  We could hitch a lift on a Spanish aircraft and on a German military aircraft.  The UN is paying for these rotation flights.  It will cost approximately &euro;250,000 for two return flights to Lebanon.  That gives the UN a significant say over where and when the rotations take place.</p> <p> There is a myth that if we rotate our troops out of Lebanon early, it will somehow adversely affect our case for a seat on the UN Security Council.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Our two competitors on that panel are Norway and Canada, which are moving their peacekeeping personnel all around the world even as we speak.  There should be no reason we should think that moving our troops out of Lebanon on time is going to affect any chance of us getting a seat on the Security Council.</p> <p>Moving our personnel around the world is an issue of national competence.  It is like taxation or public health.  If Brussels decided to tell us what our tax rates should be, we would rightly tell it that it is a sovereign issue for our nation state.  Similarly, having our troops in Lebanon, deploying them, redeploying them or rotating them is an issue for this House and this Oireachtas, not an issue for UN headquarters in Manhattan.</p> <p> They are the six points I would like to raise.  I would be grateful for the Taoiseach's view in this regard but this is my personal view with which perhaps he might disagree.  We have sent approximately 50 Aer Lingus flights to China to pick up cargo and PPE, and rather than have our troops waiting for another six to eight weeks, could we not send two Aer Lingus flights to Beirut international airport to pick up our people and bring them home?  Six months is long enough.  Some of these people have not seen their families since November and we should bring them home.</p></speech>

I am sorry.  He is gone.  It was always a pleasure to converse with Dr. Harty as well.  It is good to see Deputy Berry is here as well, so there are at least two of us.  I look forward to a good, robust and positive relationship.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy rightly said, about 500 people have expressed an interest in rejoining the Defence Forces, which is really encouraging.  Those 500 will certainly not turn into 500 re-enlistments but it would be really welcome if we could re-enlist 100 or 150 people, especially those with particular skills.  We have had some pilots come back and I only signed off on that the other day.  However, we would like to see people come back across the Defence Forces and into all three services as well.  I am disappointed to hear that a barrier to that might be the terms and conditions, which always seem to plague progress in the Defence Forces.  I will not go into too much detail on that at the moment but I will be in touch with Deputy Berry about it.</p>  <p>  We have sought an exemption regarding Lebanon.  It is not solely up to us, as it does involve a decision of the Lebanese authorities and the UN.  We hope the rotation can happen in June.  I have no objection to using commercial aircraft to bring people home, including from Beirut to Dublin, if that is a solution that works.  I had not heard the myth of it affecting our SECO campaign, so it must be a myth, because if it was a problem I would have heard it.  I do not know where that is coming from.</p>  <p>  Military air transport is a real weakness for us.  We are unusual as a country, in that we cannot get to our own troops in Lebanon or in Mali.  We rely on commercial aircraft or the defence forces of other countries.  That works, but it is suboptimal in my view.  The Defence Forces have invested a lot in recent years in new ships, equipment and aircraft, including a Pilatus aircraft.  The CASA aircraft are being replaced at the moment.  I have said to the Chief of Staff that given there are so many aeroplanes on the ground at the moment, and perhaps aeroplanes are inexpensive at the moment, that this might be an opportunity for us to invest and purchase aircraft that would allow us to get our own troops back and forth to Lebanon.  There is always a sensitivity around the Defence Forces buying jets, as people will know, but this would be for the use of the Defence Forces not for the use of the Government.</p></speech>

Have they adversely affected the performance of the Defence Forces' response to Covid-19?  Yes.  Can they be fixed?  Yes.  These are man-made problems and it is within our gift to solve them.  I very much look forward to working with this Government and the next one in that regard as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.59" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1592" speakername="Carol Nolan" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400021#T00600"><p>In April, I highlighted the fact that without a series of immediate interventions to help alleviate the staffing shortages in nursing homes, enormous difficulties would emerge.  A number of nursing homes in my constituency of Laois-Offaly have contacted me in recent months about a chronic staff shortage due to staff members being out on Covid-19 sick leave and due to the fact that some were awaiting test results.  This fact undermined the capacity of many nursing homes to operate efficiently.  It put a huge strain on small numbers of staff members who had to work very long shifts and on the management that was trying to fill shifts and fill the gaps.</p> <p>I emailed the Minister for Health about this particular nursing home in my constituency which was at crisis point.  I sent that email on 17 April and I am still waiting for a response.  I sent a copy of that email to six HSE managers in Laois-Offaly.  It was only after it was sent a second time that I received a response.  That is absolutely appalling.  It sends a very strong message that our nursing homes are being abandoned.  I genuinely feel that urgent and decisive action needs to be taken because those nursing homes are still encountering staff shortages and feel ignored.  I spoke to a number of managers over recent weeks and they genuinely feel that they have been left out of the plan for dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic.  They really feel aggrieved.  Government and the HSE need to get their act together fairly quickly.</p> <p> As I have said, a number of nursing homes still require assistance.  I acknowledge that 18 Covid-19 teams were put in place nationally and that 183 nursing homes had contact with the telephone helpline put in place to support them.  While these are welcome gestures, they are certainly not the solution.  Staff on the ground is the only solution in this instance.  That needs to be dealt with quickly.  </p> <p> I also acknowledge that many community groups and volunteers have stepped in and made sure that PPE was donated to nursing homes.  A business in Tullamore contacted me and I delivered some PPE equipment myself, as did a number of volunteers.  That is unacceptable.  There never should have been shortages of PPE.  While I welcome the goodwill shown in all communities and that everybody put their shoulder to the wheel, there were gaping gaps with regard to our nursing homes.  Answers are needed.  I hope that there will be a review or investigation into how the whole nursing home situation was dealt with across the State.  </p> <p> I acknowledge that a little progress has been made but challenges still remain.  One of these challenges relates to the continuing and troubling difference of opinion between the Chief Medical Officer and the director of Nursing Homes Ireland.  Last week the Chief Medical Officer categorically stated that visitors did not bring the virus into nursing homes.  This was in response to a question as to whether appropriate measures had been taken quickly enough.  In response to this the director of Nursing Homes Ireland said, "I don&rsquo;t know how Dr Holohan can be so definitive on that [...] I would be asking to see the epidemiological study on that."  That was a fair comment.  I too would like to see the evidence on which the CMO felt he could make such a clear and unequivocal statement.  The reason this issue concerned me is that it highlights a growing sense that a certain level of institutional and reputational self-protection is already kicking in.  There was clearly already a major gulf of opinion between the CMO and Nursing Homes Ireland in the earliest phases, particularly with respect to visitor restrictions.  </p> <p> I hope that this issue, along with many others, will be addressed during the proceedings of the Covid-19 committee.  This has absolutely nothing to do with blame or fault-finding but we have to be constructive and we have to recognise where mistakes were made and ensure that they are never made again.  I want a clear sense that accountability will be obtained without fear or favour and without a sense that we should always and in every case simply give deference to those who are making decisions on public health.  </p> <p> What actions and interventions are being taken to address the staff shortages in our nursing homes?  These shortages are chronic in some nursing homes.  I would also like a timeline of the actions that are being taken.</p></speech>

I am, however, growing very frustrated.  I am privileged to be the leader of our group to attend regular two-hour briefings with the HSE.</p> <p>They are an absolute waste and an insult to the intelligence of the Deputies sitting there and the officials.  We had one yesterday evening which was a joke with no answers whatsoever.</p> <p> I compliment the new Kildare Deputy for his insight into what is happening with the Army.  I also want to raise the issue of our 300 peacekeepers who are the most noble of all and the duty that they carry out.  The Taoiseach waited 17 days to reply to a letter to apply for some leniency from the United Nations directive.  It is simply appalling and quite disgusting.  They have families; there are 300 families involved there.  There are young children some of them who were to make their first communion.  Some of them were anxiously waiting to see their dads and mums come back again to live together, work together and be homemaking together.  They have given their six-month stint and this creates uncertainty.  To add to the disbelief, we do not have any carrier to bring them home.  It is shocking.  We always praise them like we are praising the nurses now instead of paying them and respecting them.  We too are seeking proper pay and conditions for our soldiers and members of our Army and Navy.  The Taoiseach is the boss and is in charge of this.  Can he get answers for me and Deputy Berry as to why it took 17 days to reply?</p> <p> The mandarins in the Departments are calling the shots.  I challenge the Taoiseach directly on that.  The Taoiseach's statement last night about the cr&egrave;ches and schools appeared to be an affront to Dr. Holohan.  I compliment and support him so far, but he is not the Taoiseach.  We have to look at him every night on the Nine O'Clock News and the propaganda and spin.  I challenge RT&Eacute; and the media for not asking questions about what is going on.</p> <p> Others welcome the fact that we are returning to parliamentary democracy slowly but surely.  However, parliamentary democracy as we had it, before ever we had this election or before we ever had Covid, was unaccountable.  We see the saga of what is going on with the children's hospital.   We see it now with our nursing homes.  A deliberate plan, I put it to the Taoiseach, was designed to forget about the nursing homes.  Deputy Nolan referred to the statement by Dr. Holohan and how he can be so sure that visitors did not bring it in.  Who brought in the infection?  It was not the help they were getting from the HSE.  What the Government offered after several weeks was to send in HIQA.  My God, what a response to a group of dedicated people who were pleading for help and begging all of us in our respective constituencies to help them.  The HSE, in fact, directed the suppliers of oxygen not to supply to a nursing home; they countermanded that it should be supplied to hospitals.  That should be happening in a war situation and let the nursing homes go to hell or to Connacht.  These people do not matter.  We saw what the Government's value of life was when it introduced abortion with a desperately liberal regime.  The Taoiseach can roll his eyes to heaven if he likes.  The value of life diminished among members of the Government.</p> <p> There are many questions to be asked about other countries and how we have dealt with Covid.  There are a lot of questions here.  I am beginning to question if it is a great con.  Many people die every year of influenza.  Is there something else more subtle and more serious underneath this whole crisis and pandemic?  Big business has too much power.  This Government, the last Government and the big parties are mixed up completely with them, and have not and will not challenge them in any area. </p> <p> In the meat industry, independent farmers are now trying to get live exports of cattle.  We got one out.  It did not suit the moguls in the beef industry.  Now the Department is blocking 1,200 cattle leaving this country when it is so badly needed to keep our farmers literally alive and off the breadline.  It is being blocked with red tape again because big business has the Government in its pockets and is keeping it firmly in its pockets.</p> <p> Covid is now being used and abused.  We have this lovely hospital, St. Brigid's in Carrick-on-Suir, now closed.  The Government commandeered it and took it over.  It is now removing furniture from it.  I might add that the people of the town of Carrick-on-Suir funded the hospice beds and everything else there.</p> <p> There are numerous questions to be asked.  The gloss and sheen have gone off the spin.  People are asking serious questions.  Certain very well-educated professors and scientists are challenging this issue.  Other countries got banished.  They are being banished from the media here too.  I am challenging for honesty, openness, integrity and the truth.</p> <p> Why is the Taoiseach making one statement and Dr. Holohan making a different one a couple of hours later?  It is a pure affront to democracy as far as I am concerned.  I recognise his stewardship, but I also have questions that he needs to be asked.  I turn up at briefings with my colleagues to ask numerous questions and I get no answers.  I have been told when a woman waits six weeks in the town of Cahir in Tipperary for a test that it is a once-off.  Deputy Pringle had another one where 21 days was a once-off.</p> <p>The testing is a fiasco.  The centres that so much money has been spent on are not working.  No tests.  A testing laboratory in County Kildare did not receive a test from midday on Friday of the bank holiday weekend until the following Tuesday.  The mandarins decided that it was business as usual on the bank holiday weekend and one would think that we are out of the crisis.  We need answers and accountability but we are not getting them.  Above all, the Taoiseach, above all, must provide them, as must his caretaker Government.  He is cobbling together a new Government to try to get back into power.  There are too many questions that need to be answered.  This situation is too serious and lives are being lost.</p></speech>

There are two issues I wish to raise.  The Taoiseach will have time to respond to my questions before we move to the other members of my group.</p>  <p>  Deputy Mattie McGrath referred to testing.  It is very frustrating that consistently positive news is being given regarding testing when we know the situation is different.  Like many other Deputies, I take part in Skype meetings with the HSE at which we are supposed to be given a full run-down on what is happening and get answers to our questions.  At a meeting on 5 May, the HSE told us that 15,000 tests are being done per day and that it is fantastic and great.  When the call ended, we got an email from the same HSE, which outlined the success of the testing programme and stated it was carrying out an average of 6,000 to 8,000 tests per day.  Which is it?  If it 6,000 tests are being carried out, the HSE should state that is the case such that we can get on with it.  I would not slate the HSE for such an announcement.  I would like it to get up to speed and achieve 15,000 tests per day but it is not at that level.  Unfortunately, the Taoiseach has presented the same figures and stated there are 15,000 tests per day.  It seems the HSE has the capacity to carry out 15,000 tests per day but it is not doing that.  The Taoiseach seems to be repeating the same thing, which is very frustrating to hear.  I know of several people who were tested but have not received the results three or four weeks later.  There has been a so-called blitz on nursing homes.  I know of a nursing home where at least 20 people were tested but have not received the results three weeks later.  In spite of such cases, we are constantly given positive news on testing and that is very frustrating.</p>  <p>  The issue of the testing app that will be rolled out was previously raised with the HSE.  There are concerns about its safety, the criteria that will be used and for what purpose the information will be used.  The Council of Europe, the human rights body of which Ireland has been a member for many years, issued a statement this week on the use of such apps across Europe.  It questions how voluntary the voluntary participation will be.  We need to consider this issue.  It states that there will inevitably be social pressure on individuals to download and use the apps and, furthermore, that many public health regimes incentivise participation or penalise citizens for not voluntarily participating.  For example, Israel places its citizens lower on waiting lists if they do not agree to voluntarily donate their organs.  Questions have been raised regarding where the data are being stored and who will get to see them.  In the United Kingdom, its Government intentionally chose a model incentivised towards continually asking for increasing amounts of private information.  Legislation requires a formal assessment of the proportionality of Government usage of personal information as balanced against the legitimate aim of protecting the population.  Personal information is afforded special protection under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  If such an app is to be rolled out here, is the necessary legislation being prepared and will it meet the standards set out in Article 8?</p></speech>

On the volume of testing, as I stated earlier, 44,000 tests have been carried out in the past seven days.  That works out at roughly 6,000 per day, which I think is the figure referred to by the Deputy.  As he rightly pointed out, the capacity is there to do more.  The current clinical guidelines are to test people who have symptoms, as well as carrying out some screening in certain places.</p> <p>It is a good idea to have spare capacity because if we find that there is a surge or a series of clusters next week or the week after we will need that spare capacity.  I am happy with the volume of testing being done.  We are in the top ten EU countries for tests per head.  I am not yet happy with the turnaround times; they need to improve.  I think the HSE and everyone acknowledges that.  I know from my own clinical practice that healthcare staff are getting the results back within a day or two but within the community it is closer to five.  It needs to be better than that.  We acknowledge that there is a shortcoming there.</p> <p> The app is being developed.  I had a verbal briefing on it yesterday.  It will be voluntary, not compulsory, and because it is voluntary, it will be less effective.  The more people who download and use it the more effective it will be, the fewer that do so the less effective it will be but it will be voluntary.  It will have the benefit of additionality but it is not an alternative to traditional manual contact tracing.  The data will be held on the phone.  It will not be held centrally by Government.  I understand it will be field tested in June.  I do not know the exact answer to the question about the European Convention on Human Rights but I will check it out. </p></speech>

I spoke to the Taoiseach last week about face masks.  Yesterday, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport said it was likely that facial coverings would be encouraged from next week on public transport, etc.  We need certainty on this for three reasons. First, we have to plan.  Many face masks can be homemade and various groups are making them voluntarily, to avoid a spike in costs and shortages, we need to give certainty to people as we open up next Monday.  Second, of course we do not have certainty but if we consider countries where SARS and MERS were prevalent we can see what they did in practice and we should learn.  Finally, the Taoiseach said this morning that face masks are no substitute for handwashing, social distancing etc.  I fully agree.  Nobody is saying they are a substitute.  They are literally an extra barrier to stop the spread of the virus.  As we open up next Monday, can the Taoiseach please give us some certainty about recommending the wearing of face masks in public?</p></speech>

Throughout west Clare, a number of water schemes have completely outdated water mains, including Cooraclare, Doonbeg, Miltown Malbay and Mullagh.  One has broken down four times since this pandemic arrived in Ireland.  The Irish Water staff locally have done an excellent job repairing it each time but twice in the past three years, that water mains was the subject of a contract to be replaced.  That has not happened.  The problem is not the length of time it is out in Miltown Malbay; there are group water schemes around Miltown Malbay where the people pay their water charges and rely on this water.  In those group schemes the water is out for days on end.  Five days was the last outage, the last of four outages.  I know it is not the Taoiseach's role to manage where Irish Water replaces water mains but it is a public body.  The Government is the ultimate shareholder and the Taoiseach is the Head of Government.  Does he accept that it is not good enough at any time for people to be without water for days on end, but particularly at this time?  Will he ask somebody in his Department to find out what Irish Water is going to do to replace those mains because while the staff locally are fixing them every time they break down, which is every couple of days and that is great, it is not enough?  They need to be replaced.</p></speech>

Water mains that need to be repaired should be repaired and replaced if they need to be replaced.  Deputy Carey mentioned this to me as well.  I will make inquiries at Irish Water about that and find out if we can get the work done quickly.  We all know the importance of clean water in terms of public health and general hygiene.</p>  <p>  In response to Deputy Harkin, when it comes to face coverings, there is an active scientific debate on that. </p> <p>There is an active scientific debate on face coverings.  We have been waiting for quite some time for advice from NPHET and we expect it today or tomorrow.  Hopefully we can give people clarity.  I believe the advice will be to advise face coverings in certain circumstances but perhaps not face masks as we do not want to be in a situation where we run into shortages of surgical or respiratory masks for those who need them most, namely our healthcare workers.  If that is the case, it will be necessary to have a public information campaign as well to inform people how and when to use them and reminding people, as the Deputy rightly said, that it is not a substitute for the other things.  It may have some additional benefit in certain circumstances but it should not be seen as an alternative to social distancing, hand washing and respiratory etiquette.</p></speech>

First and most important, I express my sympathy to the family and friends of those that have been lost to this disease since I was last in this House.  The ways of mourning we hold dear have been taken away from us, compounding the deep sadness of the bereaved but I hope they know, and I hope it helps to know, we all as a country grieve with them.</p>  <p>  It is now more than ten weeks since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in our country on 29 February.  I know it seems much longer since the days when this virus did not dominate our lives and we were free to be together and to go where we pleased without the concerns that are now a routine part of daily life.  I do not think that there is anyone among us who would not like to wake up one morning and find that all this is over and that we can go back to living the lives we led before Covid-19.  Unfortunately, we have been given a different challenge and a harder road to follow.  It is one where we have had to adapt our everyday lives and be ever vigilant about this disease so that, in simple terms, we do not give it to anyone and we do not get it from anyone.</p>  <p>  Our reward for the sacrifices made and the hardships suffered in these weeks is that fewer people have this disease and fewer still have become ill from it than would have been the case if we as a country had done nothing.  Our modelling work shows that 12,300 lives would have been lost by this day last week if the infection rate had continued as it was.  As a country we can be proud of what we have achieved.</p>  <p>  I can update the House on the reproduction rate, or R nought, that we have become familiar with.  This is now in the range 0.4 to 0.6.  This is a remarkably stable number which has below 1 for the past weeks.  The number of hospitals admissions per day has fallen again from 20 a day when I was here last week to 15 a day.  ICU admissions are also now averaging around one to two per day from four to six a day two weeks ago.  We are moving to a new phase in our response, but we must we must be honest with people about the impacts this will have.</p> <p>Every movement carries increased risk of exposure to this virus so while we want society and the economy to reopen, we must be conscious that the public health risk has not gone away.  This virus has not disappeared.</p> <p> We must now try to chart a path to a new normal.  This will be a long road and, frankly, the final destination is unknown, but we do know that every step must be taken carefully because unlocking a lockdown is fraught with danger and risk.  As we have seen elsewhere in the world, a small recurrence of the disease can cause the need for an immediate and serious response.  Depending on what the public health advice may be, and the Government decision tomorrow, 18 May could well begin what will be our biggest national test to date.</p> <p> Our best line of defence is the Irish people.  Their individual behaviour, help and assistance will be our greatest chance of success.  Staying at home, washing their hands, keeping their distance, painful and difficult as some of these measures are, are the best things people can do to protect themselves, their family and their community.</p> <p> For now, we must continue to adapt our way of living to this disease so that we can hold on to the ground that has been so hard won.  We have come this far and achieved this much because we followed the clear public health advice that we were given and faced the reality, as a people, of what the evidence was telling us.  We did this despite the cost to all of us as individuals and the cost to our country.</p> <p> Our reality today is that we have made great progress against this disease but it certainly has not gone away.  We must continue to be ahead of it and to carefully watch its behaviour as we consider taking the first steps in reopening our society and our economy.  We have published our roadmap and we have been clear from the outset that it is slow, gradual and careful.  This is for no other reason than to make sure we have a safe pathway to regaining what is necessary and what is best in our lives and in our society.</p> <p> Last week, we published our Return to Work Safely Protocol.  It provides clear guidance to employers and workers on the measures that must be taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in the workplace.  The protocol was developed through the co-operation of the Health and Safety Authority, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, the HSE and my Department.  It is designed to be used by all workplaces to adapt their procedures and practices to provide protection against the threat of Covid-19.</p> <p> Let me be clear.  The protocol is not static.  There will be ongoing engagement at a national level between stakeholders on its implementation and it is subject to change in line with the latest public health advice or other developments in order to maximise the protection it will afford in our workplaces.  While we want workplaces to be able to open in accordance with the roadmap and at the right time in the roadmap, they can only open if that protocol is adhered to and if it is safe to do so.</p> <p> As we come to 18 May and consider the next steps to open our society and our economy, we will continue to rely on our expert public health advice and carefully assess: the latest data on the progression of the disease; the capacity and resilience of our health service in terms of hospital and ICU occupancy; the capacity of our sampling, testing and contact tracing programme; our ability to protect and care for those who are most at risk from the disease; and the risk of secondary morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the restrictions.  It is against those metrics that I will report to Cabinet tomorrow.</p> <p> The HSE plan for building its capacity to 100,000 tests per week by 18 May is on target, as it outlined this morning.  It is fair to say that we have made much progress in terms of increasing the capacity when it comes to testing along every step of the process.  Turnaround time is now the absolute priority and I am pleased that the HSE outlined its plans in that regard this morning also.  We can move forward with confidence if we know that we have the capacity to quickly contain new cases of Covid-19 in the future.  That remains the absolute priority in an area that will require constant attention and vigilance.</p> <p> We are continuing to focus on the behaviour of the disease in our residential facilities so that we can be best placed to protect those most vulnerable to it.  As the initial roll-out of testing in our nursing homes is completed we will continue to protect both residents and staff through our response teams and under the ongoing oversight of our regulator, HIQA.  The focus of our testing will now move to other residential facilities and settings so that we can identify and contain any clusters of this disease.</p> <p> Across phases 1 and 2 of our roadmap we have committed to increasing the delivery of non-Covid-19 healthcare services alongside Covid-19 care to meet demand.  This will require very careful planning to ensure that our health services can be delivered in a safe way.  Our health service responded to this pandemic with commitment and innovation. We need to build on that innovation as we move forward with resuming non-Covid-19 care.  As set out in the roadmap, we will use our modelling capability to assist in predicting demand to inform our capacity planning.</p> <p>We will continue to deliver care and services in new ways, for example, through telephone consultations and virtual clinics.  We will develop new models of care to meet demand and alleviate the concerns of patients, service users and healthcare workers.</p> <p> Let me be clear about one thing: our planning for future services does not mean that anyone should wait until any date in May, or indeed, for any date at all, before seeking assistance if he or she have any symptoms from any illness that are not Covid-19 related.  I urge any person who has symptoms he or she is concerned about to contact his or her GP today or attend an emergency department now.  Our healthcare service is there for such people.</p> <p> It is a privilege to be in a position to see how our country has come together in the face of the threat of Covid-19.  I hope the sense of community and care we have experienced in recent weeks continues; in fact, it is going to be essential.  I hope our future can be shaped by the actions of us as individuals in recent weeks, where we have worked together to solve problems facing us, where we have trusted each other to play our part, and where no problem has been insurmountable.  Every day, thousands of unrecorded acts of kindness and solidarity make it a little easier to come through a difficult day.  We have endured much loss and hardship in the weeks since 29 February but we have also shown incredible resilience as a people and a country.  I am very conscious there are still questions, some of the most simple and heartbreaking ones, that we cannot answer.  When can our children hug their grandparents again?  When can we hug one another again?  I wish I could answer those questions today but I can tell people we can hold each other safe.  We need to hold firm, stay home, stay safe, and protect each other. </p></speech>

Taking over the private hospitals in March to guard against a surge was the right thing to do.  It was a big, bold move and it was the right thing to do.  Health officials agree that that capacity is no longer needed for the surge, and that only 20% of it would be required in the future if there were a second wave, which hopefully there will not be.  The obvious thing to do would be to end the contract and put in place a contract that has an option to get an extra 400 beds if required.  However, that is not happening.  The HSE is giving a new reason now for retaining control and paying for the private hospitals, which is that it wants to use them to treat public patients.  That is an excellent sentiment but we might both agree that the implementation has not worked out as we would have liked.  I have heard of many cases relating to this issue, as I am sure the Minister has.  A young man from Cork in need of urgent spinal fusion cannot get the operation.  A young woman from Wicklow in need of urgent blood services cannot get access to outpatient procedures.  A father from Offaly is in urgent need of stents but his consultant cannot schedule a surgery for him.  Deteriorating eyesight, possible cancers and urgent heart conditions are not being treated at the moment.  Beds are empty, operating theatres are dark, doctors' rooms are shut, and because of this, patients are unfortunately suffering a great deal.  Many are deteriorating and it is entirely possible that some will die if they do not get access to the medical treatment they need.  We are paying &euro;115 million a month, which is a large sum of money, for healthcare facilities that we are currently not using and that it looks like we do not know how to run.  Half of the doctors have not signed up, many who have signed up are not operating at the capacity they would like because they cannot access their rooms and somewhere between half and two thirds of the beds in private hospitals are empty.  Indeed, there are several hospitals around the country where there are no patients in any inpatient beds.  It feels like we have arrived at the worst of both worlds.  I am not attributing any blame here.  This is about solving the problem.  Public patients are not being seen in private hospitals and public money is now going to be used to treat private patients in private hospitals, the cost of which would normally be picked up by insurance companies.  My priority, like the Minister's, is the treatment of public patients, but the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, has identified just 5,000 patients who could be transferred to the private hospitals.  In comparison, in 2018 the NTPF procured 21,000 procedures with just &euro;50 million.  Clearly, this is not an effective use of healthcare resources or public money.</p> <p>The Minister stated previously that he, his Department and the Government are looking at this with a view to making a decision as to whether to continue at the end of June.  I put it to him that given how badly this is going and how much suffering we are seeing for patients as a result, it is time to act now and cancel it.  Does the Minister agree that it would be prudent to cancel the private contract, retain the option for the 400 beds if there is a surge and give the money we save to the NTPF to allow it to identify not 5,000 public patients but tens of thousands of public patients who could be treated?  This would do three things.  It would get our full healthcare facilities up and running, which we need.  It would get the maximum number of public patients treated and it would get the insurance companies rather than the State to pay for private treatment of private patients in private hospitals.  </p></speech>

We, the taxpayers, effectively own or at least own the use of all the private hospitals in the country until the end of June.  Under that agreement, we have the option of extending that agreement for at least a month and an option after that for extending for a further month based on a mutual agreement.  As more than 300 private doctors have signed up, it is a minority of consultants who have not taken up our offer, which is a <i>pro rata</i>salary starting at &euro;141,000 per year and going to in excess of &euro;170,000, so we are offering to pay people to work in these hospitals.</p><p>The Deputy is right.  Thankfully, we have not seen the surge we feared.  That is a fair point but as the Deputy rightly says, we may yet see a surge so we believe we still need that capacity.  We are beginning to see a very significant number of people being treated in the private hospitals.  There is a bit of a myth, which has not been put forward by the Deputy, that these hospitals are empty.  For example, in April 2020, the Bon Secours Hospital in Cork had 82% inpatient occupancy and now it may even be greater.  UPMC Whitfield in Waterford has  55% occupancy, the Mater Private Hospital Cork has 57% occupancy and the Mater Private Hospital in Dublin has 60% occupancy.  I can circulate this list to the Deputy rather than taking up all of the time.  It has been a strategy of the health service to keep vacant beds for the reasons outlined by the Deputy.  We are now looking across the public and private hospitals as to how we can bring back non-Covid care.  We will be using some of this capacity, including for some of the things we spoke about last week in terms of cancer care.  I had a very long meeting with the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, IHCA, last Friday evening where I made it clear to it that the type A contract is the only contract on offer but I did provide clarification regarding continuity of care.  We have also given the HSE flexibility where there are some private rooms to which a consultant may wish to have access to continue to use to treat his or her patients and we could meet some of those costs but consultants cannot get a fee if they are treating patients.  We cannot pay twice.  We have all this extra capacity.  It has to be used.  There must be equity of access.  We cannot effectively own private hospitals and allow a difference in care between private and public.  I take the point that there were issues that needed to be teased and ironed out regarding continuity of care and I have written back today to the IHCA regarding that.</p></speech>

I will focus on what is sometimes referred to as the third and fourth wave in any pandemic, which has a particular impact on the mental health of our society and individuals.  A report by the WHO's mental health department warned of another looming crisis.  Its director stated that "the mental health and wellbeing of whole societies have been severely impacted by this crisis and are a priority to be addressed urgently" and that the world could expect to see an upsurge in the severity of mental illness, including among children, young people and health workers.  The UN has warned that the coronavirus pandemic risks sparking a major global mental health crisis.  Here in Ireland, the St. John of God service has seen a dramatic increase in admissions to its Dublin mental hospital, half of which are related to Covid-19, including a number of healthcare workers.  The Mental Health Commission, a State agency, has stated that it has been highly critical of the inconsistencies in staff testing and has criticised unacceptable delays in Covid-19 testing in mental health units.  Clearly, the mental health impact of Covid-19 is already being felt in our society; both as a population and on those who are already vulnerable.  On 23 April, I requested of the Minister and he agreed to the setting up of a mental health task force to guide the mental health recovery of our nation.</p> <p>I have to say there was a significant amount of general interest among our mental health community about that.  Have any steps been taken towards establishing such a task force and, if so, what steps?  I have also written to the Minister about the matter since then.</p> <p> What steps are being taken to ensure our mental health staff and patients are being tested as needed and are getting results without delay, bearing in mind the criticisms the Mental Health Commission made of the Department?</p> <p> The mental health charities have seen a significant reduction in their capacity to fundraise and, in some cases, are already reducing services.  What funding supports are being put in place to ensure continuity of service?</p> <p> My next question is not directly related to mental health but has an impact thereon.  It concerns patients who are non-Covid-19 related but need treatment.  I will give two examples with which I dealt in my constituency yesterday.  One patient was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in January but has received no treatment.  Another patient underwent a serious back operation in February but has not been able to avail of the necessary pain management since then.</p></speech>

I would like to meet Members of this House in whatever the appropriate forum is to work out how to advance that, or perhaps through the Business Committee.  I met representatives of Mental Health Reform and Jigsaw last week and discussed the Deputy's proposal of a mental health task force with them.  I do not want to speak for them, but some of them were of the view that it should be linked to the publication of the new version of A Vision for Change.  That document is ready to be published but, from a policy point of view, new policy initiatives are generally brought forward by a new Government after an election.  I am happy to engage with parties about when that should be published.</p>  <p>  I take seriously the comments of the Mental Health Commission.  I am conscious that they were testing long-term residential care facilities, starting with nursing homes, disability facilities and mental health facilities, so I hope and expect that the situation has improved.  I will engage with the Mental Health Commission on that.</p>  <p>  I am sure I will get a chance to comment further on non-Covid care later but we are looking at how we can safely resume non-Covid care alongside Covid care.</p>  <p>  On the issue of funding, as a country, we are going to have to work our way through how we recognise the fact that many organisations which do superb work have seen a reduction in their funding but their services will be more important now than ever.</p></speech>

That is a straight question.  Many people have held private health insurance over a lifetime - 30 or 40 years in many cases.</p>  <p>  The Minister might be in a position to comment on the guidelines for dentists.</p>  <p>  A number of psychotherapists and counsellors have been in contact with me asking when they can begin to practise again.  Can the Minister give a date for them?</p>  <p>  Youth workers working in community settings, as part of drug task forces or with youth and community groups have not been considered essential workers as part of this crisis.  That is a lesson we could all learn.  When can they go back and interface with their clients?</p>  <p>  I wanted to make one point that connects with the fact that society has made considerable sacrifices to protect the vulnerable, a good block of whom are elders.  The great paradox is that having done that, the greater swathe of those who have succumbed to the virus are elderly people in congregated settings.  The State mobilised an incredible cross-community effort in that regard and that same dynamism is going to be needed for the generation who face a trinity of calamities.  The generation that has had to face the outcome of the financial crash and shoulder the burden of climate action will also have to deal with the outworkings of the consequences of the pandemic.  The Minister might have a comment to make about where we, as a society, should go with that.</p></speech>

It will all obviously come down to their ability to practise physical distancing safely.  I know a number of counsellors have moved services online.</p><p>As to the future direction for private health and private health insurance in this country I have no doubt that it will always be a part of society.</p> <p>That is the case even in a country like Britain where a national health service is in place.  However, it is the clear policy direction of Sl&aacute;intecare to try to create a universal healthcare system. In the medium term, I presume that will impact on people's decision as to whether they believe they need private health insurance.  I am conscious, too, that a number of private health insurance companies have issued a rebate, recognising some of the changes in private hospital services to date.</p></speech>

We learned this week that both BreastCheck and CervicalCheck were paused for the month of April.  That is understandable in terms of the pandemic we find ourselves in, with the requirements for social distancing, PPE and all of that to be taken into consideration.  Equally, we have to consider the thousands of women who have missed out on that all-important screening.  Will the Minister outline to us today a comprehensive plan for how a catch-up will be carried out for the women who have missed out?  In terms of figures, I understand no mammograms were done in April, as opposed to 13,000 in the same month last year.  In the case of CervicalCheck, only a couple of hundred screenings were carried out, as opposed to 21,000 in April last year.  In addition, we have heard reports of women waiting up to six months for their CervicalCheck screening result to come back.  These are high-risk women and we do not want a repeat of what happened before with CervicalCheck.  Will  the Minister offer a response today that will give the women of Ireland some comfort in terms of how we are going to catch up with all of these missed screenings?</p></speech>

I will respond to the Deputy in writing and I take very seriously the point she makes.  The decision to pause screening was made on public health grounds and the decision as to when it is safe to commence it will also be taken on the same grounds.  The truth is that it will probably mean doing screening in a different way in terms of making sure the protections are in place.  The most important message I want to get out today is that screening is for people who do not have symptoms.  If people do have any symptom, then my message, as I am sure the Deputy's will be, is for them to go forward today to their health services.  A plan is being worked on by the national screening service and Dr. Colm Henry, the HSE's chief clinical officer, as to when it will be safe to resume screening.</p></speech>

Last week I spoke to him about the need to put geriatricians and geriatric consultants in place, which he agreed was a good idea.  The response from the HSE tells me this is not happening and that staff are visiting but not actually being seconded to work in a more permanent capacity.  Will the Minister address that because I still think seconding is a good idea?</p>  <p>  Will the Minister indicate what testing system is in place for people being transferred on discharge from hospital into nursing homes?  A young man contacted my office yesterday whose mother tested positive for Covid-19 and was treated in hospital before, thankfully, becoming well enough to be released.  However, she was not tested again before being returned to her nursing home.  I ask the Minister again, and I would like a fairly short answer, whether or not - and, if so, when - the system of two tests before transfer started.  I know it did not start at the very beginning of the crisis.  My belief, as I have said previously to the Minister, is that an opportunity was missed in this regard.  I am concerned that the two tests which should be happening, as was previously advised to me, are not actually happening in hospital prior to patients' transfer back to a nursing home.</p>  <p>  I want to ask about the details of the catch-up programme for BreastCheck, CervicalCheck and BowelScreen.  We know that thousands of those screenings have been missed.  That was done for good reason and we fully accept the public health measure.  However, there needs to be a catch-up programme, not just when the services restart but in such a way that it will catch those women who were due to have a smear test or mammogram in the normal course of things.  We are also hearing from people that they are waiting months to get their screening results back, and again that will cause problems.  I want to hear from the Minister whether the capacity has been sourced or will it be sourced to ensure there is not another backlog and we do not end up back where we were.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister comment, if he can, on the letter that was issued by the local department of public health to residents in direct provision in the Skellig Star Hotel in Kerry?  These residents are unable to follow social distancing requirements because they are all squashed in together and it is physically impossible to do so.  The letter issued by the local department of public health, which I am sure the Minister is aware of as it got extensive media coverage, advised the people in direct provision that it was basically their own fault that they had contracted the virus.  That is just not acceptable.</p>  <p>  Last Friday, the Government announced a &euro;35 million Covid-19 stability scheme for the wider community and voluntary sector.</p> <p>Many in the sector have raised concerns that the grant size of between &euro;20,000 and &euro;100,000 is too small for some organisations.  Some of those organisations are very large and provide a lot of services.  The Minister will be familiar with them.  Will he commit to engaging with stakeholders in the community and voluntary sector around grant size to ensure sufficient money is provided through grants to ensure continuity of service? </p> <p> I will accept an answer to my next question in writing if the Minister can give it to me.  What arrangements are in place for home helps to access PPE?  People have contacted my office about this.  I have spoken to those living in my area who I have bumped into, at a social distance, about this.  In some instances they have been told that they do not need PPE and can just wash their hands.  That is not acceptable.  I spoke about this a couple of weeks ago.  Many elderly people need home help, but are afraid to let those who provide it into their homes.  It would help if these workers had access to PPE.  Many, because of ideological reasons on the part of previous Governments, work for private companies and are not employed by the State, but they deserve State protection.  I would like to hear the thoughts of the Minister on that.</p></speech>

The number of staff redeployed from the health service to long-term residential care facilities is 451, comprising 394 redeployed from the community and a further 57 redeployed from private nursing homes.  In respect of private nursing homes, approximately 100 public staff have been redeployed from community settings to private nursing homes and a further 57 have been redeployed from acute hospitals to private nursing homes, making a total of 157.  I am not sure that the two figures fully align.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has raised the issue of discharges for some time.  I will refer to the current relevant guidelines for discharge from hospitals to residential facilities.  They are the interim public health and infection prevention and control guidelines on the prevention and management of Covid-19 cases and outbreaks in residential care facilities and similar units.  The HPSC does a lot of things well, but snappy titles is not one of them.</p>  <p>  On 10 March, the HSE issued preliminary guidance on the transfer of hospitalised patients from acute hospitals to residential care facilities in the context of the epidemic as it was then.  The guidance included a number of procedures to be followed. For example, patients with Covid-19 should not be transferred to a long-term residential care facility until they had two consecutive tests indicating virus not detected.  Patients who were symptomatic and contacts of a confirmed Covid case should be transferred only if the person had a test indicating the virus not detected and it was possible for the person to be isolated for the relevant incubation period.  Patients who were asymptomatic and were contacts of a confirmed Covid case should transfer only if it was possible for the person to be isolated for the relevant incubation period and transfers from hospital with no evidence of the spread of Covid-19 should proceed as normal except for patients with respiratory tract infection meeting the then criteria for Covid-19 testing.  In these cases, testing should be carried out on the result of the virus not detected before transfer.  There is quite a lot in that, so I will put it in writing for the Deputy.</p>  <p>  I heard the Deputy's comments on the national screening service during the week and I accept her bona fides in terms of what she wants to do.  I am obviously not going to make decisions on the floor of the House on catch-up programmes and the like.  The Deputy is not asking me to do so.  It is really important that we follow the clinical and expert advice in this regard.  Dr. Colm Henry, chief clinical officer with the HSE, is leading this.  I spoke with the chief executive officer of the HSE, Mr. Paul Reid, yesterday about this matter.  They are examining how to reintroduce screening in a safe way and at what point it should recommence.  We note that screening has paused in Northern Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales and, I understand, in New Zealand and many other countries.  The national screening service is participating in a national process, led jointly by Dr. Colm Henry and Ms Anne O'Connor, the chief operating officer, to restore health services safely.  They are developing and updating their plans to restart the four screening programmes.  They have confirmed that all four screening programmes are working on systems to invite people back for screening on a priority basis.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, it is important to say that not all screening services will come back at the same point in time because they are different, as she said.  Dr. Colm Henry speaks about this much better than I do but, for example, the physical contact required for something like a mobile breast cancer unit for some screening-----</p></speech>

We all saw the generous support of the Irish public for Pieta House last weekend, with the big fundraiser on "The Late Late Show".  Like many others in the House, I supported that charity last week.  I was concerned to discover, however, that Pieta House had introduced redundancies for clinical workers prior to that fundraiser.</p>  <p>  At a time when people's mental health is being adversely affected by the pandemic, what is the Government doing to help Pieta House retain these clinical support workers and how will the Government fill the void in mental health support created by these redundancies?  The HSE funds Pieta House to the tune of &euro;2 million per year.  What, if any, discussions has the Minister's Department had with Pieta House regarding future provision of the service?  </p>  <p>  There is a bigger issue, however.  If people trusted the Government to provide a comprehensive mental health service to begin with, there would be no need for Pieta House or other charities to plug the gaps.  Being so dependent on charities to provide services that the State should be providing is a failure of this Government.  Covid-19, as has already been mentioned, has seen an upsurge in people looking to avail of mental health supports and the longer this goes on, the bigger will be the demand for these services.  Time, unfortunately, does not permit me to debate written responses I received from the Minister during the week on issues I had raised previously in this House.  Will the Minister, therefore, support the reconvening of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Future of Mental Health Care?  Will he also support a special sitting of the D&aacute;il in respect of mental health?  We need a change in how mental health services have been provided in recent years.</p></speech>

As he definitely knows, what committees are convened is definitely not a call for me or the Government, but I see no issue with his request.  I think the Deputy's idea of a special sitting on the issue of mental health is a really good one.  I do not want to use up the Deputy's time, but he asked me to engage with Jigsaw regarding Clondalkin.  I had a very good engagement on that issue, and I will write to the Deputy, if I have not already.</p></speech>

I saw the recognition of that amazing work by the people of Ireland in their generosity last week through "The Late Late Show" fundraiser.  Deputy Ward is asking, rightly, what the Government is going to do to match, or at least recognise, the incredible work Pieta House does.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, in addition to the continuation of the existing HSE funding of some &euro;2.03 million per year, as he rightly stated, the HSE and Pieta House have now formally agreed to additional funding of &euro;114,608 per month, which is equivalent to &euro;343,824 per quarter.  Once the current Government staffing cost schemes, of which Pieta House is availing, have ceased, the HSE is committed to providing cash flow support monthly, with the position to be reviewed after each quarter.  The funding is being provided to fund an additional 300 hours of high-risk clients, and a quarterly review will ensure that any client who commences a programme of support can have a reasonable assurance of its completion.  The cash flow support is also contingent on the continuation of the process of engagement with the HSE to work towards creating a sustainable funding model for the organisation.  This arrangement, therefore, will provide the necessary support to Pieta House as it and the HSE continue to work together.  I hope that is some good news and that it will be of great assistance to many.</p></speech>

The report continued by stating, &ldquo;The mental health and well-being of whole societies have been severely impacted by this crisis and are a priority to be addressed urgently.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  The mental health consequences of the lockdown and the well-being of individuals, particularly among the elderly who have to cocoon in their own homes as well as in nursing homes, will be a major factor in the increasing demands on services.  The lack of contact for many elderly people with their families and friends is particularly devastating, and has made their isolation a greater burden for them to bear.  It has been recognized that, in general, older people are especially vulnerable to loneliness and social isolation, which contributes to a downward spiral in their morale and mental well-being.  This enforced isolation is causing even greater loneliness for many elderly people as they do not have the means to alleviate this loneliness by meeting friends and family or participating in social activities. </p>  <p>  This is just one aspect of the types of mental health issues arising during this crisis.  Those working on the front line of this pandemic are under greater stresses and pressures with regard to their mental health.</p> <p>Service users or those trying to access mental health services are struggling to avail of those services that were previously available.  How they utilise such services has changed substantially in this crisis as they cannot be counselled on a face-to-face basis.  This is having a considerable effect on their mental well-being and ability to cope.<br/><br/>Anecdotally, I have been made aware of an increase in both suicidal ideation as well as deaths by suicide.  I have also been told that there appears to have been little or no recruitment of peer-support workers, psychiatric nurses or psychiatric consultants, or putting in place of outreach services to address the increase in demand expected for such services and facilities.  Under <i>A Vision For Change</i>, this was meant to have happened.  This crisis makes it even more urgent.  What are the Minister's plans to rectify this gaping hole in mental health services, what is the present situation in regards to recruitment and how many volunteers have been utilised from the 40,000 plus who signed up?</p></speech>

I particularly thank him for acknowledging that when we rightly talk about mental health the impact of this pandemic on people across the age spectrum, including older people, is, indeed, a major priority.</p><p>I would like the new Government to publish within its first month in office the <i>A Vision for Change</i>roadmap.  I would like the House to convene whatever is the appropriate mechanism to make sure that we get on with implementing that document.  That is a key step.  I met Mental Health Reform, the organisation the Deputy referenced.  It was their priority that we would see the <i>A Vision for Change</i>roadmap published and the structures we put in place in this House would arise from that.  Truthfully, I do not have an answer in terms of how many volunteers and I suggest that I will correspond with the Deputy on that.</p><p>Regarding child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, 90% of mental health needs are being successfully treated in the primary care setting with less than 10% referred to our specialist mental health services.  We have thankfully seen a reduction in the mental health waiting list for CAMHS but in the interest of time, I will send the Deputy a full breakdown on all the information I have.</p></speech>

The Minister will be fully aware that we have had a capacity issue over a long time in University Hospital Limerick.  Over the past week, the numbers presenting on trolleys are out of line with other areas in the country; on average, there was 28 over the past week.  Today, there are 42 - 22 on trolleys and 20 not quite on corridors but in isolated areas.  Nevertheless, there is a capacity issue.  A 60-bed unit is being built.  A total of 24 beds are being provided under the Minister's initiative relating to the Covid-19 response UHL, with a further 24 beds in Croom orthopaedic hospital.  He might give an update as to when he expects that they will come into operation.  People are beginning to present with non-Covid-19 issues.  This is becoming a significant issue for us, particularly in Limerick and the mid-west.  It is something I feel strongly about.  I have been campaigning for additional beds for many years.  The Minister might give a perspective on the status of the 60 beds.  More acutely, where are the 48 beds for UHL and Croom?  They are to come on stream as part of the Covid-19 response.</p>  <p>  More generally, many businesses are looking to reopen but they want to open safely.  Public health has very much taken up the area of public health safety.  I commend the Government on how it dealt with containing the virus but as we move into a phase where we will be living with this coronavirus for a period, how do we manage it?</p> <p>What changes to the dynamic does the Minister foresee in public health in terms of proactively advising on reopening businesses in a safe manner, taking the need to control the virus into account?  The virus will be there.  We need to get people back to work and back to normal life, get children back to school and so forth.  Perhaps the Minister might address that.  I also ask him to deal specifically with University Hospital Limerick, where today 42 people are on trolleys.</p></speech>

I note his comments about people waiting in the emergency department, ED.  From my own recollection of visiting that hospital and its relatively new ED, my understanding is that sometimes the most appropriate place might be to isolate someone within the ED, where there may be a single isolation room or the likes available.  I will certainly ask for a report on the issue and work with the HSE and hospital management to do anything we can to support them.  In many ways the Deputy's question highlights the need to keep the capacity we have our private hospital facilities, at least in the short term.  I am conscious of the fact that there is a private facility in Limerick as well.  Having that extra capacity will be crucial in the short term as we try to bring on more capacity in the public health service.  I went with the Deputy to look at the 60-bed extension at University Hospital Limerick, which must be nearly completed by now.  I know that was due to open later this year.  I will certainly get the Deputy an update on that and on the 48 beds.</p>  <p>  We are going to have to provide health services in a different way.  People talk about resuming non-Covid-19 care.  I do not think anyone means this, but it is not just a matter of switching it back on as it was.  It is going to have to be about doing things in a very different way.  We cannot go back to having packed emergency departments and outpatient waiting rooms when we are trying to minimise the spread of infection and allow infection control.  This will mean more testing in hospitals for patients and staff, more protective equipment, better scheduling of appointments and trying to do more with telemedicine, as we have seen.  It may also mean a continuing enhanced role for initiatives like the community assessment hubs that have opened across the country.</p>  <p>  The Deputy's broader question was about how we can get our country open while keeping people safe.  There are a couple of points here.  The protocol launched last week showed how a safe workplace can operate.  That is a framework, not a static document.  It is very helpful.  It is an agreement between employers, unions and the Government on what needs to be done.  It is enforceable.  If a business wants to open, it has to be able to abide by it.  That protects employees as well.  I refer also to testing and tracing.  This will mean that if a cluster of cases or an outbreak does occur, a possibility the Deputy raised with me in this House last week, we can very quickly get on top of it.  The third point is as important, if not the most important.  It concerns individual behaviour.  We have to make sure that we as citizens continue to practice a good public health response so that we can limit the spread of the virus.</p></speech>

I hope that we can all work together to mitigate the issues around this crisis.</p>  <p>  Last week I raised with the Minister personally the challenges faced during this crisis by members of the Irish Dental Association.  One of the many challenges concerns the availability and affordability of personal protective equipment.  Dentists are competing with so many different groups and are finding it very difficult.  The Minister said he would meet with the organisation.  How did that meeting go?  Can he share the outcome with us?  Was it successful?</p>  <p>  Second, businesses such as hairdressers, hotels, pubs and restaurants will have to make a lot of decisions to comply with the public health regulations.  This will require advance planning and these industries will need much clearer information than what is set out in the road map.  I understand that it will be very difficult to give clear information, but I noticed something today when I was in a service station to get a coffee on the way to Dublin from the north west.  No matter what I did, I found it very difficult to maintain a 2 m distance from other people.  Seemingly, only 1.5 m is required in Germany.  Perhaps we can reduce that distance a little bit.  That is up to the experts, not me, but if the requirement in Germany is 1.5 m perhaps it is time to look at that.  It is going to be very difficult to bring some of the businesses back together.  Perhaps 1.5 m is not enough either or perhaps it is time to reduce that 2 m.  Again, that is up to the experts.</p></speech>

I had an excellent meeting with the Irish Dental Association last week.  I was hoping to meet its representatives again today but the meeting had to be moved to tomorrow.  They raised three issues.  A lot of the dentists need funding to get their business back up and running.  I discussed with them some of the supports announced by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation relating to adaptations, rates and so on, and I have undertaken to write to the association about that.  I talked to dentists about linking them in with the HSE.  I know some dental practices have been receiving PPE.  As the Deputy rightly said, they were not asking us to give them PPE, but they were wondering whether there was a way to secure it at an affordable rate.  I am hopeful that we can make some progress on that tomorrow when we engage.</p>  <p>  The most important issue they wanted to ask me about was the expert advice.  They want to reopen, we want them to reopen, and the question is how we can do it safely.  We asked the expert advisory group to NPHET to provide specific, bespoke advice about how a dental practice can reopen in a safe manner.  I hope to have that for them tomorrow and if not then, then certainly early next week.</p>  <p>  On some of the points that the Deputy made about complying, it will be difficult for all of us to comply and live alongside the virus.  I hear different stakeholders on the radio every morning telling us how difficult it will be.  I know it will be difficult.  We will all have to work and live in a different way alongside this virus.  The WHO could not be clearer in that regard.  That means we will have to support people.  In the first instance, sectors will have to come forward to their line Department, such as the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or Transport, Tourism and Sport, with their proposals and ideas, and where necessary, if they want to seek advice from the NPHET, that Department can do so.  Our roadmap is iterative.  It is not a finished document or the final word on the matter.  We will continue to engage with everybody in the country about how we make a success of it.</p>  <p>  With regard to the WHO recommendations, we continue to recommend two metres.  There are different schools of thought on this but we believe that 2 m at least is important to stop the spread of the germs from one person to the next.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.107" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1594" speakername="Brian Leddin" time="16:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400037#NN00300"><p>I have four questions for the Minister on behalf of the Green Party, about testing, tracing, isolation and funding for our community and voluntary sector.  We all agree that being innovative and effective in each of these areas is key to our continued success in suppressing Covid-19.</p>  <p>  There has been a lot of discussion, including in this House, about testing capacity, volume and turnaround time.  I would like to discuss how we can increase our testing capacity and reduce our wait times by considering alternative testing technologies.  I note that for all our testing to date, we have used the highly sensitive and specific RT-PCR technique.  This is very accurate but it is laboratory-based and, as we have seen, it takes time, especially when sent to Germany for processing.  In order to reopen workplaces and be able to handle possible subsequent surges of Covid, we need more and more rapid testing options.  Ideally, these could be processed in doctors' offices or in front-line clinical facilities rather than in laboratories.  Amazon has announced that it intends to build testing facilities for its employees and I am sure that other employers will follow suit.</p>  <p>  At NPHET's request, HIQA completed an excellent report, published on 17 April, on the rapid assessment of alternative diagnostic technologies for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.  This report considered, but for now rejected, so-called rapid antigen tests for Covid-19 until their efficacy is more widely proven.  On 8 May, the US Food and Drug Administration, FDA, approved just such a rapid antigen test, which gives a result in ten minutes via a non-laboratory based test.  This will enable the US to double its testing capacity within the next month.  It has been described by leading US health experts as a game changer.  In Ireland, this kind of testing could be used directly in settings such as nursing homes and potentially also larger workplaces, offering a real-time view of likely or probable infection, and saving valuable time for vulnerable people.  We understand that these alternative forms of testing have less accuracy than RT-PCR.  In the case of rapid antigen testing, it is approximately 85% accurate but gives very few false positives.  However, the need for more and more rapid testing is so great that we need to re-evaluate constantly the risk calculus around different forms of testing.</p> <p>In light of the FDA's recent approval of this approach, will the Minister ask NPHET and HIQA to look again at the possibility of endorsing rapid antigen testing?</p> <p> My second question relates to tracing.  In recent days, as our focus has turned to reopening, we have seen renewed scrutiny of our end-to-end times for testing and tracing and we clearly continue to be challenged in this regard.  We continue to look forward to seeing and to discussing the Covid tracker app's data protection impact assessment, DPIA, technical specifications and source code and we would welcome any updates in that regard.  I note that the publication last week by the National Health Service in the UK of the DPIA for its app has facilitated a healthy debate in the UK about the trade-offs between privacy and public health.  I would like to focus today not on the app, but on the contact tracing back office and whether and how we can use technology there to complement the Covid tracker app.  Once an individual has tested positive, he or she is engaged by our contact tracing operatives to find out who else he or she might have infected.  According to recent reports by the HSE and in the media, this process can be slow, especially in complex cases.  Several European jurisdictions, including to my specific knowledge, the Czech Republic, have rolled out computer systems designed to help automate and accelerate that process.  These systems use, with an individual's consent, more detailed location and banking data to help jog a person's memory of his or her movements and develop a more complete picture of the possible infective contacts.  Early experience in the Czech Republic is that this approach has greatly helped with the speed and quality of contact tracing and they are ready and willing to share their system with other countries.  Is any purpose-built technology currently being used by our contact tracing teams and, if not, will the Minister ask the appropriate part of the HSE to investigate such technology?</p> <p> My third question relates to isolation.  We saw reports last week that up to one third of arriving passengers at Dublin Airport were refusing to provide contact information, as requested on the arrival form.  We understand that further regulations will be introduced to make this information compulsory.  The other side of this topic is the question of whether arrivals are actually self-isolating.  Will the Minister tell us how many checks have been carried out to verify that arrivals are self-isolating, what form the checks take and what level of compliance was seen in the checks?  We do understand that expecting garda&iacute; physically to visit every person who arrives during a putative two-week quarantine is impractical.  Given that we have increasing test bandwidth available, and noting that just 113 people arrived at Dublin Airport this Monday, should we not mandatorily test all arrivals at our airports?  Any positive results could then be handled and contact traced in the normal manner.  If we used rapid antigen testing, results could be received before visitors are allowed to leave the airport.  Will the Minister recommend mandatory testing of arriving passengers at all Irish airports?</p> <p> On Friday last, the Government announced a &euro;35 million Covid-19 stability scheme for the wider community and voluntary sector.  However, at the same time, it is pushing ahead with a 1% cut in the HSE's 2020 disability services budget, which announced a &euro;20 million cut.  This is at a time when public funding for disability organisations has largely dried up due to the inability to fundraise during Covid-19 and at a time when the funding recommendations of the Government's own report, the Catherine Day report, are largely not implemented.  Is there a plan to reinstate funding for the community and voluntary sector at the appropriate level?</p></speech>

Regarding testing, the HSE has done an incredible job, moving heaven and earth to get to the point now where it will have the capacity to do up to 100,000 tests a week.  Today, the HSE announced a plan for how, from next week, it intends to have end-to-end referral to contact tracing completion in less than three days in 90% of positive cases.  That is a truthful acknowledgement that in the remainder of cases there could be some more complex contact tracing and management.  It also intends to have the target swab-to-result in less than two days, which would take account of the majority of cases which, thankfully, are negative.  Currently, 97% of tests that have been taken are negative.  This is an area that we want to continue to be scrutinised.  I am aware the Covid committee will look at this next week.</p>  <p>  In terms of more rapid testing, that could really be a game-changer.  Deputy Leddin is correct; we were one of the first countries in the European Union to carry out a massive health technology assessment and to publish it.  I know it was seen as useful not just in this country but also among other regulators that did not recommend one currently, but it is constantly under review.</p> <p>The short answer is "yes".  I will ask that it continue to be reviewed but I know it is already happening.  There are two parts to my answer on the issue of tracing.  I reiterate that it is my intention to publish the source code and data protection impact assessment, DPIA, for the app before it is launched.  I will also ask if there is any further purpose-built technology which could be used in the back office to speed up contact tracing.  Automation is seen as having the potential to shave further time off the process.</p> <p> With regard to isolation and airports, the Deputy is right; this issue will become bigger and bigger as countries start to reopen.  It is a relatively small issue at the moment.  Approximately 3% of cases of Covid in Ireland have come through travel.  One is much more likely to get it in the community but that is because there is not really any travel happening.  As travel begins to recommence we will need to have very robust protections in place.  I intend to see the passenger locator form put on a regulatory footing.  That will be a matter for Government and I hope we can consider it in the coming days.  It is my personal view that self-isolation should also be regulated and made mandatory.  That is not the case today so I do not have the figures for which the Deputy asked.  I will see if the border management unit has any.</p> <p> We do not currently envisage testing at airports for some of the reasons the Deputy outlined with regard to the current testing process.  That could be reviewed should a quicker test become available.</p> <p> With regard to funding, not long before the last D&aacute;il was dissolved for the general election we set up a group chaired by Peter Cassells to begin work and engagement between the voluntary sector and the State with regard to the Catherine Day report.  As I have said in the House, I do not believe that 1% efficiency saving will be achievable in 2020 in the current context.  I intend to engage with the sector including the Disability Action Coalition, which Deputy Shortall asked me to meet.  I have a meeting scheduled with that group for early next week.</p></speech>

Perhaps we will divide them and spend five minutes on each.  The Minister will not be surprised that my first set of questions relates to the famous letters I have been requesting for three and a half weeks and which I now have.  They are explosive.  I can see why the Minister did not want to publish them and why I had to keep asking for them.  They would have been revealed one way or the other because I had asked a parliamentary question in respect of them and half a dozen freedom of information requests had also been made in that regard.  They come to the nub of the governance issues about which I have previously asked.  In his letter of 23 March Paul Reid flagged to the Minister that &quot;the Board is understandably concerned that its statutory governance role is respected.&quot;  The most explosive letter is dated 19 April, when the CMO had announced that 15,000 tests a day or 100,000 tests a week were going to be delivered pretty quickly even though it had been said it would be delivered a month earlier based on the view of Dr. Cillian de Gascun.  In this letter Mr. Reid says:</p> <blockquote> 	Regrettably, I was taken very much by surprise by Dr Holohan&rsquo;s letter of 17 April 2020 [which I believe was the night he appeared on the &quot;Late Late Show&quot;] and also by the NPHET press conference which preceded the letter arriving.  The directions as set out in the above letter and press conference are at odds with the process that we have been jointly engaged in at both the Government Cabinet Committee and in subsequent meetings with Secretary General Fraser.  They are also at odds with the process in place with the HSE Board. </blockquote>  <p>Worryingly, he also says that he is &quot;extremely disappointed that these understandings appear not to have been respected.&quot;  The CEO of the HSE wrote to the Secretary General of the Department of Health basically to say that the process that had been put in place through a Cabinet sub-committee and the board of the HSE was not being respected by the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET.  Despite this, we have heard denials from the Minister, the Taoiseach and the CMO that any tensions existed.  The chair of the HSE wrote to the Minister on 8 April, on 20 April and on 24 April.  The Minister responded to him on 27 April.  Given the crisis we are in, the period of time from 8 April to the 27 April is pretty significant.</p><p>I have real concerns about governance.  Why did the Minister deny that these tensions existed when we can now see, in black and white, that there were real issues, particularly in respect of the roll-out of testing?  The CMO publicly announced a process different from that agreed by the board of the HSE, which has full authority in respect of governance.  The Minister stands over policy and it stands over governance.  This process had also been agreed through the Cabinet sub-committee.</p> <p>Why was there not a concern that the CMO made this statement which was counter to that?  Why was the Minister not concerned about it?</p> <p> Will the Minister outline to the House and provide the documentation regarding the appointment of everybody to NPHET?  The Minister is over NPHET.  The line structure stated by the Taoiseach is that it reports to the Minister.  Obviously, there must be documentary evidence regarding how people are appointed to NPHET.  I ask the Minister to provide that to us in respect of all those people - some very fine people.  Will the Minister also explain to the House why in any form of good governance minutes are not agreed at the beginning of each meeting and then published?</p></speech>

I particularly thank him for acknowledging that many of the people on NPHET - I would go so far as to say all of the people on NPHET - are very fine people.  They have done an incredible job in helping us save thousands of lives.  I know how hard Deputy Kelly works and I know how hard I work.  I have seen how incredibly hard these people work.  About 20 of them have the word "doctor" in front of their names.  They are working flat-out providing public health advice.  I am very proud that we live in a country where we have not played party politics with people's health, and Deputy Kelly has not either.  We do not need to look very far to see a very different approach being taken.</p>  <p>  The National Public Health Emergency Team is chaired by Dr. Tony Holohan, the Chief Medical Officer.  He gives public health advice; the Government makes decisions.  I want to answer the Deputy's question directly.  It is not just a body with the Chief Medical Officer and a few people from the Department.  While I am open to correction, I think there are also nine members of the HSE on that.  If the HSE wants to put another nine people on it tomorrow, that is also fine; it knows that very clearly.  It is a collaborative body where we bring experts from the HSE, the Department of Health, HIQA and the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, together along with a few external people like Dr. Mary Favier, an ICU consultant, to advise Government.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is right about the minutes; they should be published.  They are now being published.  The Deputy would like to see them published quicker, which is also a fair point.  They are now being published.</p></speech>

The letters show people working extraordinarily hard in real time.  I said on a Saturday at a press conference that there is, of course, tension.  I have been Minister for Health for four years and Deputy Kelly has been in Cabinet.  When has there never been back and forth between officials working their backsides off to try to save people's lives in a global pandemic?  However, what have they done is to have achieved their target.</p>  <p>  The letters should not be selectively quoted from because all of the letters are published.  There are letters where the chairman of the HSE writes to the Secretary General conveying his admiration for the extraordinary work that is being accomplished, and  it is stated that it is reassuring to know that we are approaching this crucial endeavour with mutual understanding.  I think the process is better as a result of the engagement of the HSE and the Department on process, but it is a matter of process.  I am very satisfied that NPHET is working extremely well with the HSE.  I do not think we have ever had better leadership of the health service than we have with Paul Reid and Ciar&aacute;n Devane chairing the board.  If there is any further documentation I can publish, of course we will.  I understand the CEO, the CMO and the Secretary General will appear before the Covid committee in this Chamber on Tuesday.</p></speech>

There is the Government, there is the Minister, there is the board of the HSE and there is NPHET.  A process was agreed as regards testing by the HSE through the Cabinet sub-committee.  Then it went outside that process and was announced.  That is essentially what these letters, in black and white for everyone to read, are saying.  I agree with the Minister that the process has improved, but what I have just described should not happen.  Surely the Minister would acknowledge that was an error and should not have happened in that way.  It took an awful lot for a CEO and a chairperson to write letters like that to the Department.</p>  <p>  I will run through my further questions.  When will the Minister honour the pay agreements to all the nurses?  I raised this with the Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  How will the Minister proceed with Dealgan House?  This is an extraordinary issue over which I have deep concerns and I have spoken to people about it.  How will what happened there be investigated?</p>  <p>  When will we have a date for screening?  I will not hold the Minister to it.  He knows how passionate I am about this whole area.  When will we ensure we have dates because people are very worried about this?</p>  <p>  When it comes to the whole plan for non-Covid health services, how will the Minister ensure that the remobilisation of our health services happens?</p> <p>The biggest error in the roadmap published by the Taoiseach is that there was no roadmap for the health services.  How is the pendulum swing between Covid deaths and non-Covid preventable deaths being measured?  We are now in a Covid world, for want of a better phrase.  People's behaviour has changed and so has the capacity of the health service.  We need to move into another phase.  How will we do so?  How will the Minister manage issues such as the scheduling of appointments and distribution of resources?  Stating that the facility in Citywest will be used to provide 1,300 new beds and University Hospital Limerick will be used in the manner proposed will not work.  What is the Government's plan in that regard?</p></speech>

None of us is.  There are always ways to improve processes.  There is back and forth between officials to ensure we get the right outcome, but that does not give credence to a conspiracy theory about there being negative tension.  I am not suggesting Deputy Kelly believes that is the case.  Rather, it means that experts in the HSE and the Department of Health are trying to achieve the best outcome.  Everyone agreed that we need to carry out 100,000 tests per week.  The question being asked by the HSE related to it wanting to ensure it could operate-----</p></speech>

It does so all the time.  It announces what it believes needs to be done and asks the other organisations to do it.  NPHET is not Dr. Tony Holohan's outfit.  He chairs the team but there are nine members of the HSE on it.  Nothing is perfect, but it works well.</p>  <p>  On nurses, my understanding is the number of nurses on enhanced contracts has gone from 3,200 when I spoke in the House on this issue last month to 4,500.

Many questions are asked and many answers are provided.  I hope the Minister will answer all the questions I have for him today.</p>  <p>  In his opening comments he correctly praised the Irish people for all they have done to flatten the curve and control the virus.  The problem lies elsewhere.  Unfortunately, the side of the deal which involves having a testing and tracing system in place with a fast turnaround of the tests at the scale required has not been kept.  All we can do is keep our fingers crossed that by next Monday the long-promised arrangements and end-to-end tracing at that scale and in a timely manner will be achieved.  I hope that will be the case.</p>  <p>  It has been very frustrating to try to get answers from the HSE and elsewhere on what is happening on testing and tracing.  There is no reason for the secrecy.  It is essential for the system to be transparent if people are to have confidence in it and know their sacrifices are being repaid.  As such, will the Minister consider requesting that all of the data behind the figures on testing and tracing be made open source?  In my view, there is no reason why that cannot be done.  Journalists and Deputies have tried to get to the bottom of some of the answers we receive and are always told that the information is not to hand.  Why are all of the data not made open source such that everybody can view and interrogate them?</p>  <p>  Last weekend, Paul Reid stated that we need to spend &euro;1 billion per year on PPE.  That is a staggering figure - &euro;250 million per quarter.  It clearly sets out the timescale in question and the scale of what is required.  The implications of the figure are enormous for the wider economy as well as the health budget.  Will the Minister consider establishing a group to see how much of that PPE can be sourced locally?  The capacity may not yet exist.</p> <p>Why are we not looking at bringing all interests on board, SMEs and all industry interests to see whether we can start producing that here, not only to do it in a more cost-effective way but to have confidence in supply?  Can the Minister set up a group to consider that and to establish whether we can source it domestically?</p> <p> The third area concerns private hospitals.  I note the points that have been made earlier and the fact that the Minister is talking about a roadmap for opening up the hospitals to non-Covid 19 cases.  That should absolutely happen as quickly as possible.  Can the Minister give an assurance that there will be a single list used for inpatient, outpatient and diagnostics in such a scenario?  I agree with what the Minister is saying.  It is very much in line with the Sl&aacute;intecare principles that we should have a single-tier service that does not discriminate against people on the basis of ability to pay.  Will the Minister give a guarantee that it will be done in that way?  We should be able to get through lots of the backlog by scheduling that properly.  Even in the awful event that there might be a second wave, it should still be possible to balance that.  In that regard, given the way the people have co-operated on this huge addition in capacity, has the Minister given consideration to potentially not going back on that, that is, to keeping all of that capacity within the public service and jumping a couple of steps ahead in the implementation of Sl&aacute;intecare?  Has he given considerations to or had discussions on that?  I really think he needs to do that. </p> <p> I welcome the fact that the Minister will meet disability service providers within the next few days.  While the funding being made available on an emergency basis is welcome, there is a limit on it of &euro;100,000 per organisation.  The National Council for the Blind of Ireland, NCBI, for example, is losing approximately &euro;3 million through not being able to fundraise.  It is a huge organisation that caters for approximately 8,000 people.  It does not make sense and is not fair to have that kind of cap for some of those very large organisations.  Will the Minister revisit that issue?</p> <p> On the opening up of some sporting facilities from next week, Tennis Ireland is advising that people aged over 70 may not play tennis and there are many over 70s who cannot wait to get back onto the tennis court.  Can the Minister clarify the guidance on that?  The same applies to other sports such as golf.  It would be helpful to have clarification on that. </p> <p> Childcare is a major issue.  The collapse of the scheme was absolutely predictable.  Lots of people said from the start that it would never work, that childcare workers could not be sent into people's homes without all of the necessary regulations, safeguards and protection.  My colleague, Deputy Whitmore, talked about the possibility of using public buildings.  We have a network of schools in every area of the country, spacious buildings, covered by insurance, with play areas and all that kind of thing.  Has the Minister given consideration to bringing together all of the interests there, including teachers' unions, childcare workers, SNAs and other interests, to see whether something can be done in schools?  That is happening in the UK, for example.  All children of front-line workers and children with special needs are being cared for in schools.  What consideration, if any, has been given to that?  Would the Minister consider bringing those representatives together while of course following the advice of the Chief Medical Officer? </p></speech>

There are things we need to do as a Government, a State and a health service.  There are things people are doing very well.  We desperately want to get what we are doing right.  The Deputy acknowledges that.  People are trying to do everything humanly possible to get our testing and tracing to where it needs to be.  The commitments given by the HSE today were significant in that regard.  I welcome the Deputy's comments on the Covid-19 committee to the effect that it will not become a party political group but is more focused on trying to get the information, get the answers and apply that focus..</p> <p>The Deputy is correct that the more data that can be shared open source, the better.  I have no difficulty with that and will talk to Paul Reid in advance of his attendance at the committee to see how much can be achieve on that.  </p> <p> On testing, the Deputy will be interested to know that following a request from NPHET, the HSE and the Health Protection Surveillance Centre will proceed with plans to undertake a population zero prevalence study.  It is intended to submit an application to the national Covid-19 research ethics committee later this week and, subject to ethics approval and completion of a clinical validation of a suitable antibody test, the aim is to start a zero prevalence study in the next four weeks.  That could be of potential assistance.</p> <p> The Deputy's comments on PPE make sense.  We must secure whatever we can because speed is of the essence but considering the virus will be with us longer, and how we do things will change, we will need a big supply of PPE now and for the foreseeable future.  I will speak to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, to see how we can pull together the HSE and some of her agencies to see how we can support the economy in trying to benefit from that.  </p> <p> I have no intention of us at least temporarily owning private hospitals and having a situation whereby the taxpayers pay for them and not for public work.  It just does not make any sense.  There are issues around continuity of care from a medical ethics perspective but aside from continuity of care, I understand there will be a single list but I will write to the Deputy on this.</p> <p> On capacity generally, Laura McGahey, leader of the Sl&aacute;intecare office is analysing where Sl&aacute;intecare stands - in a good sense - and what lessons can be learned out of the HSE board.  We will consider capacity as part of that.  </p> <p> I take on board the Deputy's point about the limitations of the funding scheme for disability services.  I will return to her on that. </p> <p> On opening up for the over 70s, I heard the same as her about tennis and it did sound rather peculiar.  I will seek the advice of NPHET on how cocooning - which again, is a phrase I do not like using - may evolve as we move forward in the plan.  </p> <p> On childcare and schools, the reopening of both will be key.  I will be happy to meet Deputy Whitmore or to get the Minister, Katherine Zappone, to engage with her to see if it is possible to bring stakeholders together.</p></speech>

I wish to press the Minister on the issue of public and private healthcare.  Given that Covid-19 will be with us for the foreseeable future, any consideration of a return to the two-tier system is untenable.  The Government needs to make up its mind.  Fianna F&aacute;il seems to be somewhat sitting on the fence and even hinting that we should go back to the two-tier system sooner rather than later.  I want to push in the exact opposite direction and it should not be for a few months.  We need Covid-19 care, Covid-19 surge capacity and to deal with the waiting list crisis and non-Covid-19 care.  The only way that can be done is to integrate all healthcare capacity, public and private, into a single system.  We need to grasp that nettle now and take the private hospitals fully into public ownership, not on the basis of paying huge sums in rent to billionaires who own them but taking them over fully.  Will the Minister respond?</p></speech>

We are not doing it to provide profit for anyone; it is being done on an open cost basis and will be subject to scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts and so on.  There is a clear understanding in the agreement that at the end of this month, there is a 30 day review period.  I intend that the Department and HSE will use that time to review the arrangement, and there have been many suggestions and comments, and then to arrive at an informed viewpoint to engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and revert to the Government and the Oireachtas.</p> <p>It is not my intention to take over the ownership of the private hospitals through this arrangement.  It is my intention to try to keep the capacity at the level we require for the Covid-19 pandemic.  The question Deputy Shortall asked about the future beyond that is in my view a question for the Sl&aacute;intecare work being led by Laura McGahey.</p></speech>

There was never a justification for a two-tier system.  There has been a general acknowledgement with Sl&aacute;intecare that that is the case.  Now that we have the private healthcare capacity in our hands, why on earth would we go back?  It does not make any sense.  There is a problem with this contract because it is essentially rent to people who are making profit from health, whatever way one puts it.  Why not take it directly under public control?  That is the only way we can establish how much additional capacity we need but we certainly need significant additional ICU capacity generally and staffing levels across the healthcare system.  Unless we have a single integrated system I do not see how we can even do that.  The Minister also needs to respond to the INMO's demands in terms of pay parity for nurses with other healthcare workers, a big recruitment campaign and paying them the awards they were granted as a result of the industrial action.  I would like to hear the Minister's response on that.</p>  <p>  I have a final brief question although the Minister might not have time to answer.  For a long time I have been asking about blood plasma therapy.  There are trials going on and 500 people have signed up to donate plasma but the plasmapheresis machines in St. James's Hospital are currently sitting idle.  I know that from somebody who went there and was told that by the staff.  The results from blood plasma therapy are very good.  If there are people who are willing to donate, why are we not collecting the plasma?</p></speech>

On the enhanced nurse contract, I am pleased that the number of nurses on it now is 4,500 compared with 3,200 last month but I want us to ensure that every nurse who wants that enhanced nurse contract can get it quickly.  I have been clear to the HSE in that regard.</p>  <p>  Regarding nurses or other staff working in private hospitals, my understanding from the agreement is that they remain employees of that entity.  I want to be clear on that.  I want to create a universal health service.  I want to create the Sl&aacute;intecare health service but the reality is that we do not own the private hospitals.  We have the use of those buildings for a period of time by agreement with the private hospital owners.</p></speech>

According to the agreement with the private hospitals, last week they were to produce a full cost statement detailing the costs for the month of April.  I asked last week if that would be published but I did not receive a response to that question.  Will the Minister make this detailed breakdown of costs available to Deputies and the public?  He has said, including today, that the model is an open book but, for that to mean anything, will he open the books for the public so that we can see exactly what we are paying for and try to get to the bottom of why we are paying four times as much per bed as the NHS is paying in its similar agreement with private hospitals?</p></speech>

I have written back to the Deputy on some of the questions he has asked in this regard.  If I have not answered all of them, I am more than happy to; my office will come back to him as well.</p>  <p>  Regarding the full cost statement, my understanding is that all of these will be analysed by independent firms of accountants who will give a view then in respect of ensuring that it is a cost book approach.  The Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General are obviously welcome to have a role also.  Whether the full cost statement will be published, I truthfully will have to liaise with my Department.  I could imagine that there may well be information commercially sensitive to one entity in it but I will certainly have a conversation with the Department officials and revert to the Deputy.</p></speech>

I raised it once with the Taoiseach and three times with the Minister and, repeatedly, the phrase "open book" is used to explain it but I do not understand what "open book" means if the books are not actually open for people to be able to read them.  I got a response yesterday from the Minister for Finance who refused to publish the final agreements with the individual private hospitals saying only that it could be considered but it may be "commercially sensitive".  This is an issue of transparency when hundreds of millions of euro are being handed over to the private hospitals, including owners like Denis O'Brien and Larry Goodman.</p> <p>We need the final agreements and the breakdown of costs to be published or this could prove to be another scandal in the making.  I asked repeatedly if we are making payments, whether fees, interest or otherwise, to Denis O'Brien's Ragazza special purpose vehicle or other companies like the Goodman Group - companies which are registered in Luxembourg specifically to avoid paying tax on profits.  The letter I received this morning from the Minister's office says that rent and interest that is a proper operating expense will be paid "regardless of who the ultimate beneficiary is".  I read that as an admission that some of this money is going to companies in Luxembourg that are set up to avoid paying tax.  Can the Minister confirm whether that is the case, and if so, how much is being paid?  Will he publish the full cost breakdown in order that we can see for ourselves?</p></speech>

What we are trying to do here is make sure we have enough capacity in the Irish health service to deal with a wave that, thank God, has not arrived so far.  I am very grateful for the fact that a number of privately owned hospitals reached a not-for-profit open-book cost-only arrangement with the State.  There are a number of safeguards put into the agreement, including independent accountant's oversight.  The normal scrutiny that applies to the spending of taxpayers' money applies here in relation to the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the most powerful and only constitutionally named committee of this House, that is, the Committee of Public Accounts.  I have no doubt that Members such as the Deputy will ensure that oversight is exercised to the full extent.</p>  <p>  I was clear in my letter to the Deputy that where fees or interest payments relate to the ongoing functioning of the hospital, they will be included in the costs, but intra-company payments are excluded and the rent and interest payments apply to pre-existing arrangements.  Any rent or interest payment relating to the ongoing functioning of the hospital is to be paid under the agreement but intra-company arrangements will not.  I am happy to continue considering the issue of the full cost statement.  We have to be conscious of commercial sensitivity, which is a legitimate issue for any business.</p></speech>

Has the Minister considered the request by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties not to expand the Garda powers beyond 18 May?  Rather than using these restrictions on civil liberties, the Garda should rely on the things that have an overwhelming impact, such as education, persuasion, etc.</p></speech>

I will be going through that process.  I share the Deputy's view that the people of this country have been incredible in their response.  We are always of the view that regulations are something for the Garda to have in the exceptional and very rare circumstances in which it may need them and I think that is the way it has policed them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.145" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="17:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400045#VV00500"><p>I have been watching the handling of the Covid-19 infections within the meat industry over the last number of weeks.  It gives me no pleasure to say that I am very seriously concerned by the manner in which this particular infection is being managed.  I have a genuine fear that if the reopening of the economy continues next week, we could be looking at the resurgence of this virus.  We have a serious problem within our meat plants, which should come as no surprise because this is a global problem that has sadly been replicated here in Ireland.  Our response to this can at best be described as lethargic.  There are now clusters of infection surrounding meat plants where the levels of infection within the plants themselves is up to one third or in some instances half of the workforce.  This seriously brings into question the Covid protection measures implemented in these plants.  Despite this, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine assured me here in the D&aacute;il just two weeks ago that he was satisfied from the feedback from his officials in the meat plants that everything was being done to minimise the spread of this infection.  What surprises me is that even though we had a problem in nursing homes because of delayed actions, the same was allowed to happen within our meat industry.  Why did it take six weeks after the first infections in plants for screening of all staff to take place?</p> <p>Why has it taken up to two weeks to return test results to some meat plant employees if there was no backlog with testing?  Why were staff not instructed to self-isolate in the interim while awaiting those test results?  Instead they returned to work the very next day into meat plants where public health doctors were concerned enough about the scale of infection to order testing of every employee.  Because of this failure to self-isolate staff members who potentially showed no sign of infection, they could have been spreading the infection asymptomatically.  This has resulted in a situation where the negative results issued to employees are worthless, as they could have become infected in the interim period by employees who were asymptomatically positive while awaiting test results.  We have serious lessons to learn from the manner in which testing and the delivery of results have taken place in the meat plants.  </p> <p> This is also the case in nursing homes, where staff have been waiting up to three weeks for results.  As these delays have seriously undermined the value of the screening process, will the Minister ensure that all residents and staff members are re-tested immediately and the results issued in a timely manner?  This also needs to be done in meat plants and staff instructed to self-isolate until they have received a clear result.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.147" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="18:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400046#WW00200"><p>The Deputy may have corresponded with me but I would very much welcome the details of those nursing homes.  I will revert to him directly about that.  I am holding twice weekly meetings with Nursing Homes Ireland and the HSE's national director leading on this with the specific aim of identifying any difficulties - be they in terms of PPE, testing and the like.  I would be very happy to engage with the Deputy on that.  Regarding when nursing home residents and staff and indeed many priority groups will be re-tested and the schedule for that, NPHET has asked the HSE to put in place a testing plan in that regard.  I want to go back to nursing homes next week and be able to outline to them when they can expect further testing.  I know a number of them are eager to do the testing themselves, which will further streamline the process rather than requiring the National Ambulance Service to go there, but I will engage directly with the Deputy about nursing homes.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of meat factories.  As the Deputy knows, food production was deemed an essential service.  It was also decided that where essential work cannot be carried out other than in a workplace setting such as in a meat plant, employers are required to have protocols in place for the protection of their employees.  These protocols have been put in place.  Examples could include things like protecting employee safety through the reduction of throughput rates at plants, the extension of operating hours and other safeguards such as the checking of temperatures of people entering plants, the provision of additional PPE, the use of Perspex screens and the provision of additional facilities to support physical distancing measures.  Where cases of Covid-19 do arise, employers engage with the HSE.  Typically, a local outbreak control team is set up.  On foot of a number of clusters arising in meat plants, a national outbreak control team was established on Thursday, 7 May with further meetings planned.  This group will oversee and co-ordinate the approach to Covid-19 outbreaks in meat plants in Ireland and as part of its output, it will issue guidance documents to all meat processing facilities.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy raises a very serious point.  Approximately 250 veterinary and technical staff in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are involved in supervising and regulating the operations of 56 slaughter plants and a large number of meat processing plants.  I know that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, has had ongoing engagement with Meat Industry Ireland and that he met with it on 5 May.  He acknowledged the efforts made to date but emphasised that the meat industry should proactively take any additional measures necessary to continue to mitigate the risk of Covid-19 for all workers.  Regardless of whether it is an essential business or one that may open in the future, it has a very clear responsibility in terms of public health.  Regardless of who is involved, what business he or she owns or how important it is deemed to be by society, NPHET and others issue public health guidance and it is the expectation that this guidance needs to be followed.  The measures announced by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation the other day are very clear regarding the enforcement that can be taken if those measures are not in place.  </p></speech>

We have been informed as public representatives by the HSE that people are being given results within a day of their return from the laboratory and those who are positive are being contacted directly by a health professional.</p> <p>This is not happening and negative results are being long-fingered for days and possibly weeks.  In fact, the system is so bad that employers are being directly provided with a list of test results and they are the ones informing employees as to whether they are positive or negative for Covid-19.  Will the Minister now confirm that medical data are being shared with employers before employees and explain to me why this is happening?  Can I also say to the Minister that, if he thinks the initial communication of test results is bad, the follow-up contact tracing is, at best, intermittent and from my experience is failing fundamentally.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that there are always areas in which we must continue to improve but the difference between this Government and others in different jurisdictions is that, when the challenge gets difficult, we do not walk away.  In many countries, one would not get a test for Covid-19 unless one was in a hospital setting.  Many countries are not doing community testing or recording what we are recording.  We are proactively seeking to find this virus in every possible scenario we can, including the community at large, and we have had success in that regard in the suppression of the virus so far.  We are also now identifying areas of particular challenge and difficulty such as nursing homes and we have seen progress made as a result of the significant effort in testing made by many staff in the HSE, HIQA and other places.  The Deputy is right to highlight certain workplace environments.</p>  <p>  We will have the capacity to do 100,000 tests a week from next week.  That will ensure that there is capacity to test people who are symptomatic, to test their close contacts and also then to target testing at other groups who might be vulnerable to the spread of the virus.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is right about the need to tighten further turnaround times.  The issue was the challenge of capacity and it is now the challenge of turnaround times.  The HSE made clear comments about that today, with a target of completing end-to-end referral to contact tracing in less than three days in 90% of positive cases from next week, acknowledging that there will always be some cases, the remaining 10%, which will be more complex in terms of contact tracing and management.  The HSE also outlined a target from swab to result of two days which, of course, will account for the majority of people who receive a negative result, which is currently approximately 97% of tests.</p>  <p>  I do not have any information about the issue of patients' details going to their employers but I would be very happy to receive it and revert to the Deputy.</p></speech>

The Minister has said that 90% of those who are positive would be contacted within three days.  I have outlined to him a fundamental problem with the negative results which is leading to a situation whereby people are not self-isolating and there is contamination and people being infected as a result.  The system is not working.  I am not attributing blame, but to keep to the agricultural theme, the reality is that Deputies are now being fed organic fertiliser.  As long as this happens and we are not being given the truth public confidence in the management of this pandemic will be seriously undermined.  After such heroic efforts by every citizen in this State to stop the spread of the virus, we cannot allow, under any circumstance, a second wave of infection.  The Government cannot ask people to continue to make such efforts if the truth about the consistent delays in contact tracing and informing people of their results are being hidden from them.</p></speech>

A special committee dedicated to the issue will meet next Tuesday.  A range of briefings has been provided, delivered by the HSE leadership, the Taoiseach, the Chief Medical Officer and others.

We ask lots of questions in question time but we are not getting the answers.  As for the briefings, the one yesterday evening was a total waste of time.</p><p>When can we expect smear test cancer services and other essential health tests to resume?</p> <p>Having arranged additional capacity for Covid-19 care in the private hospitals, are the Minister and his Department putting together plans to resume operations in them?  There are ideological issues coming up about treating all patients together, but people who pay their insurance and are waiting for treatments need answers.</p> <p> Mental health services in Tipperary are still non-existent while we wait for the Jigsaw service to be set up.  Mental health, disability and early intervention services have all been cancelled and there is no idea of when these essential care services will resume for so many families.  Mental health is a huge issue.  I heard of a case recently where a suicide, unfortunately, was put down as a Covid-19 death.  There is a lot of trick of the loop going on here.  Deputy Naughten called it "organic manure".  I would call it something that starts with "b" and something else starting with "s", but I do not want to say that in the House.  It is just not on.</p> <p> It is time to stop the spin and give us the answers.  We are seeing the love letters being exchanged between Dr. Holohan and senior officials in the HSE.  The Minister can smile if he likes but they are not really love letters, as has been exposed today.  They are litreacha, not Litreacha um Thoghch&aacute;in, going from different Departments to different officials, and showing a jealous kind of questioning of who is who and what is what.  We need to put accountability back on the floor of this House.  The Ceann Comhairle intervened when Deputy Naughten spoke about workers' test results going to the meat factory owners.  I would not be surprised at anything that has happened in the meat factories, because they own their workers.</p> <p> I have several questions about testing arrangements for Covid-19.  In one case I know of, an 80 year old in Clonmel in my constituency, had to get a 75 year old to take him for testing in Kilkenny in spite of the fact we have a test centre in Clonmel - provided by the GAA club I support, Moyle Rovers, which is of some fame - that is empty and not working.  What is going on?  Can we have some transparency about the number of tests being done in that GAA club, and in the centre in Nenagh?  Where are the answers to the questions we are asking?  My office is waiting more than three weeks for replies from the Department and the HSE to our queries about facilities and funding in Tipperary.</p> <p> What is happening with St. Brigid's Hospital?  It is a lovely facility, formerly a district hospital, in which many people from Carrick-on Suir were born and where they lost loved ones, who were waked there before we had funeral parlours.  The building has been taken over as a Covid-19 centre but it is empty.  The lights are off and it is in total darkness.  Beds are being removed to be put into Cashel.  The Minister and I visited one day and we saw a pristine, empty hospital.  People in Carrick-on-Suir and surrounding areas in west Waterford, south Kilkenny and all over Tipperary funded the three hospice beds that are there and other facilities.  We need answers but I cannot get them from the HSE.  I cannot get telephone calls returned or emails replied to.  Where are the answers?</p> <p> Unfortunately, the usual issues regarding the HSE, which many other Deputies and I raise on this floor day in and day out, are still there.  They may have gone down in the pecking order but they are still there.  The cardiac care service in the south east is non-existent.  There are still problems with dentistry, orthodontics, speech and language services, and the  waiting lists are a mile long in the public system.  How long will it be before those services are resumed and will we have chaos again?</p> <p> Worst of all is what has happened in nursing homes.  I will not repeat what I said to the Taoiseach earlier in that regard.  Those people were thrown to the wolves and blocked and blackguarded.  What happened when a response had to be given?  The usual suspects from HIQA were sent in, which had to hire in experts from other areas, for a form-filling and paper-ticking exercise.</p> <p> The Minister must feel for the people with intellectual disabilities, children with autism, and their parents and families.  We have some excellent centres in Tipperary, many of them voluntary and community-run, but now the people they serve have no outlet.  There is nobody to look after them.  Parents are getting no break from their children and the children are getting no break from their family.  Those breaks are badly needed because many of them require 24-7 care in the home.  I see many young adults who are pure frustrated by the current situation.  Younger children are frustrated, too, but it is easier to control them because they are smaller.  I am talking about young men and young women who are big and strong.  It is desperate for them that they cannot get access to services, not even the trip on the bus with the other young people who are brought to school by the excellent bus drivers and staff who care for them.  That service is badly needed and it must be put back in place in some semblance of a way in order to keep those families sane who are under enormous pressure.  I cannot quantify the pressure they are under.</p> <p> The over 70s have put their shoulders to the wheel but they have been locked up for long enough.  They are asking questions, as we all are.  We want less of the spin on RTE every evening, on "Six-One" and the "Nine O'Clock News", and more honesty.  The last thing people want is to have the Taoiseach saying something on "Six-One" and then his spin machine is outspun - and he has a fair machine - by Dr. Holohan saying something else.  That is divisive.  The Minister rightly praised, as did every speaker, the front-line staff and all the citizens of the State for what they have done, but they need to be seeing one message, and it has to be an honest, direct and fair message.</p></speech>

I sent an email to the Minister's office on 17 April about one nursing home that was at crisis point and I am very disappointed that I received no response whatsoever.  I had to email six different individuals in Laois-Offaly HSE, and only after emailing them for a second time did I finally get a response.  The delay in terms of our nursing homes are unacceptable and appalling.  I have spoken directly to managers of nursing homes.  They feel they have been neglected.  I urge the Minister to take urgent action to try to address this crisis.  I would be grateful for a written response to my questions.</p> <p> My second issue is hospitals.  The staff in our hospitals have played a fantastic and commendable role during this pandemic.  It is at times like these that we realise just how important and crucial our hospital services are.  Tullamore and Portlaoise hospitals are located in my constituency of Laois-Offaly.  Uncertainty still hangs over Portlaoise hospital.  It is unable to develop services and recruit staff because of the uncertainty in regard to its future.  I appeal to the Minister to put that to bed for once and for all because my constituency needs this hospital.  We need to ensure that at no time is any service downgraded.  I appeal to the Minister to provide some certainty to the hospital.</p> <p> My third issue concerns meat factories.  I was contacted by constituents in Edenderry who informed me that 60 workers in the Rosderra Irish Meats plant have now been confirmed as having Covid-19.  I wish the workers a speedy recovery and a return to full health, but there is major concern about this in the town.  What protocols have been put in place?  The Minister answered some of my questions in his response to Deputy Naughton but I want to stress the important of resolving and getting to grips with this issue because there is huge concern about clusters of Covid-19.</p></speech>

She is absolutely right to highlight the issue in regard to meat factories, as was Deputy Mattie McGrath.  I have outlined on the record of this House the protocols in place and the national outbreak team that is overseeing this issue.  The regulation and management of meat factories resides with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, rather than with me, but I take very seriously the points made by Deputies Nolan and Mattie McGrath.  I will revert to them in writing in regard to the specific protocols and safeguards in place and the work that is under way.  I will also revert to Deputy Nolan in writing, as requested, in regard to the nursing home issue and Portlaoise hospital.</p><p>I thank Deputy Mattie McGrath for raising a range of very serious issues.  I wish to note, however, that the only reason we have suspended any service is to save lives.  Nobody wants to suspend a disability or screening service.  We suspended services to make sure that more people did not die of Covid-19 in our country.  The only motivation for suspending services was public health.  The Deputy is correct that we now need to put in place a plan to safely reintroduce some services in a manner which recognises that this virus is not going away and we will have to work out a way of living alongside it while keeping staff, residents, patients and citizens who use services safe. </p><p>I have outlined the processes that have been put in place for screening services.  A plan is being devised to determine how we can try to provide some supports to children with disabilities.  I thank the Deputy for raising this very serious issue.  Many children with disabilities have not had a school or health intervention for many months.  We cannot just tell children we will see them in September.  That would be an entirely inappropriate, offensive and irresponsible approach.  I am working with colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills to see what we can do for them over the summer months.  It will have to be done in a safe way involving physical distancing.  There are things we need to do to support that.</p><p>I have a note to hand on St. Brigid's that I will not have time to read out.  My understanding is that admissions will recommence when there is a demand and I wish to provide the Deputy with that assurance.  I am sure the Deputy did not mean to say that those aged over 70 are locked up.  Nobody is being locked up.  We are giving people over the age of 70 the very best medical advice to keep them safe.  I know it has been really tough for them and we are eager to see that situation improve.</p><p>On Jigsaw in Tipperary, I had a meeting with Jigsaw.  In the interim period while its services cannot be provided locally it has moved a lot of services online to try to provide some degree of support to young people in Tipperary.  The website <i>jigsaw.ie</i>has a lot of help for young people in Tipperary.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.163" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1547" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="18:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400050#AAA00100"><p>I am going to ask some questions and then hand over to Deputy McNamara, with five minutes per session.  I said this earlier to the Taoiseach, but it has to be said again.  Regarding testing and the testing regime, we are getting fed a load of BS, as has been mentioned by other Members across the board.  I think we are because I know of cases - and I have not looked for these - in the nursing homes tested on the very first day the nursing home blitz was done, when the Army went into nursing homes and did the testing, and yet people still have not got results.  I know of at least 20 people, from one nursing home, who have not got results.</p>  <p>  Those cases may be within the 10%, and perhaps that is why this has occurred.  If that is the case, it is very worrying because that is a big number.  That is the problem we have.  I attend the HSE briefings and meetings.  We hear all of the stuff where we are told that 15,000 tests a day are being done, that there is huge capacity and we can do 15,000 tests a day.  There are not 15,000 tests a day being done, however.  Why does the HSE just not tell us what is happening, instead of feeding us lines all the time that there is great progress and that everything is being done?  We know it is not.  </p>  <p>  Sometimes, as politicians, we only ever hear about the bad stuff because that is what we end up having to deal with.  In social welfare, for instance, we do not hear about the 90% of people who get payments in time, but we always get the people who do not get them.  Perhaps we do have a skewed view, therefore, on how things are working because we only ever hear about the trouble.  It is worrying for me, however, when there is no acknowledgement of it and that is very difficult.  </p>  <p>  That was one of the things I wanted to ask about, but I really want to talk about another matter.  I know the Minister is in a difficult situation during this crisis, but we are going to have another crisis coming up very quickly regarding our hospitals as they start to reopen and deliver services.  Outpatient clinics, and similar services, are only going to be fit to see about a third of the people they were seeing prior to this crisis.  Our waiting lists are just going to get longer and longer.  Right away, therefore, we must have discussions about seeing people on Saturdays, working from 7 a.m. or 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. or something like that.  We will not get the level of appointments we had prior to this situation, but it is going to be a major and serious problem to stop our waiting lists going through the roof.  Will the money be made available and will hospitals be able to take those actions so as to be able to deal with waiting lists in future?</p></speech>

That is a good thing that we get to bring the challenges and things not going well to the floor of this House.  I respect that fully.  I can tell Deputy Pringle that we are publishing testing figures every week concerning how many tests are completed.  The Deputy is not just hearing that from the HSE or people like me.  I heard the president of the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, Dr. Mary Favier, in the national media the other day saying that things were better than they were the previous week and they will be better this week than last week.</p>  <p>  They do need to continue to improve, however, and I am very clear on that.  Testing and tracing is in a better place now than it was a few weeks ago, but it is not yet where we need it to be.  We need to improve and build on it further.  I went to visit a contact tracing centre yesterday to see the plans.  A fair bit of what is involved is automation.  If we know at the moment that 97% of people who get a test result are getting a negative result, and if one of us then has a test and it is negative, I would be happy to receive that result by text message----- </p></speech>

I am confident things are moving in the right direction but I am in no way complacent or cocky about it.  This is going to be an area that will require the scrutiny of this House, the Covid-19 committee and the likes.  That will be a very constructive role.  Deputy Pringle has also raised a very pertinent issue concerning our hospital services.  I am conscious I am talking about the future.  At some point, this House is going to elect a Government and some of these questions will fall to that Government.</p>  <p>  My own view of the world, for what it is worth, is that we are going to need to look at new ways of doing things in the health service.  It is no longer a case of it being nice if we did things in a new way.  It is going to be essential.  Deputy Pringle is entirely right.  Things we have been talking about for years, such as telemedicine, are now happening.  We need that to continue happening.  I also refer to the idea that all outpatients, as the Deputy referred to, need to go to the hospital, when some might be able to be seen in community assessment hubs or primary care centres.  I agree fully with the Deputy on that.  It is a big body of work.</p> <p>It will fall to me currently but, principally, to the new Government and committees that scrutinise the work of that Government in terms of how we make Sl&aacute;intecare happen in that regard.  The advantage is we have a blueprint from Sl&aacute;intecare in terms of how some of these things should be brought about.  I am happy to keep in touch with the Deputy on it.</p></speech>

Obviously, we owe everybody in the front line a huge debt of gratitude, including nurses.  We all have stood and applauded them, but nurses cannot live on applause alone.  None of us can, although applause for politicians is rare and, maybe, deservedly so.  Will the Minister set a deadline by which he will use his legal powers to force through the pay agreements that were entered into, if they are not already implemented by a certain point?</p><p>We have talked a lot about mental health today.  Will the Minister have a representative of psychiatrists, who are the people responsible for the delivery of mental health services according to the system in Ireland, appointed to NPHET, so that they can participate in the decision-making that it undertakes?</p><p>The Minister talked about a new way of doing medicine.  The deal that was done with the private hospitals, and the effective takeover of the private hospitals, is not something that I would dare to criticise because nobody at the time knew what we were facing.  Thankfully, our hospitals have not been as overwhelmed as we feared and those private hospitals have not been working to capacity or anything like it.  I believe the Minister gave figures for the Bon Secours in Cork.  Will he confirm that 142 beds are being used in the hospital at present out of its 300-bed capacity and that it is the hospital which is being most used?  All the others are working at even lower capacity.</p><p>Is it the case that the doctors who work in those hospitals can no longer carry out any work for private patients, even on a <i>pro bono</i>basis?  Is it the case, for example, that they are no longer able to have a colposcopy, which is a testing procedure for cervical cancer, carried out in respect of an ongoing patient if they have not signed the new contract?  If so, that would be, we will all agree, very worrying.</p><p>Finally, I understand NPHET is looking at a proposal to carry out non-elective work in those private hospitals now because there is capacity in them but that there is an anticipated budget of &euro;115 million per month.  The budget for all of that work last year in the national planning framework, NPF, was &euro;75 million as opposed to &euro;115 million for a month.  There may be many reasons for that increase but it looks like it could be a very bad deal for the Exchequer at a time its returns are plummeting.  There are many questions there but I would appreciate answers to at least some of them.</p></speech>

It will be an important role.</p>  <p>  I gave figures earlier regarding the enhanced nurse contract.  When I was last asked about this in this House last month, just over 3,000 staff nurses had been appointed to the new scale.  That was up from 700 in February.  I believe the number is approximately 4,500 now.  I expect a significant further increase on that in the next week or so when I get updated figures.  At that stage, I will make a decision as to whether I need to issue a direction to the HSE.  I am not detecting an unwillingness in the HSE to do this at all.  Basically, I will give the Deputy an answer on that within a week.</p>  <p>  On the private hospital issue, the Deputy rightly acknowledged the reasons it was done.  Obviously, a review period is built in from the end of this month to the end of June where I must decide in consultation with Government colleagues, and particularly the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, whether it makes sense to renew the contracted and whether it is needed.  We will consider all of these issues.  We will use that review period to the fullest in terms of value for money for the taxpayer but also, obviously, the needs of the public health service.  Of course, if we are to be paying for the use of the private hospitals, we would all agree that we want them used for public patients.</p>  <p>  I do not have the figure for the number of vacant beds.  I only have the percentages I outlined earlier which I am happy to send to the Deputy in writing.  I will also correspond with the Deputy, specifically about psychiatry, which he raised.  We have a psychiatrist, Dr. Hillery, on the medical leaders' forum but the issue of having a psychiatrist on NPHET is something I will discuss with the Chief Medical Officer, and on which I will revert to the Deputy.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.174" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="19:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400052#GGG00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to update Members on the initiatives the Government has taken to support businesses in meeting the challenges presented by Covid-19.  Covid-19 has impacted upon our society and our economy in a manner we could not have imagined.  Unemployment is at a rate we have never seen and our business community is under extraordinary and unprecedented pressure.  Covid-19 came at us with unprecedented speed and the Government moved quickly to bring forward a series of measures to support those impacted by the pandemic.  These include emergency income support such as the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme, the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment and a range of business supports on which I will provide further updates.</p>  <p>  As of this morning, almost 54,000 employers had registered with Revenue for the wage subsidy scheme, with more than 462,000 receiving a payment under the scheme.  The cumulative value of payments made to employers under the scheme is &euro;936 million.  Last week, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection reported that it had issued payments valued at &euro;209.3 million to 598,000 people in respect of their application for the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment. </p>  <p>  The Government's roadmap for reopening society and economy sets out a five-stage plan to ease the Covid-19 restrictions.  As the Taoiseach has said, our objective is to help our country get through this emergency, rebuild our economy, get people back to work and keep them safe while doing so.  A key tool in achieving this objective is the return to work safely protocol I announced last Saturday.  This protocol clearly and comprehensively sets out the steps and processes employers and workers must take to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 in the workplace.  The protocol was developed and agreed in consultation with the members of the Labour Employer Economic Forum, the forum for high-level dialogue between the Government and union and employer representatives on labour market issues.  Participants in this process included IBEC, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, Chambers Ireland and the Construction Industry Federation.</p> <p>It is the result of a collaborative effort led by my Department and the Department of the Taoiseach involving the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, the Department of Health and the HSE.  Collaboration between employers and workers will be central to the success of our safe return to work.  That is why we have specified in the protocol that every employer should appoint at least one worker representative whose role is to work collaboratively with employers to assist in the measures to prevent Covid-19 and monitor their adherence in the workplace.</p> <p> The protocol applies to all workplaces across the economy.  Specific sectors may need to introduce additional safeguards, but this document sets the standard set of measures required in every workplace.  The HSA will take a collaborative approach in the first instance as it oversees implementation of the protocol.  Inspectors will provide advice and support to employers and employees on how they are implementing the Covid-19 measures in the workplace.  If necessary, they will also be able to visit the workplace and advise on any shortcomings through a report of inspection, which is left with the employer at the end of the visit and can include timelines and follow-ups needed.  They also have the power to serve an improvement notice, a legal directive from an inspector requiring that certain improvements be carried out in a specific timeframe, or a prohibition notice, a legal instruction directing that a specified work activity be stopped.</p> <p> Ultimately, if a business does not co-operate and comply with the public health guidelines after being asked to make improvements, the HSA will be able to order it to shut down the workplace.  I am confident that employers want their businesses to remain open and want to do the right things to protect and support their workers.  This document provides them with the know-how to ensure that they have a safe working environment for all.</p> <p> I am aware that many sectors have already developed detailed Covid-19 return-to-work plans that capture most, if not all, of the measures in the protocol, and I acknowledge and thank them for their work.  I acknowledge that many critical and essential businesses have continued to operate during the pandemic with the appropriate safeguards in place.</p> <p> The Government has announced a range of supports to assist businesses impacted by Covid-19.  I updated the House on 30 April with regard to the &euro;1 billion package of liquidity measures I announced in early April.  On 2 May, along with the Minister for Finance, I announced a number of additional measures to aid the economy as the Covid-19 restrictions start to be lifted.  These are part of an economic plan worth up to &euro;6.5 billion to help businesses impacted by Covid-19 and minimise the extent of the economic damage caused by the pandemic.</p> <p> These measures are a &euro;250 million fund to provide for the following: restart grants of up to &euro;10,000 for micro and small businesses; a three-month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses; a &euro;2 billion pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, which will make capital available to medium and large enterprises on commercial terms; a &euro;2 billion Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme to support lending to SMEs for terms ranging from three months to six years, which will be below market interest rates; and the warehousing of tax liabilities for a period of 12 months after recommencement of trading during which time there will be no debt enforcement action taken by Revenue and no interest charge accruing in respect of the warehoused debt.</p> <p> On 7 May, as part of the &euro;180 million sustaining enterprise fund, I announced that Enterprise Ireland will administer a specific sustaining enterprise fund for small businesses.  This fund will provide a &euro;25,000 to &euro;50,000 short-term funding injection to eligible smaller companies to strengthen their ability to return to growth.  Eligible companies will have suffered, or be projected to suffer, a 15% or more reduction in actual or projected turnover or profit as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak.  As I have said, all of these measures are in addition to those supports for business that I put in place at the start of this crisis.</p> <p>We now have a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes grants, low-cost loans, write-off of commercial rates, wage subsidies and deferred tax liabilities, all of which will help to improve cash flow among SMEs.  To date, the totality of the supports package the Government has put in place to help businesses and workers through Covid-19 amounts to &euro;12 billion.  These supports are designed to build confidence, further assist businesses in terms of the management of their companies and allow them to begin looking to the future and to start charting a path forward for the weeks and months ahead.</p> <p> I believe the new &euro;250 million restart fund will be a particular help to small businesses.  Following Government approval of funding for this scheme on 2 May, my officials have worked urgently with officials in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to develop the operational details of the scheme.  My priority is to ensure that it is a simple and straightforward application process so that small business can access the funding easily.  Grants up to a maximum of &euro;10,000 will be available under the scheme to assist small businesses with restocking, fixed costs and adhering to safety requirements.  I will be bringing a memo to the Government tomorrow seeking approval for the scheme and I will announce full details afterwards.</p> <p> I should also explain that, in addition to this, the full range of Enterprise Ireland, IDA, local enterprise office, LEO, and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta grant and advisory supports continue to be available to companies.  We will continue to seek the best ways of supporting people and wider society, and rebuilding the economy so that we can get people back to work safely.  We will do this by being cognisant of public health advice and doing what is in the best interests of all people.  Throughout this crisis, we have seen just how quickly businesses can change and adapt, whether that is restaurants switching to drive-through restaurants and using contactless payments for deliveries or Irish companies producing PPE to help with the global crisis.  We must always remember that the fundamentals of our economy were sound going into this crisis, so businesses can adjust and adapt to the new norm and, as Minister, I want to support them in doing that.</p> <p> Following the publication of the roadmap, many retailers have asked if they can open earlier than their scheduled phase, if they can meet the public health guidelines.  While I appreciate that they wish to get back to business as quickly as they can, all decisions on the timing of the modification or lifting of restrictions will be underpinned by public health advice.  As the Taoiseach said when announcing the roadmap, the Government continues to consider the broad range of public health, societal and economic impacts and options for the lifting of the current restrictions.  The roadmap is being kept under review and may be accelerated if the spread of Covid-19 is halted earlier than expected.</p> <p> I am aware some Deputies have had queries from businesses about when they can reopen.  Some people have even asked if an official licence is required before a business can reopen.  It is up to each individual business to review the roadmap and the Return to Work Safely Protocol carefully, carry out a detailed assessment of their activities with regard to the continuing public health advice, and decide which phase applies to them and, most importantly, if they will be in a position to reopen safely.  It is not necessary for businesses to seek official authorisation to reopen.</p> <p> I assure workers and employers that the Government is committed to ensuring that as the economy reopens, we will do everything we reasonably can to save those businesses that are viable.  As we unwind restrictions, we must do so in a way that supports our longer-term economic prospects.  Sectoral issues are being worked on at official level across relevant Departments.  We must also be mindful of the need to focus on economic recovery, an issue that I expect to be to the fore of any new Government's agenda.  The Irish people have made a real difference in the fight against Covid-19.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1596" speakername="Robert Troy" time="19:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400055#KKK00100"><p>I am sharing time with Deputies Butler, Flaherty and McAuliffe.  I will take six minutes and they will each take three.  We are acutely aware of the economic effects of Covid-19.  While public health is obviously the number one concern, if the right policy decisions are not made and the right supports are not put in place, we will not have an economy to ensure a sound public health system.  We know who is advising with regard to health.  Has a similar task force been established to advise on rebooting our economy?</p>  <p>  I will focus on a few issues.  Yesterday Lemon and Duke, a well-known pub here in the capital city, had to take a legal challenge in respect of a legitimate claim under its business interruption cover.  We wish its owners luck.  While they are fortunate enough to be in a position to take that challenge, what of the hundreds of SMEs that have legitimate business interruption cover but that cannot afford to take such a challenge?  When will the Government meet the CEOs of the insurance companies and tell them to adhere to the guidelines issued by the Central Bank, which recommend coming down on the side of the consumer wherever there is any doubt whatsoever?  The Minister might come back to me on that.</p>  <p>  I have raised the issue of trade credit with the Minister on a number of occasions.  It is critical to rebooting trading post-lockdown and is needed to restore market confidence.  Without Government intervention, it will be difficult for many of our SMEs to access credit.  Will the Minister provide an update as to where her Department is in this regard?</p>  <p>  She mentioned the restart fund in her contribution.  I welcome that, finally, two weeks after being announced we will know the details tomorrow but I am very worried about this fund.  I do not believe it will be adequate.  The circular issued to local authorities by the Minister's Department, or perhaps it was the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, suggested that the fund will be based on rates paid in 2019 up to a maximum of 10%.  In the Westmeath County Council area, the median rate paid in 2019 was &euro;1,900.  Under the Minister's scheme, 50% of businesses in Westmeath will be lucky enough to get &euro;1,900.  That is no laughing matter.  Across the Border and across the sea, the minimum grants are &pound;10,000.  How in the name of God can a small business restart with &euro;1,900?  It is not practical and it needs to be reassessed.  </p>  <p>  I have engaged with many industries and sectors over recent weeks.  Yesterday I spoke to the Hairdressing Council of Ireland.  Despite the return-to-work protocol, it still does not know what requirements will be placed on its members with regard to screens, PPE and so on.  They need time for a lead-in and to make modifications to their premises so that they can be ready when they are enabled to open.  There is no guidance in this respect.  They have been on to the HSA and the HSE but have received no guidance.  It is not good enough. </p>  <p>  The position is similar for the hospitality sector, including pubs and restaurants.  These businesses are still waiting for guidance on what they need to do and what modifications they need to make to ensure they comply with the restrictions being introduced.  I suggest that a task force or forum be established for the hospitality sector.  This would include representatives from the pub industry, the hotel industry, the restaurant industry and caf&eacute;s and would work under the leadership of the Minister's Department to bring forward clear protocols and guidelines as to how these businesses can operate safely.  </p>  <p>  Restrictions will undoubtedly make businesses that normally would have been profitable less so or even not profitable at all.  The measures that have been announced to date only offer businesses that are struggling further debt.  These businesses are struggling to repay some of their existing debt and we are offering them debt at interest rates of 4%, 4.5% and even 5%.  </p> <p>We need to review that again.  We need to review the wage subsidy scheme.  Can normally profitable businesses go back into operation and continue to pay this at a tapered rate?  As restrictions lift and as turnover increases and profitability rises, we can withdraw the wage subsidy.  It is crucial to look at that.</p> <p> According to the ESRI or the CSO, 400,000 people are better off receiving the weekly &euro;350 payment.  Some part-time workers, seasonal workers and reduced-hour workers are actually earning more now, which is proving a disincentive to certain people, making it difficult for certain industries to recruit staff.  How much longer will that category of people be in receipt of this payment?</p></speech>

The economic impact from the Covid outbreak has already been unprecedented.  Many businesses throughout the country have had to close their doors to adhere to public health advice to combat the spread of the virus.  Many supports, as the Minister has outlined, have been put in place with 590,000 receiving the pandemic unemployment payment and 452,000 employees receiving income support under the wage-subsidy scheme.  Everyone realises this is not sustainable and the objective now, adhering to health and safety guidelines, is to get our economy back to work.</p>  <p>  I was disappointed that the roadmap did not include any clear timeframe for manufacturing that is not deemed essential.  Many businesses, closed now for seven to eight weeks, may not be deemed essential during a pandemic.  However, they are deemed essential in the economy and to the region in which they are based.  Many businesses are concerned that if they have to wait for the various phases, they may not be able to reopen.</p>  <p>  Waterford is the county with the lowest number of people who contracted the virus per head of population.  We currently have one case being treated in University Hospital Waterford.  I thank everyone for their great work.  On a case-by-case basis, maybe a regional or a county basis depending on all the guidelines being adhered to, might some manufacturing businesses be allowed to open sooner than recommended in the roadmap in order to be viable and to secure the future of their business as they really feel it necessary to open to compete with other competitors worldwide that are operational?</p></speech>

It is not necessary for businesses to seek official authorisation to open.  Businesses should review the national return-to-work guidelines, which set out the steps businesses need to take.</p>  <p>  We are only at the very early stages of returning to work and we must be cautious.  We will keep the roadmap under review.  Deputy Butler raised particular issues with me offline and I hope to be able to resolve some of these issues next week,</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.181" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1597" speakername="Joe Flaherty" time="19:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400056#LLL00400"><p>Obviously, I welcome the suite of measures that have come on stream to support businesses emerging from the Covid crisis.  The measures are generic and broadly speaking do not address the fundamental threat which will be to rural Ireland, which undoubtedly faces the greatest threat in a post-Covid era.  A report from the three regional assemblies has highlighted that among the eight counties with the greatest potential impact from Covid are both Longford and Westmeath with 2,700 jobs potentially at risk.</p>  <p>  The Covid crisis comes fresh on the heels of Brexit and that is a fear that has not gone away.  The counties now grappling with the commercial reality of a post-Covid era are the same ones that were staring into the abyss at the prospect of a no-deal Brexit.</p> <p>Covid has hastened the pressure on many businesses.  Although corner shops and village filling stations have enjoyed something of a purple patch, there has been a massive shift to online shopping.  There is no doubt that a general reluctance to hurry back into retail and hospitality settings will make it very difficult for many rural businesses to return.  For big bars in Dublin, it might be an issue of whether they will get away with restricting numbers to a few hundred when they reopen, but the reality for many rural bars is whether it will be worth their while opening their doors.</p> <p> Small businesses need the start-up scheme, grants, wage subsidies and a break on rates.  Most of all, they need the money to come on stream quickly.  In that regard, I welcome the announcement today by the Minister that a memorandum to be released tomorrow will set out the detail of the business restart scheme.  I hope it will come in time for businesses that hope to reopen on Monday morning but are still unsure how they will make all the bills add up.</p> <p> There is a belt of rural counties, including my own county of Longford as well as counties Leitrim, Westmeath, Roscommon and Cavan, which need the greatest support of all.  I am conscious that we are in the throes of Government formation talks and much is made of balanced regional development and investment.  How this House targets supports for businesses and communities in a Covid recovery era will truly define the sincerity of the House and all parties herein with regard to rural Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.183" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="19:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400057#MMM00200"><p>I wish to acknowledge the work that has been done to support employment.  I look forward to the announcement to be made tomorrow.  We need to start looking at how to reopen our economy such that we can continue to protect employment.  Many older people have told me that when they came back into the world after weeks of cocooning they felt less confident and less safe.  Employers, employees and consumers will have a similar feeling and it will impact on our economic recovery.  If we fail to give leadership, support and reassurance, our recovery will be stilted.  I acknowledge that the advice from NPHET has ensured a slow and steady approach to opening.  We also need to give confidence to people.  When public health advice allows permitted activities, consumers need to be encouraged to support those employers.  People's mindsets have been locked down and it will take Government action and intervention in order to unlock those mindsets.</p>  <p>  We need to provide additional supports.  The wage subsidy scheme put ground under the feet of many small businesses.  However, as they reach the end of that scheme with limited working capital, they face the dilemma of whether they will be forced to let go the staff who they were able to retain.  Employers, particularly small businesses, need an off-ramp to the wage subsidy scheme.  The key lies in working capital.  Employers may have retained employment but they have depleted their working capital.  The owners of most small businesses such as corner shops, caf&eacute;s and independent restaurants typically have very limited working capital.  They cannot scale their business beyond the four walls they rent and, as such, a pool of cash is rarely available.  In its latest policy document report responding to Covid-19, Dublin Chamber outlined that one third of businesses in Dublin city have less than three months of cash reserves.  These small businesses often struggle to secure working capital.  It can be almost impossible to do so without providing personal guarantees which often include the family home.  I look forward to announcements in that area to support these small businesses. </p>  <p>  Employers need to be able to avail of a phasing-out of the wage subsidy scheme that is relevant to their sector.  They do not want a handout, but the Government needs to look at a flexible approach to this scheme, other cash supports and the collection of taxes, particularly VAT.  This needs to be done over the whole financial year.</p>  <p>  Although it does not fall immediately under the Minister's brief, many of those availing of the back to work enterprise allowance scheme of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection have spent months or years working towards self-employment and feel like they are back at square one after Covid-19.  They are too small to access meaningfully many of the supports which have been outlined.</p>  <p>A small restart grant would ensure that we have their back.  I ask the Minister to have the backs of all these businesses in the post-Covid-19 phase.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.185" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1497" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="19:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400058#NNN00200"><p>Two weeks ago I raised with the Minister my concerns about the SME loan schemes offered by the Government.  I was hopeful at the time that she would take on board the suggestions put forward by me and other Deputies.  Looking at the new schemes announced on 2 May, however, it is clear that our suggestions fell on deaf ears.  The new loan schemes serve the interests of private finance and corporate landlords rather than SMEs, which are the lifeblood of this State's economy and indeed our communities.  We are seeing more repackaging of, and fiddling with, existing funds and schemes and that is just not going to cut it.  There are five loan schemes now, three currently in operation and two more requiring legislation to get them off the ground.  I discussed the three existing schemes the last time I spoke and will not repeat myself.  What is clear, however, is that these schemes are not fit for purpose and what is needed are interest-free loans that are easily accessible to SMEs now.  Both of the new loan schemes announced on 2 May will require legislation and will not be available any time soon, which is of little use to businesses facing this crisis now.  The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, through the pandemic stabilisation and recovery fund, will provide &euro;2 billion of ISIF funding for enterprises that employ more than 250 people, that have a turnover in excess of &euro;50 million and have been impacted by the pandemic.  The criteria require that all investments must yield a commercial and economic impact return in line with ISIF's statutory requirements and the enterprise must present viable business models in the medium to long term.  It is hard to see how this scheme relates to the Covid-19 crisis.  I have no idea what it brings to the table to help the tens of thousands of businesses suffering hardships due to the restrictions.</p>  <p>  There is also the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme.  Two weeks ago, I called on the Minister to amend the scheme to reflect the needs of SMEs, which means a 100% State guarantee and zero interest.  That has not happened, meaning that thousands of enterprises will not be able to avail of these loans and the Minister is aware of that, given the low take-up.  In terms of grants there was finally an announcement of a restart fund for micro and small businesses.  Does the Minister have a date for when those grants will be available and could she inform us of that?  Some businesses are opening next week, some a few weeks later.  They need clarity.  There is very little detail available at present regarding the re-start grants other than the fact that the Minister has linked them to the rates from last year which have no bearing whatsoever on restarting up costs.  It also clear that the numbers do not stack up.  The fund offers grants of up to &euro;10,000, or at least that is what the Minister said when she launched her business proposals.  The total fund is &euro;250 million.  If every business that applied needed the full &euro;10,000, and bearing in mind that Chambers Ireland estimated that the average restart cost per firm would be between &euro;26,000 and &euro;32,000, only 25,000 firms would be able to get that grant from Government.  The Central Bank had estimated that there are almost 96,000 firms in highly affected sectors and more than 128,000 firms in moderately affected sectors making a total of businesses potentially needing restart grants of almost 250,000.  That is almost ten times the number of businesses provided for by the Government's scheme.  The Minister needs to show leadership on this as thousands of businesses and hundreds of thousands of workers are relying on her.  Their very livelihoods are in the balance and they are depending on the Minister to bring forth the solutions that will help them.  Thus far, the solutions she has brought forth are neither fit for purpose nor good enough.  </p>  <p>  Last week the Minister launched the Return to Work Safety Protocol.  I agree that all those changes are necessary but we need specific legal protections relating to Covid-19. </p> <p>Protocols are just protocols.  We cannot have things the way they were before, when businesses could pick and choose whether they recognised trade unions.  The protocol says that each workplace will appoint at least one lead worker representative to ensure that Covid-19 measures are strictly adhered to in their place of work.  The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 needs to be amended accordingly.  It also needs to be updated to allow trade union representatives to meet their members in the workplace to discuss health and safety issues.  It cannot be left to one person alone on the shop floor to take on a reckless employer.  As the Minister with responsibility for business, the Minister should know that.</p> <p> It is no good telling us that the Health and Safety Authority will do inspections.  In 2018, it managed to inspect only 914 retail and wholesale premises and only 195 food and accommodation workplaces.  There are more than 280,000 businesses in this State, all of which must be subject to Covid-19 regulations in law, not just in a protocol.  </p> <p> I also appeal to the Minister regarding the announcement of 176 job losses announced at National Pen in Dundalk on 8 May, a decision that workers had no prior knowledge of whatever.  On 10 May, workers alerted my colleague, Deputy Ruair&iacute; &Oacute; Murch&uacute;, and me to the fact that the company had advertised 100 European language jobs on their Tunisian website in the week prior to the Dundalk announcement.  Teachta &Oacute; Murch&uacute; and I have written to National Pen seeking clarity on why the company claims that a major downturn in its market due to the coronavirus is the cause of the job losses, yet it appears to be recruiting in a lower wage economy in north Africa.  It is sickening that a company that has received  &euro;1.5 million in grant aid in the past five years from IDA Ireland can move jobs from Irish towns and cities to cheaper locations with impunity, in this case using the coronavirus as an excuse.  National Pen does not recognise unions - surprise, surprise - leaving staff in a vulnerable negotiating position when dealing with management.  The Minister has a responsibility to intervene and explore all available avenues to try to rescue these jobs.  </p> <p> I know the Minister will not have time to answer my questions, certainly in the detail that I seek, so I ask that she respond to me in writing in the next few days. </p></speech>

My first question is about the role of the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, in policing workforces for compliance with public health guidelines in regard to Covid-19.  As she knows, everyone is deeply concerned that the HSA will not be sufficiently resourced to handle the massive task it will be asked to do.  I welcome the comments made earlier this afternoon by An Taoiseach when he acknowledged that the HSA will need additional staff and resources.  Will the Minister provide the House with information on the extra funding she will be providing to the HSA?  How many additional inspectors would be employed under her plans?  Is she satisfied that the HSA has the powers required to achieve those objectives?</p>  <p>  The second issue is about the Minister's plan in the joint document between Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il about the introduction of a living wage.  Although it is a welcome departure from the Minister's previous conservative position, I am concerned about the lack of detail and commitment to the proposals.  This week, we have seen the Small Firms Association and IBEC call for a freeze on any increase in the national minimum wage for the next few years and oppose the introduction of a living wage.  Those organisations deal with the Minister's Department all the time.  That is the reason I am asking her about the Government's position.  The approach from those two organisations is disgraceful as the past few months have shown just how vital workers who earn the minimum wage are to our society.  To clap for front-line workers one day and turn around the next and say they do not deserve a wage that will let them afford the basic day-to-day necessities is the worst type of hypocrisy.  Business can recover while paying their staff a decent wage.  It is not a case of one or the other.  Sinn F&eacute;in completely rejects this approach from the Small Firms Association and IBEC.  What is the Government's position?  Have the Small Firms Association and IBEC raised this with the Minister and what has she told them?  I am aware they have been meeting the Minister.</p></speech>

It is recognised that the HSA will need additional resources to oversee compliance with the Covid-19 Return to Work Safely Protocol.  It is also recognised that relevant officers of other Departments and agencies, together with the Health and Safety Authority, will need to oversee compliance.  The necessary resources will certainly be made available to the HSA.  I want to compliment the HSA on the work it has done in putting together the Return to Work Protocol.  It has worked very closely with the HSE and all the employer representatives, including IBEC, ICTU, the CIF and also with Chambers Ireland.  It has done a lot of work in that regard.  There are very clear processes around when the HSA get a complaint.  I have no doubt that it will get all the resources it needs to carry out this very important work.</p></speech>

I want to know the number of inspectors in the HSA.  I refer to enforcement of the new regulations that have been put in place, and I commend everybody who was involved, including the trade union movement, in putting them in place.</p> <p>Those regulations are ineffective if we do not have enough inspectors, so I would like to know how many inspectors the HSA has, or if resources will be given to recruit additional inspectors to enable it to do the job.</p></speech>

The protocol that has been developed is very much about employers and employees working together in order that the right safety measures are put in place to give both staff and employers the confidence to go back to work.  In fairness to a lot of employers right across this country, they closed down quickly to protect their staff and have been working very closely with the HSA.  I am satisfied that the majority of employers will do the right thing but if the HSA needs to take action regarding some employers that may not adhere to the guidelines, it has the necessary powers to do so.</p></speech>

First, I congratulate and thank the Minister and her colleagues for the measures already taken in containing the virus, particularly in preparing for the restart of our economy, which is the next most important phase.  We need to keep a number of things in mind.  First, we tend to refer to the businesses that might not open their doors again.  We should refrain from using that phrasing as much as possible because plenty of people, including the lending institutions, will seize upon that opportunity to say that because those people's businesses are no longer viable they do not count.  We need to be careful because that will have an ongoing negative impact on our economy at a time when we cannot afford it.</p>  <p>  I will briefly mention one of the queries I have received regarding the restart of business and the reopening of pubs, clubs, hotels etc.  The one thing that has been brought to my attention is that they need to be given a fair chance to open simultaneously, in order that nobody gets a head start on their neighbour and puts them at a disadvantage.  That is a natural thing in business but when the reopening starts it should be done in a way that is fair and equal to all.</p>  <p>  The other issue that came to my attention this morning was that of a haulier who has been in business for many years.  He is over 70, has his own pension to which he contributed himself, and is a sole trader.  He received communication from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to the effect that he could no longer operate.  That was a ridiculous decision because he was operating quite well and doing his business the same as he always did, with no impediment to the delivery of his business at all.  I ask the Minister to be alert to that kind of thing, which causes unnecessary stress and strain.  That businessman has trucks, insurance, tax and his vehicles are now idle just because someone made that decision. </p></speech>

The warehousing of tax liabilities and the supports through the local enterprise offices are very welcome, as they are important for the smaller businesses which make up a large proportion of our economy.  In her opening statement, the Minister mentioned that it was not necessary for businesses to receive official authorisation to reopen.  It is important that we clarify that.  Hoteliers, for example, are concerned about family events and weddings.  Is it the case that if they can satisfactorily implement social distancing requirements and put those safeguards in place, they can base their capacity on that?  I would also be grateful for more clarity on hair salons and barbers, though the plan is very detailed.  The credit scheme and other supports are welcome as it is important that we support businesses.  The next Government will have a huge task in avoiding a two-speed recovery and ensuring our regional areas get key supports and interventions.  I have received many queries regarding women on maternity leave who have missed the wage subsidy scheme but I appreciate that may require primary legislation and a new Government may be needed to implement some of those changes.  To provide support for 1 million people in our State<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the Covid payment and the wage subsidy scheme in such a short timeframe is a massive achievement by the Government.</p></speech>

She is bringing a memo to Cabinet tomorrow.  When does she expect the scheme to be announced, when does she anticipate people being able to apply for the scheme and how quickly will rebates be made because businesses, certainly in Limerick and north Tipperary, are asking specifically about how the scheme will operate in practice?</p>  <p>  The Minister said people can judge based on the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business as to when they can reopen.  There is a need for a one-stop-shop that businesses can ring with queries in this area in terms of clarification as distinct from decisions being made.  Where are we with regard to that one-stop-shop being established?  </p>  <p>  I believe there is a need for particular recovery action plans at local authority level.  I put a ten-point action recovery plan to Limerick City and County Council where the council would deal with specifics, set up its own one-stop-shop and look at what it can do with remote working, how businesses will open and what it will do with streets so we can deal with social distancing.  Would the Minister support such an idea in terms of getting down?  It has the added advantage of enhancing balanced regional development.</p></speech>

One area on which I wish to focus is the rural economy, particularly farming.  It is great to see that the marts will open up in June.  There are many issues regarding rates, insurance and the costs the marts will have to bear.  What dialogue has taken place with the marts' managers and the marts' representative bodies to achieve this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.243" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="20:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400062#RRR00300"><p>The restart fund will be open next week.  I know businesses that are anxious to open will want to access that fund as quickly as possible.  It must get approval from the Government but I am satisfied that businesses will welcome this fund because I understand that they have overhanging costs from the shutdown.  It will give them that leg up and the encouragement some of them might need to get started again.</p>  <p>  I would encourage all sectors to prepare for reopening, examine the protocol and determine what it means for each sector.  The roadmap is clear on the timelines so each business needs to look at where it fits on that roadmap.  If all goes well, they could move ahead.  However, there is also the risk of a setback and we must always be very conscious so we must do this on a phased basis.  </p>  <p>  Regarding the one-stop-shop, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has a helpline that is available to anybody who wants to contact it.  Deputy Kieran O'Donnell mentioned each region doing something.  I would suggest that they do it through the regional enterprise plans.  I think this is the best structure that is there at the minute.  It is working well.  I know the one in Limerick is particularly successful.  The Deputy's idea is a good one but businesses should use the structure of the regional enterprise forum to do that.  </p>  <p>  Marts are reopening and are in phase 2.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is very engaged with the sector.  I know they are currently online so they are keen to get back to the marts.  </p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland has set up a Covid-19 industry advisory group that meets weekly.  The purpose of this group is to provide support to the tourism industry, which we all know has been badly affected.</p> <p>This forum facilitates the sharing of information and insight to help to improve the sector's understanding and the response to the crisis.  There is also a business support hub that was set up by F&aacute;ilte Ireland which offers a suite of targeted supports for businesses in the tourism sector to enable them to respond to the challenges.  Of course, the hospitality sector can access all of the supports that are available through my Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.245" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="20:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400063#SSS00200"><p>Mr. Paddy Shaffrey's 1975 book <i>The Irish Town: An Approach to Survival</i>was decades ahead of its time.  It was only in recent years that policymakers began to look seriously at the challenges facing Irish market towns and to consider the potential they have as economic engines and drivers of rural hinterlands.  What is also evident from Paddy's visionary publication is how much we have lost of our built heritage, the vernacular and unique character of the Irish towns, and how we deliberately and maliciously hollowed them out to exploit car-centred development on the peripheries.  Now, thanks to the great work of organisations such as The Heritage Council, we are beginning to look anew at our towns and how they could provide us with solutions to the challenges we are facing.</p><p>Yesterday, my colleague, Deputy Joe O'Brien, asked the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to issue guidance to local authorities to allocate road space and budgets towards active travel, cycling and walking.  It is time to get our towns ready for a grand revival.  In adding to the discussion which took place yesterday, I wish to raise with the Minister the enterprise and job creation role of our unique market towns and how they can again become just that.  If the alarming and unsustainable retail vacancy rates in our regional towns pre-Covid-19 were not sufficient to exercise the collective minds of policymakers and planners, surely what is about to follow when restrictions are lifted should.  In our view, there would appear to be no clarity of thought as to the future of our urban centres and no vision as to the use of civic spaces.  Local authorities need to be adequately resourced and equipped with the right set of policy tools to unlock their potential.</p><p>Our small towns could well be key to realising the potential of tens of thousands of SMEs, our craft and creative sector, sustainable living, food innovation, culture and the arts, co-operative living spaces and digital enterprise.  The establishment of a town centre regeneration unit to drive the heritage-led regeneration of our town centres must be a priority for the next Government.  Every town should embark on a collaborative town centre health check to build capacity, share knowledge and best practice, and learn from mistakes.  It should be the default means of pooling resources to get the best out of the people who have an interest in the future of our towns.  We can no longer turn our backs on our unique Irish towns.  Indeed, combining technology and traditional building skills could provide thousands of creative and meaningful jobs for young people.</p><p>I have a number of questions for the Minister.  Can we unlock the potential of derelict public buildings in our town centres that could be in the ownership of State agencies such as An Post and repurpose them as innovation hubs or centres for crafts at low or minimal rents?  We see this as a means of bringing life back into our town centres.  </p><p>In my own home town of Kilkenny, Cartoon Saloon started off as a group of young people with drawing pads and an abundance of creativity.  Now, animation provides more than 400 jobs in our town centre.  The saloon has been nominated four times for Academy Awards and is keeping our town centre vibrant with an influx of animators from all over the world.</p><p>Animation production companies, such as Cartoon Saloon and Lighthouse Studios in Kilkenny, have largely maintained 100% full employment during the Covid-19 crisis and have not had access to the employment supports introduced by the Government.  In light of this, would the Government look at enhancing some of the supports currently in place for animation companies, particularly those in the regions?  In the Finance Act 2018, the Government made provision for a short-term, tapered, regional film development uplift.  The assistance took a long time to put in place and a very small number of projects have been approved for uplift.  Anecdotally, I have heard that, for many production companies, it is time consuming and heavy on administration to make applications.  The feedback from producers is that the rules are vague and unusual in their interpretation and do not seem to be applied as was intended, or in the spirit of the legislation, or indeed as being marketed internationally by national agencies.</p><p>On top of the time lost in the introduction of uplift, which could be nearly six months, producers could lose another year with this pandemic and with costs only increasing from changes in work practices as a result of Covid-19.  Will the Minister consider maintaining the regional uplift indefinitely as part of the supports under section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act and consider not tapering off the reliefs after 2020 but maintaining the uplift at 5% on a permanent basis?  Will the Minister confirm how many applications for regional uplift have been received and how many have been approved to date?</p> <p>Will she outline any other supports that are planned or intended for the animation sector, which is maintaining crucial jobs in a time of great uncertainty in both large urban centres and the regions?  I do not expect a detailed response to these questions today.</p> <p> Finally, is the Minister aware of businesses being unable to access the temporary wage subsidy scheme due to issues with filing amendments?  Can Revenue be given some leniencies in this regard to deal with businesses on a case-by-case basis?  Has the Minister any plans in place specifically to assist cottage industries?  We have received correspondence from owners of these generally family-run businesses who are particularly impacted by the Covid-19 crisis and have small or no cash reserves.</p></speech>

In terms of town planning, I certainly would encourage a partnership approach to town development.  I agree with much of what the Deputy said regarding the need to create more activity in our town centres.  The face of shopping is changing and, after the Covid-19 crisis has passed, I think we will find that more and more people are shopping online, which will have a direct, knock-on effect on the retail sector, including town-centre shops.  We have been providing online vouchers for businesses right across the country.  They can get a grant of &euro;2,500 from the local enterprise office to set up online, and a second grant is also available for this purpose.  Retailers should be using all of the supports that are currently available because they can help them to establish a strong online presence while still being able to maintain a presence in the centre of town, which is important.</p>  <p>  I have been working through the regional enterprise plans to encourage centre-of-town co-working spaces.  There may be opportunities in that regard for old buildings to be renovated and turned into digital hubs.  There is no reason that we cannot do these sorts of things.  The Department has a guide for town development, combining the retail, business and craft sectors.  The chambers of commerce have been very effective in putting together plans around town development.  As I said, under the regional enterprise development fund, a number of different grants have been paid out to various areas to set up hubs and co-working spaces.  Those initiatives will be even more important as we look at the potential of remote working.  It is good to be at home to work for some part of the day, if it suits a person, but I think it is healthier to have co-working spaces.  I have been advocating remote working in these areas for some time but, all of a sudden, what was a foreign concept has become a reality.  Remote working offers a much better quality of life and is useful in terms of reducing carbon emissions and ensuring people do not have to sit in long commutes.  They may be able to walk or cycle to work.  We must have a plan in place and really look at how we can improve quality of life for people by bringing the jobs closer to where they live.  Remote working will be a game changer in that regard.</p>  <p>  Regarding the animation sector in Ireland, having formerly been Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, I am very proud of that extremely successful sector.  I led a trade mission last year to the west coast of the United States, which promoted the Irish animation industry.  Enterprise Ireland works closely with the sector and Screen Ireland is also involved.  The animation industry is a priority under the Creative Ireland programme and the section 481 provisions have been very successful.  The regional uplift aspect has been particularly successful, as seen with Troy Studios in Limerick and a number of others.  The Deputy mentioned Cartoon Saloon, which is a wonderful company.  I was delighted to facilitate some of the meetings which led to the company signing contracts during a trade mission to China.  As the Deputy noted, the company is located in the centre of Kilkenny and employs a significant number of people.  Thankfully, it has not been impacted by the Covid-19 situation.</p> <p>Again, we want to see more of those companies and we will do everything we can to support them because they have high-quality jobs, which is what we all want.  I thank the Deputy for all of his questions.</p></speech>

Some weeks ago, that well-known left-wing firebrand, the deputy governor of the Central Bank, stated that we should be wary of socialising the costs of the private sector, whether it is big business, banks or landlords, while profits continue to be privatised.  Yet the Covid-19 business package announced by the Minister a number of weeks ago, and updated just two weeks ago, has a noticeable lack of any social or environmental conditionality attached to those mechanisms.  In many ways, the Minister has done very little, through the leverage she has, to advance the idea that a post-Covid Ireland would be any better than what has gone before.  This goes against the EU grain.  Countries right across Europe have attached conditionality to very substantial taxpayer and citizen supports to businesses at risk.</p><p>The case of National Pen in Dundalk illustrates and provides an example of this.  It has dishonestly deployed the pretext of the Covid-19 pandemic to essentially gut jobs from its facility in Dundalk and transfer them to low-wage economies elsewhere.  This company, as the Minister knows, received up to &euro;1.5 million in grants from the IDA between 2015 and 2019.  As the Minister might be aware, this week I wrote to her directly and I understand the workers of National Pen in Dundalk, some of whom she represents because they are resident in the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, require some answers to the questions I put to her.</p><p>I will reprise some of those questions.  When, under the statutory obligation for the company to notify the Minister of collective redundancies, did it alert her to its intention to introduce collective redundancies at the facility?  Will the Minister call on National Pen in Dundalk to suspend the consultation process which started in earnest today, in the context of the Covid-19 restrictions?  Will she instruct the company to do what the Labour Court has asked it to do, namely, allow SIPTU to represent professionally the interests of the staff during the statutory consultation period?</p><p>The Minister will recall that a similar case was made by Mandate Trade Union in terms of the suspension of the liquidation and statutory consultation process around collective redundancies in Debenhams.  It is practically impossible to have a meaningful consultation process between workers, trade unions and employers given the current restrictions.  One cannot have a meaningful consultation about the future of one's job via Microsoft Teams.</p><p>On conditionality, we have to ask ourselves whether the taxpayer should now foot the bill for private companies, some of which have been knocking on the Minister's door to look for grant and loan assistance, have evaded tax, are exploiting workers' rights and have, thus far, eluded the obligation to recognise trade unions.  Some have, in fact, made an art form of giving the two fingers to the industrial relations mechanisms of the State.  For example, we now have a plethora of hospitality sector actors who have a path worn to the door of the Minister and to everybody else looking for a 0% VAT rate, when they are the very same people who actively campaigned to ensure this Government continued to allow them to have a veto over the operation of the joint labour committee system that would deliver decent pay, terms and conditions to their workers.  There should not be corporate welfare without respect for the welfare of the citizen, through collective bargaining rights for workers.</p><p>We know that our domestic economic sector requires support, and I support that, but the Minister and her Government colleagues need to use the leverage they now have to make sure we do not go back to the <i>status quo</i>.  Will the Minister commit to ensuring employers in receipt of public support will be obliged to recognise the Labour Court and the WRC, implement their recommendations and recognise workers' rights to collective bargaining?</p><p>Many of the Covid-19 business supports have been inadequate in terms of their scale.</p> <p>I have some concerns, and I have said this before in the media and this House, about the speed and bureaucratic stringency around the allocation of funds to businesses that need those resources now.  I am glad the Minister addressed the situation regarding the maximum &euro;10,000 grant.  That can present an important lifeline to our high streets and I look forward to reading the detail.  The Minister knows, however, that it is confidence that businesses need.  People preparing to open their doors need confidence that the State is there to support them and provide them with the resources and cash flow required.  I am looking forward to an update on that tomorrow.</p> <p> I turn now to the question of insurance.  I think the Minister will accept that insurance indemnity will be crucial to assist in the reopening of our economy and individual businesses.  We have already seen the childcare scheme for front-line workers killed off just last night because of an inability of providers to acquire cover.  This sets a very dangerous precedent and illustrates what we already know.  A dangerous situation is now facing us.  There is a real risk to the success of the Minister's, and our, plans to reopen this economy and that threat is posed by the behaviour of the insurance companies.  I would like to hear the Minister's plans to resolve this insurance indemnity issue with her Cabinet colleagues.  I accept the Minister does not have full direct responsibility for the insurance sector, but it is important she consider the Labour Party's proposal to use the State Claims Agency, SCA, in respect of indemnities for businesses.</p> <p> My last point concerns the welcome production of protocols regarding the reopening of the economy and the return of citizens to work.  We will need a strong and robust inspection and compliance regime from the HSA. Those found to be breaking the rules must face the full force of the law.  Any issues with compliance should be treated in the same way as a company responsible for a chemical spill.  It should be closed.  The owners of such companies cannot be allowed to put the health of their workers, the general public and themselves at risk.  As Patricia King of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, has said, these rules are mandatory.  There is not a menu of options that businesses can select from, these rules are mandatory and there needs to be compliance with them.  </p> <p> From figures released in recent days, I know some 200 complaints about breaches of the Covid-19 guidelines had been received by the HSA.  Worryingly, none has resulted in inspections.  We need to see an improvement on that and we need to see a new momentum behind this approach on foot of the protocols published just a few days ago.  I have been pointing out this lacuna in regulation for some time now and I am glad some efforts are being made to address this issue.  We look forward to seeing how this develops.  Workers need to have full confidence that when they make complaints to the HSA those complaints will be followed up.  Can the Minister guarantee the House that workers making complaints about the conduct of their employers, and issues concerning their workplaces, will be free from victimisation?  Will those workers be protected from victimisation in the same way as the law protects those workers engaging with their trade unions for collective bargaining, as well as those workers who use the protection of whistleblowers' legislation to advance their rights?  </p> <p> I understand that the HSA only has about 100 inspectors available.  That is a major deficiency.  Some 100 inspectors alone will not be sufficient to police this protocol and ensure its implementation.  Is the Minister planning to move public servants from other agencies?  Will the Minister, if she has the opportunity, elaborate on what training will be provided to those public servants and when they will be in the field?  </p></speech>

I appreciate fully how difficult the situation is for those involved and their families.  Please be assured that Government supports are in place to help them through this time.  I am especially aware also that at a time when mobility is restricted, employees do not have the same easy access to their support networks and representatives.  I wanted to just say that.</p>  <p>  The IDA is working very closely with the company.</p> <p>Obviously, there is a process here but the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection will be there to provide all the supports it can to those workers.  The Deputy asked about the alert.  The alert is made now directly to the Department of Employment and Social Protection.  Then it was advised to my Department.  I got notification from IDA Ireland as well about the matter because it is doing everything it can to assist.</p> <p> The Deputy mentioned the HSA.  The HSA protocols have been drawn up in collaboration with the employers' groups and the unions.  I thank ICTU, IBEC, Chambers Ireland and the Construction Industry Federation, all of which came together to make sure that all of the issues that had been brought to their attention were included in this protocol.  The protocol is about how we can given confidence to the employees that it is safe to go back and to the employers that they are putting the right processes in place to protect their workers.  The Deputy will accept that there were many employers that closed down early.  They did not have to close down but they were concerned about their workers.  We must acknowledge, too, that there will be many employers and employees who will work together and find the right solution.  At the end of the day most people want to get back to work and want to get back to normality.</p> <p> I can also confirm to the Deputy that the HSA will have the necessary powers to take action in cases where it must take action.  Initially, they want to work with the employers because there are new processes here that they have not had to comply with previously.  I would say, "Work together first," but if there are issues where there is non-compliance, the HSA has the full powers to apply to Covid-19 situations as it has to any other situation.</p> <p> The Deputy asked me about staff.  The HSA will get more resources.  If the authority needs more funding or staff, there are staff in other Departments and other agencies that can be moved over to work with the HSA.  It is about working together on this matter.</p></speech>

It is intended that phase 1 will happen on Monday and provisions must be in place for Monday.  I was told by the Taoiseach that I would be better to address it to Deputy Humphreys because she is the line Minister.  I refer to the specific information on the number of staff who will be enforcing this.  I accept there are many good employers with which there will not be an issue and with which this will work well but, equally, there will be others.  If we do not spend the time and effort and the money on this, we will spend it on the front line in the hospitals.  We must get this right.  If phase 1 does not roll out properly, phases 2, 3, 4 and 5 will not roll out properly because it is spaced for that reason.  The Minister needs to give us specific information on the number of staff and the kind of resources that will be available.</p>  <p>  The other point I want to make in relation to the construction sector is there are elements of the construction sector that are not under the remit of the Construction Industry Federation, CIF.  They would have self-employed people because that is the kind of work available to many in the construction sector.  There will be elements of the construction sector that will not be linked in in that same way and that needs to be considered.</p>  <p>  I will move on to a few other points.  The Minister has told us that businesses need to be working on preparing to open.  Some of them are still guessing what that means.  I accept there is a roadmap and there are guidance documents but, as I have raised with the Minister previously, some of those need to be bespoke as opposed to general.  For example, some of them will probably have to open on a phased basis.  That needs to be taken into consideration, for example, building up clientele because not everybody works out of a physical building.  For those who work out of a physical building, what support grants are available, for example, for such items as Perspex and personal protection equipment, PPE, which allow for reopening?</p> <p>For many businesses such as hairdressers and caf&eacute;s, the flow of people through the door may be greatly reduced because of the number that can be accommodated.  That will have an impact on turnover but the overheads will not decrease.  Will a specific approach be taken to consider that side of things?</p> <p> I wish to ask the Minister about upward-only rent reviews, which we are still seeing in the city centre and in other locations.  I take the point concerning a plan for each town.  We have to reimagine things differently.  The last thing we want is to lose the vibrancy from our city and town centres.  Because of upward-only rent reviews we could lose the artisan shops and independent coffee shops, the kind of things that create vibrancy.</p> <p> I refer to planning and the hospitality sector.  Are people planning for a 2 m distance or a 1 m distance?  People might want to spend their time working on things, but they have to know what they are working on if things are to work out.  The Minister might give us some idea of the distance reduction so there can be a little more certainty in that regard.</p> <p> The Covid-19 payment is a very good initiative and keeps people attached to their employment.  I remember going on about this ten years ago.  This is how Germany responds to a downturn in order to get people back to work very quickly.  The idea is very good, but several people have told me that they are worried about it.  I really am all in favour of transparency but I note that employers do not really want to be on Revenue's list for anything.  They are concerned about being on a Revenue list for having received Covid-19 payments for their staff.  Is that likely to happen?  It has been raised with me a few times.  I do not think they mind being listed, but to be on a Revenue list would be a concern.  Will the Minister address those queries?</p></speech>

The protocol we launched on Saturday is a very good one.  It provides a lot of information on how businesses can prepare to get back to work.  They need to look at the things they have to do.  For example, each workplace will appoint one lead worker representative.  These representatives will be able to work with employers to ensure Covid-19 measures are in place.  There is a lot of very simple stuff in it about washing hands, good coughing and sneezing etiquette and staying apart.  Deputy Murphy mentioned distance.  The protocol provides that "In settings where 2 metre worker separation cannot be ensured by organisational means, alternative protective measures should be put in place".  For example, businesses may have to "Install physical barriers, such as clear plastic sneeze guards between workers"; "Maintain at least a distance of 1 metre or as much distance as is reasonably practicable"; and "Minimise any direct worker contact and provide hand washing facilities, and other hand hygiene aids, such as hand sanitisers, wipes etc. that are readily accessible".</p>  <p>  There are a lot of provisions in the protocol.  I am telling businesses to get the protocol and read it.  Managers should look at it to find out they need to do in their own specific businesses.  They will get a lot of information there.  If they have any doubts, they can ring the HSA, officials from which will be happy to talk to them and provide guidance.  I am hearing a lot about implementation, the need to enforce the law and so on.  A lot of employers out there want to do the right thing and make sure they have the right procedures in place to protect their workers.</p> <p>The wage subsidy scheme is particularly good.  As workers return to the workplace, the employer will get that subsidy.  The Deputy is right that it is great that we have it now for this crisis.  It will be paid until 16 June.  If one is an early mover and gets back fairly early, one will get the benefit of having up to 85% of one's wages paid to the employer.  That in itself is a cash injection.  I know the Deputy is anxious to get in.</p></speech>

If I ask questions, I am happy to have them answered in writing if I run out of time.  I cannot believe the answer that Deputy Humphreys has just given to Deputy Catherine Murphy.  It is outrageous.  The Minister patronised her for a good section of the time by telling her that this document I am holding tells a person how to sneeze, how to distance, how to mask up and use PPE.  We have been listening to that for eight weeks, and in the course of those eight weeks, many Deputies in this House have been inundated with complaints from workers about the lack of protocol and safety on their sites.</p>  <p>  I asked the Minister at the beginning of this month for a list of the number of complaints to the Health and Safety Authority and the Minister told me there were 122.  The Minister wrote to Deputy Paul Murphy yesterday and told him there were 200.  In her answer, the Minister states that it has not been necessary for the Health and Safety Authority to carry out any physical inspections.  How did it know if it did not perform inspections?  Did it pick up the phone and ask the employer how it is getting on, and whether it knows about sneezing, masking, PPE and distancing?  If the Minister asks me, that is what this document states.</p>  <p>  We have all waited with bated breath for this, having asked the Minister what she is going to do about the lack of protocol at work.  We got that document and it is what the Minister just said, and it is full of caveats.  There are two parallel universes here.  There is the world that workers live in and there is the world that the Minister, the Construction Industry Federation and IBEC live in-----</p></speech>

I want to tell the Minister why they are different.  She should read the article in today's edition of <i>The Guardian</i>about workers in the meat factories.  I hope it pulls the strings of the Minister's heart, because it pulls mine when one listens to those workers talking about the experience they have been through.  At least one worker has died and hundreds have been infected.  According to the article in <i>The Guardian</i>:</p> <blockquote> 	&ldquo;One hundred per cent, I know I got it in the factory,&rdquo; [one worker said]  &ldquo;If the disease was in the animals, they&rsquo;d have closed the place.  But for workers, the factories can do what they want.&rdquo;  </blockquote> <p>These workers feel intimidated.  They are vulnerable and they are not being treated with dignity and respect.  There is no checking of temperature, no masks, no 2 m distancing and when they asked for masks they were told, "No".  Many of them are migrants and because of the low pay, they live in communal housing and the risk of the disease spreading among them is very great indeed.</p> <p> Today, I got a response from the HSE, which tells me it set up an outbreak control team in the meat industry this day one week ago and it has met once.  I am disturbed by the lack of urgency from the Department on workers' rights.  The Minister can talk all she likes about the need for industry and businesses to resume.  I agree that they do need to resume.  I know tens of thousands of workers are anxious to get back to work, but, for God's sake, let us bring them back to work in safe conditions.  Workers need to know there is legislation that covers them.  It is section 27(e) of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  If a person feels unsafe at work, under the legislation, he or she can walk away from the workplace without fear of intimidation or dismissal because the workplace is not protected.  If the Minister was protecting those workplaces, she would not have given us a document full of caveats.  It is like a sieve because it states many times that employers, in as far as practicable, should provide masks if they can and that facilities should be provided if they are reasonably practicable.</p> <p> The Minister repeatedly told many Deputies here today that the HSA would inspect workplaces.  It has not inspected one out of 200 complaints at the height of the Covid pandemic in this country.  By her own admission, she stated the HSA had not gone to one workplace.  She refused to answer the question of Deputy Paul Murphy and other Deputies on how many additional inspectors would be provided.  I do not believe the Minister has the interests of employees at heart.  Her document and her interest is all about the employer.  I have just come from a radio interview with Tom Parlon.  Not once did he mention the employer or the responsibility of his members.  He consistently mentioned the personal responsibility of workers to mask up, to use PPE and to socially distance.  If two construction workers are walking across a 4 ft wide plank, how can they keep a 2 m distance between them?  They cannot do it.  Let us make no mistake about it, when the construction industry resumes, the pressure will be on to get a structure built, to get the cement in and to get it done.  There will be breaches; even travelling to work will be a breach.  We have rushed to get the leaving certificate cancelled but we have no problem sending more than 100,000 workers from all parts of the country back into very unsafe conditions without any proper redress.  I do not believe this document has either teeth or power to do what is required.  It is the Minister's responsibility.  I do not need the answers now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.272" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1522" speakername="Mick Barry" time="20:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400070#ZZZ00200"><p>When Clerys closed without paying a penny to long-standing workers, the D&aacute;il said that would never again be allowed to happen.  It is happening again.  It is happening on the Minister's watch.  It is happening at Debenhams and more than four times as many workers are involved in this case.</p>  <p>  Debenhams closed in early April.  Liquidators were appointed by the High Court, namely, KPMG.  I met the liquidators earlier.  The 30-day consultation period is very nearly up and KPMG has informed the unions that it does not intend to extend the consultation period and that it intends to issue redundancy notices at the start of next week, the week beginning Monday, 18 May.  The Mandate trade union has asked that they extend the period.  The union is balloting for industrial action over the company's failure to negotiate a redundancy package.  The result of the ballot will be known at the start of next week.</p>  <p>  There are 1,400 workers directly employed in the company and a further 600 work in the concession stands in the stores.  The cost to the State of paying the two-week statutory minimum redundancy, one week's wages in lieu, the unpaid holiday time and, let us say, nine months' jobseeker's benefit to each of those workers would be more than &euro;25 million, and that is not even counting the lost tax revenue.</p>  <p>  Let us take into account some facts.  The Debenhams workers in Henry Street in Dublin have contacted in writing the landlord of the Henry Street premises, who is also the landlord of the Debenhams premises in Patrick Street in Cork and asked if he would be prepared to negotiate a rent reduction.</p> <p>He has not given a commitment that there would be a rent reduction but has said that he is open to discussions about the possibility of one.  It makes business sense from his point of view.  It is better to have an open premises from which one receives at least some rent than a closed premises from which one receives none.  </p> <p> Of the 11 shops in this State, three made a profit last year.  Online business from Ireland is profitable.  If four of the 11 stores made losses last year, these losses were very much at the lower end of things.  The KPMG affidavit to the High Court valued the stock at &pound;12 million for 1.239 million items.  I asked whether this was cost price or retail price.  It was cost price.  What would the retail price be?  At &euro;20 per item of stock, which is a very conservative estimate, it would yield &euro;25 million.  It could, in fact, yield significantly more as I believe the average price would be more than &euro;20.  This is money that could, and should, be used to save jobs.  At the very least, this money could be used to fund a decent redundancy package for those workers.  </p> <p> I asked the liquidator whether he had received a request to discuss these issues from the Minister or her Department.  He said he had received no such request and that no meeting had taken place.  It seems that the Minister is standing idly by while 1,400 direct jobs, or 2,000 jobs if one includes both direct and indirect jobs, go down the Swanee.  Is the Minister prepared to urgently contact the liquidator tomorrow to seek an extension to the consultation period in order to allow time to explore these issues?  Is she prepared to request a meeting with the liquidator to explore these issues?</p></speech>

We have heard details of a number of schemes to ease the path to business recovery.  Most businesses can avail of a range of schemes.  Although these schemes are, as of yet, untested, they have been put in place in a timely manner under the guidance of the Minister and will lessen the burden for many businesses.</p>  <p>  There is, however, one sector which seems to have fallen through the cracks.  For whatever reason, the self-employed, micro-companies, small businesses and social enterprises do not appear to be adequately catered for.  They seem to have been left on the fringes to sink or swim.  The self-employed represent 15% of the workforce in Ireland, a significant figure.  These are people who have chosen to work and to provide for themselves.  They work alone or may employ one, two or three people.  Perhaps they train a young apprentice.</p> <p>They own and run their own businesses and are responsible for every aspect of it.  </p> <p> These sole traders and microbusinesses are located in every city, town and village across Tipperary and the country.  They do not have the means to advertise, so they depend on word-of-mouth referrals, on being convenient to consumers and on providing a local service.  Every week is a gamble.  Every opportunity is grasped with both hands.</p> <p> They are a vital cog in the economic wheel.  They drive the local economies.  They help ensure that the local wheels keep turning.  They purchase their supplies locally.  They assist larger business by providing trade-specific services on demand.  They live and raise their families in the places they work so they support other local enterprises.  They may be microbusinesses, but they pack a macro punch in the local economy.  </p> <p> Sole traders and microbusiness owners are true entrepreneurs of our country.  They stepped outside the box.  They chose to become self-sufficient through their own hard work.  They decided to take a risk - a risk they carry every day.  These hard-working men and women work all the hours they can to sustain their business.  They struggle to keep their books balanced and they toil to keep their debts paid.  Profits, if any, are ploughed back into the business.</p> <p> Every week they work endless hours to make their risk pay off, hoping and praying that nothing happens to unravel their efforts.  Then along comes the pandemic and, in the blink of an eye, everything comes crashing down.  This was not a risk anyone could have planned for, least of all the self-employed.</p> <p> We all know people who have taken the gamble of becoming self-employed.  They have ploughed everything they have into their venture.  They have borrowed the minimum amount to set themselves up, keep themselves afloat and stay within their means.  If things go wrong, they remain liable for these loans.  The term "financial wriggle room" does not apply to them, unless it refers to an overdraft arrangement.  Despite being the most vulnerable business sector, this cohort have been largely forgotten and ignored by comparison with the bigger businesses.</p> <p> Microenterprise loans of up to &euro;50,000 are available from Microfinance Ireland.  However, to avail of these loans business owners must have received a refusal for finance from commercial providers.  They must be able to prove that their business is viable.  They will also be required to produce a tax clearance cert.  Of course, they must know that they have the capacity to meet the challenge of repaying the loan.</p> <p> Surely the Government can do more for these people who drive our local economies.  While the weekly Covid payment is keeping food on their tables, adding a loan repayment to their financial struggles is not a feasible option in their current fragile state.  Businesses will require grant aid and investment to remain viable.  Without cash flow these small businesses will crumble adding to the social welfare queues rather than returning to self-sufficiency.</p> <p> These people have taken personal risks to enhance our economy.  They contribute in a small but very consistent way to our country&rsquo;s progression.  They are key people who symbolise enterprise in Ireland today.  They are our stepping stones to recovery.  They need a once-off payment to address cash flow, start-up costs and restocking.  Owners know their business.  They operate a simple model.  A relatively small investment by the State will pay a rich dividend in terms of renewing small business, protecting jobs and enhancing community service.</p> <p> I also ask the Minister to ensure that social enterprise is included in any new stimulus programme.  These projects must be deemed eligible for new start-up grants.  We have several of these social and community enterprises in Tipperary, for example The Cottage in Loughmore, and The Parish Shop &amp;Tea Rooms in Annacarty.  These projects are a regenerator of communities, a creator of jobs, a developer of people and social cohesion, and provide other social and economic benefits.  </p> <p> I also raise a separate matter.  The Minister will be aware the pharmaceutical industry is the one sector that has increased manufacturing output during this pandemic.  Ireland is the largest net exporter of pharmaceuticals in the EU and the third largest globally.  The sector directly and indirectly employs 60,000 people.  It accounts for &euro;50 billion in exports, of which &euro;21 billion is exported to the United States.  All of the world&rsquo;s top ten drug companies have operations in Ireland.</p> <p>They are massive employers which support thousands of Irish jobs.  We are fortunate to have Abbott Ireland, Boston Scientific and Merck Sharp and Dohme happily settled and manufacturing in Tipperary.  President Trump recently stated his intention to bring these manufacturing bases back to America.  This threat cannot be dismissed or taken lightly.  The repatriation of even one company would cause economic devastation to our regions.   Are the Department, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland satisfied that we have the ability and the appropriate terms and conditions in place to counteract any such potential move?  Does the Minister accept there is a need for vigilance and constant liaison with the management of these American-owned drug companies which are so crucial to our national economy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.288" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="21:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400073#CCCC00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising these issues.  To answer his last question first, through many years Ireland has built up a very robust life sciences and biopharmaceutical industry, the quality and depth of which is recognised across the world.  Our track record on skills availability, manufacturing quality, consistent pro-enterprise policies, high regulatory standards and access to the European Union attracts many companies to the country.  Of course, biopharmaceuticals is a globalised industry with multinational companies seeking markets, skills, innovation and production expertise as well as mitigating concentration risk through diverse market presence.  Companies based in Ireland such as those in the Deputy's own county, including Abbott Ireland, MSD and Boston Scientific in Clonmel, are at the cutting edge of developing and manufacturing complex and often life-saving drugs that are exported throughout the world.  It is important to remember that Ireland is a key part of a sophisticated global supply chain within the biopharmaceutical industry and that has been built up over time.</p>  <p>  The American Chamber of Commerce Ireland recently told me that Ireland's reputation had been enhanced by how we have responded to Covid-19.  I assure the Deputy that Martin Shanahan, the CEO of IDA Ireland, and his team are in continual contact with all of these multinationals across the country because, as all Members are aware, they contribute significantly to very important high-quality jobs in the regions.</p>  <p>  On grants and the self-employed, I agree with the Deputy that the self-employed people across the country who have two or three employees are vital.  They play a very important role.  During the previous crisis to hit this country, there was no support for the self-employed and that was wrong.  We changed that in the last budget.  The pandemic unemployment payment of &euro;350 is available to every person who is unemployed as a result of Covid-19, including the self-employed.  That is, obviously, of some help to those people.  There are several grants available, including the business continuity grant which provides expertise in how to put applications together for planning and financial supports.  The trading online grant of &euro;5,000 is available to businesses which wish to go online.  They can get a grant of &euro;2,500 from their local enterprise office and apply for another &euro;2,500.  The local enterprise office is the first port of call.  I wish to take this opportunity to thank all the staff in local enterprise offices in every county.  They are doing tremendous work at the coalface.</p>  <p>  After the Cabinet meeting tomorrow, I will be announcing details of the restart grant.  It will comprise a fund of &euro;250 million to address the exact issues highlighted by the Deputy, that is, to help businesses get started and to cover the costs that might have caused businesses to choose not to open up.  It will help those businesses.  Grants of up to &euro;10,000 will be available.  The grant will relate to the amount of rates paid by the company in 2019.</p> <p>That will be a cash injection.  The wage subsidy scheme is also available to these companies for their employees.  This means that if the employees are back at work, the businesses can avail of the scheme which provides up to 80% of the employees' wages until 16 June.  There are a number of supports there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.290" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1592" speakername="Carol Nolan" time="21:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400074#DDDD00200"><p>Last week, a national plan to help the small business sector recover, and to ensure that employment is sustained, was published.  The plan is backed by ISME, Retail Excellence Ireland and the Restaurants Association of Ireland, among others.  It recognises that SMEs account for 99.8% of active enterprises and 65% of total employees in the State.  It also recalled that 31% of our exports are SME related.  This shows how important SMEs are to our economy.  These facts clearly point to the significance of the sector for our communities, regions, families and the wider economy.  One of the key points in the recovery plan was a request to ensure that improved liquidity schemes, up to &euro;6 billion, are put in place, which better target small businesses.  It recognises that most small businesses will require time to recover, and that many will need a minimum one-year payment holiday and a 0% interest rate.  It also stressed that key to all loan schemes should be the capacity to make the funds easier to access, which means the Government channelling liquidity to a broader group of lending partners and increasing the level of guarantees on this capital.  The fact that these suggestions are coming directly from the SME sector highlights the value in adopting this kind of approach, and I welcome it.</p><p>My own sense has been that since the start of the crisis, the Minister has taken a strong and very pragmatic lead and I commend her on that.  She was quick to recognise the need to put in place immediate and ongoing stabilisation measures.  These include a &euro;10,000 restart grant for micro and small businesses based on a rates waiver or rebate from 2019 and a three-month commercial rates waiver for impacted businesses.  As I understand it, however, the commercial rates waiver may be running into some difficulty due to the nature of the contractual obligations that many SMEs have in place.  I would like the Minister to elaborate on that and make suggestions for how this could be overcome. </p><p>Many businesses in Offaly and Laois will want to know that as soon as possible in order to plan for the future.  One business in Offaly that I was in contact with yesterday evening has serious concerns about access to finance.  I emailed the Minister about that earlier today.  It is very urgent and I ask the Minister to give any help she can because hundreds of jobs are on the line.  The same business informed me that it is paying &euro;11,000 every week in insurance costs, despite the fact that there is absolutely no business given the pandemic.  Action needs to be taken on the insurance companies.  They are the only sector in our economy not supporting or helping businesses in any way.  In fact they are hindering business and threatening businesses' very survival.  There was mention today in <i>The Irish Times</i>of a case being taken against an insurance company by a business.  Their approach and attitude are totally unacceptable and it is unhelpful at this time.  Has the Minister or the Minister for Finance engaged with the insurance companies in respect of their ill treatment of businesses? </p><p>On a different point, some businesses will need loans at low or zero interest and others will require direct financial support and grants.  Every business is different and we cannot employ a one-size-fits-all approach.  Is it possible to give a 30% grant based on VAT already paid by businesses from the 2019 tax year?  It would not benefit all businesses but certainly there are big ones which employ hundreds of people that could benefit from something like this.</p> <p>The Minister has also emphasised that free mentoring and online training are also available for all SMEs, which I welcome.  However, there are genuine concerns here with respect to the focus on online retail supports.  I recently highlighted some of these difficulties with respect to the Covid-19 retail online scheme.  In a reply to a parliamentary question I submitted, the Minister noted that the scheme will only be open to retailers employing in excess of ten people that had a pre-existing online presence, which is not possible for many businesses.  </p></speech>

It has already been said that small businesses are the backbone of rural Ireland, and indeed, all of Ireland.  That includes clothes shops.  I walked down Grafton Street this evening and saw big trading outlets open.  Why are small shops, particularly in the clothes sector, told to close yet the big supermarkets can sell clothes?  It is unfair competition.  As my daughters tell me, the different seasons are running past and the stock which the shops hold are out of date and not wanted.  That is totally unfair to small business.  It is a case of big business wins again.</p>  <p>  I have been in contact with Strength gym in Clonmel which is a wonderful spacious gym - I am not disrespecting other gyms but one size does not fit all in this area - and they can have one-to-one training.  Gyms are in phase five on the roadmap.  Is there any possibility that businesses could be examined individually where they have the space - this gym has 3,500 m2, it is massive - and other places that can accommodate distance?</p>  <p>  On hairdressers, I thank the Minister for speaking to Willie Walsh in Clonmel, where he is a household name.  He is a hairdresser who does tremendous work, along with his family who has operated the business for years.  I could do with a visit to him myself, but I must depend on my family to give me a trim.  He has made strident efforts to recover and made great effort to establish safe distance and hygiene and so on.  They want to be able to trade or else they will go out of business.  Will the Minister make available loans?  These people never look for loans, or grants or handouts.  They put their hands in their pockets and have sleepless nights.  They put the investment in.  The black market, in this area especially, is thriving.  It is shameful.  I have said it before and I will say again that people caught operating on the black market should be dealt with seriously.  I said before, and some people took offence at me, that some of them are not Irish nationals and they should be deported if they are caught at this.  They have been called to by the Garda&iacute; and are blatantly ignoring it.  It is not good enough.</p>  <p>  I refer to the grants and cash flow for small business, particularly in tourism.  Staycations should be promoted this year.  All those areas should be supported.  </p>  <p>  The Lazy Bean in Cahir is a wonderful outlet.  It is a meeting place, a hub, in the square, where Karen O'Donovan and her team work so well.  It will be very difficult for them to operate with social distance.  There will be trial and error.  I hear claims.  Some of the hard left here have said that all employers must be visited.  We must have support these traders at this hard time.  N&iacute; neart go cur le c&eacute;ile.  Without the vibrant businesses in our towns and villages the economy will not recover.  We must give a cash injection to people to be able to spend money, and encourage spending.  There is too much of the gloom and locking up.</p>  <p>  For hotels and every other business I mentioned, there is the matter of insurance, which Deputy Nolan also mentioned.  I would also mention banks.  The banks are withdrawing mortgages left, right and centre because people are on the Covid payment.  They are blackguarding once again.  It is nothing but blackguarding.  As for insurance providers, they know that the Minister is a soft touch and that her Government has not tackled insurance fraud, robbery and rip-off for the past ten years and nor did the Governments before that.  It is big business.  We see all the things they sponsor: why can they not give a rebate and have some bit of respect for their customers who have to pay up and who always want to pay?  </p>  <p>  Hotel Minella in Clonmel is a fabulous business run by the Allen family for generations.  They have been so good and kind in organising anything that was wanted by HSE staff or anyone else, and they are now organising with Louise Morrissey, Paddy Doheny and others to visit nursing homes.  With this lovely weather we are having, they can play out in the garden for the residents to look out, and some of them could come outside and engage and I thank them for that.  Businesses like this will have to be supported in relation to standing charges, including rates, and the sheer cost of utilities.  They have piles of bookings and have stopped taking them.</p> <p> Deputy Lowry mentioned the farming industry.  South Tipperary is the hub of the farming industry.  I refer to Pinewood Laboratories, across the border in Ballymacarbry, Clonmel Healthcare, and I have to mention ClonMedica, a pharma business in Clonmel, which has done a huge amount of voluntary work and whose staff put their hands in their pockets every time they are asked to support different events.  I refer to David Adlam and his team.</p> <p> We also need to do something about the driving test.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Shane Ross, came out of his cocooning to come into the D&aacute;il yesterday.  I was lucky I was not here because I would have blown a fuse.  He said that he wants public transport to operate.  He is astonished as to why public transport - the Luas and the buses - is not moving.  He also said that people cannot get their driving test.  People who want to work on the front line cannot get their driving test yet the NCT centres are not open.  Surely they can operate with safe distancing.  Is it all about Dublin to the Minister and getting the bus in from wherever he lives in the leafy suburbs of Dublin?  They can operate as safely as anybody else.  The motorbike testers drive behind the person taking the test.  Young people want to get their licence.  They have been waiting for years.  Many of them have done the theory test and the lessons.  They are ready to go.  They cannot have an accompanying driver with them now so the garda&iacute; should be lenient in terms of the new law that was passed - I refer to the Clancy amendment - whereby at all times learner drivers have to be accompanied in the car by a person with a full licence.  They cannot sit in the car if that is the situation.  We need to be real about that.  I appeal to the Minister, who understands how the country ticks, to try to influence some of her Dublin-centric colleagues.  Rural Ireland exists and will recover if we are allowed to recover and not stifled and hidden.</p></speech>

According to an extensive IBEC survey, many businesses are running out of cash and yet the take-up of some of the liquidity measures announced by the Minister's Department is low.  Why is that happening?  One of the reasons is that many companies do not want to add to their increasing levels of debt.  I have spoken about this previously in terms of their utility bills, rent and insurance.  We also have to remember that an end to lockdown is not the start of normal trading.  Many businesses will have turnovers of around 20% or, at best, 50%.  They have no profit so they do not want to restart with an overhang of debt.  Will the Minister give cash grants to businesses as has been done in the UK, Germany and Denmark to specifically cover ongoing costs when closed to ensure they are not restarting with a significant overhang of debt?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.298" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="21:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400076#FFFF00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising that issue.  We currently have a suite of supports.  Some of them are loans and some of them are grants.  We have the business continuity grant.  One gets that from the local enterprise office so that gives one access to somebody who will give advice and help to put together a financial plan for one's company.  We then have the grants for getting online.  In fairness, many businesses have taken that up.  Finally, we have the restart grant, which is a fund I announced last Saturday week of &euro;250 million.  Tomorrow, I will bring to Cabinet the details of how that grant will work.  It will be a maximum of &euro;10,000 and it will be connected to the rates businesses paid last year.  That will be a direct cash grant into their business.  That means they will be able to use that money if they need to buy some Perspex or whatever to put up personal protection equipment, PPE, in their businesses.  They can use it for overhanging costs.  They might have an ESB bill and a few other costs like that.  It is there for them to use and I believe it will be very much welcomed.</p>  <p>  There is also the wage subsidy scheme.  People should remember that under this scheme, when an employer starts to bring back his or her workers, and hopefully all of them will be coming back over the next period of time, the State will pay up to 85% of the wages of the workers, with a maximum of &euro;410 per worker.  That will continue until 16 June.  That, in itself, will be a cash injection also when employers have their businesses back up and running.</p></speech>

My second question relates to borrowing, and I have previously spoken about the issue of rates.  The Government can borrow at less than 1%, yet we are charging between 4% and 5% over the lifetime of the loan.  Why are we so out of kilter with our European partners?  What is the reason for this?  Is it to protect our banks and their profitability?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.300" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="21:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400077#GGGG00200"><p>Interest rates under the Microfinance Ireland Covid-19 loan schemes have been reduced to between 4.5% and 5.5%.  The first six months are interest and repayment-free, which means there is an effective annual interest rate of just over 3%.  Under the SBCI Covid-19 working capital scheme, loans are offered at a maximum rate of 4% and this represents a significant saving compared to other similar lending products on the market.  Under the future growth loan scheme, the maximum interest rate is 4.5% for loans of less than &euro;250,000 and 3.5% for loans more than or equal to &euro;250,000.  We are exploring measures to further reduce interest rates and I continue to look at whatever opportunities there are for lower interest rates on loans.  For example, I recently secured Government approval to amend the process by which Microfinance Ireland is funded, in order that it can access cheaper funding.  Once the necessary legislation is in place, it will support further lending by Microfinance Ireland at heavily subsidised interest rates.  Under the new &euro;2 billion credit guarantee scheme, interest rates will be below market rates because the State is guaranteeing 80% of those loans.</p></speech>

The Minister said the Health and Safety Authority is an independent organisation, which it is.  Has it made a request to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, or to the Minister herself, for extra staff in view of the extra burden it will face?</p></speech>

That is not a problem, but those supports must be looked at in context of the Central Bank telling us that small to medium enterprises are going to need liquidity of up to &euro;5.7 billion.  We have the national small business recovery plan, and I see John Moran is the chairman of the organisation, which put that together.  I hope he has the same passion for building public houses on public land as he shows for small businesses.  I welcome his passion.  He points out that such businesses are an integral part of our society.  They are embedded in our society and we cannot do without them.  I fully accept that.  He talks about a figure of &euro;15 billion.  While I did not get a copy of the Minister's speech, I was listening to it in my office and I think she mentioned a figure of &euro;15 billion in total as well.  Is that right?</p></speech>

My question is not on the specifics of the range of supports but on what impact analysis has been done on their take-up.  For example, when I look at the figures, I see the credit guarantee scheme has been in place since 2012 and had very little uptake preceding Covid.  In addition, only 156 loans have been approved under the working capital scheme.  I do not wish to find fault.  I am asking how we can see where this money is going and whether it is going to the people most affected.  Like every other Deputy, I am in constant receipt of representations from businesses in Galway city, as well as small restaurants and hotels in Connemara.  The Covid-19 regional economic analysis points out that the north and north west are the most exposed when it comes to business.</p> <p>I will leave the Minister a minute to respond if I can.  Responses must be targeted at those most affected and the Government must have a way of analysing this.  In respect of the regional authority for Galway city, of all cities, it is the worst affected while Clifden is in the middle ground of those affected.  Could the Minister take the minute to look at what forum is there for the analysis of how they are taken up and how one learns to improve it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.311" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="22:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400078#HHHH00200"><p>I will take the Deputy's last question first.  I meet the enterprise forum every two weeks.  The enterprise forum consists of all the representative stakeholders such as IBEC, Chambers Ireland, ISME, the Small Firms Association and the exporters' organisation so I meet all of these bodies.  I am on conference calls with them at least every two weeks.  I get their feedback and they get feedback from their members.  I know the Deputy mentioned the credit guarantee scheme.  We have a much more enhanced scheme where the State is covering 80% of the risk.  We have legislation to put through the D&aacute;il before that scheme can become active.  What is good about it is that it gives businesses certainty.  I would say to businesses that the local enterprise offices are there for the business continuity voucher or grant under which businesses get &euro;2,500 that they can use to bring in a planner and look at their financial requirements.  In fairness, the banks have given six months of a payment break on the loans and have said they are giving flexibility on overdrafts.  I accept that there is a reluctance on the part of businesses to borrow money and I understand that.  This is why we have brought in the restart grant, which I will announce tomorrow evening.  I think this will make a significant difference.  Enterprise Ireland has a range of supports for manufacturing companies.  There is a &euro;180 million fund through Enterprise Ireland, which will work with businesses with ten employees upward.  It will be able to give these businesses supports and grants through that scheme.  The local enterprise office has another suite of supports.</p></speech>

We have been confronted with a public health emergency and have sought to slow the spread of the virus and protect the health of our people, to do what is best and seek the common good.  The public health measures have had an unprecedented impact on our cultural life.  Going to a concert or theatre or visiting a museum are all vital to our well-being but this has been stopped as a result of Covid-19.  This reduction in the access to culture has had an enormous effect on our artists, arts practitioners and all arts and cultural workers.</p><p>Over the past ten weeks, my Department has focused on contributing to the national effort<b></b>by ensuring compliance with public health measures and support for the health and well-being initiatives.  We have been engaging with all stakeholders, including our national cultural institutions, artists, arts and cultural organisations, to assess and measure the impacts of Covid-19 and we have brought forward measures to ensure the continuity of cultural services.  Since the publication of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, we have been working with stakeholders to implement the roadmap and put in place all necessary public health measures to facilitate a gradual reopening of services to the public.  </p><p>I want to focus today on the impacts of the crisis on the cultural sector.  On 12 March, we took the necessary decision, on the advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, to close our cultural institutions to the public and to advise that gatherings of people should be restricted and physical distancing rules observed.  From that date, all performances were sharply curtailed and live production of films in Ireland ceased.  On 24 March, we announced that all theatres, libraries and similar venues were to close and that all indoor and outdoor events of any size were not to take place.  From that date, it has not been possible to undertake any cultural activity based on the collective gathering of people and many summer festivals that have been a fixture of our national life have been postponed or cancelled.</p><p>The impact of these public health measures has been unprecedented.  Many of the challenges are being addressed through economy and society-wide income support and liquidity measures, and others through actions taken by my Department.  The impact on the not-for-profit cultural sector has been severe.  This sector includes Arts Council funded national organisations, theatres, cultural centres, festivals and performing groups, our national cultural institutions and individual artists and cultural workers.  They are our national cultural infrastructure.</p><p>The largest cultural programme affected has been Galway 2020.  I acknowledge the huge amount of work undertaken by the board and team at Galway 2020, artists, cultural workers and the whole community.  Unfortunately, the programme has been necessarily scaled back.  I have assured Galway 2020 that remaining funding from my Department for the European Capital of Culture will be made available for projects that can be completed later this year or early next year.</p><p>This pattern is reflected across the cultural sector.  Successive surveys undertaken by the Arts Council show dramatic losses in audience numbers and box office receipts following cancellations and postponements.  Some 19,000 days of paid work were lost by the end of April.  We estimate that 2.4 million people lost out on artistic experiences and &euro;6.4 million in estimated income will be lost by the end of May.</p>  <p> We are all aware that 1.1 million people&rsquo;s incomes are now supported by the State, through the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, the temporary wage subsidy scheme or payments made to those on the live register.  Statistics from The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection indicate that there were 14,000 people in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector receiving the pandemic unemployment payment at the start of May.  To put that in context, in 2019, some 54,000 people, on average, were recorded as employed in this sector in the Central Statistics Office's labour force survey.  Covid-19 has also impacted on those working in the audiovisual sector.  There are currently almost 5,200 people previously employed in film and television production, sound recording and music publishing activities who are now receiving the PUP.  This is a significant proportion of those employed in that sector, according to the CSO.  Clearly, this Government measure is providing vital support to our artists, arts practitioners and those working in the audiovisual sector.  As we are all aware, given the nature of cultural work, the employment status of cultural and audiovisual workers can be complex.  The dedicated help desk my Department has established to answer all queries from cultural workers on the available supports has been providing valuable support and advice.</p> <p> My Department has worked with the Arts Council, Screen Ireland and other stakeholders on measures to sustain our cultural infrastructure, support artists and arts practitioners and ensure the ongoing provision of cultural services.  I made sure that we acted early in this regard.  First, following a meeting I convened on 12 March with the Arts Council, the national cultural institutions and Screen Ireland, the Arts Council announced a series of immediate measures, including an undertaking to honour all funding commitments made to organisations and allow grantees to draw down up to 90% of their funding commitment.  On 18 March, Screen Ireland announced a set of measures, including provision of 90% funding on all development loans, an extension of development production loans, the provision of additional marketing and distribution support for Irish television releases, and continuing support for skills development opportunities.  To facilitate this, my Department advanced payment of the annual allocation to the Arts Council.  These measures were taken to ensure grantees could continue to operate and meet their financial commitments, particularly to individual artists.  The measures provided much needed support to arts and cultural organisations and, more importantly, those working in the sector.</p> <p> Second, I announced measures on 3 April to enable artists and cultural workers to share their work through alternative channels.  The new measures included the Arts Council&rsquo;s Covid-19 crisis response award, and the Ireland Performs grant from Culture Ireland and Facebook Ireland.  The Covid-19 crisis response award of &euro;3,000 per grantee supports the creation and dissemination of new artistic work for the public benefit and was jointly funded by the Arts Council and my Department.  I understand the council received over 900 applications, proving the scheme's extreme popularity.  In fact, it was almost three times oversubscribed.</p> <p> Ireland Performs provides each artist with a grant of &euro;1,000 to enable the live presentation of his or her work on online platforms.  As of last Friday, 75 artists have performed to audiences of approximately 450,000 worldwide.  I acknowledge the extraordinary standard of performances under the programme, which have been uplifting for many in recent weeks.  Highlight performances of the initiative to date include Cormac Begley's performance from his vintage campervan close to his home on the Dingle Peninsula, which has garnered almost 49,000 views so far, and Aoife Scott's performance from her garden shed, which has had more than 31,000 views.  Given this success, I have increased the funding available to support an extra 20 performances, with the option of extending the scheme further in the future.</p> <p> My Department is continuing to partner with RT&Eacute;, TG4 and others to bring a broad range of cultural and Irish language programming to the public.  This includes the Courage project, which has been delivering performances from artists to the public since 23 April.</p> <p> The Government's Creative Ireland programme is working with colleagues across Departments, including in the Healthy Ireland programme, on the #InThisTogether initiative to promote physical and mental well-being during this emergency.</p> <p>As part of the initiative, my Department and RT&Eacute; will bring Cruinni&uacute; na n&Oacute;g, the national day of free creative activities for children and young people, online for 2020.</p> <p> Our national cultural institutions are providing many existing and new services online, from the creation of new online galleries to the Abbey Theatre's acclaimed Dear Ireland project.  On 16 April, Screen Ireland announced further initiatives, including an expansion of the strategic slate development fund, an additional &euro;1 million in enhanced development supports across feature film, television and animation, a new creative concept development scheme to be made available to Irish directors and writers and additional funding for skills development.  These measures will ensure that skills are retained and developed and that there is a pipeline of future productions.  All of these measures have supported our cultural services from within existing allocations.  The Government is providing significant income and liquidity supports across all sectors, rather than directing them at any one particular sector.  </p> <p> I emphasise that, in respect of the roadmap, it is clear that facilities may only open if they can maintain physical distancing and these indicative dates are dependent on three-week reviews and, of course, the advice of NPHET.  We know that it is hoped that museums and galleries will open in phase 4 from Monday, 20 July and theatres and cinemas will open later in phase five from Monday, 10 August.  I would like to extend my appreciation to all of those working in the cultural sector during this difficult time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.317" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1557" speakername="Niamh Smyth" time="22:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400081#OOOO00200"><p>I am sharing time with Deputies Jackie Cahill and Christopher O'Sullivan, who will have five minutes each.</p>  <p>  Covid-19 has had significant ramifications for our economy and the livelihoods of every person living in the State.  It is difficult to think of a sector that has been hit as quickly or as harshly as those working within the creative industries.  The closure of our arts centres and exhibition spaces has meant that artists have no outlets to show or sell work.  The closure of theatres has meant that actors and production staff have no income.  The closure of venues has meant that musicians have no income.  With the closure of cinemas, film release dates have been pushed back and regulations have stopped all productions currently in the pipeline.  This is only a snapshot of the array of people and sectors impacted.</p>  <p>  With social distancing requirements likely to be a part of life for the foreseeable future, the arts community will be one of the last to return to normal.  We need to think outside the box in terms of how to support the sector.  The Arts Council survey established that over the past number of months we have lost an estimated audience of 2.4 million people.  Over 12,000 arts activities have been cancelled, more than 112,000 tickets have been sold for activities that will not be taking place, over &euro;3.85 million has been invested in activities that have been cancelled and postponed and potential income of &euro;6.4 million has been lost from activities that were cancelled. </p>  <p>  The schemes announced by the Government aimed at supporting artists at this critical time have been, frankly, pathetic.  The commitment pales in comparison to the provision made by similar sized countries for artists.  During the most recent recession, we failed the arts community.  We cannot allow this to happen again.  The arts are critical to our well-being and economy.  The sector needs to be properly resourced and supported at this time.  The National Campaign for the Arts, NCFA, expressed its dismay at the lack of vision shown by the Department in regard to the arts.  </p>  <p>  The NCFA has pointed out that Arts Council England has made &pound;160 million of emergency funding available to arts organisations and individuals who need it during this crisis.  The Welsh equivalent has allocated &pound;7 million.  The German Government has announced an aid package of &euro;50 million for the country's creative and cultural sector.  It is critical that we have a co-ordinated national plan for the arts at this time.  The Department must show leadership in this regard, together with supports for the Arts Council and our local authorities. </p>  <p>  At this time of crisis we must protect our arts practitioners from an already difficult situation becoming impossible.  The Covid-19 crisis response award announced by the Government has been heavily criticised as it requires artists to create new work simply to justify their applications for economic assistance during this crisis.  This has not been the case in other sectors.  In the words of the journalist, Una Mullally, artists are offered pocket money and treated like jesters.  The feeling of hopelessness has been compounded by these paltry and insulting supports. </p> <p>The response of Angela Dorgan, chair of the National Campaign for the Arts, NCFA, was that:</p><blockquote>	we are devastated as a sector.  Artists are the people providing distraction, context and relief.  We are all reading books, we are all watching films, we are listening to music, we are talking about how great it is that we can turn to the arts, yet the artists are once again being abandoned. </blockquote> <p>Members of the arts community have watched their livelihoods being dismantled during the Covid-19 pandemic.  All public gatherings have been cancelled, including festivals, exhibitions, concerts, plays and tours.  All performances have been cancelled indefinitely.  Public health guidance, however, encourages us to turn to the arts and culture for our mental well-being and escapism during these difficult times.  Is the whole country not talking about the beautiful work of art that is &quot;Normal People&quot; by Sally Rooney and Lenny Abrahamson?  I rest my case.<br/><br/>Many artists in the PAYE sector are outside of the eligibility criteria for the pandemic unemployment benefit.  Many artists were not working immediately before 13 March 2020 and were not made unemployed at the time and, therefore, are disqualified.  Many were due to start work shortly after that date in March or during the summer.  This planned work has now disappeared as a result of the regulations put in place on the basis of public health advice.  Consideration must be given to the establishment of a support fund specifically for artists.  The nature of the work of those in the creative industries is such that it is not possible to meet eligibility criteria designed for standard employment contracts and arrangements.  The Minister needs to commit to artists and arts workers affected by the impact of the Covid-19 crisis via the pandemic unemployment payment by extending it until the end of the year.  The Government should immediately commit to releasing artist workspace grants for 2020 and increasing funds available under the scheme for 2020. <br/><br/>Arts and culture are the cornerstones of our society and are parts of our DNA.  We need our artists and cultural institutions more than ever as a key component of rebuilding the country.  It will take leadership from the Minister's Department to fight their corner.  If I were to ask the Minister for one thing during this discussion, it would be for her to talk to and engage with the artists and set out a collaborative roadmap of which they are a part and which would give them some sense of the Minister's vision for their future.  I ask the Minister to listen to them because they are the creators and inventors and they know what needs to be done to facilitate the restart of the creative industries.  Otherwise, there is a risk of an existential threat to artists and the creative industries.  Their future is in the Minister's hands.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.319" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1611" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="22:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400082#PPPP00200"><p>I am going on to a different remit of the Minister's responsibilities.  Thousands of jobs in the horticulture sector are under threat due to the prohibition of peat harvesting on Irish bogs which have a landmass of more than 30 hectares.  While this is not just the remit of the Minister's Department, her Department does hold ultimate responsibility for the use of bogs in this country.</p>  <p>  Peat extraction on all bogs over 30 hectares is restricted due to the striking down of legislation regulating the harvesting of peat.  The result is that private companies that harvest peat for the horticultural industry are left in limbo.  This is having a major impact on the mushroom-growing industry as commercial mushroom growing is primarily done on a blended layer of wet peat that stimulates the formation of mushrooms.  That material is provided by the private companies to which I referred.</p>  <p>  With almost 18,000 people employed in the sector, directly or indirectly, there is a huge problem in the industry when we are trying to reboot the economy and reopen following the complete lockdown of the last two months.  The facts are that the commercial horticulture sector makes a significant contribution to our national economy, with a farmgate value of &euro;437 million in 2018 and an employment value of &euro;497 million in 2018.</p>  <p>  A Government report from October 2019 reviewed the use of peat in the horticulture industry.  It stated that the output value for the sectors using peat as an input in 2018 included &euro;117 million from mushrooms, &euro;38 million from protected fruit, &euro;29 million from protected vegetables, &euro;36 million from nursery stock and &euro;19 million from protected ornamental crops.  According to Growing Media Ireland, which represents most of the country's privately-owned producers of horticultural peat, this situation will also impact on the tillage sector, as 130,000 tonnes of wheat and straw go into mushroom compost each year.</p>  <p>  This is not, therefore, a trifling matter and livelihoods are depending on the action and support of the Government.  What is holding back the beginning of the 2020 harvest is a ruling that those seeking to extract peat from Irish bogs larger than 30 hectares have to acquire planning permission prior to obtaining a licence from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  According to Growing Media Ireland, much money is being spent by companies trying to get alternatives to peat.  We hope they will be successful.</p> <p>In the meantime, it is up to the Government to fix this problem, initially for the 2020 harvesting season, because it is having an impact on the food supply chain.  Whatever solutions are found down the road are irrelevant at present to the almost 18,000 people who depend on this industry for their livelihood today.  We cannot allow the welfare of a food industry to be held to ransom now when there are scientific developments being sought to solve the problem in the near future.  Therefore, I ask the Minister, with her other Government colleagues, to address this problem and allow the industry to proceed for the 2020 season.</p> <p> To move to a different topic, the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business states that small weddings will be allowed to take place in phase 4.  The wedding industry is a major source of employment for artists, the musicians who perform in the church and at the reception, wedding photographers and wedding videographers.  The total lack of clarity as to what numbers are likely to constitute a small or large wedding has resulted in many people choosing pre-emptively to postpone their weddings to a date in 2021.  Furthermore, what social distancing measures will be put in place to allow these weddings to go ahead?  Will the bars be allowed to open?  We are two months out from this date and it is unfair of the Government not to give some guidance to the would-be brides and grooms and those working in and relying on this industry to earn an income.  The booking of venues and artists for weddings in many cases is done up to two years in advance.  Therefore, we need urgency shown by the Government in laying down some clear timelines for the industry, for the artists and for the people who are planning a major day in their lives.  We do not want this to be like the leaving certificate, where uncertainty prevailed for a long period of time until an exact road map was finally put in place.</p></speech>

We have a festival for every form of art that one can think of, including storytelling, poetry, jazz festivals and guitar festivals.  You name it, we have it.  Our traditions, gigs and festivals are under severe threat.  While artists and organisers are showing a bit of innovation and they are doing Facebook live and Zoom sessions, this is not replacing the thrill of going to a physical gig or going to the theatre.</p>  <p>  The brutal reality is that it is estimated that there is &euro;2.9 million lost per month to the arts.  A recent Arts Council survey estimated that the loss since the pandemic has been in the region of &euro;10 million.  That does not even bring into account the 23,000 artists and arts workers who are being impacted.  Livelihoods are under direct and ongoing threat and although there will be a easing of restrictions, we do not know when people will feel safe to gather physically once again.  Without doubt, the arts will be vital to our economic and societal recovery and we need to stand by them and support them.</p>  <p>  Natural heritage is a big part of the Minister's portfolio.  I am a birdwatcher.  I am a twitcher, possibly the first twitcher ever to have been elected to the D&aacute;il.  I was appalled and devastated to see the massacre of 23 common buzzards in my own constituency of Cork South-West.  These are a majestic species that had just begun to re-establish themselves in my county.  They had become a firm favourite with members of the public and with farmers who enjoyed them soaring in the skies above their land.  This is the largest killing of a protected species in ten years and it was done using a substance that has been banned since 2001.</p> <p>What is the Department is doing to tackle the use of this lethal banned substance.  The crime took place in December but it did not come to light until last weekend.  The 2019 report filed under the recording and addressing persecution and threats to our raptors, RAPTOR, protocol did not include these deaths.  Why is this the case?  Can the Minister provide details of any investigation of the incident and any ongoing investigations?  The Minister said yesterday that there have been no prosecutions under the Wildlife Act 1976 since 2016.  She said that there is a wildlife crime investigation unit within her Department, but I am led to believe that is not the case; there is a wildlife investigation committee.  I am asking the Minister to please establish a wildlife crime investigation unit that is properly resourced, staffed and funded so that these horrific crimes against wildlife can be stamped out.</p></speech>

I wish to take this opportunity to encourage and praise everyone who has brightened up the dark days we are in through his or her online art, music, etc.  Major congratulations are due to those who have taken to that form of expression for the first time and created works of art that we will treasure in the future.  As a result of this crisis, I can see the many budding careers in the arts growing.  Perhaps that is something good that will come out of it.  Hopefully they will flourish as a result of their time and our time in lockdown. </p>  <p>  This is key to our future.  As an island we have a reputation for artists, musicians, playwrights, actors, directors, stagehands, dancers, poets, authors, set designers and many more creative talents that is second to none.  We are known as a nation that is artistic, musical and creative and that can have the craic.</p> <p>Millions come to Ireland to join with us to enjoy the fruits of those who are creative and artistic.  I do not believe we have ever fully appreciated the wealth of talent we have on this island.  If we had done so, we would have invested much more in helping those in the arts sector. Being an artist is precarious employment if it is one's only employment, often not knowing from where the next pay packet is coming.  I welcome that many artists, like the rest of the community, are being sustained by the pandemic payments as much as they can be by such a payment.  It is a pity that not all artists have been able to avail of those payments.</p> <p> I know this is a question for the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, but the Minister, Deputy Madigan, will have to lobby on behalf of the artistic community.  Will the Minister give a commitment that these payments will continue for artists?  There is a need for that, given that this will be one of the last sectors to fully emerge from the clouds of Covid-19, due to venues being closed, difficulties getting insurance for displays, and the economic realities we will face as a country with the recession, depression or whatever comes as a result of this.  There is also the fact that the tourism industry, on which many artists are dependent, will be severely curtailed this year.</p> <p> I believe it is vital that we invest now to ensure we can lay foundations for art life with or without the virus, with segregated audiences, virtual performances and so on.  One place where greater preparatory work can be done relates to the opening and closing times of venues.  Will the Minister and her officials accelerate work on reform of nightlife and the night economy, especially in line with proposals regarding staggered opening and closing hours etc as is the norm in many other countries in Europe.  Some of these proposals were given to us last year when I was Chair of the Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, including by Give Us The Night.</p> <p> While acknowledging the work the Department, the Arts Council and Culture Ireland have done in redirecting some of the budgets to online performances in this crisis, much more can be done.  Can more be done to encourage broadcasters and other media to use their airtime and online presence to increase the profile of lesser known home-grown musicians, writers, artists and such?  It brings us back to the debate about how we can ensure that artists can gain payments and acknowledgement from material shared online.  Kind words and online shares do not put bread on the table.</p> <p> What about the reopening of the film studios and the need to ensure this can be done quickly and safely, while utilising the significant skills available in this country to lessen the tendency to bring in crews from abroad?</p></speech>

Art, music and literature have given us all a lift in these uncertain times.  The arts have lifted our collective spirits.  One initiative that I have seen that has given me and everybody a lift has been the art painted by children.  It is placed in windows, whether in Portobello or Pearse Street.  The current crisis is an especially worrying time for artists and their dependents.  We have never needed the arts more than we do now.  The level of funding to assist artists announced recently is extremely disappointing and I urge a significant increase in funds for the arts community.  One initiative I have seen develop is the artist support pledge.  When an artist sells a piece of work for &euro;200 or less, and then reach &euro;1,000 in sales, that artist will commit to buying another artist's work for &euro;200.  I think this is a win-win for everybody and it will certainly encourage new artists to come forward.  Will the Minister and the Department consider supporting and promoting this artist-led initiative?</p> <p>I am also interested in hearing the Minister's view on the current state of Project Ireland 2040, in particular the capital investment in culture, language and heritage.  The Minister will be aware that these investments are outlined in the document, Investing in Our Culture, Language and Heritage 2018-2027.  Many of the national cultural institutions are in historical buildings and they also happen to be in my constituency of Dublin Bay South.  We have the National Gallery, National Archives, National Concert Hall and, in Kildare Street, we have the National Library and National Museum.  Will the earmarked capital investment of &euro;460 million in the national cultural institutions go ahead as planned?  What is the Minister's current expectation regarding these projects and a timeline for them?  Will she consider bringing forward the &euro;460 million investment to act as a stimulus for economic recovery?  Will the Minister guarantee that any capital investment in culture, language and heritage will be climate-proofed?</p></speech>

I thank every single one of the artists who, in a wonderful spirit of generosity and kindness, have given of their skills and talents.  I think every one of us has enjoyed their contributions online.  Every day somebody gives some part of their skill set for our free enjoyment.</p><p>In the new era of social distancing and risk assessment, many ask how it would work to watch a musical or a play or to listen to one's favourite band.  We are deeply concerned about how arts venues, theatres and creative spaces will be able to reopen and sustain themselves economically in the coming months and even into next year if this crisis is not resolved.</p><p>In my area of Dublin West, we have several wonderful venues and creative arts spaces and a wonderful theatre, the Dra&iacute;ocht.  This theatre and creative space hosts daily events and arts exhibitions throughout the year for adults and children, with funding coming from the Government, Fingal County Council and, importantly, its own revenue streams.  Let us imagine that this Chamber is the Dra&iacute;ocht, with the severe physical distancing measures in place.  I cannot believe that any event would be commercially viable or able to support itself in any way, shape or form.  The reality for the Dra&iacute;ocht and many other creative spaces is that they will not be able to do so.  Either we will be left with few or no events taking place or they will need substantial funding from central government.  I totally understand that there are serious financial pressure due to the Covid-19 crisis.  However, we cannot lose a year, or worse, lose some of these venues permanently.  Are any supports, other than those already committed, being proposed to enable theatres and creative arts spaces to reopen, and to remain open, if social distancing is to be maintained late into 2020 or even into 2021?</p><p>Some artists cannot use the Internet to produce or show their work.  It is vital that this section of the arts community is given support to enable these artists to work in this new environment.  I am concerned that those in the arts community feel let down and, as was previously stated, it is important to emphasise what they have said.</p> <blockquote> 	Yet again, Ireland's place at the bottom of the pile in terms of investment in culture and arts in Europe is demonstrated.  Other countries have rolled out significant supports for artists in these challenging times (e.g. Germany &euro;50 Billion, Arts Council England &pound;160 Million, Arts Council Wales &pound;7 Million). </blockquote>  <p>It seems that we are a long way off what is required.</p><p>It is also vital that those involved in the arts sector are given a voice in the process of developing a strategy to enable them to chart their way through this crisis.  Will the Minister establish an external forum comprising representatives of the arts, culture, local authorities and others to support the development of such a strategy?</p></speech>

We are guided by NPHET advice and the Cabinet has to make the decisions in that regard.  Once we have Cabinet agreement on it, we hope the first phase will commence on Monday.</p> <p>The other phases will come through thereafter.  The Deputy will be aware that we hope museums and galleries will reopen on 20 July but theatres will not open until 10 August.  With regard to cultural spaces, it is ultimately not just about audiences viewing performances in these spaces but also is about the staff working in them.  The back-to-work protocols published by the Ministers, Deputy Humphreys and Regina Doherty, will obviously have to be taken into account with regard to social distancing.  It will pose a real challenge for theatres in particular, when they open in the last phase, to ensure social distancing.  There will be many requirements in respect of hand sanitisation, hand washing and the possible use of face coverings.  It will be up to centres such as Dra&iacute;ocht in Blanchardstown, which the Deputy mentioned, to meet these.  It is an extremely popular centre and amazing work is done there.  We really do not want to see places like that going under.  We have to try to support them.  We are working with these smaller and regional centres to ensure they will get up and running in the future.  </p> <p> At this stage, we are working with everybody and are constantly engaging and consulting with the Arts Council, the national cultural institutions, all of the regional centres and all of the Dublin centres to try to ensure that things can get back up and running.  It is challenging.  It has been pointed out by many Deputies today that this particular sector will be hit quite badly.  That is why, from the very outset, we have put supports in place and front-loaded a lot of funding, mainly through the Arts Council, which was given &euro;80 million this year.  It was able to front-load much of the money it had to give to arts organisations which are, in turn, giving the money to the artists to support them.  The artists themselves can obviously avail of all the normal social welfare supports.  The Covid-19 payment the Deputy's colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, mentioned is the main form of assistance.  We are very conscious of the points the Deputy raised and we will be doing our utmost to address them.</p></speech>

The national cultural institutions face big challenges.  I had an engagement with the Council of National Cultural Institutions at which we discussed some of the challenges they are facing.  I applaud all of them.  Deputy Andrews mentioned some of them including the National Gallery, the National Library, the National Concert Hall, the Chester Beatty Library and Crawford Art Gallery.  They are all doing their utmost to bring some of their works online through digital media and to showcase the work they do.  They are working really hard.  My Department and senior officials are in constant contact with them to try to ensure they will return.</p>  <p>  Deputy Andrews specifically asked about the &euro;460 million under Project Ireland 2040.  With regard to that capital infrastructure, there is no point having artists in a position to perform if they have no space in which to do so.  We need to expand.  We want all of the infrastructure for which money was allocated in Project Ireland 2040 to go ahead.  At the moment, it stands.</p></speech>

I am sure the Minister will be relieved to know that I will not be addressing the issues of bogs or turf cutting in my speech.</p>  <p>  I will reiterate some of the key points the Minister, Deputy Madigan, made about the Government's response to the Covid-19 crisis as it relates to the arts and culture.  As we all know, we are faced with an extraordinary public health emergency.  We have had no option but to slow the spread of the virus and to protect the health of our people.  We are all seeking the common good.  Unfortunately, the public health measures have come at a great cost to Ireland's cultural life.  Those who love culture and the arts and those who make a living from them continue to be dramatically affected in every corner of Ireland.  Crucially, the Government's responses in assisting many of those working in the sector, the Covid-19 pandemic unemployment payment and the temporary wage subsidy scheme, are providing vital support for many artists, arts practitioners and others employed in the arts, culture and audiovisual sectors.  As the Minister stated, more than 14,000 people in the arts, entertainment and recreation sectors were receiving the pandemic unemployment payment at the start of this month, May.  One of the initiatives I want to note is Ireland Performs.</p> <p>Normally Culture Ireland provides valuable support for thousands of Irish artists and performers to bring Irish culture around the globe.  This has not been possible during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Culture Ireland is to be commended on coming up with a timely way of promoting these performers and artists online while at the same time providing a grant of &euro;1,000 for each performance.  More than 500,000 people have tuned in around the globe to over 75 Ireland Performs performances on Facebook to date.  Artists and performers from around Ireland have taken part in and benefited from Ireland Performs, including artists from Sligo and Leitrim, and I pay tribute to them this evening.<br/><br/>Husband and wife duo, Ois&iacute;n Mac Diarmada and Samantha Harvey, performed on Tuesday, 21 April.  Ois&iacute;n hails from Sligo and is the founder of the Irish group, T&eacute;ada.  Samantha is an award-winning step dancer and pianist from California.  They performed Ceol agus Coffee live from their Sligo home.  Their programme of music was drawn from material recorded by Sligo fiddlers over the years and reflected Samantha's Californian roots and Ois&iacute;n's special interest in the fiddle music of Sligo emigrant fiddlers of the 1920s and 1930s.<br/><br/>I commend my colleague and friend, Bernard Flaherty, a traditional musician from Boyle in County Roscommon.  He wrote the historical record, <i>Trip to Sligo</i>, in 1990 which highlighted the finest music of south Sligo and north Roscommon.  It included Fred Finn, Peter Horan, Harry McGowan, Andrew Davey and Kathleen Morris, along with a younger group of musicians, including Tommy Finn, Pat Meehan, Colm O'Donnell and many others.  I recall bringing Bernard to Shannon Airport in my van with all the hardcover books to sell in the United States.  This was a major historical record.  He went with dozens of books and came home with no books but loads of money.  It is a great record.  I pay tribute to him.  We are very proud of the work he did.</p></speech>

I met ten artists across a range of disciplines.  We are very proud of our artist community based in Limerick.  We have a world-renowned art college.  We have theatres like the Lime Tree and Belltable and the University of Limerick, UL, with a host of companies.  They have major concerns about where they stand.  The Arts Council and the Theatre Forum are currently producing guidelines on social distancing.  I will put it in context.  The Belltable theatre is very well known.  Based on current restrictions, it would operate at 16%, capacity which is 37 people in a venue that holds 220.  It needs an audience of 154, approximately 70%, to be viable.</p>  <p>  We have major issues.  Looking at other countries such as South Korea, that is based on 2 m distancing.  Other countries would impose 2 m distancing where it might be at low heat, whereas if there is no heat, they might bring it down to 1 m.  We need to look at ways to keep our artistic community viable.  The Lime Tree, which gets public funding of &euro;340,000 and brings in &euro;4 million into the local economy, is not operating at the moment.  Can we look at the social distancing once again, at all times being publicly safe?</p>  <p>  There is a big issue in terms of their capacity to come through the pandemic.  The Minister said that they will be one of the most exposed communities of all.  We need to put measures in place to bring them through.  They have serious concerns about the audiences coming back.  The audience must have trust in coming back as much as the performers.  That is very important.  There are major concerns about access to public liability insurance when they resume.  </p>  <p>  We also need to look at the funding that was allocated to various events that were to take place during the pandemic.  Perhaps those funds could be redirected to retraining artists and looking at other media in which to perform, such as street theatre and performances in outside areas.  They are a major part of the fabric of Limerick city and county and the wider community.</p> <p>They were aware this debate would be taking place.  I wish to raise their concerns.  They are positive but they are extremely apprehensive about the future.  How we treat our artists and arts community is a reflection of our society.  Many artists have come out of a crisis, such as Seamus Heaney from the North or Se&aacute;n O'Casey.  I have no doubt that world-renowned artists will come out of this Covid pandemic.  We must ensure they can come through it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.358" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1562" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="23:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400089#WWWW00200"><p>Given the nature of the cultural work by and employment status of individuals in the arts, it is important to note that the Covid support payments they are receiving are very welcome.  However, I wish to echo the concern raised by my colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, regarding how they can come out of this, respond and get back to the valuable work they do in society.  That is of paramount importance.  We recognise the many positives coming out of the pandemic, particularly the videos to which the Minister referred in her opening contribution.  I watched one of them and found it fascinating.  The Dear Ireland project really caught my attention.  I am pleased to hear that the Minister plans to support another 20 performances under the Ireland Performs programme.  I would love to see more such projects in the coming months.  There is significant concern in the cultural and arts world regarding facilities being opened up on a phased basis such that libraries will open in phase 2 but galleries and museums will not open until phase 4, while the performing arts must wait until phase 5.  I understand that is based on the advice of our public health doctors, but there is concern regarding how the arts community can respond to it.  We can take the positives from this situation, such as how the arts community will refocus and try to find a way of getting their work, which is so valuable and important to us, into the public sphere.  Culture Night is probably one of the ways that could be done.  I would appreciate if the Minister, in the very limited amount of time I have been given, could provide additional information on that issue.</p></speech>

This year, it is due to take place on 20 September.  Proposals are being developed to deliver it online in light of the need for social distancing.  It is regrettable that that is necessary but, as Deputy Farrell mentioned, there have been successful initiatives such as Dear Ireland and Ireland Performs.  People will be as creative as before and we can bring it online and, it is to be hoped, create a buzz around it.  In 2019, approximately 430,000 people visited national cultural institutions such as the National Museum of Ireland.  It is a unique and special occasion.  We wish to ensure that we recreate it in a digital way this year.  Obviously, planning is under way and, in order to err on the side of caution, we will bring it online.  I thank the Deputy for raising that issue.</p></speech>

We in Waterford are very lucky to have a vibrant and thriving arts scene but, in common with the rest of the country, our venues, performance spaces and festivals have come to a dead stop.  The arts community is among the sectors most acutely affected by the shutdown of our economy and those who work in the performing arts have been particularly badly hit.  They have little sight of how or when their practice and profession may begin to return to whatever the new normal will look like.</p> <p>We know that the arts are going to play an essential part in how as a nation we process the huge impact of the Corona virus on our society.  Arts practice has always been a mirror by which we reflect on ourselves as individuals, communities and as a society.  In the wake of the pandemic there will be a legacy of upheaval, of psychological strain and grief that we will need to work through as a nation.  Our arts practitioners will be essential in mediating that process.</p> <p> To understand the arts purely in terms of their economic function is to misunderstand the full value of their role.  The straight economic assessment of the impact of Covid-19 on the sector makes for fairly sobering reading.  The survey conducted by the Arts Council of its members estimates that organisations will lose approximately &euro;2.9 million in income for each month of the shutdown.  Expected losses in performances alone owing to cancellations are expected to top &euro;5 million and this survey only captures data from Arts Council members.  The wider impact through the arts community can be expected to be far greater.  Yet artists will continue to create.  Our poets are still writing, our painters are still painting, musicians are still planning and practising repertoire in anticipation of the reopening of our economy.  Workers in the arts sector have often proved themselves both flexible and resilient.  The reaction to the pandemic has been no different.  Already over 65% of Arts Council organisations have initiated activities specifically in response to Covid-19 and over half have created, or are promoting, online content or services.  However, these new modes of presentation represent a significant step outside the traditional funding streams.  We need to make sure that artists will continue to get paid for the work they produce.</p> <p> What are the Minister's plans to support the Arts Council over the coming weeks and months?  I have noted that the National Campaign for the Arts, NCFA, has asked for an additional &euro;20 million in funding for the Arts Council this year.  It has asked for that to be made available to artists through the bursary system.  It is also asking for a commitment that the Arts Council funding be retained at current levels in 2021 to allow them begin to plan ahead for the work in the coming year.  I understand well the competing demands on the public purse at the moment but can the Minister give the NCFA some clarity on those specific asks?  I welcome the establishment of the advisory group last week.  While it was overdue I was glad to see some action in this regard.  The membership of the group is strong and I am hopeful that good work will result from it.  I would appreciate if the Minister could outline the scope of that group and say whether it is sector-wide or concentrated on specific areas.  Could she briefly outline the timelines and the mechanisms for the implementation of any recommendations that advisory group produces at the end of its work?</p> <p> We are all aware of the massive void that the cancellation of festivals will leave in our cultural lives and our tourism offering.  Waterford, for example, is sometimes known as the city of festivals, with Spraoi, Waterford Walls, Winterval and many others punctuating our calendar year.  Many, however, face cancellation but they have already committed a great deal of time and resources.  Without sufficient support to help absorb those costs and manage lost revenues there is a distinct danger that many of the festivals around the country will not return in 2021.  Has the Minister given any consideration to financial support that could be made available to this sector?  Has she considered proposals from campaigns such as Give us the Night to use pop-up events and multipurpose spaces to help fill the void left by festivals on a smaller scale that would allow us to answer the requirements of social distancing?  The arts sector has already shown its flexibility in responding to the Covid-19 crisis with many performances moving to online platforms.  Has the Minister made any provision to support this move, in terms of facilitating the quality of that output by, for example, funding the upgrading of recording equipment but also allowing artists develop a revenue stream from online performance and arts practice?  Many musicians are developing content online but without ensuring production values or income it is hard to see how that model can be sustainable in the long term.  While none of us likes to think of opportunity coming from this health emergency perhaps there is a chance for arts organisations to use this quieter time to think through the structure and reach of their organisation to take stock, rethink and rebuild. </p> <p>Arts organisations are typically busy and bustling places that often firefight on deadlines and details.  With low-cost supports from the Department, now could be the time to refocus on the bigger picture so that when they eventually reopen they will have a clear idea of where they go from here to expand and develop their remit.  Are there plans within the Department to facilitate and support this kind of development work within arts organisations to make best use of a quiet time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.365" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="23:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400091#YYYY00200"><p>The Arts Council has daily contact with arts organisations and artists to understand how Covid-19 is impacting the sector.  It has regular updates on its website.  It has conducted a good number of surveys and focus groups with funded and non-funded organisations to get feedback on how those organisations are suffering and how the Arts Council can support people going through it.  It has set up an expert advisory group, including Lenny Abrahamson, Fintan O'Toole, Dr. Gabriel Scally, Anne Clarke and Angela Dorgan from the National Campaign for the Arts, and Alan Gray, an economist, will advise.  They will examine how to advise the Arts Council on the impact of Covid-19.  Ultimately, it is about how to support artists during this time.  They will report back in about three weeks.</p>  <p>  Some of the surveys were very interesting.  A survey of 265 arts organisations took place between 23 and 27 March, and another of 1,853 individual artists took place between 3 and 13 April.  These surveys showed severe disruption to the sector, with 19,000 paid days lost until the end of April and a loss of &euro;6.4 million in income from cancelled activities until the end of May.  The details are on the website.  The Arts Council is undertaking much research.  From my perspective, the most important thing in securing funding is that it needs to be based on data and evidence.  One must show what the actual impact is in financial terms.  The Arts Council is independent of my Department but is undertaking much of this work.  It is forecasting, surveying and doing a great deal of work like that.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned Waterford.  All options are being considered.  There is merit in some of the considerations he raised and we will certainly try to bring those forward.  All the organisations, particularly the Arts Council which supports artists on the ground, have front-loaded much of their money.  They will ask the expert advisory group to assess how arts organisations can emerge from the lockdown, implement hygiene and social distancing protocols and explore the safe return to public attendance.  The collective national impact of increasing access and mobility will have to be assessed.  It is not just a question of the safety of the individual cultural outlet.  The road map will also be important in that.</p></speech>

I cannot sing, dance or act and I could not draw a straight line with a ruler but I am lucky to have people in my family who are involved in the arts and make their primary living from being singers in bands, sound engineers, music producers or event managers, so I have seen at first hand how precarious and challenging that work can be in good times and especially now in these most uncertain times.</p> <p> The Covid-19 crisis has created significant challenges for the arts and culture sector.  That has been touched on already by most of the speakers in the debate thus far.  We have mentioned the survey from the Arts Council of almost 300 arts organisations across the country where it is estimated that organisations will lose &euro;2.9 million per month as a result of the shutdown.  The economic impact to date is in or around &euro;10 million.  Those are rough estimates.  We cannot calculate the true value yet and we may not be able to do so for a long time.  By the end of April, 12,000 events throughout the country had been cancelled and 19,000 days of paid work have gone.  That is just paid work that we can quantify, not the amount of work we cannot quantify that goes into preparing for events.  The overall impact of that on the country's 23,000 artists and arts workers is still unknown but one figure that leaped out at me was an estimate that up to &euro;2.5 million of artists' own money that has been pre-invested in projects is already gone.  That highlights a number of issues regarding this sphere.  We do not see the financial sacrifice that artists make for their own craft and the amount of money and effort they have to front-load to put on a show or a concert.  That is gone.  They will not get that back.  That is something that highlights the precariousness of their livelihood.</p> <p> Many artists and those who work directly in the arts industry are in receipt of the working family payment.  Some of them have to use Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection payments in normal times.  That hammers home how worrying this crisis is for them.  It has been mentioned here already that the arts will be the last sector to come back.  Imagine being an artist now and hearing that from politicians, the Chief Medical Officer and everybody else.  They are saying what they believe, that the arts sector will be the last to come back.  Artists will be wondering if they will come back at all.  We have to provide confidence in this House, both in government and across the House, that they will come back and that we will be there to support them every step of the way.</p> <p> We understand that in this time, the front-line workers and front-loading resources to them is important but the Government must now acknowledge that sectors such as arts require reassurance and security to keep them and their sector from financial ruin, about which I am sure many of them are worried.</p> <p> I am sure that when all of us in this House, including the Minister, look into the distant future at the new normal we are all expecting but are not quite sure what it looks like, we imagine ourselves going to the cinema, the theatre, a museum, an art gallery, a comedy show, a pantomime or a battle of the bands.  We have to make sure that is there for us.</p> <p> My party colleague, Senator Hoey, brought to my attention indirectly through a tweet a quote from the late Eavan Boland, who once said, "It's dreadful to think of a society that doesn't sustain the artist".  It is an apt quote and it is something we should all think about at this time as we go through this crisis.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge Eavan Boland, who passed away on 27 April.  I had the pleasure of being introduced to her poetry when studying for my leaving certificate nearly 20 years ago.  In poems like "The War Horse", she was the very first poet who wrote about a world that I physically recognised and could connect to.  Her work helped open up the world of poetry.  An art that I, as a 17 year old boy, once thought was perhaps esoteric or unimportant suddenly became both vital and beautiful and carried a real power.  She has left an artistic legacy that will endure for generations to come and her loss will be keenly felt for a long time.  She was correct in how she viewed the importance of the arts.  In this time of isolation, we still seek and strive for that.  We only have to look at the impact of the television show, "Normal People", which Deputy Niamh Smyth mentioned also.  It has become a wonderful treat and escape at this time.  It is a collection of wonderful mainly Irish actors and is stunningly shot.  It is based on a source novel by one of Ireland's truly great writers, Sally Rooney.  "Normal People" reminds us, through the medium of television in this instance, just how vital our wider arts sector is and that our artists contribute across a wide range of areas on a 365-days-a-year basis.  Their absence from work at this time has perilous consequences.</p> <p> Artists and arts workers not only desire to get back to work for their own livelihood but seek to provide a necessary and welcome distraction from these very trying times for all of us.  Artists are keen to memorialise the friends and neighbours we have all lost and who have suffered through Covid-19.</p> <p>They want to celebrate our heroes on the front lines and those supporting our front-line workers.  They want to tell the story of the Covid-19 era.  We know they will; we just need to ensure there are enough supports and an industry in place to allow them to do that.</p> <p> Following an online meeting of almost 400 artists and art workers, the National Campaign for the Arts has outlined the particular challenges it has collectively identified for the sector.  It is offering some potential solutions in the short, medium and long terms to ensure Ireland's arts and cultural industries can remain strong and viable.  I ask the Minister to take these solutions on board and provide a strong response to all of them, though she will not have time to do so during this debate.  We need to establish a stabilisation fund for arts and cultural organisations in order that the sector can survive.  We need an immediate commitment of an additional &euro;20 million for the Arts Council for 2020 alone to support artists, art workers and art organisations to survive and recover.  This should include considerable increases to project awards and bursaries, which have a significant impact for artists and art workers.</p> <p> We need to ensure clarity and openness when engaging with the sector.  That is vitally important.  We need to support artists via the pandemic unemployment payment.  While many artists are getting it, a number are falling through the gaps.  That may be happening as, although they may not have been working at the particular time, they had work lined up later on in the month that did not come to fruition.  We need some latitude from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on that.  When the next Government is formed, we need to ensure a full Ministry for culture, heritage and the Gaeltacht is retained, and the Minister must ensure artists are part of her advisory team.  The rules of the Covid payment have been a little too strict for some artists.  We need to get the message to our Intreo offices and push the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection in order that artists who are unable to ply their trade can avail of the pandemic unemployment payment.</p> <p> We mentioned what other countries are doing at the moment and other examples.  Germany and the United Kingdom are on a different scale in terms of population and the size of their economies.  However, Wales, which is similar to us, has also been mentioned and Scotland, which we can have some kind of comparison with, has introduced supports amounting to &euro;12.5 million.  Compared to our &euro;1 million it is almost embarrassing.  This needs urgent attention from the Minister and her Department.</p> <p> James Connolly, whose execution we remember this week, said: "The Irish people will only be free, when they own everything from the plough to the stars".  The arts sector is home to both the worker and the star, and we must show them we fundamentally value them and ensure the sector which provides so much joy and entertainment to our society reaps the benefits of the profits it makes.  We must not only reopen the sector in time, but ensure those working in it do not return to their previous uncertainty, working on uncertain contracts or if-and-when contracts, and not getting the hours or pay they deserve.</p> <p> I also draw the Minister's attention to the fact that not only do our artists and those working in the sector contribute amazing creative output to our society, but they are often at the vanguard and forefront of bringing political causes to the attention of the wider public, something we as politicians are not always able to do to the same effect.  For example, over 240 Irish and international artists came together yesterday to back Amnesty International's campaign calling for a military embargo on Israel until it fully complies with its obligations under international law and urging an end to Israel's siege of Gaza amid the Covid-19 pandemic.  That is a popular cause among the Irish public and many in this House.  This is an example of the very necessary contribution from those in the arts industry and what they do on top of the creative output they provide for us on an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

When the time comes that we can gather in groups with our friends or families it will be our artists, through their music, drama and artistic content, that will be the focal point of that much needed and much longed-for gathering.  We are going to rely on our artists to help us laugh again.  Undoubtedly, when the time comes that we can honour and pay homage to our front-line workers and those who have served us during this time of great need, such as retail staff, cleaners, nurses and doctors, it will be our artists who will help us fulfil that function.  Most importantly, it will be our artists who will help us grieve.</p> <p>Artists will help us find the manner in which to find expression for grief - grief for those we have lost or the lost time away from those we long to hold.  Our artists will meet this challenge.  We know this because they always have.  For every occasion where difficulty has befallen this country, our artists have been there to help formulate our understanding of what is happening.  Through the economic dreariness of the 1980s and early 1990s, it was the artists who brought life to the voids, quite literally in some sense.  It was the artists who enlivened those spaces.  They brought music.  In my constituency, I am thinking about the SFX Theatre and Temple Theatre.  It was the artists during those dreary times who gave a generation of Irish people a reason to stay here when no other reason really existed.  Through the decadence of the Celtic tiger, it was our artists who brought much-needed ridicule to a nation that was getting ahead of itself and the politicians in this Chamber who were getting ahead of themselves.  It was the artists who helped us find meaning.  When the crash inevitably came and when all else deserted us, it was our artists who propped us up.  It was our artists who helped us to find meaning and what it really meant to be Irish in substance rather than in what we had given over to artificial content during the Celtic tiger.  When the pandemic hit us, and the pandemic has been a time when so many people stepped forward, it will be our artists who will once again help us find meaning.  I am confident in the role the arts will play in the weeks and months to follow because they have done that time and time again.  Throughout that process, we have talked about how great our artists are.  We have built statues to the exceptional artists, had gatherings to bring people back and used the music of our artists to share meaning and summon people back but when this pandemic struck in March, what this State and Government offered to our artists was 0.11% of our GDP.  This is less than half of the European average.  We talk about the role our arts play - when you think about what that means in essence - you cannot put our nice words on bread.  Our artists have suffered for long enough even though we need them.  We constantly need them.  They constantly prop us up.  That is something we have to change.</p> <p> My question concerns the process for re-opening.  The Minister said that during phase four, galleries can re-open and in phase five, we will see theatres re-open.  She said that NPHET has given those guidelines but I think we need something much stronger than that.  Does the Minister have guidelines for how this re-opening would happen?  I think she told my colleague from Dublin West that Dra&iacute;ocht would have to develop its own guidelines but I do not think that is appropriate.  Will there be guidelines regarding physical distancing?  I saw one estimate that if the Abbey Theatre was to re-open under social distancing guidelines, it could get 43 people in there.  This will not be accessible.  What are the guidelines for re-opening and when will we see them?</p></speech>

All things being equal and depending on advice from NPHET, which the Government will take into account, we will proceed to each phase consecutively.  Obviously, some of those phases may be accelerated if things go better and, again, they may regress if things do not go as well.  I am not sure if the Deputy is talking about a specific arts centre or whether he is talking in general terms about national cultural institutions.  To reassure the Deputy, there is a significant amount of engagement between, first, the Arts Council and its arts organisations and between my Department and primarily the national cultural institutions but also other arts organisations about how they are going to re-open.  Obviously, they are working themselves in terms of proposals and delivering on those so we are in constant contact with them.  I do understand the challenges that exist.</p></speech>

That clearly sets out measures that need to be taken into account.  These are guidelines for working environments.  At the end of the day, all of these national cultural institutions and spaces are working environments.  We must ensure that the audiences are safe as well as the people working there.</p> <p>We are taking all of those factors into account and my Department and its senior officials are working extremely hard in engaging with every type of arts organisation in the country on that matter.</p></speech>

We have accepted that &euro;203 in unemployment benefit is not enough for a person to live off.  We have already crossed that Rubicon.  According to the 2016 census, some 23,000 people make their living from art, including artists and the freelance technicians associated with them.  They will be one of the last groups of people to come back to normality and yet there will be an expectation for them to live off &euro;203 when the Covid-19 payment subsides.  Could the Minister clarify whether the Government can extend the Covid payment for artists?  What is the process by which that can be made that happen?  Many artists will not be able to live off &euro;203 a week and others will not be able to apply for the Facebook grant.  The fact that the arts bursary was oversubscribed is not because it was so great but because the need was greater.  Artists understand what it means to be hungry and they are terrified about what will happen when the payment subsides.</p></speech>

That was never intended.  Maintaining that payment would be divisive and create two different forms of unemployment payment.  We do not think that is fair or sustainable in the long term.  Ultimately, it will have to be reformed by the new Government.</p>  <p>  There have been comparisons made with the UK and Germany.  I have not had the opportunity to answer many of the questions that have been raised by many of the Deputies here.  I do not want the narrative of comparisons to get out because it is misleading.  For example, the &euro;50 billion package that has been rolled out in Germany is for all self-employed people and microenterprises.  Ireland has similar packages for businesses.  The Covid-19 payment is important and it is a lifeline for artists at the moment but it will be tapered at some point in the near future.</p>  <p>  The money that is being used in the UK comes from the reallocation of moneys.  It is not moneys that are going specifically to artists.  Just because the UK puts out a figure for a certain amount, it sounds a lot more appetising than it is in reality.</p></speech>

Grants and schemes are available in the Department anyway.  I hope they will be continued but we must remember that we are living in an environment where there is projected to be a deficit of &euro;30 billion this year and &euro;14 billion next year.  We must have a bit of realism about what we are going to be able to achieve.  I never make a promise that I cannot keep and I will not do that.  Obviously, I have been fighting as hard as I can for this sector and will continue to do that for as long as I am in this role, as I hope the next Minister will as well.  Every Minister fights for his or her sector.  There are competing priorities and, obviously, the overriding one is public health.</p>  <p>  I take on board everything the Deputy said.  A total of 1.1 million people are availing of social welfare benefits in this country at the moment.  I hope that payments continue is all I can say to the Deputy at the moment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.379" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="00:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400095#CCCCC00600"><p>I will be sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy.</p><p>As the person who asked for it, I thank the Ceann Comhairle and the Business Committee for agreeing to have this debate on the arts.  I ask the Minister to imagine at the best of times what it would be like if we had no music, comedy, film, theatre or art.</p> <p>Imagine going through the past two months if we had none of those things.  It is too awful even to contemplate.  The United Nations is talking about a mental health crisis.  Imagine how bad that crisis would be without our artists, musicians, poets and writers, as well as the crew - I really want to emphasise this - which includes the technicians, drivers and all the other people who make it happen.  Life would not be worth living and we all know it.  We only have to think for one minute what the past few months would have been like in that scenario.  It would not be worth living in those circumstances and that is how important the arts are.</p> <p> However, the sort of support we give to our arts workers, performers and artists is insulting.  It was insulting before the Covid-19 crisis that in a country whose reputation is built on the arts, we spend less than almost anybody else in Europe in supporting arts, the artists and the crew.  Then the crisis comes and &euro;1 million is given to support artists.  I have in my hand a rejection letter that was sent to an applicant to one of the schemes the Minister is claiming as a success.  I will not say the name of the artist who received this rejection letter but the person is a household name.  Two thirds of those who applied for this pretty miserable grant were refused and given a grade on the artistic merit of their application.  It is utterly insulting.  As I said, this particular rejected applicant is a household name who has given service to the State, as have all of these people.  They are treated with no respect, except when people want to jump into a camera shot with them to get a bit of credibility or kudos out of the artists' work and creativity.  This insulting approach to our artists has to end and we should realise, now more than ever, how important they are.</p> <p> I have a few specific issues to raise.  The Minister should commit to the demand of the National Campaign for the Arts for an additional &euro;20 million in funding for this year and next year - frankly, it should be more - to fund arts and arts organisations.  She should offer a commitment that the Covid-19 payment will be given to everybody, not just those who happened to be working on 13 March.  Many people in the arts would have been working the following week or the week after, but they are being denied payment.  The payment should be guaranteed until we at least get back to a situation where live performances and the arts are back up and running.  In fact, if we genuinely want to support them, such a payment should be given out on a permanent basis to our artists, as I have suggested before, by way of some sort of public works programme.  As Deputy Gannon said, theatres and people in the music business need clarity about the guidelines for a partial reopening.  When or if that partial reopening happens, services are going to be chronically underfunded because the revenue streams just will not be there if social distancing is implemented.</p> <p> The last point I want to make is on my oft-repeated theme of the film industry.  Why are we giving out supports to film producers who have just sacked all their crew?  The staff at Ardmore Studios and elsewhere were not put on the wage subsidy by the producers who get &euro;70 million or &euro;80 million a year but do not actually have any employees, apparently, because they do not recognise those employees as such and sacked them as soon as the crisis hit.  Do those people have to go on the Covid-19 payment or are they supposed to apply for jobseeker's alliance?  It is absolutely outrageous.  These producers continue to look for and get supports but when their workers say, "I am your employee", the producers reply, "We do not have any employees".  Let us start supporting the workers, the crew and the artists.  We should be putting the money into supporting the people who actually make the art and the work happen.</p></speech>

It is a bit frustrating listening to the Minister and some of the other Fine Gael Deputies, whose contributions have involved giving lip service to the idea of the importance of the arts, combined with a certain supposed realism about what can be done in terms of funding.  It is the same approach that existed before the crisis but repackaged for the crisis.</p> <p>It is precisely that lip service, combined with a significant absence of support, including low levels of public support compared to the European average, for example, that have left the arts sector in the state it is in and particularly vulnerable to this crisis.  In reality, the Government now appears to be doubling down on that.</p> <p> One very concrete question has been asked, but I will leave time for the Minister to answer.  I refer to the situation facing arts workers who have not only lost all of their income but who, in many cases, have been left out of pocket because they have invested in projects which had to be cancelled.  Some are still renting studios and other spaces even though they are unable to use them.  Some are unable to access even the pandemic unemployment payment because of the precarious nature of their job.  Does the Minister support the demands of the #artsblackout campaign to streamline access and accept a letter of reference from any Irish cultural organisation?  That would mean that those who work in the arts could access this payment.</p> <p> From what she said earlier, I get the impression that the Minister does not agree that supports must be continued at the same level until, at the very least, the ban on mass gatherings and events is lifted.  Afterwards, we should not go back to the old, inadequate payments.  The Minister says we cannot have inequity, but why are we levelling down?  Why are we not levelling up?  Why are we not reviewing all of the payments and, as part of that, ensuring that arts workers have stable incomes, the bottom floor of which is the basic minimum the Government has effectively accepted people need to survive on, namely the &euro;350 weekly payment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.383" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="00:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400097#EEEEE00200"><p>I will start with Deputy Paul Murphy's questions.  If I leave any answers out, he can remind me.</p>  <p>  The Deputy talked about income supports in general.  From a reality check perspective, I mentioned earlier that 1.1 million people in the country are in receipt of social welfare benefits and 212,000 people are receiving &euro;203 a week.  At the end of April, there were 213,000 people on the live register.  The amount of people receiving the pandemic unemployment payment in Ireland at the moment is 585,000, at a cost of &euro;206 million.</p>  <p>  So far, the State has spent &euro;908 million on the wage subsidy scheme.  Some 53,600 employers and 460,000 employees have availed of that scheme.  Of the total number in receipt of the pandemic unemployment payment, 14,000 people from the arts sector have availed of it according to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Those working in the arts are getting the supports required from the Government.  After workers from the accommodation, construction, administration and retail sectors, the arts has the highest share of people claiming the pandemic unemployment payment.  It is a higher level of support than in Northern Ireland, where the payment is only &euro;100 per week.  Our payment is significantly higher.</p>  <p>  As I said earlier, we are broadly in line with the European average.  We are spending more than the UK and Germany.  The UK has reallocated national lottery project grants from a development fund.  The reality is that most of the money it is spending has been repurposed and was already in the 2020 budget.  In Ireland, &euro;25 million in funding was made available in March to the Arts Council to ensure that funding would get to artists affected by Covid-19.  That is significant.  As mentioned earlier, there is a huge deficit.</p>  <p>  My Department's Vote has increased by 23% since 2017.  I have significantly increased funding for the arts since I took office two and a half years ago.  If I have the opportunity to remain in this office, I will continue to do that and will fight hard for the sector.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is right.  The world would not have been a good place over the past number of weeks if we did not have music, the arts and everything else to sustain us.  If anything, that will give a loud signal to everybody.  I am pleased that people can at least avail of the supports that are in place.</p></speech>

We again thank our healthcare workers who are doing so much during these very difficult times.</p>  <p>  When we talk of the arts in Ireland, we are speaking of some of the central foundations of our culture, our Irishness, and the historic and contemporary creative spirit that has fuelled our Celtic identity and moulded the diverse society that is Ireland in 2020.  For many years, our country has strode the world stage in theatre, drama, dance, film and music.  Our literary contributions are without international peer.  Our cities and regional landscapes boast historical and modern architecture of cultural significance, design and ingenuity.  Our rich visual arts heritage, traditional arts, street arts and spectacles we have developed in recent years have placed Ireland as a must-visit destination, which is exemplified by attracting 11.2 million visitors to these shores in 2019.</p>  <p>  How do we value this rich tapestry of lived experience and economic benefit in these present and challenging times?  We are facing into unparalleled economic upheaval.  The fallout of Covid-19 and the future implications of dealing with the requirements of social distancing have made the resumption of normal activity impossible for many of our traditional artists, performers and artistic promoters.</p>  <p>  For many in the artistic community, finances can be precarious at the best of times.  It is no exaggeration to state that for many people involved in the arts, personal and community finances are now perched on a knife-edge.  Our theatres and indoor and outdoor venues have been closed since March.  The majority of artistic community income has stopped completely without an answer as to how it can return.  How is it possible to produce new theatre and drama work in this new reality of social distancing?  In 2019, the Abbey Theatre in Dublin scheduled 30 different productions to a nightly audience of 500 people.  The new live audience restriction with social distancing requirements is 52.  How can arts centres open their doors to an available 10% of their previous footfall while continuing to pay 100% of their previous operating costs?  </p>  <p>  The National Campaign for the Arts has stated that an additional &euro;20 million is needed for venues and artists to survive.  I applaud the council for swiftly releasing virtually all available 2020 funding to artists and art organisations.  What about next year, however, when even more funding will be needed?  What priority will the Government place on supporting the arts in any future recovery plan?  Where and in what quantity will funding for the arts be provided in this new reality?  For indoor and outdoor venues, where social distancing must be observed, what innovations can be encouraged and developed?  What supports can be provided to ensure not alone that must the show go on, but that it can do so viably and into the future?</p>  <p>  The priority, scale and support the Government demonstrates to secure our future arts sector will signal whether our economic drivers are actively engaged or are absent or asleep at the wheel.  Perhaps our thought leaders might reflect on the activity of the German Government, which recently announced a sweeping aid package for that country's creative and cultural sectors.  The German culture minister, Monika Gr&uuml;tters, was quoted as saying "we know the hardships, we know the desperation".  She continued by stating the German Government knew the importance of the creative industries' sector and the problems with livelihood.  She further stated that help was being provided and "that help is coming as quickly and with as little bureaucracy as possible".  Can we also extend the lofty gaze of the Minister's Department and senior officials to such high ambitions?  </p>  <p>  I will reflect experience from my city of Waterford.  Our Theatre Royal and our Garter Lane Arts Centre are to remain closed and will be unviable for many months, and possibly years, to come.  For a generation in Waterford, there has not been an August bank holiday weekend - there has simply been the Spraoi weekend.  This year Waterford will not rhyme and chime in August to the rhythms of the Spraoi international street arts festival.  Instead, our 28 year old street festival has been stopped in its tracks.  Honouring Government directives on large-scale outdoor events this summer, Spraoi organisers and our artists, musicians, volunteers, funders and partners have decided that staging Spraoi is neither feasible nor appropriate.  </p>  <p>  Like so many other national cultural events, however, Spraoi remains committed to its artists and its audience.  Our national artists have served this State well.  They give voice to our spirits as a nation and develop our culture.  In so doing, for those reasons in particular, they have helped to develop a vibrant tourist economy.  The artists in my city and county are everyday people who enliven our lives and our souls with the gift of music, imagery, dance, storytelling and entertainment and in so doing provide to our region an economic engine. </p> <p>Spraoi's passion for the people, the streets, the squares, the lanes and the quays of Waterford remains undented.  The company is purposeful and currently active in exploring ways to return, with an adapted experience in September and with the resilience to ignite support in local communities.  Like many other artistic endeavours, the Spraoi festival will require funding - not token funding as an act of charity but rather strategic funding advanced as a pragmatic investment in Ireland, in the hearts and minds of our people, and in the future economic recovery of our regions.</p> <p> Covid-19 is causing our artistic sectors to face into a period of intense introspection but the questions being asked are largely commercial in nature.  We may have a formula to estimate the economic value of our arts and cultural heritage in Ireland, but how do we measure the intrinsic value of the arts to our society and what funding mechanism can be put in place to see it fairly supported?  This is my overarching question.  What value and what future supports will the Department provide for the cultural and artistic sectors in Ireland?  What funding parameters will be put in place to secure jobs and expertise in artistic imagination and expression?  Given the recent announcements of capital required as called for in the small business recovery plan, the local jobs alliance report and the IBEC Reboot and Reimagine report, a figure of &euro;15 billion has been identified as the funding requirement to refloat our national economy in the coming months.  It would appear the arts and cultural portfolio will require significant and additional resourcing from such investment this year and for years to come.  I am joined by many in our arts and cultural communities and in our wider tourism sector who sincerely hope this significant economic driver will receive now the immediate support it needs to problem-solve, innovate, adapt and survive.  Many of us await a comprehensive and extensive investment plan from the Department and the Government.  We hope to see the sector secured so that it can thrive into the future.  We hope, too, that the breadth of ambition to be deployed in the Department is adequate to the challenge awaiting.</p></speech>

If anybody is listening in, I ask him or her to avail of it if there are concerns.</p>  <p>  On the stabilisation fund, the Deputy sort of alluded to the fact that he wants to ensure there is funding for the arts.  Recovery is dependant on the rate at which the level of restrictions on economic activity can be varied in accordance with the prevailing public health guidance but my priority is to ensure optimal use is made of available resources to sustain the sector through this challenging period.  We continue to consult, as I said, with the cultural organisations.</p>  <p>  Deputy Shanahan mentioned the Spraoi festival in Waterford.  There was &euro;295,000 - quite a bit of money - given towards that.  In any event, it is not yet cancelled but, obviously, it is an issue for them in terms of gatherings outside.  It can be looked at.  Certainly, if the Deputy needs any assistance, our Department will help him in any way we can.</p></speech>

The impact the restrictions continue to have on this sector is frightening.  While health and economic impacts are obvious, the reality of the situation extends way beyond and affects social and mental health and engagement between our Irish artists and culture.</p>  <p>  I noted in her opening statement the Minister stated that 14,000 people in the cultural sector have applied for the pandemic unemployment payment.  While I acknowledge that, many people in the sector are unable to get that payment because they may have another income from a daytime or part-time job.  Of course, those over 66 are being denied everything everywhere, and many of them go into their late 80s and 90s in this situation with their gr&aacute; for the teanga, rince, na ceolteoir&iacute; agus a leith&eacute;id.  By its nature, many artists, music teachers and dance teachers might have a second, day-time job.  As I said, that should be acknowledged and they should get some kind of payment.</p>  <p>  The arts, music and dance offer an outlet for so many young people to express themselves and to flourish on a social level and the abrupt stop to all of this has had many impacts.</p> <p>Social media has been a brilliant help in this regard, as has local radio.  As other Deputies have mentioned, the online concerts and creations that have been published in the last few weeks have been uplifting.  Many of them have raised funds for many good causes.  One was a GoFundMe for the St. Mary's Choral Society in Clonmel, a wonderful society whose members do not know how it will survive.  This group still has bills to pay every day for utilities, electricity, heat, light and everything else.  How will it operate?  Will funds be available for it?</p> <p> Only as we approach our summer season will we truly realise the total decimation of our arts industry and events.  I refer to the necessary but sad cancellation of festivals, exhibitions, shows and of course the fleadh season, which was due to begin with the local rounds, continue with the county and regional events and culminate in the massive international Fleadh Cheoil in late August.  Ireland attracts tens of thousands of tourists from all over the world to witness our live music and cultural activities.  Places like Br&uacute; Bor&uacute; Heritage Centre in Cashel are famous, as is Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann with its summer seisi&uacute;n shows.  I refer also to GAA's Sc&oacute;r competition and An Coimisi&uacute;n Le Rinc&iacute; Gaelacha, which were unable to go ahead this year.  I must also mention places like Jim O' the Mill, a renowned old public house in Upperchurch in Tipperary which only opens gach o&iacute;che D&eacute;ardaoin.  It hosts fabulous sessions, attracting queues that go out the door, entertained by Mr. Jim Ryan and his family.  They have many visitors.  One can see the awe in the tourists' eyes when they go to places like that.  We used to have the same thing in the Thatch, a pub which is no longer with us.  We are losing many of those, so we need to support them, because n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile.</p> <p> Last month the 50th annual World Irish Dancing Championships were due to take place in Dublin, with an anticipated &euro;10 million benefit to the economy of Dublin city and its surrounds.  The Fleadh Cheoil season, including county and national events, is cancelled.  I must declare an interest here.  My own niece, Ms Kathy McGrath, runs the McGrath School of Irish Dance based in Caisle&aacute;n Nua na Si&uacute;ire.  Some of the Minister's own family are from the wider south Tipperary and west Waterford area.  It is her heritage as well.  Like many others, my niece has done her best to provide virtual classes online, but I am sure the challenges that surround this are fairly obvious.  The lack of physical engagement makes any practice much more difficult.  The same goes for music lessons.  It is hard to perform "The Siege of Ennis", "The Walls of Limerick", the old-time waltz or ruda&iacute; mar sin virtually.  I will not say anything about the foxtrot for the moment. </p> <p> Irish music and dancing is an industry in itself.  Musicians, audiovisual providers, vendors, organisers and teachers are all affected.  An Coimisi&uacute;n Le Rinc&iacute; Gaelacha has responded to this abrupt halt in activity by setting up a worldwide committee to deal with this unprecedented challenge to Irish dancing.  It is not possible simply to start up where we left off on 12 March.  That is the problem.  The lack of extra cash that families will have to put into these activities when things reopen will be a huge issue.  I appreciate the money that the Minister is committing to the Arts Council of Ireland, but we need to ensure that all these supports come through to the artists on the ground.  This needs to happen and often it does not.  Late last year we had problems with the Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann and money connected to it.  We were not too pleased with what happened but it got back on track, thank God.</p> <p> Before I finish I want to pay tribute to groups in my constituency that are keeping us entertained online during this lockdown.  I refer to groups like Cahir Comhaltas, Ballycommon Comhaltas, the In Tune for Life Orchestra in Ballycommon, Mr. Aidan O'Donnell and Music Generation in Tipperary, Mr. Paul Lafford and the famous Ms Louise Morrissey who sings in nursing homes, organised as I noted earlier by Mr. Paddy Doheny.  I also thank Mr. Paddy Doheny himself and Mr. John Allen for making the bookings.  I refer to Garda Superintendent Eddie Golden, Mr. Ned Lonergan and many others.  They give of their time out of the goodness of their hearts, with no calls for encores.  This is their culture and heritage and they espouse it for all of us to see and enjoy.  I really thank them and I hope the Minister will ensure that the funding trickles down to the ordinary people on the ground, na daoine beaga.</p></speech>

Ensuring that the arts and our culture survive and thrive is just one way that we can make this happen.  The Irish spirit is creative and artistic and has shown itself to be resilient during this crisis.  We need to do what we can to make sure that the cultural and artistic capacity of communities and volunteer groups is strengthened.</p> <p>They should be directly supported, given that they, like so many others, have suffered a crippling loss of revenue.</p> <p> How theatres and community presentations come through this will require real imagination and practical insight, and, of course, a strong commitment.  Many theatres across this State were adversely impacted due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  A well-known theatre in my own constituency, Birr Theatre and Arts Centre, had just commenced an impressive and moving musical production, called "The Hired Man", before the onset of the pandemic.  I had the pleasure of attending one of the first nights of this production, which I have to say was absolutely breathtaking.  The production showcased the amazing talent of many participants from the small rural town of Birr, a town of great character and spirit where the arts flourish.  Will theatres such as Birr Theatre and Arts Centre be provided with grants to offset some of the losses that they have incurred during this pandemic?  I am urgently calling for grants to be made available to ensure that the arts continue to flourish in all parts of this State.  Is there a breakdown of finance to be directed to theatres available yet?  Will the Minister please ensure that grants are available urgently to ensure the survival of our theatres in the future?</p></speech>

In response to Deputy Mattie McGrath, my Department provides significant support to Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann and will continue to do so.  We support the sector but we also have to maintain our focus on protecting public health.  Deputy Nolan mentioned the Birr theatre.  There are already schemes within the Department and one would hope that they will continue.  The Arts Council is honouring all existing funding arrangements and it asks regularly-funded arts organisations to prioritise their own payments to artists in turn.  Since 12 March, it has fast-tracked the payment of up to 90% of funding to organisations and individuals.  It may well be that we have to constantly review this because nobody knows how long this Covid-19 emergency will last, or even the shape of it, especially in theatres.  I acknowledge the difficulties that they face in particular.  The bigger theatres such as the Abbey Theatre and Gaiety Theatre are scheduled to reopen in phase 5, the last phase.  Some Deputies have mentioned regional theatres and they are very important for well-being, as Deputy Nolan touched upon.  We are very conscious of this and will do all that we can to support them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.393" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1518" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="00:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400101#JJJJJ00300"><p>We are in the middle of a decade of commemorations.  It is important to remember and commemorate the role of artists and culture in that, in affirming Irish Independence and even justifying Irish Independence in a certain way.  Why are we an independent State?  What makes us different?  What was the impetus to become an independent State?  It very much related to culture and cultural nationalism, in which artists played a significant role.</p>  <p>  I represent the constituency of Clare and, like every single constituency and as said by every Deputy who spoke here, there are a number of festivals that I wish to mention which are not going ahead and which make our summer something to celebrate, even if the weather is not as good as we would like.  Three are supported by the Arts Council.  There is the Feakle Festival.  Martin Hayes is a proponent of that and comes from that tradition, which is unique to east Clare.  There is the Willie Clancy Festival in Milton Malbay.  There is also the Killaloe Chamber Music Festival.  They all receive Arts Council funding.  The Scariff Harbour Festival is part of a North-South initiative and celebrates our waterways.  It is sponsored by Waterways Ireland.  One of those festivals which gets an Arts Council grant has determined that it will keep the grant.  It states that it is a grant to support the arts and it will keep it to pay the artists.</p> <p>The other festival organisers to whom I have spoken are not sure if they can do that.  I ask the Minister to confirm whether they can.  I am not saying they would use the money to support administration, but they could keep the Arts Council grant to give to the artists who otherwise would not have a source of income.  In the case of Waterways Ireland, which supports the Scariff Harbour festival, it is not a grant, it is sponsorship and it is more difficult to sponsor an event that is not taking place.  Nevertheless, a number of artists were engaged to participate in that festival and because it has been cancelled many of the artists have returned the deposits, without question.  This is not about people greedily trying to hold on to money but I wonder whether there is a way we can pay people at a time when they desperately need that money.  Very few people get rich out of the arts or culture in Ireland and this is a particular time of need for them.  I ask the Minister if she could clarify the position with Arts Council grants and if she could see fit, even Waterways Ireland sponsorship.</p></speech>

We have no difficulty with that at all.  The Deputy mentioned a few festivals in Clare, such as Consairt&iacute;n.  That has been cancelled.  Funding of &euro;4,000 was provided to it.  The Killaloe Chamber Music festival was granted funding of &euro;16,000.  The Ennis Book Club festival commenced.  It received a grant of &euro;27,000.  Deputy McNamara also mentioned the Scoil Samhraidh Willie Clancy and the Iniscealtra Festival of Arts.  As yet, neither of those has been cancelled.  The Corofin Traditional festival took place already, as did the Shannonside Winter Music Festival.  There are a number of festivals.  County Clare is a very busy place for festivals.</p>  <p>  The summer festivals have been especially affected by the impact of Covid-19.  As Deputies may be aware, the main funding provided for festivals across the country is from my Department's small-scale local festivals and summer schools scheme and the Arts Council festivals investment scheme which is also for larger festivals such as the Galway Arts Festival, in addition to the Arts Council's strategic funding stream.  The applications have recently closed so my Department has not yet assessed some of the applications but the details I have outlined might be sufficient to respond to Deputy McNamara's questions.</p>  <p>  Regarding commemorations, on 2 January 2020 when I was in Cork City Hall we announced a significant decade of centenaries programme.  This Sunday, I have the National Famine Commemoration Day, which will take place in St. Stephen's Green this year.  It was in Sligo last year.  We are doing as much as we can in terms of commemorations.  It is a real shame for Cork in particular because it had a great programme of events lined up.  There is a series of events commemorating the assassination of the Lord Mayor, Tom&aacute;s Mac Curtain, and the election of Terence MacSwiney as the new Lord Mayor.  We are doing everything we can.  We are talking to the county councils in Cork about those, but Deputy McNamara is probably more interested in Clare.</p></speech>

I am very conscious that my colleague also has a question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-14a.397" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1577" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="00:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020051400102#KKKKK00400"><p>I was going to ask the Minister a number of questions but perhaps I will just make a number of comments.  As I listened to her and previous Governments, the phenomenon of cognitive dissonance comes to mind.  I refer to the state of having inconsistent thoughts, beliefs or attitudes especially in relation to behaviour.  We treasure the arts on a national and international basis but then practically we give them very little.  I think cognitive dissonance absolutely captures that.</p>  <p>  I have to hand a speech from the Minister's colleague, her predecessor as Minister, Deputy Humphreys, from almost four years ago.  She stated, "...we state clearly that supporting culture and creativity is vital if we want to create both a fairer society and a thriving economy."  She went on to say something which I am sure the Minister would endorse tonight.  She stated, "The arts are absolutely essential to the wellbeing of the Irish people and there is no doubt that a thriving arts and culture sector makes a hugely positive contribution."</p>  <p>Yet, when we look at the proportion of our GDP, it is 0.1%.  I welcome the Covid payments and the other wage subsidy payments to the extent that the artists can benefit from that.  The Minister took exception to the countries mentioned, so I will mention Scotland.</p> <p>Scotland announced three funds comprising &pound;12.5 million for its population of just under 6 million.  That works out at &pound;2.29 per head of population.  Ireland announced &euro;1 million, 50% of which was already committed.  That works out at 20 cents a head.  The Minister could make a comparison between the two.  <br/><br/>Will the Minister commit to meeting with the National Campaign for the Arts if she has not already done so?  It has seven very practical points.  It is asking for &euro;20 million, recognition of the crisis and a long-term plan.<br/><br/>To go back to cognitive dissonance, I took part in a debate today in which the figure of &euro;12 billion for small businesses was mentioned by the same Minister.  I fully endorse that.  Such businesses are the backbone of our society.  The document produced by John Moran, of the Land Development Agency fame, talks about &euro;15 billion and says that, while it is very expensive, we cannot afford not to do it.  Yet we look at the arts and talk about a tiny amount of money.  We are not giving recognition to the importance of arts to the economy, not to mention anything else.  It is ironic that one of the bestsellers at the moment is <i>The Plague</i>by Albert Camus from 1947.  That tells us something, does it not?  It is a bestseller at the moment.  We resort to art, including literature and music, all of the time.  This has all been said.  <br/><br/>My difficulty is that I am really tired of spin.  I understand the Minister has a job to do but, at some stage, we must make language mean something.  I have made this point numerous times in my short time here in the D&aacute;il.  If we value the arts and realise how important they are to us - and we certainly have in recent months - we must put an economic value on that and put forward a long-term plan that ensures the viability of the sector.<br/><br/>I have many documents in front of me but I will refer to one, which is titled &quot;Review of Arts Centres and Venues&quot;, published last year.  It is a very practical document for local authorities.  It pointed out the good points but also pointed out what was missing.  The National Campaign for the Arts has also done this.  It made it very simple for us as regards Galway.  It made five points about providing a space to perform, a space to learn and a space to share.  It also made a few other points in that regard.  In a very practical and simple way, it told us what was necessary.  <br/><br/>Will the Minister please meet with the campaign?  It represents many organisations on the ground and approximately 23,000 artists.  It is not looking for charity or even for a handout.  These artists are looking to survive so that we can continue to thrive because of our artists.  That is all I am asking of the Minister tonight.  Can we please stop with the spin?  I thank her for her contribution as regards what has been given so far but it is not being done in context because they will not survive unless urgent action is taken.</p></speech>
