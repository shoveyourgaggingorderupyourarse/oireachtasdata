Accordingly, I will proceed to put the two proposals relating to this week's business.  Is the proposal for dealing with today's business agreed to?</p></speech>

It is to be taken after the Taoiseach's questions.  There is a fundamental problem here because there is a flaw in this process.  These Revised Estimates have not yet been published.  We, as a party, have sought a detailed briefing on them; we have not got one.  If we hold off passing this motion until 2 o'clock, it will delay the publication of the Revised Estimates even more.  This is a very unusual circumstance.  We have a caretaker Government and an unelected Minister.  We have Estimates being presented which, based on the figures we have seen, suggest that the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and the wage subsidy scheme will end in June.  That is outrageous if that is the proposition that is being put or if it is the case that the Estimates are going to be out of date even before we debate them.  This is ludicrous.  We cannot support the Order of Business unless we get a guarantee from Government that the Estimates will be published today as soon as possible and that there is a clear verbal briefing for the Opposition.  We have sought it in writing and have been told that it is not forthcoming.  That is unacceptable.  We will oppose the Order of Business if we do not get that commitment from Government.</p></speech>

The sessions we are having this week, and indeed every week, were established on the basis that we could ask questions of Ministers and get accountability during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Last week in the D&aacute;il, I was given a commitment by the CMO that they would publish the minutes of the expert advisory group to NPHET.</p></speech>

Let us face it, people have been overpaid and now we will run out of money to pay the real people who need it.  We need to see the Estimates and the spokespersons of the groups in the Oireachtas need to get a decent and full briefing by the Minister.  I also have issues about tomorrow's business but that is another matter.</p></speech>

If any changes are to be made to the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, in future, the Government has not made that decision.  Like many Estimates in the past, this allows the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to continue to pay all social welfare payments - pensions, disability, carers, one-parent family, PUP, all of it - beyond 8 June when the Department will reach 80% of its funding ceiling.  If this is not passed, it will not be possible for the Department to continue to pay any social welfare or pension payment from 8 June.  It is done on a no-policy-change basis; all we are asking the House is for authorisation to keep paying those payments.</p></speech>

Nobody is being asked to vote for any legislation or change to the pandemic unemployment payment.  No decision has been made on that by Government.  This is an Estimates motion to allow the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to continue to pay pensions and other welfare payments from 8 June because if it is not passed, the Department will meet its 80% ceiling and cannot pay any payments.  In normal times, and I appreciate these are not normal times, this is the kind of thing that would be passed by the House after a committee hearing of an hour or an hour and a half, probably with very limited debate and no vote on it.</p> <p>I fully appreciate that Deputies will want to raise and discuss other issues but the only question being asked of the House is to pass this Estimate in order that all social welfare payments can continue to be paid from 8 June on a no-policy-change basis.</p></speech>

As I have already said in this House, a week ago, if not two weeks ago, it is the intention of the Government to extend the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and the wage subsidy scheme but that is a separate issue.  A Cabinet decision has not been made on that yet.  That will have to be done, probably some time next week.  All we are asking the House to do tomorrow is to vote on a social welfare Estimate to allow us to continue to pay existing social welfare payments and pensions from 8 June.  Because of the massive rise in unemployment, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is running out of money and we need an Estimate passed in order that it can make those payments on 8 June.</p></speech>

I believe it is bizarre that we would consider an Estimate on Thursday which has implications for the rest of the year and yet Members are not to be provided with information as to the implications of that until there is a Cabinet decision next week.  It was my understanding that we would have some clarity on both the PUP and the wage subsidy scheme in advance of considering the Estimate here on Thursday.  The Taoiseach is now telling us that that is not the case and I think it makes a farce of what we are to consider on Thursday.</p></speech>

That is not a problem but I wish to clarify that it is the intention of the Government to extend the pandemic unemployment payment beyond 8 June and the wage subsidy scheme as well.  The Government has yet to make a decision on to when they are extended but that is not what the Estimate Vote is about; it is about allowing the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to continue to pay all existing pension and welfare payments after 8 June, because the money runs out then.</p></speech>

We all understand that.  We all want to ensure that all payments are continued, as in the normal course of events, but this will probably be a huge overrun or demand.  We all understand that but we need to have accountability.  We need the Minister to provide a proper briefing in order that we know exactly where we are going.  We are very much putting the cart before the horse.  That is not fair or right.  I do not think the Taoiseach understands where we are coming from on this issue.  We do not want to delay the Estimate and we do not want to deny anybody payments but we want to see where we are going and to cut our cloth according to our measure.  We must understand what we are doing.</p></speech>

I am sure he appreciates that this is an important part of our work here in the D&aacute;il.  We all accept that we are in unprecedented times.  We have a Minister who is not elected.  We have a caretaker Government.  We have our job to do.  A briefing needs to take place.</p>  <p>  Following on from Deputy Naughten's point, which I also made, it is ludicrous that a decision has not been made on those other payments.  We are being asked to vote on a Revised Estimate when hundreds of thousands of workers are concerned about what will happen.  The Taoiseach has said there may be changes and there may be an extension to the payments.</p></speech>

People who are in receipt of the payment will continue to get it beyond 8 June.  I can give that assurance to the House.  The economy is only now slowly opening up.  The payment will have to be extended.  Nobody needs to worry.  As Members know, the pandemic unemployment payment expires if a recipient is offered his or her job back, but with that proviso.  Anyone who has not been offered his or her job back will continue to receive the payment beyond June.  This Government or the new Government will have to make a decision as to how long that will be extended.  We will also have to deal with some of the anomalies of which people are already aware.  A certain number of part-time workers are now receiving more in the pandemic unemployment payment every week than they did in January and February, before the pandemic happened. </p></speech>

They may well be decisions for the next Government and may require a further Revised Estimate in the future.  Over the course of the next week or two we will need Revised Estimates for a lot of Departments, but they will be brought to the House on a no policy change basis because as much as possible we want any new policy decisions to be made by the next Government, but sometimes we do not have any choice.  As the various parties that claim to want to form a Government have failed to do so, we have to continue in our capacity as the Government and make decisions as necessary.  As much as possible, however, we will leave the big policy decisions to the next Government, whenever it forms.</p></speech>

Obviously we had to make a decision, but I am not satisfied that we cannot have the Minister here tomorrow for two hours with a break of 40 minutes.  Like everybody else, I want to see convincing evidence of scientific and medical advice.  Maybe I picked it up wrongly from the Whip, but my understanding at the meeting was that the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Regina Doherty, had no problem with appearing, but the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health would not allow two hours.  We had this issue last week with the Minister.</p> <p>We expect workers throughout the country to work on building sites and everywhere else that, thankfully, we have opened, although we need to open more of them.  We have a different rule for the House, in spite of the size of the Chamber and the distancing between the seats.  I appreciate the efforts of staff and everybody else, as well as those on the front line, but this has gone on too long.  We need to see the evidence, not just hear it, so that we can understand and appreciate it.  There is a great deal of conflicting evidence in respect of the rules being imposed.</p> <p> I saw Deputy Kelly smiling a moment ago because he has been looking for the minutes for months, but it is like pulling teeth.  One cannot get a dentist's appointment and one cannot get the minutes, which is strange.  I object to the proposal for dealing with tomorrow's business.</p></speech>

The first relates to how we conduct our business based on the guidelines.  I know the advice is that every workplace is different but look at the size of this place.  This is ridiculous.

We have certain conditions in the Chamber that we do not expect workers or employers throughout Ireland to mirror.</p>  <p>  The Labour Party and I have a deep concern about whether a dangerous precedent is being created.  Within these conditions, we could be working like this for a considerable period, and the likelihood is that we will be.  The precedent set last week by the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, will now be pushed on this week, although admittedly in a slight variation, which I respect.  Is a dangerous precedent being set?  If or when a Government is formed, how will the Oireachtas honour the Constitution and ensure Ministers are held to account working in those conditions, given that it may be unworkable?  We need to tread very carefully here.</p></speech>

It stated there was no public health advice anywhere that suggested a two-hour limit for meetings but rather that it was an issue of contact tracing, which the professor then described as a rule of thumb that public health officials had put together.  I respectfully suggest there are issues with that and I think Deputy Kelly is correct that we should examine how we look at it in the future.  I am aware of one parliament in Europe where 180 MPs turned up for a roll call today.  While I do not suggest we do that, we need to look at how we will work this out into the future.  I have my concerns about meeting in the Convention Centre and the costs of that.  We have to rethink how we set about this.  Notwithstanding the advice that has been received, the two-hour rule does not make sense to me as we move on.  In the letter we received last week, Professor Cormican stated there was a very low possibility of anything happening to anybody in these circumstances.  We are practising social distancing, good hygiene and so on.  We need to look at the matter again.</p></speech>

It is certainly not an argument for minimising ministerial appearances for the purposes of public scrutiny and should not be used for that purpose.  As Deputy Kelly has said, we have here the benefit of great ventilation for all the hot air, from this end and not from the Ceann Comhairle's end.  We have many advantages as a workplace.  Our job is to maximise the interactions we can have and not to minimise them.  I am concerned that this is being used for people to minimise their appearances here and the necessary scrutiny.  This is very concerning.</p> <p> We are now moving into a phase of thoughtful and careful unwinding of the public emergency measures.  People are anxious to get back to work and they will get back to work, but they must see that we are back at work too.  This is very important.  I do not see why Ministers and officials cannot present themselves.  We have the space to make the necessary arrangements.  The two-hour rule around defining close contacts arises specifically in the unfortunate event of an infection.  That is the status.  I believe the correspondence made that very clear.</p></speech>

That this has not happened is a problem.  This was discussed in detail at the Business Committee.  There is deep unease that there are two sets of rules depending on who one is, and that we expect people to do an eight-hour shift where the same sorts of issues do not impact.</p>  <p>  I do not want to hold up, nor will I object to, tomorrow's business.  We do need, however, to square the circle in how we go on from here.  It is not just about setting the agenda for this week.  It is also about how we will deal with things next week, next month and in six months' time.  The proposal is not good enough.  We must find a mechanism to deal with this so we can have some degree of normality, hold the Government to account and have committee meetings, all within the Covid-19 confines that are patently there.</p></speech>

Public health advice about the health implications of proximity is acting as a barrier to having further committees to cover the many different areas in our society where people are in real trouble and need their voices heard.  We are told we can only have one committee because of physical constraints relating to public health guidelines.  It looks like these are just excuses.</p>  <p>  I will throw a real spanner into the works now.  There is no consistency on the issue of who is considered a close contact of a person who is Covid-positive.  I am sure all Members have been reading the RT&Eacute; website since the outbreak of this crisis.  At the end of every single article, it says that a person who has been in close contact in the same room as somebody else for more than 15 minutes - not two hours - is a close contact.  It says that this is the public health advice.  On that basis, nothing in this country would be operating at all.  It is nonsense.  We need consistency on this.  The difference is that essential workers have been working all the time under very different conditions of close contact - according to these definitions, for two hours or 15 minutes - to keep our society functioning-----</p></speech>

It is important that the Estimate is adopted.  I have a very serious concern around the justification for the way the Minister will present to the House tomorrow.</p> <p>This is referencing the justification given last week by the Minister for Health as his reason not to come in to answer legitimate questions which I had raised here the week before regarding the operation of the meat industry which had been found to be correct.  There is absolutely no medical basis for the justification that was given by the Minister for Health here last week.  I do not want to see that now being used as a mechanism and a justification to set a precedent for Ministers not to be held accountable here for legitimate issues regarding the operation and management of Covid-19, as well as many other issues which will arise over the next 12 months, 18 months and two years until these restrictions are lifted.</p></speech>

There is a difference between the call from many Members for a debate on the principle of this two-hour duration regime, which I believe would be more appropriately explored in some detail at the Covid committee.  There is a difference between that and the issue before us today, which is simply a piece on the Order of Business, namely, do we or do we not transact the business tomorrow.</p>  <p>  The second point Members must bear in mind is that they should read Standing Order 29 which makes it abundantly clear that it is a matter for the Government to determine which, as well as how, Ministers come in to respond to matters raised on the floor of the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.116" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700009#G00300"><p>I was about to make that point.  It has always been the case - at least for as long as I have been in the House - that the Government decides which Ministers come in.  It is often that a different Minister comes in but it is always the case a Minister is there.</p>  <p>  On the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, guidance, for the benefit of Deputy Boyd Barrett, it is actually both, namely, 15 minutes in close proximity or two hours in the same space.</p>  <p>  We are, however, all feeling our way through an unprecedented scenario.  The truth is that, as the virus diminishes in the community - there were only 30 or so new cases yesterday - we are able to take more calculated risks.  What might have been the right thing to do two or three weeks ago, may be different now and may be different again in the next couple of weeks.  We should accept that it is a risk, however.  There is a genuine risk that if there is any Minister or politician here for more than two hours and somebody else in the Chamber or they test positive, then all of the people in the Chamber will be required to self-isolate for 14 days.  That is the truth.  The objective is to make sure that the Government is held to account.</p></speech>

The Minister, Regina Doherty, is happy to take the Supplementary Estimate.  I do not understand why it will take six hours given that it is a straightforward, no-policy change, Supplementary Estimate.  She is happy to do it, however.  The logical thing to do is that she does two hours here and then move directly to the committee room to do the rest from there.  Then we can leave the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, out of it, if Members want Regina Doherty to be the one to do the full six hours.  The solution would be for her to do two hours here in the Chamber and then move to the committee room for the next two, four or whatever number of hours it will take.</p></speech>

It must be the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, or another Minister, who must move it.</p>  <p>  Standing Order 29 is about the Government deciding what Ministers come in.  We have no issue with that.  We are told by the Whip that the Minister, Regina Doherty, has no issue with coming in.  The problem is with this two-hour trick - we can call it that rather than a three-card trick - which is continuing, meaning the Government will not come in and be held accountable.</p>  <p>  I am objecting to tomorrow&rsquo;s business on that basis.

For the first time in 65 days, there were no reported Covid-19 deaths, evidence that our sacrifices are making a difference and that lives are being saved and protected.  Last night, the figure was nine deaths, a tragic and timely reminder that this is not over and that we will have days of sadness as well as days of hope ahead before we prevail.</p>  <p>  I know this has been a painful struggle for people across our island.  Too many loved ones have lost their lives and too many lives are still at risk.  As of last night, 1,615 people have died in our State from Covid-19, and a further 514 in Northern Ireland.  The fact that the trend is going in the right direction does not lessen the grief of those who have lost loved ones, nor the fear of those who know somebody with Covid today.  In total, 24,735 people in the Republic of Ireland have been diagnosed with Covid-19.  Some 325,795 tests have been carried out, including 30,000 in the past week, of which 633 were positive, resulting in a positivity rate of 2.1%.  That rate continues to decline.</p>  <p>  My message today is that we need to hold firm.  As a Government, we will not jump the gun by taking an unnecessary risks with public health.  Any announcement of whether we can go to phase 2 or whether we can make any changes to the plan will wait until 5 June, when we will have more data available and the latest advice from NPHET.</p>  <p>  Ar an Luan bhaineamar sprioc th&aacute;bhachtach amach nuair nach raibh b&aacute;sanna nua ar bith le tuairisci&uacute;.  Ba mhaith liom tuilleadh laethanta d&oacute;chais mar seo a fheice&aacute;il.  Is &iacute; teachtaireacht an lae inniu n&aacute; seasamh go daingean go f&oacute;ill.  Leanaimis ar aghaidh leis na h&iacute;obairt&iacute; at&aacute; &aacute; nd&eacute;anamh againn sa chaoi go leanfaidh an claonadh ar aghaidh sa treo ceart.  Fanfaidh aon fh&oacute;gra ar cib&eacute; a rachaimid ar aghaidh go c&eacute;im a d&oacute; n&oacute; go nd&eacute;anaimid aon athruithe eile don phlean go dt&iacute; an c&uacute;igi&uacute; l&aacute; de mh&iacute; an Mheithimh.  Fanfaimid ionas go mbeidh n&iacute;os m&oacute; sonra&iacute; agus eolas le f&aacute;il &oacute; na saineolaithe.  Idir an d&aacute; linn seasfaimid go daingean agus gheobhaimid an ceann is fearr air.</p>  <p>  Covid is a tragedy for all of us, but most of all for those who lost their lives or someone close to them.  It is something we all wish had not befallen us.  History teaches us that from every tragedy there are lessons to be learned and that from every crisis come opportunities for positive change.  We must build on the solidarity we have seen over the past few months and work towards a better Ireland.  We owe that to everyone who has been impacted by Covid and to the choices that have been made by so many that have got us to this point.  Covid has kept us from our loved ones, leaving some of us feeling anxious and isolated.  It has up-ended our businesses and halted our livelihoods.  At worst, it has stolen lives and devastated families.  This is an emergency that has disrupted our society.  It has also challenged us to work differently, to make changes that in normal times might have taken years to implement and prompted us to reflect on what really matters in life.</p>  <p>  I believe there are six major opportunities that arise from the terrible tragedy of Covid.  If we seize them, we will be better prepared for future pandemics or a second wave, should it come, and we will also make our country a better place for us all.  The opportunities are building permanent public health and well-being infrastructure, reviewing how we care for older people, changing our approach to sickness in the workplace, embracing better work&ndash;life balance, reducing unnecessary travel and respecting our natural environment.</p>  <p>  East Asian democracies learned from the SARS crisis and were much better prepared for Covid than western ones were.  We need to be better prepared for a second wave if it comes and also for future outbreaks of new viruses.  This means building up a much better and permanent public health infrastructure to test for, track, trace and treat infectious diseases, not just Covid.  Linked to this should be a new focus on well-being, for example through an enhanced vaccine programme such as the enhanced flu vaccine programme for this winter, which we have planned already.  We can build on what we have done to reduce smoking and alcohol consumption through the Healthy Ireland framework, with added emphasis on reducing obesity, physical inactivity and addiction.</p>  <p>  Across the western world, Covid has exacted a terrible toll on nursing homes.</p> <p>I am aware there is a lot of focus at the moment on when and for how long visitor restrictions should be in place.  That is important but it begs a bigger question; is this the model of care we want for older people?  Do we want to have no visitors, residents confined to the home, and staff dressed head to toe in PPE for months on end?  I do not think so.  We need to think again about alternatives and follow through on a new statutory funding model for home care, as well as more supported housing options for older citizens as they age.  We will not have to do so from scratch.  A lot of the groundwork has already been done by the outgoing Government.  When it comes to nursing homes and social care generally, we need greater integration with the health service, not a separation of social care from healthcare as some advocate, as well as clear clinical governance in order that there is no confusion about who is in charge of medical issues when they arise.<br/><br/>In Ireland we often talk about high levels of absenteeism in the workplace and the impact that has on productivity.  That is a real problem, but sometimes so is presenteeism.  In some professional settings, one is expected to go to work even when one is sick.  Sometimes this might be done out of commitment to one&rsquo;s work, at other times it is because of guilt - one just does not want to let the side down or impose extra work on a busy team.  In sectors like retail and hospitality, sick pay arrangements are poor and many staff simply cannot afford to take a sick day.  This is not good for the individual who is sick or for society, in terms of infection control.  Covid and the new Covid-related sick pay arrangements have changed this.  We cannot go back to the <i>status quo ante</i>.<br/><br/>I know from listening to a lot of people, especially busy working parents, the extent to which they have appreciated the opportunity to be at home a little more.  There has been more time for family, more time for couples to see each other, and more dinners at home or time together in front of the television.  Some overworked parents - mums and dads - are treasuring the extra time they are getting with their kids.  Of course, we all want the school and cr&egrave;ches to open as soon as it is safe to do so and for normal working and social life to resume but the bell has been rung when it comes to work-life balance and it cannot be unrung.  Home working is now evidently doable for many, as are core hours, flexible hours, job sharing and team working.  Of course, none of this is new but employers, employees and Government should work together to make it more mainstream.<br/><br/>The use of technologies like Zoom and Webex has enabled us to do so much remotely and digitally, including staff meetings, conferences, online education, e-seminars, medical consultations, residents' meetings and club meetings, and even political summits.  It is no substitute for meeting people in person but perhaps we can find a better balance than heretofore.  Better use of technology will mean fewer journeys, fewer business trips, less traffic, better air quality and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.  The public and private sectors need to make sure we do not simply drift back to the old way of doing things.<br/><br/>I also believe the emergency has given us a better respect of our natural environment.  Because the traffic is so much quieter, we can hear the dawn chorus again.  We see foxes at dusk and wildlife is thriving.  As an island, we have an abundance of land and sea, rivers, mountains, lakes and bogs.  This crisis has reminded us how lucky we are to live in a country like Ireland.  I think we all value our natural heritage a little bit more and we need to ensure more people can experience it in a sustainable way in the future. <br/><br/>To recap, we are only starting to fathom the enormous cost of Covid in terms of human life lost, economic damage and damage to the public finances.  Even so, out of this tragedy we should identify and build on some of the good things we have seen and some of the lessons we have learned.  We see some of this thinking in the significant set of proposals published this morning by the European Commission, which include proposals on how countries will recover economically from this crisis.  There are also new proposals for the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and I will give the House an update on these next week.  As always, I look forward to hearing the comments, observations and contributions of Members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700015#P00100"><p>As we near the end of the third month of the Covid-19 pandemic, we must never forget to remember the great impact it has had.  As of today, well over 2,000 people on this island have lost their lives.  Hundreds are still fighting the virus and there is absolutely no doubt that things could have been much worse without the severe action which has been taken here and throughout the world.  As I have said every week during these debates, mistakes are inevitable when we have a fast-moving and unprecedented emergency.  The best responses are always defined by a willingness to listen to different voices, acknowledge problems and move quickly.  Our primary focus here must remain on helping those who are suffering from the virus, continuing to suppress its spread and moving to restart social and economic life as quickly as can safely be achieved.</p>  <p>  There is simply no question but that major errors were made in terms of the speed and impact of policies in regard to nursing homes.  This is emphatically not simply an issue of the public versus the private systems because some of the biggest clusters have been in public facilities, an issue which has got lost in some of the debate to date.  At a much earlier stage of the pandemic, I and a number of my party's spokespeople raised serious concerns about policy concerning nursing homes.  To be honest, the answers we received did not show the level of transparency and responsiveness which should have been expected.  Deputy Stephen Donnelly has shown how concerns about the lack of a proper voice for nursing homes on key committees were justified.  As we heard yesterday, the facts concerning the transfer of asylum seekers across the country into a new facility, with no regard to the spreading of the virus, are developing constantly.  They suggest another serious systems failure.</p>  <p>  Tagra&iacute;m do na tithe altranais.  Is l&eacute;ir gur tharla bot&uacute;in mh&oacute;ra.  N&iacute; raibh na polasaithe maidir leo l&aacute;idir a dh&oacute;thain.  Is l&eacute;ir &oacute;n gcomhfhreagras idir an Roinn agus Nursing Homes Ireland go raibh siad i gcruach&aacute;s agus go raibh taca&iacute;ocht &aacute; lorg acu &oacute;n t&uacute;s ach bh&iacute; na h&uacute;dar&aacute;is mall ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leo.  Caithfimid a admh&aacute;il go raibh na deacrachta&iacute; c&eacute;anna ag na tithe altranais san earn&aacute;il phoibl&iacute; agus a bh&iacute; ag na tithe altranais san earn&aacute;il phr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideach.  An rud is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; anois n&aacute; go bhfoghlaimeofar ceachtanna &oacute;n m&eacute;id a tharla go dt&iacute; seo.</p>  <p>  However, the scale of the work still required during this emergency is such that trying to litigate past failures cannot be the priority now.  What we need to know is that measures are in place to make sure that nothing like these failures could recur if and when a second wave of the virus appears before we have an effective and widely administered vaccine.  The overall situation today is that Europe as a whole has entered a new phase in the response.  A fortnight ago, countries of a similar size to Ireland, such as Denmark, Finland, Croatia and Austria, started reporting record lows in new infections and days with no deaths.  This has happened weeks after they began to implement opening-up measures.  After Germany's major reopening moves, there were reports of a rise in its virus reproduction rate, but two weeks later, it appears that the figure is well below one and is in line with Ireland's figure.</p>  <p>  The good news we have had this week confirms that Ireland is following the increasingly well-established pattern in Europe for the containment of the virus.  However, there is every reason to be concerned about whether we are handling the process of the return of social and economic activity properly.  The evidence is that there remains a broad and strong compliance amongst the public when it comes to measures they have been told are essential.  Eighty per cent are staying home and few in urban areas are moving more than 5 km from their homes.  A serious concern, though, is that there is a very real danger of a growing division in the population between those who fear change and those who are angry about restrictions which appear not to be fully justified scientifically.  Certainly, people are entitled to look at measures implemented in countries where the community spread of the virus has not spiked and ask why the situation in Ireland should be so different.</p>  <p>  In my view, there is no remaining serious justification for the 5 km limit.  The public health concern is how people behave around others, not how far they are from their home.</p> <p>In fact, the research shows that this limit may be forcing people in urban areas into more crowded situations.  This also applies to the 20 km rule, which is envisaged to replace the 5 km rule.  I do not see a logic or scientific basis for it.  I believe we must deal with that more expeditiously.  T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an gceist seo, mar t&aacute; s&eacute; in am deireadh a chur leis na teorainneacha 5 km agus 20 km agus gan bacadh leo.  N&iacute;l aon chiall ag baint leis na teorainneacha agus srianta seo agus n&iacute;l aon bhun&uacute;s eola&iacute;ochta leo.  T&aacute; siad ag cur br&uacute; ar dhaoine agus t&aacute; daoine m&iacute;shuaimhneach f&uacute;thu.</p> <p> Equally, the current distinctions between different types of shops are, at best, arbitrary.  Supermarkets have been open throughout the pandemic while implementing measures for distancing and hygiene.  The figures on community spread suggest that supermarkets have not played a role in spreading the virus, where the overwhelming issue is clustering in health facilities, which has been the dominant one, nursing homes and some workplaces, such as meat factories.  That is where the big clusters have been.  The supermarkets are a lesson and perhaps require more research in terms of how it worked so well there.</p> <p> In general, the overriding need now is to move to a situation where the focus is put on showing people how to behave once most activity is restored.  We do not need empty, feel-good advertising with a single photograph and a hashtag, but a simple public education campaign.  Last week, the media began carrying stories about loosening to be announced on 5 June and most people have concluded, as was the case when the loosening steps were first published, that announcements are being delayed rather than being made as soon as they are justified.  The restrictions in place today in respect of most workplaces and many social activities will lose public support if they are no longer seen as being based on clear scientific evidence.</p> <p> With regard to the 2 m guidance, which it has been acknowledged is not required by the science, it has been helpful but it cannot be allowed to block Ireland restarting activity that is already under way elsewhere without a negative impact.  If it is true that our capacity to rapidly test, trace and isolate is now in place, we must see this reflected in the loosening of policies put in place, in part, because we had lacked this capacity.  I note the Taoiseach's comments, but it appears that this is still the issue.  Testing, tracing and isolating the virus is ultimately the best guarantor we have.  The greater activity in the D&aacute;il in the past few weeks must be followed by a review of restrictions so that they are not arbitrary and they move us as quickly as possible to fully restart our core democratic institutions.</p> <p> As I have communicated directly to the Government, we need immediate clarity on the reopening of special needs education and its provision during July.  I am aware that the Government is conscious of that and is examining it.  In many countries, the limited reopening of certain classes has been achieved and there is no obvious reason for an announcement on what will happen being delayed.  This has been particularly severe for parents of children with special needs and the children themselves.  I have talked to teachers who have communicated through technology with them and I believe we must move heaven and earth to see if we can facilitate a return to routine, particularly for children on the autism spectrum.</p> <p> During the debate on the social welfare Estimates, Fianna F&aacute;il spokespeople set out in detail our approach to the overall economic and fiscal issues.  There is no doubt that we have yet to see a proper response to critical issues.  The basic strategy being followed in much of Europe is to try to kick-start a rapid recovery and to change critical fiscal benchmarks to reflect the unique nature of a rapid onset recession caused by a pandemic.  The overall principle is that the pandemic response should not be allowed to be a financial millstone dragging down budgets, companies and families.  It is not yet clear that this is fully understood or accepted here and there are two areas of major concern.  First, there is the failure to show much greater urgency and ambition in preventing otherwise sustainable Irish businesses from suffering a terminal cash flow crisis.  Sustainable growth for Ireland is utterly dependent on this sector, but short-term measures have not been followed with a credible plan to define the scale of what is needed or to push for new types of support.</p> <p> Second, there is a refusal to give support to critical public companies and institutions.  Due to Government policy in recent years, higher education institutions have been pushed to make up funding shortfalls through international programmes.</p> <p>These have collapsed everywhere in the world and leave the universities in particular facing a shortfall of hundreds of millions of euro yet, as the <i>Irish Independent</i>reported yesterday, the response of the Minister for Education and Skills has been to tell them that they will have to simply suck up the deficit.  This has quite rightly shocked tens of thousands of people working in a sector critical to our future.  The same is being repeated in public enterprises of all types.  In a world where the German Government can funnel hundreds of millions of euro into protecting one airline, the refusal to prepare a detailed plan for saving our public transport companies is inexplicable.<br/><br/>At the moment, commentary about what the fiscal position will be later this year, let alone in five years' time, is based on informed speculation.  We do not know yet what the impact will be but, of course, we do know that there is nothing sustainable in having more than 1 million people directly and indirectly receiving wage supports from the Government.  Anyone who claims that an emergency response to an unprecedented emergency should be kept in place forever is simply playing politics with a profoundly important issue.  However, if we want to rebuild our economy we cannot do that unless we act now to prevent smaller businesses going bankrupt and put in place a proper rescue package for our public companies and institutions.</p></speech>

I record also the success that has been achieved by everybody in flattening the curve.  Everybody was very pleased to see tangible results in the course of the week here, and in the North, and we need to commit to build on that.  Congratulations to everybody concerned and to our citizens in particular.</p>  <p>  I want to reiterate the point raised by Deputy Martin and raised last week by Deputy Catherine Connolly on the issue of special needs education.  I know this is an area the Taoiseach is examining.  I believe we are all of one mind that this is something that needs to be addressed very speedily.  The level of stress in families and for the people concerned is unbearable.</p>  <p>  I have raised with the Taoiseach previously the issue of those workers in receipt of maternity benefit, and only maternity benefit, returning from their leave and being excluded from the wage supplement scheme.  I note that there has been no progress in correcting that exclusion.  I would like the Taoiseach's response to that.</p>  <p>  I have raised with the Taoiseach previously the issue of childcare because this will be an area of critical concern as we return to our new normal and as people seek to go back to work.  I am sure he saw yesterday the Federation of Early Childcare Providers survey which explicitly has laid bare the problems regarding childcare.  It found, for example, that nine out of ten childcare providers say that either they will not reopen on 29 June or that they have grave reservations about reopening.  Many of their concerns relate to health and safety.  Many are worried about their ability to implement physical distancing measures, particularly with preschool children.  They are concerned about infection controls and access to personal protection equipment.  They have real worries about the plans that are being aired in part over the airwaves.  Of particular concern is how they would meet the ongoing costs that the plans, as they are drip-fed, appear to indicate, which would necessitate the hiring of more staff and reduce their capacity dramatically.  They are worried that the sums simply will not add up for them.  The potential consequences of all of that are either cr&egrave;ches and childcare facilities not being in a position to reopen indefinitely, parents struggling to find places for their children and the prospect of increased fees for those fortunate enough to secure a place.  Bear in mind that even before this crisis, people were shelling out the equivalent of a second mortgage for childcare.  I was alarmed to hear the very stark response yesterday from the chairperson of the Federation of Early Childhood Providers.  She was asked about the level of guidance its members have received from the Department and she answered, "We have had nothing from them".  That is a signal that something is very badly wrong.</p> <p>I want to give a sample of the issues that have been raised with me regarding childcare workers.  I will go through them quickly but it is important that we place this on the record in order that Members get a flavour of it.</p> <p> Suzanne from Dublin says that she works in a preschool and asks how social distancing will work in this setting, if numbers will have to be reduced and if staff will lose their jobs because of smaller numbers, or if funding will be put in place for new measures.</p> <p> Tanya says that they literally do not know where they stand and the way that they have to work with children, staff and parents is getting very worrying.  She says that all of their childcare years are to prepare children for school, and that children need their social interaction.  She asks how she will comfort children who are upset because they cannot play like they used to.</p> <p> Maeve says that the facility she is at has already allocated 22 places to children.  She asks how they can now tell half of parents that the facility cannot take their child because the facility has to reduce its numbers.  She states that places were allocated at the end of February and that they cannot turn away half the children in September.</p> <p> Jeanette states that she is currently on the Covid-19 payment with no return date as of yet.  Her question is whether she will still have to pay for her child's place even though she will not attend cr&egrave;che until Jeanette returns to work.</p> <p> Orla says that reduced numbers cannot work and asks who the childcare facility she is at turns away.  She states that she runs a wraparound service for all ages and that if primary schools take smaller numbers in September, parents will need her to care for children who cannot be at school and she cannot cater for this.</p> <p> Julie asks that clear direction be given now because preparations will take time.  She questions the idea of pods of four children and its sustainability.</p> <p> Melissa, who is a childcare worker who has children, says that she will have to bring her kids to work.  There are other staff who also have children so this, in its own way, eliminates places for parents.</p> <p> Siobh&aacute;n from Sligo sums up the situation of many families when she says that her husband's boss is putting terrible pressure on him after weeks without childcare.  He may lose his job over it.  They thought an end was in sight with 29 June approaching but their cr&egrave;che is not certain that it will be in a position to open.  It is not the fault of the cr&egrave;che but the lack of help and information from Government.  Siobh&aacute;n is a front-line worker and her husband is an essential worker.  She says that they will be in the dole queue if this continues.</p></speech>

As the House knows with regard to maternity benefit, women who were still on the payroll prior to the pandemic when they went on maternity leave can be included on the wage subsidy scheme.  However, women who were not on the payroll and were only in receipt of maternity benefit cannot.  We are trying to find a solution to that.  Much work has been carried out by the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.  A solution has been developed but it is not adequate and does not really solve the problem in the Minister's view.  They continue to work on it but we will hopefully come to a resolution soon.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for sharing some of those individual queries and questions about childcare.  The plan is to allow childcare centres to reopen at the end of June.  That is in phase 3.  We appreciate that all centres may not be able to open, or some may choose not to open, but they will be allowed to open from the end of June, and I believe that many will.  Public health advice has been sought and there has been detailed engagement involving the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and NPHET on the public health advice about reopening childcare centres.  It needs to be refined and shared with the sector in good time for it to read, understand, digest and implement it.  We hope to be in a position to share that with the sector sooner rather than later and to give it a good few weeks before the end of June to implement measures.  The sector is being consulted and the Minister, Katherine Zappone, is leading on that.  Childcare staff will be able to return to their centres before the end of June to make any changes or preparations that may be needed.  Teachers already can return to schools and lecturers to colleges and that will be allowed for childcare workers too and it is happening in practice in some cases.</p> <p>A survey has been done of parental demand.  As is the case in other countries, we anticipate, at least initially, a fall in demand for childcare.  It will not just go back to the way it was.  That will not surprise people.  Many people are out of work.  We are heading into the summer.  There is concern among some parents about sending kids back to cr&egrave;che.  We know from other countries that initially demand is depressed at the start.  That, at least, will help with the capacity issues.</p></speech>

I repeat to the Taoiseach that many people across the sector are saying publicly that the level of consultation and engagement is simply not sufficient.  There is a call for clear guidance to cover childcare settings, including cr&egrave;ches and early education facilities.  We also need guidance on childminders.  What will the public health guidance on that be?</p>  <p>  The State currently covers the wage bill for the childcare workforce.  Will the Taoiseach make a commitment that this support will continue until the end of the year?  That would come as some relief and reassurance to childcare workers and childcare providers.</p>  <p>  Many people face the prospect of not being able to work, not because their job is no longer there, but because they will not be able to access adequate and safe childcare.  What reassurance and what support can the Taoiseach afford to those workers?  Can he guarantee them that they will not be left permanently unemployed and that they will not see their income slashed because they cannot return to work owing to insufficient childcare for them?</p></speech>

We had a good news day on Monday when there were no such deaths.  I hope that can now start to become the norm.</p>  <p>  I believe the Taoiseach said earlier that on 5 June there might be a review of the timeline of some of the measures.  Given the reduction in the levels of infection I think many people will be hoping we can move some of the dates on the opening up of restrictions.  I come from working in the tourism industry.  What a difference it would make to thousands if not tens of thousands of small Irish tourism businesses if we could move that opening date and, as Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin said, perhaps  not have that 20 km restriction along with a change to the timelines on movement restrictions if the tourism industry had two months of domestic demand rather than just one under the current timelines.  That could make the world of difference to people's livelihoods, employment and future.  We hope that some of the good news we have seen in recent weeks will continue to allow the Government to make some of those decisions on 5 June.</p>  <p>  To give further hope, if I can, I want to refer to the broad economic strategy we need to manage this crisis.  Two documents produced today are particularly important in that regard.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's publication of its fiscal assessment report is very welcome and timely.  Today's publication of the European Commission's &euro;1.85 trillion recovery plan is also very significant in terms of the economic response.  Both give us a very clear sense of direction and a very clear understanding of the right economic approach.</p>  <p>  Sometimes we give out about the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council taking the bowl of punch away when we all have various appropriate spending priorities.  However, today it has been very clear in reporting that what has been done to date with interventions such as the pandemic unemployment payment, the wage subsidies and other supports has been appropriate.  Critically, the report states, "While policy needs may evolve, and policies should be adjusted as appropriate to fit these needs, support should be provided on a large-scale for as long as is needed to avoid lengthening and deepening the economic crisis."</p> <p>More specifically, it states:</p><blockquote>	Borrowing to support weak demand would be an appropriate countercyclical approach for the government to manage the economy.  It should be temporary, targeted and conditioned on the likely state of the economy.  </blockquote> <p>This is not similar to previous economic downturns when there was a structural problem with the economy where we could not borrow, such as the 1980s, or in the crash of 2008-10 when our economy was fundamentally broken because we had allowed a property bubble to build up.  That is not the case here.  The correct economy strategy is for us to borrow on international markets and stimulate the economy to help us get out of the economic downturn.  That is what is being said across so many economic sectors.  <br/><br/>Hopefully, as in the Central Bank's baseline scenario, the return to the economy in respect of some of the stimulus measures will see employment return in the next two to three years.  That may be sufficient on its own and the best way of managing our deficit.  We must plan, over a four or five-year period, not just to kick-start and stimulate the economy but to get the deficit back in line in order that we continue to enjoy the prospect of low interest rates that will allow us to borrow.  <br/><br/>Things may be worsened by what happens with Brexit or the OECD corporate tax changes.  An adjustment to manage the deficit in three years' time may be needed but we will not know until we see what happens in the next two or three years.  It is likely, however, to be much smaller in scale than any of the previous crashes to which I referred.  Regardless of the gap that must be closed by taxation or other measures, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, noted &quot;Nonetheless, ambitious policies can still be achieved in areas like health, housing and climate change.&quot;  The economic situation is not impossible.  The analysis from bodies such as IFAC is very clear and matches what the European Union is saying today.  The Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, stated:</p><blockquote>	The recovery plan turns the immense challenge we face into an opportunity, not only by supporting the recovery but also by investing in our future: the European Green Deal and digitalization will boost jobs and growth, the resilience of our societies and the health of our environment.  This is Europe's moment.  Our willingness to act must [be] up to the challenges we are all facing.  With Next Generation EU [which is what the Commission is calling its plan] we are providing an ambitious answer. </blockquote> <p>That European green deal is the centre of its &euro;1.85 trillion stimulus package.  It is saying specifically we should invest in things such as renovating our buildings to improve building stock and tackle climate change, in renewable energy - wind and solar in particular - and the prospect of a new hydrogen economy where Ireland could be very successful as a country, and in cleaner transport and logistics.  That is the best economic analysis in Europe and matches the Fiscal Advisory Council's advice that this is the time to invest in the future, a time to borrow for something that will give us a return which is social, environmental and environmental.<br/><br/>I acknowledge that as we progress, we will have to review matters in two or three years' time, particularly given the risks from Brexit or changes to corporate tax rules but it is not an impossible situation.  We should not be overly fearful or pessimistic for our people.  We have the economic plan.  The direction coming from almost all the economists I have seen is that this is manageable and we can do it.  Recent days have seen the good news of infection rates decreasing.  If we may adjust slightly some of the timelines for opening up, we may, even during this summer, we will start to see unemployment turning around, then we will have to tackle long-term unemployment to make sure that is going the right way.  <br/><br/>I have a question for the Taoiseach.  The clear economic advice is to borrow to invest for the future and invest with a good return.  I do not want to be too picky but I have a concern.  The Government has announced investment by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, in companies that may be running into difficulty.  My concern is that in future investment, we should try to use whatever resources we have in new opportunities and investment areas.  I understand that ISIF has not yet received any applications.  </p> <p>I very much understand the political imperative in terms of trying to support companies, but I am very keen that if we are investing in ISIF funds, or any other funding that we may raise through borrowing, it would be for the new economy that is going to grow.  I believe the focus must be on that sense of the future, new jobs and new prospects.  That is a difficult thing to get right.  I am trying to think of examples.  We could, for example, in particular with Brexit, have real difficulties in our food industry.  Rather than just keeping the current system in place, we could invest in a policy to improve school meals and to improve our health and well-being, as the Taoiseach stated in his comments.  It would be great to make an investment to connect the farmer to the local school and to set up a new food distribution system and a new retail system that would help that level of connectivity, help Irish food producers and make something new work.</p> <p> I heard a proposal yesterday from someone in the Taoiseach's party which I thought made great sense.  It was that we would create work hubs in the centre of every town and village where people could do distant working.  They would not have to travel all the way to work but they would not just be at home.  We could have innovation hubs such as the Ludgate Hub in Skibbereen.  We could start to make things happen in such digital centres.  I will only touch briefly on these points as I want to leave the Taoiseach a minute or two to answer.  It is clear what the strategy is.  We must invest in the future.</p></speech>

That will be done through equity investments.  We would expect companies to pursue all other options first - to look to their own shareholders, loans and other such options before coming to the taxpayer to invest.  However, other governments are doing it and we may need to do it too.  We will treat our own public companies differently.  The investments the Deputy talks about are wise investments the Government could make but perhaps they would come from a different fund or a different source.</p>  <p>  In terms of appropriate fiscal policy, I have always been of the view that the right fiscal policy is a countercyclical one.  When the economy is growing fast, one tries to keep public spending under control and one reduces debt, if not in cash terms at least as a percentage of GDP.  When the economy is in recession, one is then able to increase public spending to cushion the blow of the recession on people's incomes, to stimulate the economy so it can grow again and to allow one's debt to rise.  That is the policy that this outgoing Government has pursued.  For many years in this House we resisted the demands of people that we should spend more and borrow more &ndash; &euro;22 billion more in one case &ndash; at a time when the economy was growing fast and overheating.  We were right to resist those demands, and because we resisted those demands we are now in a position to do what could not be done ten or 12 years ago, and that is a countercyclical response to this crisis, namely, increasing spending and increasing debt.  However, as IFAC points out, that does come to an end.  It suggests that in or around 2023, we may need to take measures to reduce the deficit, but between now and then we should try to make the economy grow as fast as possible so that the deficit that is there in 2023 is closer to &euro;6 billion or less rather than the &euro;14 billion it put at its upper end, because any retrenchment that will happen when the economy returns to sustained growth should be as minimal as possible.  That is why we need to go for growth and opt for pro-growth policies in the next year or two.</p></speech>

I congratulate everybody &ndash; all the workers - for all their hard work.  I hope the trajectory will continue in this way in terms of the volume of deaths and the volume of cases.</p>  <p>  I have a number of questions for the Taoiseach today to which I would appreciate his response.  I will allow enough time for him to respond to the individual questions.  However, before I start I wish to make a plea to the Taoiseach.  I have never come into this House and stressed something as passionately or emotionally as on this occasion.  We have to do something immediately to change the way in which we are dealing with funerals.  We all work together.  We are always working in our communities and supporting one another but we are also together in death.</p> <p>The rules are too rigid and ten people is too small a number.  At many funerals the families are bigger than that.  The social conditioning, the things we have all refrained from doing and the ways in which we have all changed, supports an increase in that number.  I beg the Taoiseach to increase the number to 30.  A friend of mine buried his father.  His immediate family comprises much more than ten people.  A funeral director told me a very sad story about grandchildren crying outside a church.  We can do better.  I plead with the Taoiseach to change this.  I suggested a figure of 30, but everybody knows the social conditioning we have to work with.  I hope everyone in the House can support me on this. </p> <p> I was very struck by the report published today by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, entitled "No Going Back".  We will need a new social contract.  I want to raise some questions relating to where we go from here and I would appreciate the Taoiseach's responses.  We must continue the pandemic unemployment payment, which we have argued for but some of the conversation around it is unacceptable.  It is said that some employers cannot get workers.  They are obviously not looking too hard.  The Contract Cleaning Association of Ireland is now saying that it will not honour an employment regulation order requiring a 40 cent pay increase for contract cleaners.  These are front-line workers who are putting their lives at risk to clean and save all of us.  These cases demonstrate a narrative that I do not want to see continuing.  I ask the Taoiseach to recognise the fact that we need to continue the pandemic unemployment payment.  Furthermore, as we come out of this we will have to provide stimulus for several different sectors.  This should be conditional on those sectors honouring industrial relations decisions arrived at by the State mechanisms.  This is our chance to do that. </p> <p> The Government has made two attempts at a proposal for childcare for front-line workers and healthcare workers.  We must get this right.  The Taoiseach's answer was not good enough.  He said the Government will allow them to open.  That is not going to work.  It is not a case of allowing them to open.  We need to create conditions where that is viable.  This is the fulcrum around which all of our economy and society will turn.  I am not sure this message has got through.  The Government has failed twice.  This needs a lot more attention. </p> <p> I refer to the HSE's roadmap.  I 100% believe that we need a plan for children and adults with intellectual disabilities.  I have spoken to families in which children and adults are losing the will to go on.  Intervention is needed now.  I also want to see screening.  How will the Government deal with disability organisations and various other section 38 and section 39 organisations that do what the State should?  How will we chart a roadmap for them?  They cannot all be funded through "The Late Late Show".  We need a plan.  What will it be?</p> <p> A cross-reference group is needed along with NPHET to assist the Government in working through the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business with the participation of the social partners because critical decisions will have to be made.  If things go the way they are going, the roadmap will have to change.  We need a way to manage this.  </p> <p> My final question relates to antibody testing.  We have spoken about how we are going to conduct our business in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in future.  It is very obvious that we are going to have to live with this virus for a considerable period.  We are going to have to use antibody testing for the economy, society, schools and everything else to function.  I have taken an awful lot of time to research this and I have spoken to a lot of people.  A huge amount of work is going on.  It could be introduced relatively quickly.  What is the status of that?</p></speech>

He started by talking about funerals.</p> <p>I know this is a really difficult issue for many people and families, where only ten people are allowed to attend the funeral.  I have spoken to some people who had to make that awful decision of choosing which ten and then explaining to the 11th, 12th or 13th person why he or she could not be there.  I think we have all seen the scenes of people gathering in a car park or along the street, which is sometimes touching but also really painful.  We understand that it is a really difficult thing for many people.  Whether the person died of Covid or not, it is just as difficult trying to get through a funeral of that nature with these rules.  We have started a discussion with the churches about we might be able to amend that over the next couple of weeks, and much of that may be more to do with the size of the church than anything else because a large church could take more people with social distancing than a small church.  The idea is to develop a practical solution to that, and protocols already exist in other countries such as Germany and Italy.</p> <p> In addition, in my discussions with the Catholic bishops a few weeks ago, they were particularly interested to know what we might be able to do to allow some baptisms and weddings to happen again.  They, again, would be small, but a lot of people have been waiting a long time to christen their child.  Obviously, we want to make all these things possible sooner rather than later, but to do so safely.</p> <p> Childcare centres will be allowed to open at the end of June.  I am not saying they will just be allowed to open, with the matter up to them alone; they will, of course, require guidance, as Deputy McDonald noted.  They will require guidance on what changes they need to make, at least a few weeks before the opening date so they can digest and implement it.  There may well be some centres that decide not to open.  That will be true in any sector but I believe it will be possible for the vast majority to open and we will work with them to do that.</p> <p> On the pandemic unemployment payment, I reiterate that anyone currently in receipt of the payment does not need to be concerned about it being stopped on 8 June.  It will continue to be paid beyond 8 June; we just have not agreed an end date for it yet.  We want people to have the opportunity to get their job back, and while some people in sectors such as construction have, in most sectors they have not yet, which is why it will need to be extended beyond 8 June.  If people are offered their job back and they refuse that job, they will lose the pandemic unemployment payment, but the vast majority of people have not yet even had that opportunity, which is why it needs to be extended.</p> <p> The payment was a temporary, emergency measure and it is not affordable or sustainable for it to go on forever.  We are just playing politics with people if we somehow pretend that is possible.  It will have to come to an end at some point and it would not be right to create different classes of unemployed people, with people unemployed before Covid getting one set of benefits, people made unemployed during Covid getting a different set of benefits and people who lose their jobs after Covid getting a different set of benefits again.  That would not be right or fair so it will all need to be merged again, but these are not decisions for this week or even next week.</p></speech>

I refer to the issues relating to the roadmap for intellectual disabilities, section 38 and section 39 organisations, antibody testing and whether he will bring forward a cross-reference group to help us come out of the roadmap.  There were four different questions.</p></speech>

There are too many false positives and false negatives, and HIQA has published a health technology assessment on that.  Once we have antibody tests that are accurate, they could be used.  Approval has been given for a zero prevalence survey using antibody tests but that is very different.  It will not give an individual result from an individual test of an individual patient.  It will be a survey of the extent to which there is exposure and immunity within society.</p>  <p>  On the reference group question, I know that other countries have done this and it is under consideration.  It may be something the next Government decides to do rather than this one, but it has been proposed by others.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has proposed a similar approach to that, as has Deputy Shortall.  We have our plan, it is working and we are sticking to it, but that is not to say that at a point in the future, some form of expert group or reference group that is multidisciplinary could be established to give advice to the Government in addition to advice from NPHET.</p>  <p>  There are thousands of section 38 and section 39 organisations and they are all in different circumstances.  Some have got additional funding, such as the hospices.  Some are section 38 organisations whereas others are section 39.  It depends on the individual organisation and its individual financial position.</p></speech>

Almost everyone sought a political consensus on decisions, which were underpinned by solid medical and scientific advice.  It worked well because we all understood that the advice was coming from NPHET and was designed to save lives and protect everybody insofar as it was possible.  I expect this is still the motivation.  While D&aacute;il sittings have recently resumed it is important to note that a lot of the discussions prior to that had happened behind closed doors in briefings not seen by the public.  Many of us had been raising concerns about nursing homes, direct provision and testing, tracing and personal protective equipment, on which there were discussions forward and back but out of public view.</p>  <p>  The news in recent days of the continued reductions in the numbers of cases and the constant decline and levelling off of the R nought number is hugely welcome and I congratulate everybody who worked towards that.  Surely this now means we once again need to look for a political consensus on how we move forward on some things.  This becomes slightly more difficult in a situation where the medical and scientific advice on certain aspects either differs somewhat or is vague.  The current conversation on the 2 m versus the 1 m distance is a prime example of this.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will agree that the discourse on this, politically and among the scientific and medical community and NPHET, has been varied.  There is a lot of talk about guidelines as opposed to regulations, and there are references to best judgment.  By and large, people are doing their best to do the right thing to get through this.  Situations where the interpretation is vague do not help any of us.  There are many things on which the Taoiseach and I will disagree but there are some things where we could all agree, across the political spectrum, to reach a consensus.  It strikes me that agreeing on a minimum distance is one issue on which we can find a political consensus.  I believe we can also find a political consensus on the two-hour rule.  We need to find a way of working in this House.  I believe this to be a very safe workplace given its size and the amount of cleaning done, which is premium.</p>  <p>  The World Health Organization recommends that people stay at least 1 m but ideally 2 m from each other.  There is no consensus across the European Union with its varying approach.  So far, our Chief Medical Officer has erred on the conservative side, and he may be right on that, but we could do with a consensus on it.  Essentially, there is a very big difference between 1 m and 2 m with regard to the unravelling of the roadmap.  It is, for example, the difference between a business being viable or not and whether schools go back full time in September.  We are aware that this will be a significant difference.</p> <p>Regarding some of the rules and the roadmap, there is a big difference, for example, in construction between working inside and working outside.  There are subsets of other sectors that could safely go back to work.  The roadmap is very rigid.  We must find some political consensus on the opening up of the economy in relation to the roadmap.</p> <p> Essentially the public was ahead at the beginning in terms of the closing schools, having a view on visitors from Italy and on Cheltenham.  I feel the public is now starting to move ahead of the decisions being made.  This virus has been assaulting all of our senses and there is a darkening of a mood.  If one is going to bring people along, one has to be in symmetry with them.  I feel we are out of step with the public mood.  The confusion in respect of the expert advice is a real problem.</p> <p> People are working from home.  While doing a full-time job, they are also childminders and teachers.  They can only do that for so long.  There has to be some hope.  There are people with children with special educational needs who can see the difference in the child where they have lost social interaction as much as the educational opportunity.  We need to find some political consensus on all of this.  Will the Taoiseach meet the leaders of the groups and the political parties with a view to looking at the 1 m versus 2 m distancing guidance, the two-hour contact rule and how we deal with the roadmap in order that we can do this differently but by consensus?</p></speech>

If there is a place to do that, it probably is the Covid committee that has been established.  The committee seems to be working well and is very representative of the D&aacute;il.  I do not think it is something for the party leaders to be honest.  Obviously some Members represent big parties that have a lot of political support while some are small and some are not parties at all.  The right place to do that is the Covid committee.  It can hear the evidence and then make a recommendation to the Government on the 1 m or 2 m rule and the two-hour contact tracing rule.  It might be the best forum for political consensus to be found, if it can be found.  I am not sure, however, if it can.  In the meantime, we will follow the advice of the public health emergency team.</p>  <p>  It has to be seen in its overall context, however, namely, how prevalent the virus is in the community.  A set of rules that were right when there were hundreds of new cases and dozens of deaths being reported every day may not be the right rules at a time we have 30 or 50 new cases and fewer than ten deaths being reported every day.  We need to bear in mind that, while there is no such thing as zero risk from this virus, as the risk reduces, then rules can be relaxed.  That is what the plan is all about in many ways.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is right in saying the public was ahead of us in terms of demanding school closures.  Many businesses, pubs, restaurants and gyms closed before they were instructed to by the Government.  That is what we call anticipatory behaviour, which was not necessarily bad.  What we have now is another form of anticipatory behaviour, which is the public ahead of us, looking for us to unlock things, in some cases, perhaps, before we are sure it is safe to do so.  I heard a call from a prominent person this morning that flying is entirely safe, for example.  We have to continue to base our decisions on evidence.</p>  <p>  The plan, as agreed by the Government and published, is a living document.  I said from the very start and I will say it again that as things develop, elements of that plan could be accelerated and brought forward.  I ask the public and the House, however, to hold firm for now.</p> <p>We are only in phase 1.  One of the reasons the phase lasts three weeks is in order that we can have proper data.  We will not really know what effect the easing of the restrictions has had for about two weeks.  If the numbers are still going in the right direction in the first week of June, that would give us an assurance that we could accelerate some aspects of the plan, but to do that earlier would be acting without evidence and would be premature.  I ask people to hold firm until that first week in June.  If the numbers are still going in the right direction at that point, we can have some confidence about bringing forward some of the things from later phases.</p></speech>

They are trying to justify suggestions that the &euro;350 payment should be cut for those people and many others who have already seen a reduction in income.  Does the Taoiseach think that is fair?  Does it chime with the motto "we are all in this together" for Ministers and Deputies who earn multiples of &euro;350 a week to tell people who were essentially earning poverty wages that &euro;350 a week is too much for them?  For example, I met a woman named Lisa, who has given me permission to mention her name, on the Debenhams picket.  She has worked for Debenhams for 20 years, since she was 16.  She earned just under &euro;350 a week but with overtime she sometimes earned more.  She was unceremoniously sacked by Debenhams and thrown on the scrap heap.  She says she does not want to be getting the &euro;350 payment.  She is applying for jobs but she cannot get one at the moment.  Does the Taoiseach honestly think it is fair to Lisa and people like her, who have worked all their lives and never claimed social welfare, to even consider cutting their &euro;350 payment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.160" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700026#CC00300"><p>I am not aware of anyone who is considering cutting Lisa's payment, if I accurately picked up the Deputy's description of her case.  It sounds like she was earning &euro;300 or &euro;400 a week, and nobody I am aware of is considering cutting the pandemic unemployment payment in that circumstance, and certainly not in the near future when we are still in the early phases of the pandemic.  I have not heard anyone expressing horror at people getting &euro;350 a week.  I am the head of the Government that introduced this payment, which is one of the most generous welfare schemes in response to pandemic unemployment in the world, and I stand over it.  We introduced it because we wanted to get money to people quickly - to people who needed it and who lost their jobs largely because of a Government order to close the businesses in which they worked.  We stand over doing that.  We wanted to do something a bit more logical or fair, which was to give people 70% or 80% of their previous income, with floors and ceilings, but we could not do that and so we had to just put out a flat payment.  That is what we did and we stand over doing so.  That flat payment is &euro;350 a week, which is 70% of average wages in the sectors most affected, as I explained previously.  People are trying to connect this matter to low pay, but I do not accept that argument.  Someone working full time for 38 or 39 hours a week on the minimum wage of &euro;10.30 an hour would have been earning over &euro;400 a week.  Nobody is suggesting that the &euro;350 be reduced in that case.  Someone working a full week on the living wage would also have been earning more than &euro;350.  Nobody is suggesting for a second that any of the people in that category should have their pandemic unemployment payment cut.  What has been identified, which is a commonsense issue that many others have noted, is that some people who were working only ten hours a week, perhaps earning &euro;20 an hour and &euro;200 a week throughout January and February, are now getting &euro;350 a week.</p></speech>

Deputy Rabbitte of Fianna F&aacute;il has said that the payment is unfair and unsustainable.  It is not.  People who are earning multiples of the amount of the payment are suggesting it is unfair, unsustainable and needs to be cut.  It is good if the Taoiseach is backtracking on that position but he should give a clear commitment to people such as Lisa, workers in the arts and retail sectors, taxi drivers and others who may face protracted periods where, through no fault of their own, they will not be able to get back to the amounts they were previously earning, or employment at all, that the Covid payment will not be cut for them.  That is the commitment we need.</p></speech>

I appreciate that is his political position but it is not one shared by many people in this country.</p>  <p>  When we discuss tapering, it is important to bear in mind that the only people who are now getting less than they were earning before the pandemic are those who earned more than &euro;350 a week.  Someone who was earning &euro;700, &euro;600 or &euro;500 a week is now receiving the reduced payment of &euro;350.  Separate to that, there is a group of people who were not earning &euro;350 a week.  All of those who were earning &euro;200 a week, for example, would have been part-time workers rather than full-time workers because full-time workers earning the minimum wage would have been paid more.  That group of people is getting paid more than they were paid before the pandemic.  Anyone who is talking about tapering is doing so in the context of making sure that any tapering ensures people are not better off than they were before the pandemic.  People who earned more than &euro;350 a week are the exception and are already worse off.</p></speech>

It is undeniable that we have seen a massive propaganda campaign in the past week or more to attack those on the pandemic unemployment payment.  Pat McDonagh, a millionaire, has been complaining that it is tough to get part-time workers to work in Supermac's for &euro;200 a week because of the availability of the pandemic payment.  A Government Minister has suggested it is unsustainable to continue to pay it.  Deputy Rabbitte has said that some people are "a hell of a lot better off" due to the payment.  My first question is simple and will require ten seconds to answer.  Is the Taoiseach willing to live on &euro;350 a week, before he cuts that payment for anybody, to see what it is actually like?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.167" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700027#DD00400"><p>I am willing to live on whatever salary I am given for the job I am doing; that is how these things work.  I appreciate that the Deputy's argument is that everyone should be paid the same but he does not say what that would be or how that would be funded.  It is the Deputy's choice to take such an action and if he wants to demonstrate that, he should do it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.168" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="14:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700027#DD00500"><p>My argument is simply that before the Taoiseach cuts the pay of anybody who is currently on &euro;350 a week, he should see what it is like to live on that amount.</p><p>Everything about this propaganda campaign reminds me of the &quot;Welfare cheats cheat us all&quot; campaign that was rolled out when the Taoiseach was the Minister for Social Protection.  It is the same attempt to divide and rule workers through the use of the same scaremongering and exaggeration about people scamming the system and from the same underlying motivation of driving people to work for poverty wages.  It emerged that at the root of that campaign was a big lie.  The Taoiseach, when he was Minister, claimed that the amount saved by people reporting others for social welfare fraud was &euro;500 million.  It turned out that the real figure was less than 10% of that, less than &euro;50 million.  I wonder if the same sort of creative accounting is being used in this propaganda campaign.</p><p>Last Thursday, <i>The Irish Times</i>had an unpublished report, presumably leaked from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, which stated that 38% of recipients of the Covid-19 payment were previously earning less than &euro;300 per week.  That was used by people, including the Taoiseach, to suggest that a considerable number, almost 40%, of people are better off under the pandemic unemployment payment.  That is not true, is it?  Is it not the case that, of the 38% who are supposedly better off, a substantial number were already in receipt of social welfare payments which meant that their total income was already higher than &euro;350?</p><p>The article referred to more than 200,000 people who are better off unemployed than they were when they were working.  That number includes a substantial number of the 40,000 availing of the one-parent family payment, the 50,000 on the working family payment, the 5,000 on the back to work family dividend and the 35,000 part-time workers who were previously in receipt of jobseeker's allowance along with their wages.</p> <p>Can the Taoiseach confirm that the reference to pre-Covid income in that report does not include their social welfare payment and, therefore, the suggestion, which he has echoed, that 38% of people who are on the pandemic unemployment payment are better off is simply not accurate?</p></speech>

I do not have the report in front of me, although it was published either on Friday last or on the Friday before.  If the Deputy has heard what I have said about this publicly on a number of occasions, I have acknowledged that there are people who would be better off on ordinary long-standing welfare payments than on the pandemic unemployment payment.  There are people who were part-time workers in January and February who are better off on the pandemic unemployment payment.  There are also people who are on the pandemic unemployment payment who would be better off if they were moved to jobseeker's - largely people who have dependants - or moved to other payments such as the one-parent family payment.  There are anomalies in both directions and I have always acknowledged that.</p>  <p>  This was a temporary measure brought in during an emergency.  It had to be done quickly.  Everyone got a flat amount.  However, over time we need to reconcile that in order that those who got more than they would have got normally have their payments tapered and those who have been left short and would be better off on other welfare schemes are moved to those welfare schemes and get the increase to which they are entitled.</p></speech>

The response of all our medical staff during the pandemic, and particularly those at the front of house, has been exceptional.  The Covid-19 crisis has shown the entire country how we should do things and how we should not.  The greatest tribute we could all pay to our medical staff is to ensure that we do not go back to overwhelmed and overcrowded emergency departments with trolleys on the corridors.</p>  <p>  I welcome the publication of the just transition commissioner's report and the resulting discussions at Cabinet last week but we need to see talk and promises converted into real and practical action to deliver immediate jobs within the communities right across the midland countries now.  Every time we hear of just transition, we are always one more announcement away from action.  We cannot accept a situation where we must wait for Covid-19 restrictions to be lifted or the next budget cycle before we see action on the ground.  We do not have the luxury of time.  We must see action now because 360 families depend on a peat harvest this summer and, sadly, there is no guarantee that peat harvesting will be allowed pending the complex planning process that Bord na M&oacute;na must go through.</p>  <p>  I also echo the call of the just transition commissioner, Mr. Kieran Mulvey, that it is imperative that the &euro;11 million just transition fund announced last October would be used this year to stimulate and finance projects that have employment potential and that can contribute to the economic, social and environmental sustainability of the region.  This must be in a manner that complements other sources of public funding available to the region.  Mr. Mulvey went on to say that the funds needed to be made available as quickly as possible for allocation to selected projects.</p>  <p>  On 23 July last, I wrote to the Taoiseach requesting as an immediate measure that &euro;30 million from the climate action fund should be ring-fenced to commence the work of rehabilitating the cutaway bogs - work that must be carried out on these bogs regardless of the future of peat harvesting.  The front-loading of this work was to be carried out over the 15-year period but would provide security of employment for the 360 Bord na M&oacute;na staff at this anxious time, as well as reducing peat oxidation and carbon loss on our bogs.  On 9 September, the Taoiseach wrote back to me to say that funding the rehabilitation of cutaway bogs from the climate action fund should form part of the solution.</p>  <p>  Bord na M&oacute;na has a landholding of just under 200,000 acres across the country.</p> <p>While some of these lands may be considered for new commercial uses, such as the growing of herbs, other lands will naturally return to nature.  As a result, there is a considerable land bank, where peat extraction has already ceased, that would flood naturally and where work on rehabilitation can start.  This work would include the provision of recreational facilities such as walking and cycling trails, which would be less than two hours' travel from Leinster House.</p> <p> As the Taoiseach knows, the decision has already been taken, as part of Project Ireland 2040, to develop a 35,000-acre national wetlands park on the Mount Dillon bog complex in counties Roscommon and Longford.  A further example of the opening up of bogland for public access is the Ballinasloe parkland project, which would utilise the cutaway bogs outside the town of Ballinasloe.  It is envisaged that it will form part of the Dublin&ndash;Galway greenway.</p> <p> Public access alone is already attracting over 50,000 visitors a year to Mount Lucas in County Offaly.  Two hundred and seventy days after the Taoiseach&rsquo;s letter to me, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, has announced that work on the advanced rehabilitation of these peatlands is "subject to further Government consideration".  Again, we are another announcement away from action.  Not a single cent has been spent on rehabilitating these bogs, nor has a single cent from the just transition fund been allocated for alternative employment in the region, yet we are quite happy to borrow money on the back of every citizen in this country to subsidise the wages of Bord na M&oacute;na staff or pay them unemployment benefits at a cost of approximately &euro;65,000 every week, forcing them to sit at home although the rehabilitation work will have to be done regardless of the future of peat harvesting.</p> <p> I have a number of questions.  First, I want a commitment from the Taoiseach that the funds will be released immediately, in line with his commitment last September, to re-employ Bord na M&oacute;na staff currently laid off to commence the rehabilitation of State-owned and State-controlled bogs.  Second, I want a commitment that the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, amendment legislation to provide moneys for the climate action fund will be agreed by the Cabinet and ready for publication within seven days of the formation of the new Government, and that it will ensure part of the fund will be ring-fenced for projects across the midland counties.  Third, will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government has received the &euro;5 million committed by the ESB for the just transition fund, and will he provide me with the date that moneys from the &euro;11 million just transition fund will be allocated for shovel-ready projects that can create jobs now, not in ten years' time?</p></speech>

I agree with him on the overall point.  If we can front-load bog rehabilitation, we should.  It would be a great thing to do.  It would secure jobs in Bord na M&oacute;na.  It would also help to restore our natural heritage and promote tourism.  The question the Government is grappling with now is that of how to fund it.  The carbon tax revenues for 2020 have already been ring-fenced for particular circumstances.  I am aware that the Minister is considering repurposing the Bord na M&oacute;na PSO for rehabilitation-type work.  If that could be done, it would be really great because it would mean a substantial amount of money that could be used in the region and on the bogs.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy said, the climate action fund legislation has to be approved by the Cabinet and passed by the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  That is intended to be a competitive fund.  The idea is that people bid into it.</p>  <p>  What I am told about the ESB is that it has agreed to contribute an additional &euro;5 million, and arrangements are being put in place by the Department to transfer the money to the just transition fund 2020.  I assume that means it has not been done yet but that arrangements are being made to do so.  It means &euro;11 million will be available for projects in 2020 through the fund.  The first call for that money was opened by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, last Friday.  In addition, there is a separate &euro;5 million for bog restoration and a rehabilitation scheme.  That is on land of the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  It will restore 1,800 ha of bog in seven counties.  Bord na M&oacute;na won the contract for doing the work, which will support 40 jobs.</p></speech>

I will come back to the comment made last week by Mr. Kieran Mulvey, the Government-appointed just transition commissioner, in his report.</p> <p>He made specific reference to the just transition fund.  I am disappointed to hear that the ESB money has yet to be lodged to that account, but there is potentially &euro;11 million available.  My fear is that this issue will be kicked down the road.  While we welcome Deputy Bruton's call for submissions, he might as well be calling out in Croke Park because we still do not have a closing date for applications, a date on which decisions will be made, or a date on which communities and projects across the country and across the region will know that money will be allocated.  I want to know the date on which decisions will be made, the date on which money will be allocated and the date on which projects across the midlands that can create jobs now can start.</p></speech>

It is reasonable to ask for them so I will check with the Minister and either he or I will contact the Deputy once I know what those dates are.  I do know that the &euro;11 million just transition fund for the midlands is there even if the ESB's &euro;5 million has not yet arrived.  The money is there and it is ring-fenced for just transition in the midlands.  The Minister opened the call for applications last Friday.  We should not waste any time in this regard.</p></speech>

It is a shambolic situation that I am speaking to the Taoiseach's empty seat while he is in another part of the building.  We had this debate at the meeting of the Business Committee yesterday and again this morning.  We called a vote on the matter but, unfortunately, people who objected to the proposal decided to vote with the Government and to allow the Taoiseach to carry on with his nonsense.  There is clear scientific and medical evidence that there is no issue with spending two hours in this massive Chamber.  The Taoiseach is just hiding but there is no place for the Taoiseach to hide and there will be nowhere to hide when the real truth about all of this is found out.</p><p>I asked him about our peacekeepers last week.  They are still out there.  We should be thankful that they have now got a date for their return, which is 29 June.  These 300 gallant men and women and their families at home are suffering.  I hope that date is honoured and that there will not be another shambolic excuse given.</p><p>I also mentioned the issue of nursing homes last week.  Different doctors have resigned from the Medical Council and other bodies.  They have better knowledge of this issue than I do.  What happened was nothing short of national sabotage.  I hope there will an inquiry into what happened and that people will be held accountable.  As I mentioned last week, people who got oxygen tanks had to give them back.  Tanks that were nearly empty were taken away and people were left without oxygen.  Let us think about that.  People were just left without oxygen.  What happened to our young people and our people aged over 70 is shocking.  There is a cohort of people aged over 66 who are working and sustaining many families and communities and who are not getting a bob in payment.</p><p>Mention was made of the Covid payment.  I argued that the payment should be made <i>pro rata</i>based on what people had earned in the month or four weeks prior but I was told that could not be done.  We would not have the problems we now have had that been done.  I do not agree with what Members on the left are saying, which is that we are trying to be mean; we are not.  Many people are not getting enough but it is clearly unsustainable to give &euro;350 to people who were earning &euro;80 or &euro;100.  </p><p>The issue of the mental health of our young people and our old people is just shocking.  On the issue of the 2 m distance, a very close relative of mine visited a hospital in Cork last week and had to sit in huge queue in a waiting room separated from others by only 1 m.  Who is codding whom?  Even the WHO, about which we hear so much, does not recommend 2 m.  </p><p>I also want to ask the Taoiseach about the carry on with the private hospitals.  I have a very sad letter from a woman who has given me permission to use her sister's details.  She states:</p> <blockquote> 	For the last 45 years, my sister has paid for private health insurance to cover all her hospital stays.  She has never asked the general taxpayer to pay for any of her medical treatment.  She is now 66 years of age and needs urgent surgery for a stage 3 prolapse, which could go to emergency stage 4 at any time.  Her consultant has clearly stated he cannot operate on her until July at the earliest, or even into September.  Each day the surgery is delayed means that further damage is happening inside her body.  Therefore,  in order to repair the damage, she will require much more extensive surgery at the end of the time.   </blockquote>  <p>There are many thousands of people like her.  It is totally unfair.  This woman supplied me with figures, for which I thank her.  They relate to the number of beds occupied in Cork hospitals on 14 April, 20 April, 28 April and 7 May.</p> <p>In the Bon Secours Hospital, which has 300 beds, the numbers occupied on those dates were 30, 36, 89 and 103, respectively.  This means that 200 beds or more were empty at all times.  That is shocking.  In the Mater Private Hospital, which has a capacity of 102, six beds were occupied the first week, and the figures for the following weeks were 25, 37 and 23, respectively.  It is an absolute shame.  We had to take over the private hospitals and I supported that, but for how long?  When are we going to give them back and allow surgery of all kinds to go ahead for people?  There are no cervical cancer smear tests taking place.  There are no tests of any kind happening.  Many people with serious diagnoses will require treatment and everything else.</p> <p> I said to the Taoiseach last week that there was a con element or large con element in this.  I am still saying it.  I am glad to see today that in Spain, lawyers are challenging the government there, and the unelected officials who are wielding all the power, to prove the evidence.  I am asking the Taoiseach to give us the evidence.  We cannot get the minutes of meetings.  Give us the scientific evidence which we are not being given.  The officials in Spain will be called to account and I hope they are called to account here too.  Big business is flourishing and all those companies can open, but the same is not true for small businessmen - na daoine beaga - who include ordinary people such as shopkeepers, taxi drivers and all those small business owners.  What is going on is that we seem to be wiping all those people out and letting the big companies flourish.  We must let small businesses trade, whether they are selling a bit of homeware or whatever else.  Let us support the small businessmen who employ from one to ten people or one to 50 people.  There is a con element going on here and the sooner we realise it and the sooner people stand up to it and question it, the better.</p> <p> We must have accountability in this Parliament, not the Taoiseach fleeing to some other building because he cannot face us here.  I hate talking to faceless people.  I talk to get answers for the people from Tipperary on whose behalf I have the privilege of having been elected.  We are not getting answers and I want those answers.  I do not know what is wrong with Deputy Feighan.</p></speech>

There are many reports and surveys indicating that Kerry will be worse affected by the pandemic than any other county in the country.  Indeed, I do not need to see any of those reports because I know of it first hand.  We see that there is nothing at all happening in towns like Killarney, Dingle, Cahersiveen and Castleisland.</p>  <p>  In relation to seasonal workers, it is very unfair that they were not recognised.  If the lockdown had not happened for another two weeks, all of them would have been back and would now be getting the Covid-19 payment.  Bus workers, hotel workers and many others have concerns.  Indeed, in the past two days, I have had over 700 emails from bus drivers and others concerned about the transport industry in Kerry.  It is shambolic the way they have been treated.  We are seeing yards of buses, none of which are moving, and there is no payment for any driver.  Their stamps are gone and they have been totally left behind.  I am asking the Taoiseach to address that matter.</p>  <p>  My next question concerns the social distancing requirement and whether it should be 1 m or 2 m.  In order to get going and give some kind of assistance to the tourism industry, I am asking the Taoiseach to reduce it to 1 m.  Other countries, like France, Austria, Norway, Sweden and Finland, have all applied the 1 m restriction.  The World Health Organization, WHO, to which the Government lately gave &euro;9 million for its advice and assistance, is recommending distancing of 1 m or more.  One metre is sufficient in rural places.  If we do not apply that smaller distancing requirement, and the longer we leave businesses in the hotel and tourism industry without releasing them and allowing them to get going and avail of the national tourists who come down from Dublin and all around the country to towns like Killarney and other places in Kerry, the less hope there is of those businesses ever again opening.  That is probably what will happen.</p>  <p>  I have a question regarding the young drivers waiting for a driving test.</p> <p>Is it possible to give them a temporary amnesty?  There are thousands of them.  If the Taoiseach cannot do that, surely the schools of motoring or the driving instructors could be asked to put a division between the instructor and the learner driver to allow the learner to do the lessons or the test.  After the lessons are completed, and most of the learners have completed them, they could be allowed to do the test in the driving instructor's car.</p> <p> I am glad other Deputies raised the issue of funerals and churches.  I sympathise with all the people and families who have lost loved ones during the pandemic and who did not have a proper funeral.  It makes no sense that only ten people can go into the massive cathedral in Killarney.  There should be some other way of deciding.  I would support it being looked at again.</p> <p> With regard to nursing homes, I call on the Taoiseach to explain to the people of Ireland why people who toiled and worked so hard all their lives had to die alone with no member of their families with them.  As somebody who lost someone very dear to me in the last few years, I know what it means for the person who is dying.  Those people surely could not understand why there was nobody with them.</p> <p> I also call on the Taoiseach to look at what has happened with the direct provision centre in Cahersiveen, all the inconsistencies and the things that should have happened.  It is clear now that the opening of a direct provision centre there should never have happened.  The HSE did not agree with it, the people of Cahersiveen did not agree with it and the residents in the direct provision centre do not agree with it.  I ask the Taoiseach to examine this, to close it down for once and for all and to give the people of Cahersiveen and the residents fair play.</p></speech>

I am happy to do that and to be held to account for as long as I hold this office.  I agree with the Deputy that it is sending the wrong message that I spent two hours in the Chamber and one hour here, but that happened because of a procedural row and a vote that went on for an hour and was unnecessary.  If anybody sent the wrong message to the public, it is not the public health people but some of the Independent Deputies who decided to spend an hour on a procedural wrangle and vote that were entirely unnecessary.</p></speech>

With regard to the col&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh, the Minister is working on a package to help them.  We want to do something to help them because I realise they will be financially hit by having no income for the summer.  However, we must ensure we do it in a way that is fair.  There are many other groups in society and other businesses and organisations that will not get their summer income either because of the pandemic and we cannot do something for one sector and not have regard to what other sectors may want as well.  It is being considered in the round.  We want to do something to help the col&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh and ensure that they can function as normal in 2021.</p></speech>

Beidh na mn&aacute; t&iacute; agus na col&aacute;ist&iacute; th&iacute;os leis.  Beidh impleachta&iacute; maidir leis an gceantar, leis an nGaeilge agus leis na Gaeltachta&iacute;.  Is rud thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; seo.</p> <p>It is very important that the implications of the summer colleges not going ahead is realised at Government level.  I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach could come back to me in writing on when the package will be announced.</p> <p> My second question relates to children with special needs.  I have repeatedly raised it with the Taoiseach at this level as well as with the Minister for Education and Skills.  Can we, please, have some certainty as to what is being put in place, whether the special schools will be reopened and-or, in the meantime, that a package would be in place?</p> <p> Finally, I do not accept the Taoiseach's response in regard to a row in the D&aacute;il.  I do not know how we could put trust in any advice that says it is not safe to be in this D&aacute;il, which is empty, and that the Taoiseach should be ensconced in another room.  I go back to Galway and I see people working.  I go to the shops where they have to work all day.  They cannot hide away in any room, neither can the nurses or the doctors.  What I am saying to the Taoiseach is that we should be sensible.  We are giving out contradictory messages that some people are more important than other people, and we are giving a very wrong message that we are now moving in the right direction in terms of Covid-19.  Let us have a little sense and review the advice.  I read the advice last Thursday that was passed out by the Ceann Comhairle at 2 p.m. and it made no suggestion that this should happen.  I ask the Taoiseach to use the 45 seconds remaining to me to answer the question relating to certainty for the col&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh, and particularly for the children and teenagers with disability and their families.</p></speech>

I will come back to her on the summer colleges once I have more information on what the package is and what may not be possible.</p>  <p>  On children with special needs, we are totally aligned on our concern about that issue.  I share the Deputy's desire to do something for children with special needs over the summer to ensure they get the education, attention and therapy that they need.  NPHET is doing a lot of work at the moment on how that might become possible.</p>  <p>  On the two-hour rule, we do make our own procedures in this House.  It is a matter for the Business Committee and I am happy to abide by whatever decision is made in regard to how we conduct our business in the Chamber.  If that means that I or many of us have to self-isolate for 14 days for some reason then so be it, but I do not make the rules.  I am in the hands of others in that regard.</p></speech>

I would certainly be happy to convey that to the committee and we will see if we are in a position to deal with it.  The extra session we will have per week will certainly help us deal with more issues.</p>  <p>  We had the HSE representatives in last week and I asked what the testing was costing.  It was at the end of a very long day.  We were confined to two hours and I was told that it was hundreds of millions of euro.  That was as specific as we got in the time period available to us.  We cannot bring in the same people every week - we have a lot to cover - but I wonder if the Taoiseach has any more information than that on the cost of Covid-19 testing per person.</p></speech>

I might be out of date on this but the last time I was briefed on this, which was a week or two ago, the estimate for the cost of testing for Covid this year will be somewhere between &euro;400 million and &euro;450 million.  That is because of the fact that the tests cost about &euro;200 a go, which is a lot of money.  I might be out of date but that is the most recent briefing I had on it.</p></speech>

There may be differences - I am not saying there are none - but it does seem like a very large difference.  In Vienna airport, and this brings me on to my next question, they are carrying out accelerated testing, which is obviously more expensive.  The cost is borne entirely by the passenger and one gets the result within three hours.  It is accelerated testing so it is more expensive.  It is &euro;190.  I worry that if we get to 10,000 tests a day and if there is a discrepancy between what we are paying and what we should be paying, that could be an enormous cost to the Exchequer.  I cannot put it any further than that.</p>  <p>  That brings me to my next question.  There has been a good deal of controversy about people coming into the country, the regime in place and whether we should be testing and quarantining.</p> <p>In any event, regulations were made.  They were not put before the committee but they were made and are in place.</p> <p> We should also look at potentially testing people leaving the country, for one particular reason.  Foynes, and later Shannon and all of Ireland, has been an aviation gateway to North America for some time.  The entire economy of the mid-west is built around that.  There are no flights going from Shannon to North America.  There are flights from Dublin but only American residents and citizens can go on them.  We have customs pre-clearance and were the first in the world to have it.  Has there been any investigation of the possibility of testing passengers in our airports?  I appreciate that it would be extraordinarily difficult to accommodate the numbers and to distance and segregate those who are tested from those who are not.  Significant space would be needed to do that.  Having spoken to the officials in Shannon Airport, while they would clearly not be able to do the testing, they would be able to accommodate it.  It may well be that other airports in the country would also be able to.  It might open the possibility of passengers flying from Europe to North America via our airports, using the existing paradigm of customs pre-clearance.  Has the Taoiseach considered that?  If not, will he consider it and will he task the diplomatic corps to see if there is any possibility of that going ahead?</p></speech>

Everything in healthcare is at a premium at the moment, whether PPE or testing kits.  Everyone is looking for the same stuff and the cost is very high, but I think the cost of testing will come down.  The Deputy is right that in Austria, one can have a test done in the airport but one has to bear the cost of &euro;190.  No work has been done in our airports that I am aware of to see if we can set up testing there, but we can give it consideration.  The direction of travel in policy is probably a bit different.  We currently have a 14-day quarantine for people coming into the country through our airports and ports.  We would like to get to a point at some stage in the future, within months rather than weeks, where we can lift that quarantine requirement if people are flying to or from another country where the virus has been successfully suppressed, and then we would not need to do testing at all.  As things stand, neither Britain or America is one of those countries.</p></speech>

A lot of young people need to sit their driver's tests to get a licence to get to work.  Perhaps social distancing is not even being observed to get them to where they need to be.  Is there any possibility of reinstating driver testing in cases of need, particularly in rural Ireland?</p></speech>

I totally appreciate that we need to get testing started as soon as possible.  A car means freedom in large parts of the country, particularly rural Ireland.  People need to do their tests so they can take up employment that they need.</p></speech>

First and most important, I wish to express my sympathy to the family and friends of those who have been lost to this disease since I was last in this House.  It is important to say that each private loss is also a loss to our country, and we offer our deep and sincere condolences to all those impacted.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased today to be able to report some good news to the D&aacute;il.  The modelling data, compiled by Professor Philip Nolan and his team, confirms Ireland&rsquo;s reproduction number is now between 0.4 and 0.5 this week.  It suggests a stable transition where we have kept this virus under control while moving to the first phase of reopening our society.  This, and other key indicators, give grounds for cautious optimism.  The modelling also shows the key measures of severity.  The number of people in hospital and intensive care has also remained stable through the last week.</p> <p>We have seen one to two admissions a day to intensive care units and ten to 15 admissions a day to hospital.</p> <p> It seems at this stage that despite some more businesses opening, and more people moving, we, the Irish people, have managed to keep control of this virus so far.  That is down to the people of Ireland.  It is down to their incredible efforts and their incredible self-discipline.  People have adapted their behaviour to the realities this virus brings.  They have kept their distance, they have washed their hands, and they have adopted the public health advice.  They have worked with us to try to find a safe way of living alongside the virus.  That is really what the next number of weeks have to be about, namely, while the virus is here, how can we safely live alongside it?  We are very grateful to the Irish people for all they have done, all they are doing, and all they are sacrificing.</p> <p> All of our efforts now, our entire national effort, must be to keep the reproduction number below one, and to keep cases low so that we can keep this virus as weak as possible.  Once that reproduction number remains below one, this virus is continuing to be suppressed.  The understandable temptation might be to think the battle is won and we can drop our guard at last.  That would be an extremely dangerous position to adopt because unfortunately this is certainly not the case.  The more we open up our society and economy, which is what we want to do, the more the obligation falls on each and every one of us as an individual to continue to keep ourselves and others safe by following the public health advice that has been shown to date to work.</p> <p> We are all rightly concerned about the possibility of a second wave of Covid-19 in our country.  We have to be clear about who is in control of that possibility.  It is not someone else.  It is us.  This disease cannot come forward on its own.  It can only move through being transmitted by people.  It is our actions that will decide the behaviour of this disease.  We have kept it at bay and we can continue to do that if we stay focused and continue to push home our advantage, as we move to reopen our society and our economy.  We hope to move forward, but we will continue to be led by the data on the behaviour of this disease and our capacity to respond to it, and by the public health advice that has brought us this far.  Cabinet will decide towards the end of next week if we can move forward to phase 2, based on public health advice.</p> <p> I know there has been significant debate, and rightly so, in this Chamber regarding nursing homes and long-term residential care facilities.  I want to assure this House that the Department of Health, the HSE, HIQA, nursing home operators, and front-line staff have all worked tirelessly to help stem the spread of this virus and protect our most vulnerable.  People will seek to apportion blame but we should not forget that the villain here is the virus.</p> <p> Over the past number of weeks, I have made contact with residents of nursing homes across the country using FaceTime in order to talk directly to them.  They are full of steel, resolve and determination, but they also spoke of loneliness.  When we took the decision to introduce visitor restrictions we did so with a heavy heart, knowing the impact this would have on people in nursing homes, and on their friends and families.  I am pleased to report the health service is examining the issue of easing some visitor restrictions and assessing whether we can allow visitors to meet members of their families outside.  I am not suggesting that we can return to normal with visiting, and I do not wish to raise any false hope, but I want residents in nursing homes today, and their families, to know we are looking at this and we are hoping to be in a position to make progress on it shortly.  There has to be a safe way of bringing about some level of visiting, and I have seen very innovative ways of doing this in other countries as well.</p> <p> I also want to update the House on the outbreaks in nursing homes.  As we know, we have experienced a significant number of outbreaks in nursing homes.  Today I can confirm outbreaks have been stemmed in 29 of those.  This means there have been no new cases of Covid-19 in those clusters more than over 28 days.  I want to thank nursing home owners and staff for their heroic efforts in the face of great challenge.  I am also pleased to see there has not been a new outbreak in a nursing home in over a week, according to the chief clinical officer of the HSE today.</p> <p> The protection of those in our nursing homes continues to be my priority.  As I mentioned earlier, we have established a Covid-19 nursing home expert panel, following the recommendation of the National Public Health Emergency Team.  Until now the actions we have taken in relation to our nursing homes have been designed to assist the sector to prevent and control outbreaks of Covid-19.  We recognise this virus may well be with us for months and perhaps years to come.  We must, therefore, continue to plan how to best protect residents and staff in our nursing homes into the future, asking how can we do better, what are our current measures like and are they effective, what are other countries doing and can we learn from them, and what is best international practice.  That planning will be undertaken by the Covid-19 nursing home expert panel.</p> <p> I am really pleased Professor Cecily Kelleher agreed to chair this for me, and I met with her yesterday.  The expert panel will assess, as I have said, the measures already taken, both nationally and internationally, as well as emerging responses to what is still a new virus, to ensure we are doing everything we can in our nursing homes to prepare for and respond to the ongoing threat of this disease in the months to come.</p> <p>I very much look forward to the first report and the recommendations from Professor Kelleher, due at the end of next month.</p> <p> We talk a great deal about older people, and rightly so, but on the other side of the age spectrum I am concerned about the impact this pandemic is having on our children.  Childhood is a time of joy, innocence and exploration.  This pandemic has deprived them of time with their friends and of school time, and that is bound to have an impact.  Summer is here and, while it will not be a normal summer, we must look at ways to help our children resume some form of normality.  I hear from children right across the country and from their parents.  This is a very tough time for our kids and I am not sure we are talking enough about the impact of this pandemic on children.  I am pleased to tell the House that NPHET is currently examining the matter of how we provide more guidance and assistance for children and their families, and it hopes to be in a position to make some decisions on this next week.</p> <p> On the matter of travel, from tomorrow it will be mandatory for passengers from overseas, irrespective of nationality, to complete a Covid-19 public health passenger locator form on their arrival in our country.  We have put this measure into law because this form is very important in our overall public health response to this disease.  The form facilitates follow-up checks to make sure that people are staying where they said they would stay and it allows us to do more accurate and faster contact tracing in the event of a confirmed imported case.  It is really important, as we continue to suppress the virus here, that if there is an imported case we can move very quickly to contact trace and isolate.  We will require all passengers, with exceptions such as for aircraft crew, to complete this form.  The regulations will be further reviewed by me on 18 June.  If they must be continued, they will be kept under very regular review so that they will only be in force for as long as they are necessary.</p> <p> The introduction of this measure, along with the public health advice for self-isolation for 14 days and, I must say contrary to what I heard on the airwaves this morning, the continuing public health recommendation against non-essential travel off the island of Ireland are to ensure that we can continue to protect the progress that we have made against this disease.  I will continue to take my travel advice from public health experts.</p> <p> It is tempting to look only to the future and to wish to leave behind the sacrifices and the hardship of these last months as quickly as possible.  It is very understandable but we must guard against moving too soon or too fast.  We must remain patient and be vigilant but there are signs for cautious optimism.  If we continue to practice the behaviours that we know will keep ourselves and others safe, we will keep saving lives, we will weaken the virus and we will strengthen our position in being able to take more measures and more moves forward in terms of our roadmap, hopefully by the end of next week.</p></speech>

They paint a very dark picture of staff having to use painter's overalls and goggles from local schools to protect themselves; of four-week delays in testing; and of no voice on NPHET or even on the subgroup looking at nursing homes.  The Minister said to me recently that HIQA was its voice.  I put that to HIQA yesterday at the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response.  HIQA said it was not the voice of nursing homes on those groups.</p>  <p>  The correspondence is damning when it comes to patients being transferred from hospitals to nursing homes.  It began in early March.  It began before there was guidance in place for the testing of those patients, before there was guidance in place for nursing homes on how to care for those patients, and before nursing homes had the PPE needed to care for those patients.  </p>  <p>   When some nursing homes refused, the HSE wrote to them on 6 March.  Here is one of the things it concluded.  It concluded that there were no grounds for greater concerns about discharges from hospitals at that time, as every possible risk assessment and medical assessment necessary would have been carried out before the patient was confirmed suitable for discharge.  That was before any guidance was issued.</p>  <p>  The guidance was issued four days later, on 10 March, and it was sobering.  Patients from hospitals that have Covid patients, but where Covid has not spread around the hospital, were not tested and were not isolated.  Regarding patients from hospitals where there were Covid patients and Covid was spreading through the hospital, if those patients were asymptomatic, they were not tested.  If they were not a close contact of a Covid patient, they were not even isolated.</p> <p>If they were in a hospital where there were Covid patients and where Covid was spreading, and they were a close contact of one of those Covid patients, they were not tested; they were just isolated for a few days.  The representatives of nursing homes asked for stricter measures and said that the guidance contained "no practical guidance to nursing homes on how to reduce the risk of transmission" or to inform regarding the procedures to care for residents or staff who may present with symptoms.  No information was provided with regard to accessing PPE.  The nursing homes were screaming for help.  On the same day of that guidance, NPHET actually advised that the visitor restrictions that nursing homes themselves had put in place were unnecessary.  That is where NPHET was.</p> <p> A week later the Minister launched the Government's 60-page action plan, which mentions nursing homes once.  The only mention of nursing homes was that they were somewhere that patients should be discharged to.  That was it.  As of today, 884 women and men have lost their lives in nursing homes due to Covid.  It is over half the total number of fatalities.  Does the Minister accept that the transfer of non-tested and non-isolated patients from hospitals with Covid in them most likely contributed to those clusters happening in nursing homes?  Will he commit to finding out how many of those outbreaks in the nursing homes were likely to have come from the patients who were transferred?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.214" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="16:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700038#SS00200"><p>I watched much of the committee hearing yesterday.  It was disappointing that officials from the Department of Health were not invited to a committee hearing on nursing homes.  Their ears must have been burning but they were not in a position to speak.  Nor were representatives of the HSE invited to give an opening statement setting out what it has been doing.  However, be that as it may.</p>  <p>  Action 4 of the national action plan on Covid, caring for people who are at risk or vulnerable, is all about protecting older and more vulnerable people.  There was engagement with the nursing home sector as far back as 19 February, when the head of the HSE met representatives of Nursing Homes Ireland.  His note of that meeting specifically refers to his conversation about preparedness for Covid.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious that the transfer of patients from one setting to another is done on the basis of clinical guidance and a clinical viewpoint.  It would be done on the basis of a doctor deciding that it would be appropriate to transfer somebody.  It is true to say that our position on testing evolved throughout the crisis.  Ireland is probably one of the only countries to have decided to test all residents and staff in nursing homes regardless of symptoms.  I do not accept - because I do not yet have the evidence to accept - that the clusters were caused by the transfer of patients from acute hospital settings.  I am not sure that the timeline shows that either.  I very much accept the point the Deputy made that this is something that should be established.  I hope that the expert review panel, chaired by a public health expert with a geriatrician and a senior nurse on it, could also look at the overall issue of admissions and transfers, and discharges from hospitals.  The Deputy raised a fair point in that regard.</p></speech>

In recent days older people in County Wexford received a letter stating if they did not wish to restart their home support service by 8 June 2020, their service will cease and they will be placed on the waiting list for home support services - in other words, use it or lose it by 8 June.  Many elderly people are concerned and have contacted me about this.  They have had to rearrange their home situation, often having to move into the home of a son or daughter because the normal care cannot look after them.  This letter is totally inappropriate at this stage.  It is basically telling older people they will have to move home and reuse this service or they will lose it.  Based on the most recent figures, almost 900 people in Wexford are on the waiting list.  Bizarrely in Carlow-Kilkenny there is nobody.  The fear in Wexford of being put to the back of the list is very real.</p>  <p>  I have a second question.  I was contacted by a healthcare worker this morning.  She was in contact with asymptomatic but Covid-positive patients.  She has been waiting 14 days for her test results.  I ask the Minister to comment on this and ensure healthcare workers are not waiting for 14 days for test results.  She has been out of action for that length of time.</p>  <p>  I have a final comment.  There is now effectively cross-party support for the publication of the refreshed Vision for Change.  Can that please be published?</p></speech>

We are eager that people feel comfortable to resume home care again and to have vital supports back in their home but I understand that different people will think differently on that.  I will pursue it with the HSE and the Deputy might provide me with the correspondence.  </p> <p> On A Vision for Change, my hope, if not expectation, is that a new Government will be formed in June.  I would like to see it bring A Vision for Change to the Government in its first weeks.  The document is ready but traditionally new policy initiatives are not taken to Government, that they need to be owned by the new Government.  It is something with which the new Government should hit the ground running.  It has been through Cabinet committee.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Jim Daly, has put much work into it and it is ready.  We should aspire to have it published in June.  If a new Government is not formed in June, I can introduce it on behalf of the current Government.  We should commit to publishing it then.</p></speech>

While this has been a very significant week, we can never forget these people or their families.  I also acknowledge the vast work done across the country but today I focus on my own county, Mayo, with the work done by health workers, carers, home helps, family carers and other professionals, which has been immense and under hugely challenging circumstances.  There are specific difficulties which I have spoken to the Minister about.  I would like his reviews.  There are difficulties in Mayo University Hospital in particular.  Staff have contacted me and other public representatives on the continuing, up to last week, cross-over of staff between Covid and non-Covid units.  Staff are moving between units, traversing through one unit to get to the other.  Second, they have raised the inadequate physical space in the hospital between the Covid unit and the non-Covid unit which makes this crossing over between units inevitable.  Third, they have raised the absence of an isolation unit in Mayo University Hospital and also the district hospitals in Ballina, Belmullet and Swinford.  Are there plans, as we catch our breath from what may only be the first wave, to invest in capital facilities in hospitals across Mayo and the rest of the country, looking at the lessons learned in recent months and putting investment in place to ensure that these hospitals are ready for what may be an ongoing Covid situation?</p>  <p>  What are the testing levels of staff at Mayo University Hospital as well as all district hospitals and health facilities across Mayo?  Some weeks ago, great effort was put in.  Has that continued?  Has it been updated?  What percentage of staff at Mayo University Hospital were tested?</p>  <p>  Finally, there is the matter of derogation.  An issue has arisen across the country where HSE occupational health may advise someone who is defined as a close contact not to work but their line manager can ask or derogate them to work.  What are the rules around that policy?</p></speech>

I often feel somewhat uneasy when we speak about progress in statistics and figures but we are not talking about them in a vacuum.  This is a virus that has caused a lot of tragedy to an awful lot of people and we think of them.  I thank Deputy Calleary for raising the matters on Mayo hospital.  He was in direct contact with me on these issues.  I am advised by Saolta hospital group that appropriate control measures are in place in Mayo University Hospital for Covid-19.  As is the case across hospitals, Mayo University Hospital has adjusted how care is delivered to patients as well as continuously implementing updated national advice.  Actions taken include streaming patients into Covid and non-Covid pathways.  This did require some physical changes to the hospital, including a new entrance.  Where possible, patients are treated in single rooms.  However, given the infrastructure of the hospital, it is not always possible to provide single rooms for patients, which was the point the Deputy made about isolation facilities.</p> <p>Patients who attend the hospital through the emergency department are also separated into suspect and non-suspect Covid-19 patients.  Suspected Covid-19 patients who attend the emergency department are tested in rapid turnaround time.  While every effort is made to ensure patients are streamed separately, occasionally it will happen that a person in a designated non-Covid space will turn out to be positive, but he or she may not have shown any symptoms.  Patients who develop symptoms consistent with Covid-19 on a ward are tested rapidly and transferred to a Covid-19 ward if diagnosed positive.  The hospital has separated its clinical staff into teams to minimise contact and to reduce the risk of healthcare worker and patient infection.  Again, that is all based on the national guidance provided at that time.</p> <p> Saolta has provided executive microbiology and infectious disease input into the management of Covid-19 in Mayo, but in light of the serious issues Deputy Calleary raises I will now ask the CEO of the HSE for a report on the matters he raised with me, and that report to include information on the testing levels of staff.  My understanding is that the national public health emergency team is likely to broaden the case definition for testing at its meeting tomorrow.  It is certainly something under consideration.  I will also ask specifically about the supports for the district hospitals in Ballina, Swinford and across Mayo, and for a view on the derogation.  I will get the Deputy a written report from the CEO.</p></speech>

Our sympathies and condolences must go to the bereaved families who have suffered tragic losses in recent months due to the Covid-19 crisis.  We must all acknowledge that there has been a tremendous national effort by everybody involved across the country.  We also acknowledge the very dedicated work by all the front-line staff, especially but not just in the health service.  I refer to those people who work in supermarkets and shops and who look after people getting food and allow them to go about their daily business.  They are all putting themselves at risk by being out there, but I know that most employers have good arrangements in place to ensure social distancing.</p>  <p>  The Minister might be happy to hear me say this: it is impossible to get every decision 100% correct during a pandemic.  That must be acknowledged.  Some of the issues that did arise showed up previous shortcomings, such as the treatment of nursing homes.  For years, they have tried to be involved with national committees but the Minister refused several times to agree to that.  Other issues that came to light relate to the promises to process 5,000 and 10,000 tests in the next week.  We have long heard the over-promising of testing.  Private hospitals have not been used to their full capacity.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund must be stepped up to pick up a lot of the slack because there will be a lot of people on waiting lists.</p>  <p>  People might agree or disagree with it, but I am happy to hear there are differences of opinion among the members of the national public health emergency team, their advisory committees, the Government and the Department of Health.  I would be very worried if everyone was sitting there mute and they were all yes-men and yes-women.  I am pleased there are differences of opinion because we would not have got to where we are unless people had teased out their various points of view.  I do not have a question for the Minister.</p></speech>

I have sent the names to him.  I have a very brief question on the national children's hospital.  After much discussion, construction has restarted.  I would have thought the hospital would be a priority project.  As I often say to my daughter, it is the thing that she is going to be paying for out of her pension, but we do want to see it built nonetheless.  My information is that work has not restarted.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that.  Will there be an additional cost for the delay and, if so, how much will the additional cost be per day, per hour or per week?</p></speech>

I do not make the rules.</p> <p>I thank Deputy O'Reilly for raising those screening matters.  I will come back to her directly on the cases she has raised with me.  </p> <p> The Office of Government Procurement, OGP, has been considering how to support a co-ordinated approach to the resumption of public sector construction projects.  This has resulted in the publication of notes providing guidance, which are available on the its website.  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, has statutory responsibility for the delivery of the national children's hospital.  Health and safety on the construction site, including workforce health and safety, is the responsibility of the main contractor.  Construction-related work on the site of the hospital stopped on 31 March due to the restrictions.  Health and safety is a priority for everyone working on the new hospital and the reopening of the construction site needs to be carried out safely and in compliance with regulations, in the interests of the well-being of those working on the site, members of staff, visitors to St. James's Hospital and local residents.  The NPHDB has been informed by the main contractor that it is currently updating the construction stage health and safety plan in preparation for the reopening of the site.  A date for the resumption of construction works has yet to be finalised.  When the site reopens, it is expected that work will resume on a phased basis to accommodate social distancing.  </p> <p> It is too early to fully assess the impact of health and safety requirements associated with Covid-19 on the new national children's hospital.  Unlike others in this Chamber, I do not think we should pick figures out of the air at random and throw them out there.  We need to see the impact of the safety measures.  </p></speech>

We are going to pay for it.  I wish to quote a text message I received from a cousin of mine, shortly after her father passed away in a nursing home:</p> <blockquote> 	Is it the case that nursing homes were hit so hard because patients, some already showing signs of Covid-19 were transferred out of hospital to free up beds?  They were not only moved once &ndash; in some cases they were kept for 2 weeks in one home and transferred on.  You can understand my alarm. </blockquote>  <p>I received this message on 26 April.  I indicated to my cousin that I would ask that question and I did.  I asked HSE officials during a Zoom meeting.  They said that the testing regime meant that nobody was transferred out until they had two negative test results.  I asked the Minister about this in the Chamber at my next opportunity.  I understand that work is ongoing and I appreciate that he has been talking to people in nursing homes.  The reason I have quoted this text message to him is that I want to make it clear to him that families want answers.</p><p>Yesterday evidence was given by representatives of private nursing homes.  The same issues exist in both public and the private homes.  It seems that there was no plan.  Mr. Tadhg Daly said: &quot;The point we have been continuously making is that given the vulnerability of the age profile and the complexity of care of older persons, there should have been a national plan&quot;.  He maintains that these people were categorised as low risk.  On 10 March, a request was made to the HSE and the Department of Health for all patients to be tested, risk assessed and medically assessed.  I cannot tell my cousin whether this was done, but I know what she believes.  We have spoken about this several times.</p><p>Many of those families felt somewhat vindicated by what was said here yesterday.  They had been told that this could not have happened, or had been shown graphs to show that it could not have happened that way.  These families cannot be dismissed.  They are real people.  This family wants to know how this virus got into the nursing home when they could not visit their father.  They had to wait outside.  They observed all of the rules and they believe the staff did their best and followed best practice.  However, on 10 March, when the nursing home sector was looking for guidance and assurance that people would be tested, it was not forthcoming.  I note that there are now more than 400 delayed discharges in the acute hospital sector.  There is a possibility that those people will be transferred <i>en masse.  </i>Can the Minister make a commitment that in the event of this happening, this testing will be carried out? </p></speech>

I extend my sympathies to her cousin on her loss and I thank the Deputy for sharing the text message.  I can only imagine what a traumatic time this must be.  I understand what the Deputy is saying and I do not want to show a graph or a chart or be cold in my response.  These are valid questions.  However, I note that the first cluster in a nursing home occurred on 16 March.  The first case in Ireland was 29 February.</p> <p>People are now looking back to January and February as though there was a knowledge and understanding of this virus when perhaps there simply was not one here or in many other places.  I heard the Minister of State, Jim Daly, say there should have been a plan, but there was and there is.  There is a national plan, for starters, but on top of that national standards for infection prevention and control of antimicrobial stewardship for nursing homes were published and adopted in September 2018 that every nursing home in the country is meant to adhere to.  There was a meeting with Paul Reid, the HSE CEO, on Covid preparedness on 19 February and a meeting with the Minister of State on 28 February-----</p></speech>

The Deputy can indeed.  Interim guidance on transfer between care facilities was circulated to NHI on 10 March and there was an agreement to provide PPE on 12 March.  I do not wish to use the Deputy's time going through all of this but I reject her assertion.  Some 400 pages of correspondence show there was an awful lot of contact between incredible people in the HSE, the Department and nursing homes.</p></speech>

As general secretary of the largest representative organisation for mental health workers, he is surely well placed to make such an appraisal of the past few years of the Government's and the political establishment's approach to the system.  I join his call.</p>  <p>  This crisis has highlighted not just the gaps in our services, which are plain to see for anyone who cared, but also the failure of the outgoing Government to do anything meaningful about them.  It is generous to say the Government did the bare minimum during the austerity years but the damage done in the wake of that austerity is simply not good enough.  For years, the Government has misled the House, the public and campaigners for mental health funding with delays, retractions and re-announcements.  The costs have been far greater than the money needed to boost services or the false economy of savings on our vital health services.  Mental health represented just 6% of planned health funding before this crisis.  Unfortunately, I do not have enough time to go through all the issues but I will ask three brief questions.</p>  <p>  We need to publish the refresher report on the A Vision for Change strategy.  This is something the Government has talked about for almost five years, and it has used it as a smokescreen for an in-depth public assessment of the system, as would be done by a full, permanent mental health committee.  The previous Government wound up the temporary Joint Committee on Future of Mental Health Care in 2018 and has ignored its recommendations.  I ask the Minister to publish the report now.  It was carried out under his time and reflects the reality of the services under his time, and he must take ownership of that.  He must also ensure that any Government negotiations deal properly with mental health and that the public can be informed to scrutinise adequately any proposed Government on mental health.  The Minister has the report and told me he would leave it to the next Government.  I ask him to publish it now.  There is cross-party agreement on the matter.</p>  <p>  I also want to raise the effect of Covid-19 on our mental health services.  Mental health staff must be provided with adequate PPE and safe and secure working conditions to protect themselves and those in their care.  Social distancing presents serious issues in an overstretched, understaffed and overcrowded system.  This cannot be done effectively and safely with the problems the system has faced due to years of neglect.  The Mental Health Commission has expressed grave concerns about the delays in testing in the mental health settings, and it was only one month ago that all mental health staff were required to be tested, despite working with many high-risk and vulnerable people in crowded conditions.</p>  <p>  Finally, I raise the problem of precarious work conditions for mental health professionals in the community and voluntary sector.  Those organisations have been fantastic and much needed bodies for people who cannot access public services that, in too many cases, do not exist in their communities.  Mental healthcare is not a charity.  It is the right of the people and the duty of the State and the public service.  We must protect the vital workers in these organisations and ensure that the expertise is not lost to fundraising difficulties or reorganisation during the crisis, as seen by Pieta House.</p>  <p>  Any new Government needs to take mental health seriously, fund it properly and heed Peter Hughes's words.  I have asked all parties to join together to form an Oireachtas mental health forum to support the permanent mental health committee.  This is vital.</p></speech>

Many of these cleaners work as front-line workers in hospitals and care facilities in the battle against Covid-19 and they were expecting a 40 cent pay rise at the beginning of March, which would have brought their hourly rate of pay to just &euro;11.20 per hour.  According to SIPTU, which represents these workers, contract cleaning companies have reneged on this pay rise, which had previously been agreed on proposal.  The decision to withhold this pay rise beggars belief.  Contract cleaners who are putting their lives on the line while working in our hospitals are paid just &euro;10.80 per hour.  One of these workers has already lost his life due to Covid-19.  Hundreds more are affected.  SIPTU negotiated the 40 cent increase in good faith with employers.  I understand that the Irish Contract Cleaning Association is now refusing to implement this pay increase.  The Irish Contract Cleaning Association, which represents all the big cleaning companies in the State, needs to immediately honour the 40 cent per hour increase, backdated to March, and to apologise to those employees.  The issue again highlights what happens when good public jobs are privatised.  Cleaners employed directly by hospitals are paid at least &euro;3.20 per hour more than those employed by private cleaning companies who also have no pension or sick pay entitlements.</p>  <p>  I have spoken recently with a worker in University Hospital Limerick who told me that she worked 37 hours overtime last week at double pay, and yet the hospital does not hire staff.  That 37 hours at double pay would hire two staff members.  I put it to the Minister, but perhaps it is a question for the next Government, that there needs to be a major review of those privatised services when we come out of this Covid-19 emergency, with the aim of bringing them back under direct hospital contracts that would be better for workers and cheaper for taxpayers.</p>  <p>  I have two questions for the Minister on separate issues.  The trolley crisis at University Hospital Limerick, which I raised constantly with the Minister in the last D&aacute;il, is coming back again.  There are 29 people waiting on trolleys there today.  What will the Minister do specifically about those people on trolleys?  How will they practise physical distancing while they are waiting?  In response to a parliamentary question tabled by my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, on the issue of private hospitals, the Ministers said that Bon Secours Hospital Limerick, which is located at the old Barrington's Hospital site, had only 1% utilisation under the plan agreed with private hospitals.  Will the Minister explain the reasons for that?</p></speech>

I too would like to see that agreement honoured.</p>  <p>  On the Bon Secours Hospital Limerick, they are the figures I gave to Deputy O'Reilly.  The updated figures I have today show 30% of inpatient beds now being used in the Bon Secours Hospital Limerick.  I will forward a refreshed table to Deputies Quinlivan and O'Reilly.  I remain committed to the development projects at University Hospital Limerick and to getting them opened as soon as they are ready.  I take on board the issues made to me in this House and in other fora by Deputies Quinlivan, Kelly, O'Donnell and Leddin that we cannot see a return to the overcrowding there.</p>  <p>  I wish to be clear for the benefit of Deputy Buckley that the Government did not wind up any committee.  The Government does not have the ability to do that.  It is a matter for the Oireachtas to decide what committees to set up.  I take seriously Deputy Buckley's work in the area of mental health.  It is my intention that A Vision for Change will be published in June.  If I am still in office I will do it in June and if not I hope the new Government will.  We have provided additional funding to the &euro;8 million with &euro;1.1 million also allocated for online counselling services.  The issues raised by Deputy Buckley on mental health are important.  Peter Hughes has a degree of expertise in this and I thank him for the work of his members during the pandemic.</p></speech>

I live less than half a mile from one of the biggest of those private hospitals, the Bon Secours Hospital Cork.  There is a view, communicated to me through much correspondence, that there is underutilisation of many of these facilities.</p> <p>I know that a decision is to be taken in the next few days about extending that beyond the end of June.  Will the Minister clarify how we can make more efficient use of those facilities over the next four weeks?  If we wish to retain all or some of those facilities after 30 June, can we put in place a process which will allow some people back into providing the care that they were providing?  I have a case of an 11 year old boy with autism.  It is an intellectual disability and he is non-verbal.  He needs urgent care.  He had a programme of care but that stopped because the consultant he was under did not sign the category A contract.  Will the Minister provide some clarification on that?  Will a decision be made on this matter in the next few days?  If so, can we get an indication of how we can progress making more efficient use of those 2,000 beds?</p></speech>

That is thanks to the incredible efforts of the Irish people.</p>  <p>  It is clear that we are going to require additional capacity for the foreseeable future, however.  Even providing non-Covid care services is going to be much more difficult now.  One will have to keep vacant beds in public hospitals.  One cannot go back to having massive numbers of people on trolleys.  Accordingly, we will have to keep some additional capacity.  I have an open mind on how we arrange that.  One could look to finesse or improve agreements in that regard.  The Cabinet will consider this on Friday.</p>  <p>  We have seen the relocation of a number of services from public hospitals to private.  For example, with medical oncology services, there has been the relocation of day wards from St. Vincent's public to St. Vincent's private, Tullamore to the Hermitage, Waterford and Wexford to Whitfield and Kilkenny to Aut Even Hospital.  Urgent surgical oncology services have moved from the Mater public to the Mater private, from Galway to the Galway Clinic, from St. James's to Blackrock and from Waterford to Whitfield.  There are real benefits to non-Covid services which are now beginning to be ramped up.</p>  <p>  This is the Deputy's point about how we make better use of that capacity now that we have the virus in a very different place to where it could have been.</p></speech>

As the Minister is aware, a 60-bed block there has been under construction since the start of the year.  In addition to that, as part of a Covid response, another 48 beds have been earmarked for UHL which brings that up to 98 beds in total.  Of the 48 additional beds, 14 are due to be completed and opened in June with 24 beds opened in July.  In addition, another 24 beds are to be provided in Croom for completion in July as well.  Will the Minister give an assurance that resources will be in place to ensure UHL can recruit the necessary staff in order that these units are open when completed?  As the Minister will be well aware, Limerick and the mid-west region has a bed capacity issue outside of Covid.  I am looking for a reassurance about resources.  I know the buildings are under way which is great news for Limerick.  However, will the resources be in place to ensure staff can be recruited and be in place when the 122 beds are completed at the units in UHL and Croom?</p></speech>

I visited it quite a while ago.  I am delighted to see it is progressing and nearing completion.</p></speech>

The short answer to the Deputy's question is "Yes".  We will need all of the additional capacity we can get.  I will give the Deputy a commitment that it is the intention of my Department to ensure those beds are fully funded and can open as quickly as possible.  Of the 48, 24 are due to be ready to be opened in June and the other 24 in July.  I will look into the opening of those in Croom.</p></speech>

I thank the people of Ireland for the work they have done to help effectively flatten the curve.  I wish to bring the thoughts of many of my constituents to the Chamber.  The 2 m rule has been mentioned already and I know that a meeting between the Chief Medical Officer and Cabinet is ongoing as I speak.  It is something many people are beginning to articulate and while I understand that we will take the advice of the Chief Medical Officer, it is an issue that needs to be brought to the D&aacute;il Chamber.</p>  <p>  We have been dealing with Covid for a long time now but the health service is continuing to work away.  I was coming back from the D&aacute;il last Wednesday night and ended up in Sligo University Hospital.  Everything is fine and despite what people say, politicians do have hearts.  I thank the ambulance staff, the clinical nurse co-ordinators, the doctors and all the staff in Sligo University Hospital.  The work they are doing is absolutely incredible.  I was very proud and thankful for my experience late on Wednesday night.  We are very fortunate to have such dedicated professional service staff who are doing tremendous work.  I was asked to bring their thoughts to the Minister today, and I will be talking to him off the record as well.  I again thank the staff at Sligo University Hospital and all the front-line staff around the country.  I saw first hand the work they do.  I ask the Minister to elaborate on the issue I raised.</p></speech>

One cannot keep a good man down.  I am pleased he is well and that he had a good experience in our health service.  I join him in paying tribute to the staff in Sligo University Hospital, and the paramedics as well.  I had the pleasure of visiting Sligo University Hospital some time last year.  There are exciting plans in place in terms of capital redevelopment, as well as plans for the hospice facility in Sligo.  It is a very well-run hospital but it is in need of significant extra capacity and that is something we are going to have to work on together in the weeks and months ahead.</p>  <p>  On the 2 m rule versus a 1 m rule, as the Deputy rightly said, we will be guided by public health advice.  It is very clear that if someone is 2 m away from me, there is a 99% chance that he or she has a degree of protection if I cough or sneeze.  If that person is 1 m away, he or she will still have protection, but not as much.  Let us be honest; there will be some sectors in which 2 m of distance will not be possible and we will have to look at how we can put other mitigating measures in place there.  It would be hard to get one's hair cut from 2 m away, for example.  We will have to look at those sectors in other ways, but the general public health advice is that our citizens should follow the 2 m rule as much as possible.  It is the best way of disrupting transmission of the virus.  Very interesting research is being done on this issue in the Mater Hospital, as was shown on RT&Eacute; last night.  It is very hard for the droplets to carry further than 2 m.</p></speech>

I want to talk to the Minister about Limerick.  There is concern in my city and county at the rise in trolley numbers at University Hospital Limerick, UHL.  While I acknowledge the Minister's response to my constituency colleague, Deputy Quinlivan, many people locally have questions about the spare capacity in Barrington's hospital and why it is not being used.  I do not want to make a political issue of it, but I plead with the Minister to give this House and the public some cause for hope.  In recent years, the issue of overcrowding has been very damaging for confidence in the health service in the mid-west and while people have been very understanding of hospital workers throughout this pandemic, we need optimism that the situation can be solved in both the short and long terms.  If we continue to make progress in reducing the spread of Covid-19, does the Minister expect the trolley numbers in UHL to return to pre-Covid levels in the coming months?</p></speech>

I pay tribute to the staff in UHL, led by chief executive, Ms Colette Cowan, and clinical director, Dr. Gerry Burke, for the excellent work they do.  It is a hospital, and a hospital group, that does not have adequate capacity relative to the size of the population, which will not come as news to anybody.  I do not want to use up all the time but, as we have been discussing, there are now exciting and ambitious plans to try and grow that capacity.  There will be a 60-bed ward block.  I am looking at Deputy Kelly because he regularly raises this issue with me.  There will be an additional 48 beds in UHL and 24 in Croom Hospital.  I saw the latest figures for the Bon Secours Hospital in Limerick and it is true that there was only 2% inpatient occupancy between 11 May and 15 May.  That increased to 30% between 18 May and 22 May.  In light of Deputy Leddin raising the matter, I will specifically seek an update from the HSE on the utilisation of that capacity.</p>  <p>  I do not want UHL to be allowed to go back to the significant overcrowding issue it had.  That was not a fault of its own but rather of decades of failure to deliver additional bed capacity.  I argue that we have put the plans for that capacity in place but we need it to come on stream as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I highlight the issue of section 39 service providers to disability and intellectual disability service users.  It is commendable how they have adapted so quickly to the changed set of circumstances and how they have managed to keep Covid-19 infection at bay but they are now facing a dual challenge of the cost incurred due to risk of infection coupled with a perfect storm of underfunding and a 1% efficiency cut imposed by the HSE.  It is simply not feasible for section 39 providers to take hit after hit and be expected to provide the same high level of care that is, in many circumstances, beyond a basic social care model.  Those providers need the support of the Minister and the Government to deal with the additional costs.  Will section 39 providers be compensated for expenses incurred as a result of this pandemic, including the purchase of PPE, taking on agency staff and other costs?</p>  <p>  Thanks to the collective efforts of front-line staff, all agencies, the Minister, the Government and the people of Ireland, we have managed to suppress the spread of the virus in the community.  We have prevented the overwhelming of our healthcare system.  We now face the new crisis of ever-growing waiting lists for non-Covid hospital appointments.  Waiting lists were at a critical level in the public system for some time before the pandemic and that point is now also being reached in the private system.  I seek the support of the Minister to design an element of flexibility within the arrangement between private hospitals, consultants and the HSE.  Even at this stage as we, hopefully, exit the health phase of the crisis, we can offer an opportunity for consultants and private hospitals to again see their patients, to deal with non-Covid patients in the public system and to build capacity once again to reduce those waiting lists.</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned my constituency and Aut Even Hospital in Kilkenny which is running at between 33% and 36% bed capacity.  Healthcare staff want to do their jobs and reduce the burden on services.  We do not know if there will be a second wave of Covid-19 coupled with a winter flu later this year and we need to prepare for that.</p>  <p>  Will he come to an arrangement to urgently allow a degree of flexibility for consultants to see their patients?  There were, as I understand it, proposals around B and C contracts to build in that flexibility but they were denied at the time.</p>  <p>  Will he provide the House with an update on the commencement of videofluoroscopy scans at Temple Street Hospital?  Many families are awaiting vital scans for their children while Temple Street is awaiting clear direction from the HSE to recommence scans.</p>  <p>  Is there a case to be made for the provision of PPE to allow an opportunity to family members and loved ones of patients in a hospice setting where there is no virus to pay a final visit and say goodbye?  My understanding is that this is currently not the case and that direction is required from the HSE and NPHET regarding family visits to hospice settings.</p>  <p>  I tabled a question, No. 380, to the Minister on the Covid channel on 27 April.  In response, the Minister referred the matter to the HSE for answer.  It is now a calendar month later.  I have followed up on the matter twice and still have received no response.  Is it not important when a roadmap to our country's recovery is based on statistical information that we know how many people were referred for testing because they presented with symptoms but were never tested, or tested too late to give a positive result?  Does the Minister agree that the prevalence of referral without follow-up has led to a lack of public confidence in the HSE's capacity to test in a timely manner and will he explain the delay in the HSE's provision of this data?</p> <p>I wish to commend the network of community sewists across the island who are making and distributing DIY cloth face masks to vulnerable groups.  Will the Department run television advertisement campaigns to highlight their effective use and washing?  Will the Department advocate for more widespread use of cloth masks?</p> <p> Finally, can the Minister provide the House with an update regarding progress towards achieving a second cath lab for University Hospital Waterford?  The deficits within the south east have been well documented and the region needs absolute clarity on this matter.</p></speech>

First, I had a meeting with the Disability Action Coalition, the Disability Federation of Ireland and the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers in respect of a number of the issues that the Deputy has raised regarding disability funding.  There are three elements to it.  First, there is the 1% efficiency cut, saving or whatever one wishes to call it that they were meant to achieve this year.  Being blunt and honest, they will not be in a position to achieve it and I have made that clear to them.  We need to look at how we can formalise that and provide them with peace of mind in that regard in the coming days.  Second, there is the issue of Covid costs.  They have experienced Covid costs.  They have done an incredible job of adapting their services.  I have heard from them and from service users, particularly of the use of technology, which is something we will want to keep.  My Department would like to support them in meeting the Covid costs like we have for other sectors.  The third element is we need to see the full implementation of the Catherine Day report.  That will be a job for the next Government.  It should feature prominently in any programme for Government and this House should make sure that it happens.</p>  <p>  In relation to private hospitals, we need to be intelligent enough to say when the situation changes in terms of the route of the virus that we need to show our flexibility but I need to be clear the HSE's view is that it will require that capacity, and that is my view too.  That is how we make sure we get that right in addressing the issues the Deputy raises.</p>  <p>  I must come back to the Deputy on the video fluoroscopy scans in Temple Street.  I am not familiar with that but I will come back to the Deputy on it.</p>  <p>  On the issue of visitor restrictions for hospices or for nursing homes, as I stated earlier the National Public Health Emergency Team will look at this.  It cannot be beyond us as a country to work out ways of ensuring visits on compassionate grounds.  One can get sick of loneliness.  It has been a lonely and long time for people.  Obviously, I am acutely aware of the issue the Deputy raises regarding people in hospices.</p>  <p>  I am very sorry and angered that the Deputy has not received a response one month later.  I will follow that up for the Deputy.</p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of face coverings, I am a big believer in these.  There is now public health guidance that one should wear face coverings on public transport and in indoor areas where it might be difficult to socially distance.  We use the term, as the Deputy did, "face coverings", instead of "face masks", and that is intentional.  It is easy to make these at home.  We have advertisements to do that but so far these are on social media.  I take the point that a wider public awareness campaign could be useful.  I will take that up with the HSE.</p>  <p>  On the issue of University Hospital Waterford and the cath lab, which is an issue I get asked about a lot, I will send the Deputy an up-to-date note because I do not have the information at the top of my head.  The development of a second cath lab is funded and under way.  It is crucial that Waterford has a second cath lab before it can provide a 24-7 service.  There is a national cardiac review under way which will inform whether to provide a 24-7 service, and in what parts of the country too.  I will return to the Deputy in writing on that.</p></speech>

The fact is it is the most discriminated hospital in Ireland.  The region is discriminated against, with the lowest amount of beds, consultants, nurses etc.  The plan, not only the beds, needs to happen.  The Minister complimented Ms Colette Cowen and Dr. Gerry Burke and I thank him for doing so.  The Minister might also wish the same Dr. Gerry Burke, probably the most publicly-oriented clinical aide I have ever met in my life, the best on his retirement tomorrow.</p>  <p>  I have six questions for the Minister.  I will list them off and give the Minister time to answer them.  On nursing homes, the 400 pages of documents and the famous letter that everyone is talking about that the Department received from HIQA, the Minister might send us a copy of that letter but also might tell us when he himself read it.  The Minister stated yesterday that the Department read it when it arrived and passed it on straight away.  I accept that but when did the Minister himself actually read it?  We need to correlate outbreaks versus that document.  We need to see whether HIQA was on the money with its concerns.  I am sure the Minister has done that already.</p> <p>It would not have required a huge exercise by anyone in the Department to correlate the information.  Has it been done?  If not, it is bizarre.  When I was a Minister sitting where the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, is sitting now, one of the first things I would have asked yesterday was whether we could see what happened in all the nursing homes listed in the letter and about which we are concerned.  The Minister might tell us the position on that.  He should please tell me he has done what I have mentioned.</p> <p> My next question is very direct.  Regarding the nursing homes that have had outbreaks, was the Minister's Department or the HSE made aware of any care concerns beyond those related to Covid but arising from patients having to be transferred or nursing homes having to be taken over because of Covid?  I will leave that with the Minister.</p> <p> I have a straight question on private hospitals.  Given the work of a number of Deputies, including me and Deputy Shortall, does the Minister believe it is a good idea, in order to fast-forward the bed capacity we all know we need under Sl&aacute;intecare, to nationalise some of the hospitals?  It is a straight question demanding a straight answer.  I am not saying a Government would approve the proposal but I want to know what the Minister for Health believes.  He obviously knows my views on it.</p> <p> On cancer screening, which I always speak about, I presume the Minister has measured the changes in outcomes.  I refer to issues relating to morbidity, delayed outcomes, delayed diagnoses, etc., because screening is not happening.  Could we have a table for each month?  I presume this work is ongoing.</p> <p> With regard to the famous children's hospital, which has not gone away, what is the Department's current estimated cost?  I presume the work is continuous.  As of today, what is the estimated cost?</p> <p> The Minister announced a change regarding the vaccine recently.  I still do not understand why we are not just giving the vaccine to everyone for free for the coming year.  It would be cost-effective.  The Government does not even have to commit to providing it every year.  It could be provided just next year, and maybe the year after.  I would prefer it to be every year.  Why will the Minister not commit to it?  Considering that we are always talking about public health, and presuming every single person in NPHET believes in vaccination, why could the Minister not ask NPHET to consider it?   Given that we go to NPHET for so much, all I am proposing to the Minister is that we ask it whether this would be a good idea.  Must I write to it myself?  Will the Minister please ask NPHET whether it would be a good idea and appropriate to introduce free vaccination for everybody in the country so we will not have to deal with both the normal flu epidemic and Covid in the coming year?</p> <p> My final question relates to the National Maternity Hospital.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the concerns Dr Peter Boylan has been expressing.  While the facility, worth &euro;500 million, is very much needed, are we 100% certain there is no issue in regard to the letter that has been sent from the Vatican regarding the transfer of ownership and allowing for the alienation and transfer of the lands to a secular body?  I fully hope the information I have is true.  Can the Minister confirm it is the case and that it is his interpretation?  As far as I am concerned, it will be a first from the Vatican, so we are creating history.  Could the Minister please confirm this?</p></speech>

He is a very dedicated public servant and clinician.</p><p>In relation to the letter, I think &mdash; I say &ldquo;think&rdquo; because I read a lot of documents &mdash; I read it for the first time today.  If the Deputy does not mind, let me explain the issue here.</p></speech>

What I wish to say in this regard is important.  I would like these documents to be shared with the Covid committee.  I am aware the Deputy asked for the documents concerning Nursing Homes Ireland and the Department.  I would have thought it important for the Deputy to have the documents involving the Department and HIQA also.  That is quite important; it is actually more important.</p></speech>
