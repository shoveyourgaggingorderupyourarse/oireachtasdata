Accordingly, I will proceed to put the two proposals relating to this week's business.  Is the proposal for dealing with today's business agreed to?</p></speech>

It is to be taken after the Taoiseach's questions.  There is a fundamental problem here because there is a flaw in this process.  These Revised Estimates have not yet been published.  We, as a party, have sought a detailed briefing on them; we have not got one.  If we hold off passing this motion until 2 o'clock, it will delay the publication of the Revised Estimates even more.  This is a very unusual circumstance.  We have a caretaker Government and an unelected Minister.  We have Estimates being presented which, based on the figures we have seen, suggest that the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and the wage subsidy scheme will end in June.  That is outrageous if that is the proposition that is being put or if it is the case that the Estimates are going to be out of date even before we debate them.  This is ludicrous.  We cannot support the Order of Business unless we get a guarantee from Government that the Estimates will be published today as soon as possible and that there is a clear verbal briefing for the Opposition.  We have sought it in writing and have been told that it is not forthcoming.  That is unacceptable.  We will oppose the Order of Business if we do not get that commitment from Government.</p></speech>

The sessions we are having this week, and indeed every week, were established on the basis that we could ask questions of Ministers and get accountability during the Covid-19 pandemic.  Last week in the D&aacute;il, I was given a commitment by the CMO that they would publish the minutes of the expert advisory group to NPHET.</p></speech>

Let us face it, people have been overpaid and now we will run out of money to pay the real people who need it.  We need to see the Estimates and the spokespersons of the groups in the Oireachtas need to get a decent and full briefing by the Minister.  I also have issues about tomorrow's business but that is another matter.</p></speech>

If any changes are to be made to the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, in future, the Government has not made that decision.  Like many Estimates in the past, this allows the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to continue to pay all social welfare payments - pensions, disability, carers, one-parent family, PUP, all of it - beyond 8 June when the Department will reach 80% of its funding ceiling.  If this is not passed, it will not be possible for the Department to continue to pay any social welfare or pension payment from 8 June.  It is done on a no-policy-change basis; all we are asking the House is for authorisation to keep paying those payments.</p></speech>

Nobody is being asked to vote for any legislation or change to the pandemic unemployment payment.  No decision has been made on that by Government.  This is an Estimates motion to allow the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to continue to pay pensions and other welfare payments from 8 June because if it is not passed, the Department will meet its 80% ceiling and cannot pay any payments.  In normal times, and I appreciate these are not normal times, this is the kind of thing that would be passed by the House after a committee hearing of an hour or an hour and a half, probably with very limited debate and no vote on it.</p> <p>I fully appreciate that Deputies will want to raise and discuss other issues but the only question being asked of the House is to pass this Estimate in order that all social welfare payments can continue to be paid from 8 June on a no-policy-change basis.</p></speech>

As I have already said in this House, a week ago, if not two weeks ago, it is the intention of the Government to extend the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and the wage subsidy scheme but that is a separate issue.  A Cabinet decision has not been made on that yet.  That will have to be done, probably some time next week.  All we are asking the House to do tomorrow is to vote on a social welfare Estimate to allow us to continue to pay existing social welfare payments and pensions from 8 June.  Because of the massive rise in unemployment, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is running out of money and we need an Estimate passed in order that it can make those payments on 8 June.</p></speech>

I believe it is bizarre that we would consider an Estimate on Thursday which has implications for the rest of the year and yet Members are not to be provided with information as to the implications of that until there is a Cabinet decision next week.  It was my understanding that we would have some clarity on both the PUP and the wage subsidy scheme in advance of considering the Estimate here on Thursday.  The Taoiseach is now telling us that that is not the case and I think it makes a farce of what we are to consider on Thursday.</p></speech>

That is not a problem but I wish to clarify that it is the intention of the Government to extend the pandemic unemployment payment beyond 8 June and the wage subsidy scheme as well.  The Government has yet to make a decision on to when they are extended but that is not what the Estimate Vote is about; it is about allowing the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to continue to pay all existing pension and welfare payments after 8 June, because the money runs out then.</p></speech>

We all understand that.  We all want to ensure that all payments are continued, as in the normal course of events, but this will probably be a huge overrun or demand.  We all understand that but we need to have accountability.  We need the Minister to provide a proper briefing in order that we know exactly where we are going.  We are very much putting the cart before the horse.  That is not fair or right.  I do not think the Taoiseach understands where we are coming from on this issue.  We do not want to delay the Estimate and we do not want to deny anybody payments but we want to see where we are going and to cut our cloth according to our measure.  We must understand what we are doing.</p></speech>

I am sure he appreciates that this is an important part of our work here in the D&aacute;il.  We all accept that we are in unprecedented times.  We have a Minister who is not elected.  We have a caretaker Government.  We have our job to do.  A briefing needs to take place.</p>  <p>  Following on from Deputy Naughten's point, which I also made, it is ludicrous that a decision has not been made on those other payments.  We are being asked to vote on a Revised Estimate when hundreds of thousands of workers are concerned about what will happen.  The Taoiseach has said there may be changes and there may be an extension to the payments.</p></speech>

People who are in receipt of the payment will continue to get it beyond 8 June.  I can give that assurance to the House.  The economy is only now slowly opening up.  The payment will have to be extended.  Nobody needs to worry.  As Members know, the pandemic unemployment payment expires if a recipient is offered his or her job back, but with that proviso.  Anyone who has not been offered his or her job back will continue to receive the payment beyond June.  This Government or the new Government will have to make a decision as to how long that will be extended.  We will also have to deal with some of the anomalies of which people are already aware.  A certain number of part-time workers are now receiving more in the pandemic unemployment payment every week than they did in January and February, before the pandemic happened. </p></speech>

They may well be decisions for the next Government and may require a further Revised Estimate in the future.  Over the course of the next week or two we will need Revised Estimates for a lot of Departments, but they will be brought to the House on a no policy change basis because as much as possible we want any new policy decisions to be made by the next Government, but sometimes we do not have any choice.  As the various parties that claim to want to form a Government have failed to do so, we have to continue in our capacity as the Government and make decisions as necessary.  As much as possible, however, we will leave the big policy decisions to the next Government, whenever it forms.</p></speech>

Obviously we had to make a decision, but I am not satisfied that we cannot have the Minister here tomorrow for two hours with a break of 40 minutes.  Like everybody else, I want to see convincing evidence of scientific and medical advice.  Maybe I picked it up wrongly from the Whip, but my understanding at the meeting was that the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Regina Doherty, had no problem with appearing, but the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health would not allow two hours.  We had this issue last week with the Minister.</p> <p>We expect workers throughout the country to work on building sites and everywhere else that, thankfully, we have opened, although we need to open more of them.  We have a different rule for the House, in spite of the size of the Chamber and the distancing between the seats.  I appreciate the efforts of staff and everybody else, as well as those on the front line, but this has gone on too long.  We need to see the evidence, not just hear it, so that we can understand and appreciate it.  There is a great deal of conflicting evidence in respect of the rules being imposed.</p> <p> I saw Deputy Kelly smiling a moment ago because he has been looking for the minutes for months, but it is like pulling teeth.  One cannot get a dentist's appointment and one cannot get the minutes, which is strange.  I object to the proposal for dealing with tomorrow's business.</p></speech>

The first relates to how we conduct our business based on the guidelines.  I know the advice is that every workplace is different but look at the size of this place.  This is ridiculous.

We have certain conditions in the Chamber that we do not expect workers or employers throughout Ireland to mirror.</p>  <p>  The Labour Party and I have a deep concern about whether a dangerous precedent is being created.  Within these conditions, we could be working like this for a considerable period, and the likelihood is that we will be.  The precedent set last week by the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, will now be pushed on this week, although admittedly in a slight variation, which I respect.  Is a dangerous precedent being set?  If or when a Government is formed, how will the Oireachtas honour the Constitution and ensure Ministers are held to account working in those conditions, given that it may be unworkable?  We need to tread very carefully here.</p></speech>

It stated there was no public health advice anywhere that suggested a two-hour limit for meetings but rather that it was an issue of contact tracing, which the professor then described as a rule of thumb that public health officials had put together.  I respectfully suggest there are issues with that and I think Deputy Kelly is correct that we should examine how we look at it in the future.  I am aware of one parliament in Europe where 180 MPs turned up for a roll call today.  While I do not suggest we do that, we need to look at how we will work this out into the future.  I have my concerns about meeting in the Convention Centre and the costs of that.  We have to rethink how we set about this.  Notwithstanding the advice that has been received, the two-hour rule does not make sense to me as we move on.  In the letter we received last week, Professor Cormican stated there was a very low possibility of anything happening to anybody in these circumstances.  We are practising social distancing, good hygiene and so on.  We need to look at the matter again.</p></speech>

It is certainly not an argument for minimising ministerial appearances for the purposes of public scrutiny and should not be used for that purpose.  As Deputy Kelly has said, we have here the benefit of great ventilation for all the hot air, from this end and not from the Ceann Comhairle's end.  We have many advantages as a workplace.  Our job is to maximise the interactions we can have and not to minimise them.  I am concerned that this is being used for people to minimise their appearances here and the necessary scrutiny.  This is very concerning.</p> <p> We are now moving into a phase of thoughtful and careful unwinding of the public emergency measures.  People are anxious to get back to work and they will get back to work, but they must see that we are back at work too.  This is very important.  I do not see why Ministers and officials cannot present themselves.  We have the space to make the necessary arrangements.  The two-hour rule around defining close contacts arises specifically in the unfortunate event of an infection.  That is the status.  I believe the correspondence made that very clear.</p></speech>

That this has not happened is a problem.  This was discussed in detail at the Business Committee.  There is deep unease that there are two sets of rules depending on who one is, and that we expect people to do an eight-hour shift where the same sorts of issues do not impact.</p>  <p>  I do not want to hold up, nor will I object to, tomorrow's business.  We do need, however, to square the circle in how we go on from here.  It is not just about setting the agenda for this week.  It is also about how we will deal with things next week, next month and in six months' time.  The proposal is not good enough.  We must find a mechanism to deal with this so we can have some degree of normality, hold the Government to account and have committee meetings, all within the Covid-19 confines that are patently there.</p></speech>

Public health advice about the health implications of proximity is acting as a barrier to having further committees to cover the many different areas in our society where people are in real trouble and need their voices heard.  We are told we can only have one committee because of physical constraints relating to public health guidelines.  It looks like these are just excuses.</p>  <p>  I will throw a real spanner into the works now.  There is no consistency on the issue of who is considered a close contact of a person who is Covid-positive.  I am sure all Members have been reading the RT&Eacute; website since the outbreak of this crisis.  At the end of every single article, it says that a person who has been in close contact in the same room as somebody else for more than 15 minutes - not two hours - is a close contact.  It says that this is the public health advice.  On that basis, nothing in this country would be operating at all.  It is nonsense.  We need consistency on this.  The difference is that essential workers have been working all the time under very different conditions of close contact - according to these definitions, for two hours or 15 minutes - to keep our society functioning-----</p></speech>

It is important that the Estimate is adopted.  I have a very serious concern around the justification for the way the Minister will present to the House tomorrow.</p> <p>This is referencing the justification given last week by the Minister for Health as his reason not to come in to answer legitimate questions which I had raised here the week before regarding the operation of the meat industry which had been found to be correct.  There is absolutely no medical basis for the justification that was given by the Minister for Health here last week.  I do not want to see that now being used as a mechanism and a justification to set a precedent for Ministers not to be held accountable here for legitimate issues regarding the operation and management of Covid-19, as well as many other issues which will arise over the next 12 months, 18 months and two years until these restrictions are lifted.</p></speech>

There is a difference between the call from many Members for a debate on the principle of this two-hour duration regime, which I believe would be more appropriately explored in some detail at the Covid committee.  There is a difference between that and the issue before us today, which is simply a piece on the Order of Business, namely, do we or do we not transact the business tomorrow.</p>  <p>  The second point Members must bear in mind is that they should read Standing Order 29 which makes it abundantly clear that it is a matter for the Government to determine which, as well as how, Ministers come in to respond to matters raised on the floor of the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.116" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700009#G00300"><p>I was about to make that point.  It has always been the case - at least for as long as I have been in the House - that the Government decides which Ministers come in.  It is often that a different Minister comes in but it is always the case a Minister is there.</p>  <p>  On the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, guidance, for the benefit of Deputy Boyd Barrett, it is actually both, namely, 15 minutes in close proximity or two hours in the same space.</p>  <p>  We are, however, all feeling our way through an unprecedented scenario.  The truth is that, as the virus diminishes in the community - there were only 30 or so new cases yesterday - we are able to take more calculated risks.  What might have been the right thing to do two or three weeks ago, may be different now and may be different again in the next couple of weeks.  We should accept that it is a risk, however.  There is a genuine risk that if there is any Minister or politician here for more than two hours and somebody else in the Chamber or they test positive, then all of the people in the Chamber will be required to self-isolate for 14 days.  That is the truth.  The objective is to make sure that the Government is held to account.</p></speech>

The Minister, Regina Doherty, is happy to take the Supplementary Estimate.  I do not understand why it will take six hours given that it is a straightforward, no-policy change, Supplementary Estimate.  She is happy to do it, however.  The logical thing to do is that she does two hours here and then move directly to the committee room to do the rest from there.  Then we can leave the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, out of it, if Members want Regina Doherty to be the one to do the full six hours.  The solution would be for her to do two hours here in the Chamber and then move to the committee room for the next two, four or whatever number of hours it will take.</p></speech>

It must be the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, or another Minister, who must move it.</p>  <p>  Standing Order 29 is about the Government deciding what Ministers come in.  We have no issue with that.  We are told by the Whip that the Minister, Regina Doherty, has no issue with coming in.  The problem is with this two-hour trick - we can call it that rather than a three-card trick - which is continuing, meaning the Government will not come in and be held accountable.</p>  <p>  I am objecting to tomorrow&rsquo;s business on that basis.

For the first time in 65 days, there were no reported Covid-19 deaths, evidence that our sacrifices are making a difference and that lives are being saved and protected.  Last night, the figure was nine deaths, a tragic and timely reminder that this is not over and that we will have days of sadness as well as days of hope ahead before we prevail.</p>  <p>  I know this has been a painful struggle for people across our island.  Too many loved ones have lost their lives and too many lives are still at risk.  As of last night, 1,615 people have died in our State from Covid-19, and a further 514 in Northern Ireland.  The fact that the trend is going in the right direction does not lessen the grief of those who have lost loved ones, nor the fear of those who know somebody with Covid today.  In total, 24,735 people in the Republic of Ireland have been diagnosed with Covid-19.  Some 325,795 tests have been carried out, including 30,000 in the past week, of which 633 were positive, resulting in a positivity rate of 2.1%.  That rate continues to decline.</p>  <p>  My message today is that we need to hold firm.  As a Government, we will not jump the gun by taking an unnecessary risks with public health.  Any announcement of whether we can go to phase 2 or whether we can make any changes to the plan will wait until 5 June, when we will have more data available and the latest advice from NPHET.</p>  <p>  Ar an Luan bhaineamar sprioc th&aacute;bhachtach amach nuair nach raibh b&aacute;sanna nua ar bith le tuairisci&uacute;.  Ba mhaith liom tuilleadh laethanta d&oacute;chais mar seo a fheice&aacute;il.  Is &iacute; teachtaireacht an lae inniu n&aacute; seasamh go daingean go f&oacute;ill.  Leanaimis ar aghaidh leis na h&iacute;obairt&iacute; at&aacute; &aacute; nd&eacute;anamh againn sa chaoi go leanfaidh an claonadh ar aghaidh sa treo ceart.  Fanfaidh aon fh&oacute;gra ar cib&eacute; a rachaimid ar aghaidh go c&eacute;im a d&oacute; n&oacute; go nd&eacute;anaimid aon athruithe eile don phlean go dt&iacute; an c&uacute;igi&uacute; l&aacute; de mh&iacute; an Mheithimh.  Fanfaimid ionas go mbeidh n&iacute;os m&oacute; sonra&iacute; agus eolas le f&aacute;il &oacute; na saineolaithe.  Idir an d&aacute; linn seasfaimid go daingean agus gheobhaimid an ceann is fearr air.</p>  <p>  Covid is a tragedy for all of us, but most of all for those who lost their lives or someone close to them.  It is something we all wish had not befallen us.  History teaches us that from every tragedy there are lessons to be learned and that from every crisis come opportunities for positive change.  We must build on the solidarity we have seen over the past few months and work towards a better Ireland.  We owe that to everyone who has been impacted by Covid and to the choices that have been made by so many that have got us to this point.  Covid has kept us from our loved ones, leaving some of us feeling anxious and isolated.  It has up-ended our businesses and halted our livelihoods.  At worst, it has stolen lives and devastated families.  This is an emergency that has disrupted our society.  It has also challenged us to work differently, to make changes that in normal times might have taken years to implement and prompted us to reflect on what really matters in life.</p>  <p>  I believe there are six major opportunities that arise from the terrible tragedy of Covid.  If we seize them, we will be better prepared for future pandemics or a second wave, should it come, and we will also make our country a better place for us all.  The opportunities are building permanent public health and well-being infrastructure, reviewing how we care for older people, changing our approach to sickness in the workplace, embracing better work&ndash;life balance, reducing unnecessary travel and respecting our natural environment.</p>  <p>  East Asian democracies learned from the SARS crisis and were much better prepared for Covid than western ones were.  We need to be better prepared for a second wave if it comes and also for future outbreaks of new viruses.  This means building up a much better and permanent public health infrastructure to test for, track, trace and treat infectious diseases, not just Covid.  Linked to this should be a new focus on well-being, for example through an enhanced vaccine programme such as the enhanced flu vaccine programme for this winter, which we have planned already.  We can build on what we have done to reduce smoking and alcohol consumption through the Healthy Ireland framework, with added emphasis on reducing obesity, physical inactivity and addiction.</p>  <p>  Across the western world, Covid has exacted a terrible toll on nursing homes.</p> <p>I am aware there is a lot of focus at the moment on when and for how long visitor restrictions should be in place.  That is important but it begs a bigger question; is this the model of care we want for older people?  Do we want to have no visitors, residents confined to the home, and staff dressed head to toe in PPE for months on end?  I do not think so.  We need to think again about alternatives and follow through on a new statutory funding model for home care, as well as more supported housing options for older citizens as they age.  We will not have to do so from scratch.  A lot of the groundwork has already been done by the outgoing Government.  When it comes to nursing homes and social care generally, we need greater integration with the health service, not a separation of social care from healthcare as some advocate, as well as clear clinical governance in order that there is no confusion about who is in charge of medical issues when they arise.<br/><br/>In Ireland we often talk about high levels of absenteeism in the workplace and the impact that has on productivity.  That is a real problem, but sometimes so is presenteeism.  In some professional settings, one is expected to go to work even when one is sick.  Sometimes this might be done out of commitment to one&rsquo;s work, at other times it is because of guilt - one just does not want to let the side down or impose extra work on a busy team.  In sectors like retail and hospitality, sick pay arrangements are poor and many staff simply cannot afford to take a sick day.  This is not good for the individual who is sick or for society, in terms of infection control.  Covid and the new Covid-related sick pay arrangements have changed this.  We cannot go back to the <i>status quo ante</i>.<br/><br/>I know from listening to a lot of people, especially busy working parents, the extent to which they have appreciated the opportunity to be at home a little more.  There has been more time for family, more time for couples to see each other, and more dinners at home or time together in front of the television.  Some overworked parents - mums and dads - are treasuring the extra time they are getting with their kids.  Of course, we all want the school and cr&egrave;ches to open as soon as it is safe to do so and for normal working and social life to resume but the bell has been rung when it comes to work-life balance and it cannot be unrung.  Home working is now evidently doable for many, as are core hours, flexible hours, job sharing and team working.  Of course, none of this is new but employers, employees and Government should work together to make it more mainstream.<br/><br/>The use of technologies like Zoom and Webex has enabled us to do so much remotely and digitally, including staff meetings, conferences, online education, e-seminars, medical consultations, residents' meetings and club meetings, and even political summits.  It is no substitute for meeting people in person but perhaps we can find a better balance than heretofore.  Better use of technology will mean fewer journeys, fewer business trips, less traffic, better air quality and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.  The public and private sectors need to make sure we do not simply drift back to the old way of doing things.<br/><br/>I also believe the emergency has given us a better respect of our natural environment.  Because the traffic is so much quieter, we can hear the dawn chorus again.  We see foxes at dusk and wildlife is thriving.  As an island, we have an abundance of land and sea, rivers, mountains, lakes and bogs.  This crisis has reminded us how lucky we are to live in a country like Ireland.  I think we all value our natural heritage a little bit more and we need to ensure more people can experience it in a sustainable way in the future. <br/><br/>To recap, we are only starting to fathom the enormous cost of Covid in terms of human life lost, economic damage and damage to the public finances.  Even so, out of this tragedy we should identify and build on some of the good things we have seen and some of the lessons we have learned.  We see some of this thinking in the significant set of proposals published this morning by the European Commission, which include proposals on how countries will recover economically from this crisis.  There are also new proposals for the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, and I will give the House an update on these next week.  As always, I look forward to hearing the comments, observations and contributions of Members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="13:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700015#P00100"><p>As we near the end of the third month of the Covid-19 pandemic, we must never forget to remember the great impact it has had.  As of today, well over 2,000 people on this island have lost their lives.  Hundreds are still fighting the virus and there is absolutely no doubt that things could have been much worse without the severe action which has been taken here and throughout the world.  As I have said every week during these debates, mistakes are inevitable when we have a fast-moving and unprecedented emergency.  The best responses are always defined by a willingness to listen to different voices, acknowledge problems and move quickly.  Our primary focus here must remain on helping those who are suffering from the virus, continuing to suppress its spread and moving to restart social and economic life as quickly as can safely be achieved.</p>  <p>  There is simply no question but that major errors were made in terms of the speed and impact of policies in regard to nursing homes.  This is emphatically not simply an issue of the public versus the private systems because some of the biggest clusters have been in public facilities, an issue which has got lost in some of the debate to date.  At a much earlier stage of the pandemic, I and a number of my party's spokespeople raised serious concerns about policy concerning nursing homes.  To be honest, the answers we received did not show the level of transparency and responsiveness which should have been expected.  Deputy Stephen Donnelly has shown how concerns about the lack of a proper voice for nursing homes on key committees were justified.  As we heard yesterday, the facts concerning the transfer of asylum seekers across the country into a new facility, with no regard to the spreading of the virus, are developing constantly.  They suggest another serious systems failure.</p>  <p>  Tagra&iacute;m do na tithe altranais.  Is l&eacute;ir gur tharla bot&uacute;in mh&oacute;ra.  N&iacute; raibh na polasaithe maidir leo l&aacute;idir a dh&oacute;thain.  Is l&eacute;ir &oacute;n gcomhfhreagras idir an Roinn agus Nursing Homes Ireland go raibh siad i gcruach&aacute;s agus go raibh taca&iacute;ocht &aacute; lorg acu &oacute;n t&uacute;s ach bh&iacute; na h&uacute;dar&aacute;is mall ag d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leo.  Caithfimid a admh&aacute;il go raibh na deacrachta&iacute; c&eacute;anna ag na tithe altranais san earn&aacute;il phoibl&iacute; agus a bh&iacute; ag na tithe altranais san earn&aacute;il phr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideach.  An rud is t&aacute;bhachta&iacute; anois n&aacute; go bhfoghlaimeofar ceachtanna &oacute;n m&eacute;id a tharla go dt&iacute; seo.</p>  <p>  However, the scale of the work still required during this emergency is such that trying to litigate past failures cannot be the priority now.  What we need to know is that measures are in place to make sure that nothing like these failures could recur if and when a second wave of the virus appears before we have an effective and widely administered vaccine.  The overall situation today is that Europe as a whole has entered a new phase in the response.  A fortnight ago, countries of a similar size to Ireland, such as Denmark, Finland, Croatia and Austria, started reporting record lows in new infections and days with no deaths.  This has happened weeks after they began to implement opening-up measures.  After Germany's major reopening moves, there were reports of a rise in its virus reproduction rate, but two weeks later, it appears that the figure is well below one and is in line with Ireland's figure.</p>  <p>  The good news we have had this week confirms that Ireland is following the increasingly well-established pattern in Europe for the containment of the virus.  However, there is every reason to be concerned about whether we are handling the process of the return of social and economic activity properly.  The evidence is that there remains a broad and strong compliance amongst the public when it comes to measures they have been told are essential.  Eighty per cent are staying home and few in urban areas are moving more than 5 km from their homes.  A serious concern, though, is that there is a very real danger of a growing division in the population between those who fear change and those who are angry about restrictions which appear not to be fully justified scientifically.  Certainly, people are entitled to look at measures implemented in countries where the community spread of the virus has not spiked and ask why the situation in Ireland should be so different.</p>  <p>  In my view, there is no remaining serious justification for the 5 km limit.  The public health concern is how people behave around others, not how far they are from their home.</p> <p>In fact, the research shows that this limit may be forcing people in urban areas into more crowded situations.  This also applies to the 20 km rule, which is envisaged to replace the 5 km rule.  I do not see a logic or scientific basis for it.  I believe we must deal with that more expeditiously.  T&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an gceist seo, mar t&aacute; s&eacute; in am deireadh a chur leis na teorainneacha 5 km agus 20 km agus gan bacadh leo.  N&iacute;l aon chiall ag baint leis na teorainneacha agus srianta seo agus n&iacute;l aon bhun&uacute;s eola&iacute;ochta leo.  T&aacute; siad ag cur br&uacute; ar dhaoine agus t&aacute; daoine m&iacute;shuaimhneach f&uacute;thu.</p> <p> Equally, the current distinctions between different types of shops are, at best, arbitrary.  Supermarkets have been open throughout the pandemic while implementing measures for distancing and hygiene.  The figures on community spread suggest that supermarkets have not played a role in spreading the virus, where the overwhelming issue is clustering in health facilities, which has been the dominant one, nursing homes and some workplaces, such as meat factories.  That is where the big clusters have been.  The supermarkets are a lesson and perhaps require more research in terms of how it worked so well there.</p> <p> In general, the overriding need now is to move to a situation where the focus is put on showing people how to behave once most activity is restored.  We do not need empty, feel-good advertising with a single photograph and a hashtag, but a simple public education campaign.  Last week, the media began carrying stories about loosening to be announced on 5 June and most people have concluded, as was the case when the loosening steps were first published, that announcements are being delayed rather than being made as soon as they are justified.  The restrictions in place today in respect of most workplaces and many social activities will lose public support if they are no longer seen as being based on clear scientific evidence.</p> <p> With regard to the 2 m guidance, which it has been acknowledged is not required by the science, it has been helpful but it cannot be allowed to block Ireland restarting activity that is already under way elsewhere without a negative impact.  If it is true that our capacity to rapidly test, trace and isolate is now in place, we must see this reflected in the loosening of policies put in place, in part, because we had lacked this capacity.  I note the Taoiseach's comments, but it appears that this is still the issue.  Testing, tracing and isolating the virus is ultimately the best guarantor we have.  The greater activity in the D&aacute;il in the past few weeks must be followed by a review of restrictions so that they are not arbitrary and they move us as quickly as possible to fully restart our core democratic institutions.</p> <p> As I have communicated directly to the Government, we need immediate clarity on the reopening of special needs education and its provision during July.  I am aware that the Government is conscious of that and is examining it.  In many countries, the limited reopening of certain classes has been achieved and there is no obvious reason for an announcement on what will happen being delayed.  This has been particularly severe for parents of children with special needs and the children themselves.  I have talked to teachers who have communicated through technology with them and I believe we must move heaven and earth to see if we can facilitate a return to routine, particularly for children on the autism spectrum.</p> <p> During the debate on the social welfare Estimates, Fianna F&aacute;il spokespeople set out in detail our approach to the overall economic and fiscal issues.  There is no doubt that we have yet to see a proper response to critical issues.  The basic strategy being followed in much of Europe is to try to kick-start a rapid recovery and to change critical fiscal benchmarks to reflect the unique nature of a rapid onset recession caused by a pandemic.  The overall principle is that the pandemic response should not be allowed to be a financial millstone dragging down budgets, companies and families.  It is not yet clear that this is fully understood or accepted here and there are two areas of major concern.  First, there is the failure to show much greater urgency and ambition in preventing otherwise sustainable Irish businesses from suffering a terminal cash flow crisis.  Sustainable growth for Ireland is utterly dependent on this sector, but short-term measures have not been followed with a credible plan to define the scale of what is needed or to push for new types of support.</p> <p> Second, there is a refusal to give support to critical public companies and institutions.  Due to Government policy in recent years, higher education institutions have been pushed to make up funding shortfalls through international programmes.</p> <p>These have collapsed everywhere in the world and leave the universities in particular facing a shortfall of hundreds of millions of euro yet, as the <i>Irish Independent</i>reported yesterday, the response of the Minister for Education and Skills has been to tell them that they will have to simply suck up the deficit.  This has quite rightly shocked tens of thousands of people working in a sector critical to our future.  The same is being repeated in public enterprises of all types.  In a world where the German Government can funnel hundreds of millions of euro into protecting one airline, the refusal to prepare a detailed plan for saving our public transport companies is inexplicable.<br/><br/>At the moment, commentary about what the fiscal position will be later this year, let alone in five years' time, is based on informed speculation.  We do not know yet what the impact will be but, of course, we do know that there is nothing sustainable in having more than 1 million people directly and indirectly receiving wage supports from the Government.  Anyone who claims that an emergency response to an unprecedented emergency should be kept in place forever is simply playing politics with a profoundly important issue.  However, if we want to rebuild our economy we cannot do that unless we act now to prevent smaller businesses going bankrupt and put in place a proper rescue package for our public companies and institutions.</p></speech>

I record also the success that has been achieved by everybody in flattening the curve.  Everybody was very pleased to see tangible results in the course of the week here, and in the North, and we need to commit to build on that.  Congratulations to everybody concerned and to our citizens in particular.</p>  <p>  I want to reiterate the point raised by Deputy Martin and raised last week by Deputy Catherine Connolly on the issue of special needs education.  I know this is an area the Taoiseach is examining.  I believe we are all of one mind that this is something that needs to be addressed very speedily.  The level of stress in families and for the people concerned is unbearable.</p>  <p>  I have raised with the Taoiseach previously the issue of those workers in receipt of maternity benefit, and only maternity benefit, returning from their leave and being excluded from the wage supplement scheme.  I note that there has been no progress in correcting that exclusion.  I would like the Taoiseach's response to that.</p>  <p>  I have raised with the Taoiseach previously the issue of childcare because this will be an area of critical concern as we return to our new normal and as people seek to go back to work.  I am sure he saw yesterday the Federation of Early Childcare Providers survey which explicitly has laid bare the problems regarding childcare.  It found, for example, that nine out of ten childcare providers say that either they will not reopen on 29 June or that they have grave reservations about reopening.  Many of their concerns relate to health and safety.  Many are worried about their ability to implement physical distancing measures, particularly with preschool children.  They are concerned about infection controls and access to personal protection equipment.  They have real worries about the plans that are being aired in part over the airwaves.  Of particular concern is how they would meet the ongoing costs that the plans, as they are drip-fed, appear to indicate, which would necessitate the hiring of more staff and reduce their capacity dramatically.  They are worried that the sums simply will not add up for them.  The potential consequences of all of that are either cr&egrave;ches and childcare facilities not being in a position to reopen indefinitely, parents struggling to find places for their children and the prospect of increased fees for those fortunate enough to secure a place.  Bear in mind that even before this crisis, people were shelling out the equivalent of a second mortgage for childcare.  I was alarmed to hear the very stark response yesterday from the chairperson of the Federation of Early Childhood Providers.  She was asked about the level of guidance its members have received from the Department and she answered, "We have had nothing from them".  That is a signal that something is very badly wrong.</p> <p>I want to give a sample of the issues that have been raised with me regarding childcare workers.  I will go through them quickly but it is important that we place this on the record in order that Members get a flavour of it.</p> <p> Suzanne from Dublin says that she works in a preschool and asks how social distancing will work in this setting, if numbers will have to be reduced and if staff will lose their jobs because of smaller numbers, or if funding will be put in place for new measures.</p> <p> Tanya says that they literally do not know where they stand and the way that they have to work with children, staff and parents is getting very worrying.  She says that all of their childcare years are to prepare children for school, and that children need their social interaction.  She asks how she will comfort children who are upset because they cannot play like they used to.</p> <p> Maeve says that the facility she is at has already allocated 22 places to children.  She asks how they can now tell half of parents that the facility cannot take their child because the facility has to reduce its numbers.  She states that places were allocated at the end of February and that they cannot turn away half the children in September.</p> <p> Jeanette states that she is currently on the Covid-19 payment with no return date as of yet.  Her question is whether she will still have to pay for her child's place even though she will not attend cr&egrave;che until Jeanette returns to work.</p> <p> Orla says that reduced numbers cannot work and asks who the childcare facility she is at turns away.  She states that she runs a wraparound service for all ages and that if primary schools take smaller numbers in September, parents will need her to care for children who cannot be at school and she cannot cater for this.</p> <p> Julie asks that clear direction be given now because preparations will take time.  She questions the idea of pods of four children and its sustainability.</p> <p> Melissa, who is a childcare worker who has children, says that she will have to bring her kids to work.  There are other staff who also have children so this, in its own way, eliminates places for parents.</p> <p> Siobh&aacute;n from Sligo sums up the situation of many families when she says that her husband's boss is putting terrible pressure on him after weeks without childcare.  He may lose his job over it.  They thought an end was in sight with 29 June approaching but their cr&egrave;che is not certain that it will be in a position to open.  It is not the fault of the cr&egrave;che but the lack of help and information from Government.  Siobh&aacute;n is a front-line worker and her husband is an essential worker.  She says that they will be in the dole queue if this continues.</p></speech>

As the House knows with regard to maternity benefit, women who were still on the payroll prior to the pandemic when they went on maternity leave can be included on the wage subsidy scheme.  However, women who were not on the payroll and were only in receipt of maternity benefit cannot.  We are trying to find a solution to that.  Much work has been carried out by the Minister for Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.  A solution has been developed but it is not adequate and does not really solve the problem in the Minister's view.  They continue to work on it but we will hopefully come to a resolution soon.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for sharing some of those individual queries and questions about childcare.  The plan is to allow childcare centres to reopen at the end of June.  That is in phase 3.  We appreciate that all centres may not be able to open, or some may choose not to open, but they will be allowed to open from the end of June, and I believe that many will.  Public health advice has been sought and there has been detailed engagement involving the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and NPHET on the public health advice about reopening childcare centres.  It needs to be refined and shared with the sector in good time for it to read, understand, digest and implement it.  We hope to be in a position to share that with the sector sooner rather than later and to give it a good few weeks before the end of June to implement measures.  The sector is being consulted and the Minister, Katherine Zappone, is leading on that.  Childcare staff will be able to return to their centres before the end of June to make any changes or preparations that may be needed.  Teachers already can return to schools and lecturers to colleges and that will be allowed for childcare workers too and it is happening in practice in some cases.</p> <p>A survey has been done of parental demand.  As is the case in other countries, we anticipate, at least initially, a fall in demand for childcare.  It will not just go back to the way it was.  That will not surprise people.  Many people are out of work.  We are heading into the summer.  There is concern among some parents about sending kids back to cr&egrave;che.  We know from other countries that initially demand is depressed at the start.  That, at least, will help with the capacity issues.</p></speech>

I repeat to the Taoiseach that many people across the sector are saying publicly that the level of consultation and engagement is simply not sufficient.  There is a call for clear guidance to cover childcare settings, including cr&egrave;ches and early education facilities.  We also need guidance on childminders.  What will the public health guidance on that be?</p>  <p>  The State currently covers the wage bill for the childcare workforce.  Will the Taoiseach make a commitment that this support will continue until the end of the year?  That would come as some relief and reassurance to childcare workers and childcare providers.</p>  <p>  Many people face the prospect of not being able to work, not because their job is no longer there, but because they will not be able to access adequate and safe childcare.  What reassurance and what support can the Taoiseach afford to those workers?  Can he guarantee them that they will not be left permanently unemployed and that they will not see their income slashed because they cannot return to work owing to insufficient childcare for them?</p></speech>

We had a good news day on Monday when there were no such deaths.  I hope that can now start to become the norm.</p>  <p>  I believe the Taoiseach said earlier that on 5 June there might be a review of the timeline of some of the measures.  Given the reduction in the levels of infection I think many people will be hoping we can move some of the dates on the opening up of restrictions.  I come from working in the tourism industry.  What a difference it would make to thousands if not tens of thousands of small Irish tourism businesses if we could move that opening date and, as Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin said, perhaps  not have that 20 km restriction along with a change to the timelines on movement restrictions if the tourism industry had two months of domestic demand rather than just one under the current timelines.  That could make the world of difference to people's livelihoods, employment and future.  We hope that some of the good news we have seen in recent weeks will continue to allow the Government to make some of those decisions on 5 June.</p>  <p>  To give further hope, if I can, I want to refer to the broad economic strategy we need to manage this crisis.  Two documents produced today are particularly important in that regard.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's publication of its fiscal assessment report is very welcome and timely.  Today's publication of the European Commission's &euro;1.85 trillion recovery plan is also very significant in terms of the economic response.  Both give us a very clear sense of direction and a very clear understanding of the right economic approach.</p>  <p>  Sometimes we give out about the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council taking the bowl of punch away when we all have various appropriate spending priorities.  However, today it has been very clear in reporting that what has been done to date with interventions such as the pandemic unemployment payment, the wage subsidies and other supports has been appropriate.  Critically, the report states, "While policy needs may evolve, and policies should be adjusted as appropriate to fit these needs, support should be provided on a large-scale for as long as is needed to avoid lengthening and deepening the economic crisis."</p> <p>More specifically, it states:</p><blockquote>	Borrowing to support weak demand would be an appropriate countercyclical approach for the government to manage the economy.  It should be temporary, targeted and conditioned on the likely state of the economy.  </blockquote> <p>This is not similar to previous economic downturns when there was a structural problem with the economy where we could not borrow, such as the 1980s, or in the crash of 2008-10 when our economy was fundamentally broken because we had allowed a property bubble to build up.  That is not the case here.  The correct economy strategy is for us to borrow on international markets and stimulate the economy to help us get out of the economic downturn.  That is what is being said across so many economic sectors.  <br/><br/>Hopefully, as in the Central Bank's baseline scenario, the return to the economy in respect of some of the stimulus measures will see employment return in the next two to three years.  That may be sufficient on its own and the best way of managing our deficit.  We must plan, over a four or five-year period, not just to kick-start and stimulate the economy but to get the deficit back in line in order that we continue to enjoy the prospect of low interest rates that will allow us to borrow.  <br/><br/>Things may be worsened by what happens with Brexit or the OECD corporate tax changes.  An adjustment to manage the deficit in three years' time may be needed but we will not know until we see what happens in the next two or three years.  It is likely, however, to be much smaller in scale than any of the previous crashes to which I referred.  Regardless of the gap that must be closed by taxation or other measures, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, noted &quot;Nonetheless, ambitious policies can still be achieved in areas like health, housing and climate change.&quot;  The economic situation is not impossible.  The analysis from bodies such as IFAC is very clear and matches what the European Union is saying today.  The Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, stated:</p><blockquote>	The recovery plan turns the immense challenge we face into an opportunity, not only by supporting the recovery but also by investing in our future: the European Green Deal and digitalization will boost jobs and growth, the resilience of our societies and the health of our environment.  This is Europe's moment.  Our willingness to act must [be] up to the challenges we are all facing.  With Next Generation EU [which is what the Commission is calling its plan] we are providing an ambitious answer. </blockquote> <p>That European green deal is the centre of its &euro;1.85 trillion stimulus package.  It is saying specifically we should invest in things such as renovating our buildings to improve building stock and tackle climate change, in renewable energy - wind and solar in particular - and the prospect of a new hydrogen economy where Ireland could be very successful as a country, and in cleaner transport and logistics.  That is the best economic analysis in Europe and matches the Fiscal Advisory Council's advice that this is the time to invest in the future, a time to borrow for something that will give us a return which is social, environmental and environmental.<br/><br/>I acknowledge that as we progress, we will have to review matters in two or three years' time, particularly given the risks from Brexit or changes to corporate tax rules but it is not an impossible situation.  We should not be overly fearful or pessimistic for our people.  We have the economic plan.  The direction coming from almost all the economists I have seen is that this is manageable and we can do it.  Recent days have seen the good news of infection rates decreasing.  If we may adjust slightly some of the timelines for opening up, we may, even during this summer, we will start to see unemployment turning around, then we will have to tackle long-term unemployment to make sure that is going the right way.  <br/><br/>I have a question for the Taoiseach.  The clear economic advice is to borrow to invest for the future and invest with a good return.  I do not want to be too picky but I have a concern.  The Government has announced investment by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, in companies that may be running into difficulty.  My concern is that in future investment, we should try to use whatever resources we have in new opportunities and investment areas.  I understand that ISIF has not yet received any applications.  </p> <p>I very much understand the political imperative in terms of trying to support companies, but I am very keen that if we are investing in ISIF funds, or any other funding that we may raise through borrowing, it would be for the new economy that is going to grow.  I believe the focus must be on that sense of the future, new jobs and new prospects.  That is a difficult thing to get right.  I am trying to think of examples.  We could, for example, in particular with Brexit, have real difficulties in our food industry.  Rather than just keeping the current system in place, we could invest in a policy to improve school meals and to improve our health and well-being, as the Taoiseach stated in his comments.  It would be great to make an investment to connect the farmer to the local school and to set up a new food distribution system and a new retail system that would help that level of connectivity, help Irish food producers and make something new work.</p> <p> I heard a proposal yesterday from someone in the Taoiseach's party which I thought made great sense.  It was that we would create work hubs in the centre of every town and village where people could do distant working.  They would not have to travel all the way to work but they would not just be at home.  We could have innovation hubs such as the Ludgate Hub in Skibbereen.  We could start to make things happen in such digital centres.  I will only touch briefly on these points as I want to leave the Taoiseach a minute or two to answer.  It is clear what the strategy is.  We must invest in the future.</p></speech>

That will be done through equity investments.  We would expect companies to pursue all other options first - to look to their own shareholders, loans and other such options before coming to the taxpayer to invest.  However, other governments are doing it and we may need to do it too.  We will treat our own public companies differently.  The investments the Deputy talks about are wise investments the Government could make but perhaps they would come from a different fund or a different source.</p>  <p>  In terms of appropriate fiscal policy, I have always been of the view that the right fiscal policy is a countercyclical one.  When the economy is growing fast, one tries to keep public spending under control and one reduces debt, if not in cash terms at least as a percentage of GDP.  When the economy is in recession, one is then able to increase public spending to cushion the blow of the recession on people's incomes, to stimulate the economy so it can grow again and to allow one's debt to rise.  That is the policy that this outgoing Government has pursued.  For many years in this House we resisted the demands of people that we should spend more and borrow more &ndash; &euro;22 billion more in one case &ndash; at a time when the economy was growing fast and overheating.  We were right to resist those demands, and because we resisted those demands we are now in a position to do what could not be done ten or 12 years ago, and that is a countercyclical response to this crisis, namely, increasing spending and increasing debt.  However, as IFAC points out, that does come to an end.  It suggests that in or around 2023, we may need to take measures to reduce the deficit, but between now and then we should try to make the economy grow as fast as possible so that the deficit that is there in 2023 is closer to &euro;6 billion or less rather than the &euro;14 billion it put at its upper end, because any retrenchment that will happen when the economy returns to sustained growth should be as minimal as possible.  That is why we need to go for growth and opt for pro-growth policies in the next year or two.</p></speech>

I congratulate everybody &ndash; all the workers - for all their hard work.  I hope the trajectory will continue in this way in terms of the volume of deaths and the volume of cases.</p>  <p>  I have a number of questions for the Taoiseach today to which I would appreciate his response.  I will allow enough time for him to respond to the individual questions.  However, before I start I wish to make a plea to the Taoiseach.  I have never come into this House and stressed something as passionately or emotionally as on this occasion.  We have to do something immediately to change the way in which we are dealing with funerals.  We all work together.  We are always working in our communities and supporting one another but we are also together in death.</p> <p>The rules are too rigid and ten people is too small a number.  At many funerals the families are bigger than that.  The social conditioning, the things we have all refrained from doing and the ways in which we have all changed, supports an increase in that number.  I beg the Taoiseach to increase the number to 30.  A friend of mine buried his father.  His immediate family comprises much more than ten people.  A funeral director told me a very sad story about grandchildren crying outside a church.  We can do better.  I plead with the Taoiseach to change this.  I suggested a figure of 30, but everybody knows the social conditioning we have to work with.  I hope everyone in the House can support me on this. </p> <p> I was very struck by the report published today by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, entitled "No Going Back".  We will need a new social contract.  I want to raise some questions relating to where we go from here and I would appreciate the Taoiseach's responses.  We must continue the pandemic unemployment payment, which we have argued for but some of the conversation around it is unacceptable.  It is said that some employers cannot get workers.  They are obviously not looking too hard.  The Contract Cleaning Association of Ireland is now saying that it will not honour an employment regulation order requiring a 40 cent pay increase for contract cleaners.  These are front-line workers who are putting their lives at risk to clean and save all of us.  These cases demonstrate a narrative that I do not want to see continuing.  I ask the Taoiseach to recognise the fact that we need to continue the pandemic unemployment payment.  Furthermore, as we come out of this we will have to provide stimulus for several different sectors.  This should be conditional on those sectors honouring industrial relations decisions arrived at by the State mechanisms.  This is our chance to do that. </p> <p> The Government has made two attempts at a proposal for childcare for front-line workers and healthcare workers.  We must get this right.  The Taoiseach's answer was not good enough.  He said the Government will allow them to open.  That is not going to work.  It is not a case of allowing them to open.  We need to create conditions where that is viable.  This is the fulcrum around which all of our economy and society will turn.  I am not sure this message has got through.  The Government has failed twice.  This needs a lot more attention. </p> <p> I refer to the HSE's roadmap.  I 100% believe that we need a plan for children and adults with intellectual disabilities.  I have spoken to families in which children and adults are losing the will to go on.  Intervention is needed now.  I also want to see screening.  How will the Government deal with disability organisations and various other section 38 and section 39 organisations that do what the State should?  How will we chart a roadmap for them?  They cannot all be funded through "The Late Late Show".  We need a plan.  What will it be?</p> <p> A cross-reference group is needed along with NPHET to assist the Government in working through the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business with the participation of the social partners because critical decisions will have to be made.  If things go the way they are going, the roadmap will have to change.  We need a way to manage this.  </p> <p> My final question relates to antibody testing.  We have spoken about how we are going to conduct our business in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in future.  It is very obvious that we are going to have to live with this virus for a considerable period.  We are going to have to use antibody testing for the economy, society, schools and everything else to function.  I have taken an awful lot of time to research this and I have spoken to a lot of people.  A huge amount of work is going on.  It could be introduced relatively quickly.  What is the status of that?</p></speech>

He started by talking about funerals.</p> <p>I know this is a really difficult issue for many people and families, where only ten people are allowed to attend the funeral.  I have spoken to some people who had to make that awful decision of choosing which ten and then explaining to the 11th, 12th or 13th person why he or she could not be there.  I think we have all seen the scenes of people gathering in a car park or along the street, which is sometimes touching but also really painful.  We understand that it is a really difficult thing for many people.  Whether the person died of Covid or not, it is just as difficult trying to get through a funeral of that nature with these rules.  We have started a discussion with the churches about we might be able to amend that over the next couple of weeks, and much of that may be more to do with the size of the church than anything else because a large church could take more people with social distancing than a small church.  The idea is to develop a practical solution to that, and protocols already exist in other countries such as Germany and Italy.</p> <p> In addition, in my discussions with the Catholic bishops a few weeks ago, they were particularly interested to know what we might be able to do to allow some baptisms and weddings to happen again.  They, again, would be small, but a lot of people have been waiting a long time to christen their child.  Obviously, we want to make all these things possible sooner rather than later, but to do so safely.</p> <p> Childcare centres will be allowed to open at the end of June.  I am not saying they will just be allowed to open, with the matter up to them alone; they will, of course, require guidance, as Deputy McDonald noted.  They will require guidance on what changes they need to make, at least a few weeks before the opening date so they can digest and implement it.  There may well be some centres that decide not to open.  That will be true in any sector but I believe it will be possible for the vast majority to open and we will work with them to do that.</p> <p> On the pandemic unemployment payment, I reiterate that anyone currently in receipt of the payment does not need to be concerned about it being stopped on 8 June.  It will continue to be paid beyond 8 June; we just have not agreed an end date for it yet.  We want people to have the opportunity to get their job back, and while some people in sectors such as construction have, in most sectors they have not yet, which is why it will need to be extended beyond 8 June.  If people are offered their job back and they refuse that job, they will lose the pandemic unemployment payment, but the vast majority of people have not yet even had that opportunity, which is why it needs to be extended.</p> <p> The payment was a temporary, emergency measure and it is not affordable or sustainable for it to go on forever.  We are just playing politics with people if we somehow pretend that is possible.  It will have to come to an end at some point and it would not be right to create different classes of unemployed people, with people unemployed before Covid getting one set of benefits, people made unemployed during Covid getting a different set of benefits and people who lose their jobs after Covid getting a different set of benefits again.  That would not be right or fair so it will all need to be merged again, but these are not decisions for this week or even next week.</p></speech>

I refer to the issues relating to the roadmap for intellectual disabilities, section 38 and section 39 organisations, antibody testing and whether he will bring forward a cross-reference group to help us come out of the roadmap.  There were four different questions.</p></speech>

There are too many false positives and false negatives, and HIQA has published a health technology assessment on that.  Once we have antibody tests that are accurate, they could be used.  Approval has been given for a zero prevalence survey using antibody tests but that is very different.  It will not give an individual result from an individual test of an individual patient.  It will be a survey of the extent to which there is exposure and immunity within society.</p>  <p>  On the reference group question, I know that other countries have done this and it is under consideration.  It may be something the next Government decides to do rather than this one, but it has been proposed by others.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin has proposed a similar approach to that, as has Deputy Shortall.  We have our plan, it is working and we are sticking to it, but that is not to say that at a point in the future, some form of expert group or reference group that is multidisciplinary could be established to give advice to the Government in addition to advice from NPHET.</p>  <p>  There are thousands of section 38 and section 39 organisations and they are all in different circumstances.  Some have got additional funding, such as the hospices.  Some are section 38 organisations whereas others are section 39.  It depends on the individual organisation and its individual financial position.</p></speech>

Almost everyone sought a political consensus on decisions, which were underpinned by solid medical and scientific advice.  It worked well because we all understood that the advice was coming from NPHET and was designed to save lives and protect everybody insofar as it was possible.  I expect this is still the motivation.  While D&aacute;il sittings have recently resumed it is important to note that a lot of the discussions prior to that had happened behind closed doors in briefings not seen by the public.  Many of us had been raising concerns about nursing homes, direct provision and testing, tracing and personal protective equipment, on which there were discussions forward and back but out of public view.</p>  <p>  The news in recent days of the continued reductions in the numbers of cases and the constant decline and levelling off of the R nought number is hugely welcome and I congratulate everybody who worked towards that.  Surely this now means we once again need to look for a political consensus on how we move forward on some things.  This becomes slightly more difficult in a situation where the medical and scientific advice on certain aspects either differs somewhat or is vague.  The current conversation on the 2 m versus the 1 m distance is a prime example of this.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will agree that the discourse on this, politically and among the scientific and medical community and NPHET, has been varied.  There is a lot of talk about guidelines as opposed to regulations, and there are references to best judgment.  By and large, people are doing their best to do the right thing to get through this.  Situations where the interpretation is vague do not help any of us.  There are many things on which the Taoiseach and I will disagree but there are some things where we could all agree, across the political spectrum, to reach a consensus.  It strikes me that agreeing on a minimum distance is one issue on which we can find a political consensus.  I believe we can also find a political consensus on the two-hour rule.  We need to find a way of working in this House.  I believe this to be a very safe workplace given its size and the amount of cleaning done, which is premium.</p>  <p>  The World Health Organization recommends that people stay at least 1 m but ideally 2 m from each other.  There is no consensus across the European Union with its varying approach.  So far, our Chief Medical Officer has erred on the conservative side, and he may be right on that, but we could do with a consensus on it.  Essentially, there is a very big difference between 1 m and 2 m with regard to the unravelling of the roadmap.  It is, for example, the difference between a business being viable or not and whether schools go back full time in September.  We are aware that this will be a significant difference.</p> <p>Regarding some of the rules and the roadmap, there is a big difference, for example, in construction between working inside and working outside.  There are subsets of other sectors that could safely go back to work.  The roadmap is very rigid.  We must find some political consensus on the opening up of the economy in relation to the roadmap.</p> <p> Essentially the public was ahead at the beginning in terms of the closing schools, having a view on visitors from Italy and on Cheltenham.  I feel the public is now starting to move ahead of the decisions being made.  This virus has been assaulting all of our senses and there is a darkening of a mood.  If one is going to bring people along, one has to be in symmetry with them.  I feel we are out of step with the public mood.  The confusion in respect of the expert advice is a real problem.</p> <p> People are working from home.  While doing a full-time job, they are also childminders and teachers.  They can only do that for so long.  There has to be some hope.  There are people with children with special educational needs who can see the difference in the child where they have lost social interaction as much as the educational opportunity.  We need to find some political consensus on all of this.  Will the Taoiseach meet the leaders of the groups and the political parties with a view to looking at the 1 m versus 2 m distancing guidance, the two-hour contact rule and how we deal with the roadmap in order that we can do this differently but by consensus?</p></speech>

If there is a place to do that, it probably is the Covid committee that has been established.  The committee seems to be working well and is very representative of the D&aacute;il.  I do not think it is something for the party leaders to be honest.  Obviously some Members represent big parties that have a lot of political support while some are small and some are not parties at all.  The right place to do that is the Covid committee.  It can hear the evidence and then make a recommendation to the Government on the 1 m or 2 m rule and the two-hour contact tracing rule.  It might be the best forum for political consensus to be found, if it can be found.  I am not sure, however, if it can.  In the meantime, we will follow the advice of the public health emergency team.</p>  <p>  It has to be seen in its overall context, however, namely, how prevalent the virus is in the community.  A set of rules that were right when there were hundreds of new cases and dozens of deaths being reported every day may not be the right rules at a time we have 30 or 50 new cases and fewer than ten deaths being reported every day.  We need to bear in mind that, while there is no such thing as zero risk from this virus, as the risk reduces, then rules can be relaxed.  That is what the plan is all about in many ways.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is right in saying the public was ahead of us in terms of demanding school closures.  Many businesses, pubs, restaurants and gyms closed before they were instructed to by the Government.  That is what we call anticipatory behaviour, which was not necessarily bad.  What we have now is another form of anticipatory behaviour, which is the public ahead of us, looking for us to unlock things, in some cases, perhaps, before we are sure it is safe to do so.  I heard a call from a prominent person this morning that flying is entirely safe, for example.  We have to continue to base our decisions on evidence.</p>  <p>  The plan, as agreed by the Government and published, is a living document.  I said from the very start and I will say it again that as things develop, elements of that plan could be accelerated and brought forward.  I ask the public and the House, however, to hold firm for now.</p> <p>We are only in phase 1.  One of the reasons the phase lasts three weeks is in order that we can have proper data.  We will not really know what effect the easing of the restrictions has had for about two weeks.  If the numbers are still going in the right direction in the first week of June, that would give us an assurance that we could accelerate some aspects of the plan, but to do that earlier would be acting without evidence and would be premature.  I ask people to hold firm until that first week in June.  If the numbers are still going in the right direction at that point, we can have some confidence about bringing forward some of the things from later phases.</p></speech>

They are trying to justify suggestions that the &euro;350 payment should be cut for those people and many others who have already seen a reduction in income.  Does the Taoiseach think that is fair?  Does it chime with the motto "we are all in this together" for Ministers and Deputies who earn multiples of &euro;350 a week to tell people who were essentially earning poverty wages that &euro;350 a week is too much for them?  For example, I met a woman named Lisa, who has given me permission to mention her name, on the Debenhams picket.  She has worked for Debenhams for 20 years, since she was 16.  She earned just under &euro;350 a week but with overtime she sometimes earned more.  She was unceremoniously sacked by Debenhams and thrown on the scrap heap.  She says she does not want to be getting the &euro;350 payment.  She is applying for jobs but she cannot get one at the moment.  Does the Taoiseach honestly think it is fair to Lisa and people like her, who have worked all their lives and never claimed social welfare, to even consider cutting their &euro;350 payment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.160" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700026#CC00300"><p>I am not aware of anyone who is considering cutting Lisa's payment, if I accurately picked up the Deputy's description of her case.  It sounds like she was earning &euro;300 or &euro;400 a week, and nobody I am aware of is considering cutting the pandemic unemployment payment in that circumstance, and certainly not in the near future when we are still in the early phases of the pandemic.  I have not heard anyone expressing horror at people getting &euro;350 a week.  I am the head of the Government that introduced this payment, which is one of the most generous welfare schemes in response to pandemic unemployment in the world, and I stand over it.  We introduced it because we wanted to get money to people quickly - to people who needed it and who lost their jobs largely because of a Government order to close the businesses in which they worked.  We stand over doing that.  We wanted to do something a bit more logical or fair, which was to give people 70% or 80% of their previous income, with floors and ceilings, but we could not do that and so we had to just put out a flat payment.  That is what we did and we stand over doing so.  That flat payment is &euro;350 a week, which is 70% of average wages in the sectors most affected, as I explained previously.  People are trying to connect this matter to low pay, but I do not accept that argument.  Someone working full time for 38 or 39 hours a week on the minimum wage of &euro;10.30 an hour would have been earning over &euro;400 a week.  Nobody is suggesting that the &euro;350 be reduced in that case.  Someone working a full week on the living wage would also have been earning more than &euro;350.  Nobody is suggesting for a second that any of the people in that category should have their pandemic unemployment payment cut.  What has been identified, which is a commonsense issue that many others have noted, is that some people who were working only ten hours a week, perhaps earning &euro;20 an hour and &euro;200 a week throughout January and February, are now getting &euro;350 a week.</p></speech>

Deputy Rabbitte of Fianna F&aacute;il has said that the payment is unfair and unsustainable.  It is not.  People who are earning multiples of the amount of the payment are suggesting it is unfair, unsustainable and needs to be cut.  It is good if the Taoiseach is backtracking on that position but he should give a clear commitment to people such as Lisa, workers in the arts and retail sectors, taxi drivers and others who may face protracted periods where, through no fault of their own, they will not be able to get back to the amounts they were previously earning, or employment at all, that the Covid payment will not be cut for them.  That is the commitment we need.</p></speech>

I appreciate that is his political position but it is not one shared by many people in this country.</p>  <p>  When we discuss tapering, it is important to bear in mind that the only people who are now getting less than they were earning before the pandemic are those who earned more than &euro;350 a week.  Someone who was earning &euro;700, &euro;600 or &euro;500 a week is now receiving the reduced payment of &euro;350.  Separate to that, there is a group of people who were not earning &euro;350 a week.  All of those who were earning &euro;200 a week, for example, would have been part-time workers rather than full-time workers because full-time workers earning the minimum wage would have been paid more.  That group of people is getting paid more than they were paid before the pandemic.  Anyone who is talking about tapering is doing so in the context of making sure that any tapering ensures people are not better off than they were before the pandemic.  People who earned more than &euro;350 a week are the exception and are already worse off.</p></speech>

It is undeniable that we have seen a massive propaganda campaign in the past week or more to attack those on the pandemic unemployment payment.  Pat McDonagh, a millionaire, has been complaining that it is tough to get part-time workers to work in Supermac's for &euro;200 a week because of the availability of the pandemic payment.  A Government Minister has suggested it is unsustainable to continue to pay it.  Deputy Rabbitte has said that some people are "a hell of a lot better off" due to the payment.  My first question is simple and will require ten seconds to answer.  Is the Taoiseach willing to live on &euro;350 a week, before he cuts that payment for anybody, to see what it is actually like?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.167" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700027#DD00400"><p>I am willing to live on whatever salary I am given for the job I am doing; that is how these things work.  I appreciate that the Deputy's argument is that everyone should be paid the same but he does not say what that would be or how that would be funded.  It is the Deputy's choice to take such an action and if he wants to demonstrate that, he should do it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.168" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1628" speakername="Paul Murphy" time="14:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700027#DD00500"><p>My argument is simply that before the Taoiseach cuts the pay of anybody who is currently on &euro;350 a week, he should see what it is like to live on that amount.</p><p>Everything about this propaganda campaign reminds me of the &quot;Welfare cheats cheat us all&quot; campaign that was rolled out when the Taoiseach was the Minister for Social Protection.  It is the same attempt to divide and rule workers through the use of the same scaremongering and exaggeration about people scamming the system and from the same underlying motivation of driving people to work for poverty wages.  It emerged that at the root of that campaign was a big lie.  The Taoiseach, when he was Minister, claimed that the amount saved by people reporting others for social welfare fraud was &euro;500 million.  It turned out that the real figure was less than 10% of that, less than &euro;50 million.  I wonder if the same sort of creative accounting is being used in this propaganda campaign.</p><p>Last Thursday, <i>The Irish Times</i>had an unpublished report, presumably leaked from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, which stated that 38% of recipients of the Covid-19 payment were previously earning less than &euro;300 per week.  That was used by people, including the Taoiseach, to suggest that a considerable number, almost 40%, of people are better off under the pandemic unemployment payment.  That is not true, is it?  Is it not the case that, of the 38% who are supposedly better off, a substantial number were already in receipt of social welfare payments which meant that their total income was already higher than &euro;350?</p><p>The article referred to more than 200,000 people who are better off unemployed than they were when they were working.  That number includes a substantial number of the 40,000 availing of the one-parent family payment, the 50,000 on the working family payment, the 5,000 on the back to work family dividend and the 35,000 part-time workers who were previously in receipt of jobseeker's allowance along with their wages.</p> <p>Can the Taoiseach confirm that the reference to pre-Covid income in that report does not include their social welfare payment and, therefore, the suggestion, which he has echoed, that 38% of people who are on the pandemic unemployment payment are better off is simply not accurate?</p></speech>

I do not have the report in front of me, although it was published either on Friday last or on the Friday before.  If the Deputy has heard what I have said about this publicly on a number of occasions, I have acknowledged that there are people who would be better off on ordinary long-standing welfare payments than on the pandemic unemployment payment.  There are people who were part-time workers in January and February who are better off on the pandemic unemployment payment.  There are also people who are on the pandemic unemployment payment who would be better off if they were moved to jobseeker's - largely people who have dependants - or moved to other payments such as the one-parent family payment.  There are anomalies in both directions and I have always acknowledged that.</p>  <p>  This was a temporary measure brought in during an emergency.  It had to be done quickly.  Everyone got a flat amount.  However, over time we need to reconcile that in order that those who got more than they would have got normally have their payments tapered and those who have been left short and would be better off on other welfare schemes are moved to those welfare schemes and get the increase to which they are entitled.</p></speech>

The response of all our medical staff during the pandemic, and particularly those at the front of house, has been exceptional.  The Covid-19 crisis has shown the entire country how we should do things and how we should not.  The greatest tribute we could all pay to our medical staff is to ensure that we do not go back to overwhelmed and overcrowded emergency departments with trolleys on the corridors.</p>  <p>  I welcome the publication of the just transition commissioner's report and the resulting discussions at Cabinet last week but we need to see talk and promises converted into real and practical action to deliver immediate jobs within the communities right across the midland countries now.  Every time we hear of just transition, we are always one more announcement away from action.  We cannot accept a situation where we must wait for Covid-19 restrictions to be lifted or the next budget cycle before we see action on the ground.  We do not have the luxury of time.  We must see action now because 360 families depend on a peat harvest this summer and, sadly, there is no guarantee that peat harvesting will be allowed pending the complex planning process that Bord na M&oacute;na must go through.</p>  <p>  I also echo the call of the just transition commissioner, Mr. Kieran Mulvey, that it is imperative that the &euro;11 million just transition fund announced last October would be used this year to stimulate and finance projects that have employment potential and that can contribute to the economic, social and environmental sustainability of the region.  This must be in a manner that complements other sources of public funding available to the region.  Mr. Mulvey went on to say that the funds needed to be made available as quickly as possible for allocation to selected projects.</p>  <p>  On 23 July last, I wrote to the Taoiseach requesting as an immediate measure that &euro;30 million from the climate action fund should be ring-fenced to commence the work of rehabilitating the cutaway bogs - work that must be carried out on these bogs regardless of the future of peat harvesting.  The front-loading of this work was to be carried out over the 15-year period but would provide security of employment for the 360 Bord na M&oacute;na staff at this anxious time, as well as reducing peat oxidation and carbon loss on our bogs.  On 9 September, the Taoiseach wrote back to me to say that funding the rehabilitation of cutaway bogs from the climate action fund should form part of the solution.</p>  <p>  Bord na M&oacute;na has a landholding of just under 200,000 acres across the country.</p> <p>While some of these lands may be considered for new commercial uses, such as the growing of herbs, other lands will naturally return to nature.  As a result, there is a considerable land bank, where peat extraction has already ceased, that would flood naturally and where work on rehabilitation can start.  This work would include the provision of recreational facilities such as walking and cycling trails, which would be less than two hours' travel from Leinster House.</p> <p> As the Taoiseach knows, the decision has already been taken, as part of Project Ireland 2040, to develop a 35,000-acre national wetlands park on the Mount Dillon bog complex in counties Roscommon and Longford.  A further example of the opening up of bogland for public access is the Ballinasloe parkland project, which would utilise the cutaway bogs outside the town of Ballinasloe.  It is envisaged that it will form part of the Dublin&ndash;Galway greenway.</p> <p> Public access alone is already attracting over 50,000 visitors a year to Mount Lucas in County Offaly.  Two hundred and seventy days after the Taoiseach&rsquo;s letter to me, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, has announced that work on the advanced rehabilitation of these peatlands is "subject to further Government consideration".  Again, we are another announcement away from action.  Not a single cent has been spent on rehabilitating these bogs, nor has a single cent from the just transition fund been allocated for alternative employment in the region, yet we are quite happy to borrow money on the back of every citizen in this country to subsidise the wages of Bord na M&oacute;na staff or pay them unemployment benefits at a cost of approximately &euro;65,000 every week, forcing them to sit at home although the rehabilitation work will have to be done regardless of the future of peat harvesting.</p> <p> I have a number of questions.  First, I want a commitment from the Taoiseach that the funds will be released immediately, in line with his commitment last September, to re-employ Bord na M&oacute;na staff currently laid off to commence the rehabilitation of State-owned and State-controlled bogs.  Second, I want a commitment that the National Oil Reserves Agency, NORA, amendment legislation to provide moneys for the climate action fund will be agreed by the Cabinet and ready for publication within seven days of the formation of the new Government, and that it will ensure part of the fund will be ring-fenced for projects across the midland counties.  Third, will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government has received the &euro;5 million committed by the ESB for the just transition fund, and will he provide me with the date that moneys from the &euro;11 million just transition fund will be allocated for shovel-ready projects that can create jobs now, not in ten years' time?</p></speech>

I agree with him on the overall point.  If we can front-load bog rehabilitation, we should.  It would be a great thing to do.  It would secure jobs in Bord na M&oacute;na.  It would also help to restore our natural heritage and promote tourism.  The question the Government is grappling with now is that of how to fund it.  The carbon tax revenues for 2020 have already been ring-fenced for particular circumstances.  I am aware that the Minister is considering repurposing the Bord na M&oacute;na PSO for rehabilitation-type work.  If that could be done, it would be really great because it would mean a substantial amount of money that could be used in the region and on the bogs.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy said, the climate action fund legislation has to be approved by the Cabinet and passed by the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  That is intended to be a competitive fund.  The idea is that people bid into it.</p>  <p>  What I am told about the ESB is that it has agreed to contribute an additional &euro;5 million, and arrangements are being put in place by the Department to transfer the money to the just transition fund 2020.  I assume that means it has not been done yet but that arrangements are being made to do so.  It means &euro;11 million will be available for projects in 2020 through the fund.  The first call for that money was opened by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, last Friday.  In addition, there is a separate &euro;5 million for bog restoration and a rehabilitation scheme.  That is on land of the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  It will restore 1,800 ha of bog in seven counties.  Bord na M&oacute;na won the contract for doing the work, which will support 40 jobs.</p></speech>

I will come back to the comment made last week by Mr. Kieran Mulvey, the Government-appointed just transition commissioner, in his report.</p> <p>He made specific reference to the just transition fund.  I am disappointed to hear that the ESB money has yet to be lodged to that account, but there is potentially &euro;11 million available.  My fear is that this issue will be kicked down the road.  While we welcome Deputy Bruton's call for submissions, he might as well be calling out in Croke Park because we still do not have a closing date for applications, a date on which decisions will be made, or a date on which communities and projects across the country and across the region will know that money will be allocated.  I want to know the date on which decisions will be made, the date on which money will be allocated and the date on which projects across the midlands that can create jobs now can start.</p></speech>

It is reasonable to ask for them so I will check with the Minister and either he or I will contact the Deputy once I know what those dates are.  I do know that the &euro;11 million just transition fund for the midlands is there even if the ESB's &euro;5 million has not yet arrived.  The money is there and it is ring-fenced for just transition in the midlands.  The Minister opened the call for applications last Friday.  We should not waste any time in this regard.</p></speech>

It is a shambolic situation that I am speaking to the Taoiseach's empty seat while he is in another part of the building.  We had this debate at the meeting of the Business Committee yesterday and again this morning.  We called a vote on the matter but, unfortunately, people who objected to the proposal decided to vote with the Government and to allow the Taoiseach to carry on with his nonsense.  There is clear scientific and medical evidence that there is no issue with spending two hours in this massive Chamber.  The Taoiseach is just hiding but there is no place for the Taoiseach to hide and there will be nowhere to hide when the real truth about all of this is found out.</p><p>I asked him about our peacekeepers last week.  They are still out there.  We should be thankful that they have now got a date for their return, which is 29 June.  These 300 gallant men and women and their families at home are suffering.  I hope that date is honoured and that there will not be another shambolic excuse given.</p><p>I also mentioned the issue of nursing homes last week.  Different doctors have resigned from the Medical Council and other bodies.  They have better knowledge of this issue than I do.  What happened was nothing short of national sabotage.  I hope there will an inquiry into what happened and that people will be held accountable.  As I mentioned last week, people who got oxygen tanks had to give them back.  Tanks that were nearly empty were taken away and people were left without oxygen.  Let us think about that.  People were just left without oxygen.  What happened to our young people and our people aged over 70 is shocking.  There is a cohort of people aged over 66 who are working and sustaining many families and communities and who are not getting a bob in payment.</p><p>Mention was made of the Covid payment.  I argued that the payment should be made <i>pro rata</i>based on what people had earned in the month or four weeks prior but I was told that could not be done.  We would not have the problems we now have had that been done.  I do not agree with what Members on the left are saying, which is that we are trying to be mean; we are not.  Many people are not getting enough but it is clearly unsustainable to give &euro;350 to people who were earning &euro;80 or &euro;100.  </p><p>The issue of the mental health of our young people and our old people is just shocking.  On the issue of the 2 m distance, a very close relative of mine visited a hospital in Cork last week and had to sit in huge queue in a waiting room separated from others by only 1 m.  Who is codding whom?  Even the WHO, about which we hear so much, does not recommend 2 m.  </p><p>I also want to ask the Taoiseach about the carry on with the private hospitals.  I have a very sad letter from a woman who has given me permission to use her sister's details.  She states:</p> <blockquote> 	For the last 45 years, my sister has paid for private health insurance to cover all her hospital stays.  She has never asked the general taxpayer to pay for any of her medical treatment.  She is now 66 years of age and needs urgent surgery for a stage 3 prolapse, which could go to emergency stage 4 at any time.  Her consultant has clearly stated he cannot operate on her until July at the earliest, or even into September.  Each day the surgery is delayed means that further damage is happening inside her body.  Therefore,  in order to repair the damage, she will require much more extensive surgery at the end of the time.   </blockquote>  <p>There are many thousands of people like her.  It is totally unfair.  This woman supplied me with figures, for which I thank her.  They relate to the number of beds occupied in Cork hospitals on 14 April, 20 April, 28 April and 7 May.</p> <p>In the Bon Secours Hospital, which has 300 beds, the numbers occupied on those dates were 30, 36, 89 and 103, respectively.  This means that 200 beds or more were empty at all times.  That is shocking.  In the Mater Private Hospital, which has a capacity of 102, six beds were occupied the first week, and the figures for the following weeks were 25, 37 and 23, respectively.  It is an absolute shame.  We had to take over the private hospitals and I supported that, but for how long?  When are we going to give them back and allow surgery of all kinds to go ahead for people?  There are no cervical cancer smear tests taking place.  There are no tests of any kind happening.  Many people with serious diagnoses will require treatment and everything else.</p> <p> I said to the Taoiseach last week that there was a con element or large con element in this.  I am still saying it.  I am glad to see today that in Spain, lawyers are challenging the government there, and the unelected officials who are wielding all the power, to prove the evidence.  I am asking the Taoiseach to give us the evidence.  We cannot get the minutes of meetings.  Give us the scientific evidence which we are not being given.  The officials in Spain will be called to account and I hope they are called to account here too.  Big business is flourishing and all those companies can open, but the same is not true for small businessmen - na daoine beaga - who include ordinary people such as shopkeepers, taxi drivers and all those small business owners.  What is going on is that we seem to be wiping all those people out and letting the big companies flourish.  We must let small businesses trade, whether they are selling a bit of homeware or whatever else.  Let us support the small businessmen who employ from one to ten people or one to 50 people.  There is a con element going on here and the sooner we realise it and the sooner people stand up to it and question it, the better.</p> <p> We must have accountability in this Parliament, not the Taoiseach fleeing to some other building because he cannot face us here.  I hate talking to faceless people.  I talk to get answers for the people from Tipperary on whose behalf I have the privilege of having been elected.  We are not getting answers and I want those answers.  I do not know what is wrong with Deputy Feighan.</p></speech>

There are many reports and surveys indicating that Kerry will be worse affected by the pandemic than any other county in the country.  Indeed, I do not need to see any of those reports because I know of it first hand.  We see that there is nothing at all happening in towns like Killarney, Dingle, Cahersiveen and Castleisland.</p>  <p>  In relation to seasonal workers, it is very unfair that they were not recognised.  If the lockdown had not happened for another two weeks, all of them would have been back and would now be getting the Covid-19 payment.  Bus workers, hotel workers and many others have concerns.  Indeed, in the past two days, I have had over 700 emails from bus drivers and others concerned about the transport industry in Kerry.  It is shambolic the way they have been treated.  We are seeing yards of buses, none of which are moving, and there is no payment for any driver.  Their stamps are gone and they have been totally left behind.  I am asking the Taoiseach to address that matter.</p>  <p>  My next question concerns the social distancing requirement and whether it should be 1 m or 2 m.  In order to get going and give some kind of assistance to the tourism industry, I am asking the Taoiseach to reduce it to 1 m.  Other countries, like France, Austria, Norway, Sweden and Finland, have all applied the 1 m restriction.  The World Health Organization, WHO, to which the Government lately gave &euro;9 million for its advice and assistance, is recommending distancing of 1 m or more.  One metre is sufficient in rural places.  If we do not apply that smaller distancing requirement, and the longer we leave businesses in the hotel and tourism industry without releasing them and allowing them to get going and avail of the national tourists who come down from Dublin and all around the country to towns like Killarney and other places in Kerry, the less hope there is of those businesses ever again opening.  That is probably what will happen.</p>  <p>  I have a question regarding the young drivers waiting for a driving test.</p> <p>Is it possible to give them a temporary amnesty?  There are thousands of them.  If the Taoiseach cannot do that, surely the schools of motoring or the driving instructors could be asked to put a division between the instructor and the learner driver to allow the learner to do the lessons or the test.  After the lessons are completed, and most of the learners have completed them, they could be allowed to do the test in the driving instructor's car.</p> <p> I am glad other Deputies raised the issue of funerals and churches.  I sympathise with all the people and families who have lost loved ones during the pandemic and who did not have a proper funeral.  It makes no sense that only ten people can go into the massive cathedral in Killarney.  There should be some other way of deciding.  I would support it being looked at again.</p> <p> With regard to nursing homes, I call on the Taoiseach to explain to the people of Ireland why people who toiled and worked so hard all their lives had to die alone with no member of their families with them.  As somebody who lost someone very dear to me in the last few years, I know what it means for the person who is dying.  Those people surely could not understand why there was nobody with them.</p> <p> I also call on the Taoiseach to look at what has happened with the direct provision centre in Cahersiveen, all the inconsistencies and the things that should have happened.  It is clear now that the opening of a direct provision centre there should never have happened.  The HSE did not agree with it, the people of Cahersiveen did not agree with it and the residents in the direct provision centre do not agree with it.  I ask the Taoiseach to examine this, to close it down for once and for all and to give the people of Cahersiveen and the residents fair play.</p></speech>

I am happy to do that and to be held to account for as long as I hold this office.  I agree with the Deputy that it is sending the wrong message that I spent two hours in the Chamber and one hour here, but that happened because of a procedural row and a vote that went on for an hour and was unnecessary.  If anybody sent the wrong message to the public, it is not the public health people but some of the Independent Deputies who decided to spend an hour on a procedural wrangle and vote that were entirely unnecessary.</p></speech>

With regard to the col&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh, the Minister is working on a package to help them.  We want to do something to help them because I realise they will be financially hit by having no income for the summer.  However, we must ensure we do it in a way that is fair.  There are many other groups in society and other businesses and organisations that will not get their summer income either because of the pandemic and we cannot do something for one sector and not have regard to what other sectors may want as well.  It is being considered in the round.  We want to do something to help the col&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh and ensure that they can function as normal in 2021.</p></speech>

Beidh na mn&aacute; t&iacute; agus na col&aacute;ist&iacute; th&iacute;os leis.  Beidh impleachta&iacute; maidir leis an gceantar, leis an nGaeilge agus leis na Gaeltachta&iacute;.  Is rud thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; seo.</p> <p>It is very important that the implications of the summer colleges not going ahead is realised at Government level.  I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach could come back to me in writing on when the package will be announced.</p> <p> My second question relates to children with special needs.  I have repeatedly raised it with the Taoiseach at this level as well as with the Minister for Education and Skills.  Can we, please, have some certainty as to what is being put in place, whether the special schools will be reopened and-or, in the meantime, that a package would be in place?</p> <p> Finally, I do not accept the Taoiseach's response in regard to a row in the D&aacute;il.  I do not know how we could put trust in any advice that says it is not safe to be in this D&aacute;il, which is empty, and that the Taoiseach should be ensconced in another room.  I go back to Galway and I see people working.  I go to the shops where they have to work all day.  They cannot hide away in any room, neither can the nurses or the doctors.  What I am saying to the Taoiseach is that we should be sensible.  We are giving out contradictory messages that some people are more important than other people, and we are giving a very wrong message that we are now moving in the right direction in terms of Covid-19.  Let us have a little sense and review the advice.  I read the advice last Thursday that was passed out by the Ceann Comhairle at 2 p.m. and it made no suggestion that this should happen.  I ask the Taoiseach to use the 45 seconds remaining to me to answer the question relating to certainty for the col&aacute;ist&iacute; samhraidh, and particularly for the children and teenagers with disability and their families.</p></speech>

I will come back to her on the summer colleges once I have more information on what the package is and what may not be possible.</p>  <p>  On children with special needs, we are totally aligned on our concern about that issue.  I share the Deputy's desire to do something for children with special needs over the summer to ensure they get the education, attention and therapy that they need.  NPHET is doing a lot of work at the moment on how that might become possible.</p>  <p>  On the two-hour rule, we do make our own procedures in this House.  It is a matter for the Business Committee and I am happy to abide by whatever decision is made in regard to how we conduct our business in the Chamber.  If that means that I or many of us have to self-isolate for 14 days for some reason then so be it, but I do not make the rules.  I am in the hands of others in that regard.</p></speech>

I would certainly be happy to convey that to the committee and we will see if we are in a position to deal with it.  The extra session we will have per week will certainly help us deal with more issues.</p>  <p>  We had the HSE representatives in last week and I asked what the testing was costing.  It was at the end of a very long day.  We were confined to two hours and I was told that it was hundreds of millions of euro.  That was as specific as we got in the time period available to us.  We cannot bring in the same people every week - we have a lot to cover - but I wonder if the Taoiseach has any more information than that on the cost of Covid-19 testing per person.</p></speech>

I might be out of date on this but the last time I was briefed on this, which was a week or two ago, the estimate for the cost of testing for Covid this year will be somewhere between &euro;400 million and &euro;450 million.  That is because of the fact that the tests cost about &euro;200 a go, which is a lot of money.  I might be out of date but that is the most recent briefing I had on it.</p></speech>

There may be differences - I am not saying there are none - but it does seem like a very large difference.  In Vienna airport, and this brings me on to my next question, they are carrying out accelerated testing, which is obviously more expensive.  The cost is borne entirely by the passenger and one gets the result within three hours.  It is accelerated testing so it is more expensive.  It is &euro;190.  I worry that if we get to 10,000 tests a day and if there is a discrepancy between what we are paying and what we should be paying, that could be an enormous cost to the Exchequer.  I cannot put it any further than that.</p>  <p>  That brings me to my next question.  There has been a good deal of controversy about people coming into the country, the regime in place and whether we should be testing and quarantining.</p> <p>In any event, regulations were made.  They were not put before the committee but they were made and are in place.</p> <p> We should also look at potentially testing people leaving the country, for one particular reason.  Foynes, and later Shannon and all of Ireland, has been an aviation gateway to North America for some time.  The entire economy of the mid-west is built around that.  There are no flights going from Shannon to North America.  There are flights from Dublin but only American residents and citizens can go on them.  We have customs pre-clearance and were the first in the world to have it.  Has there been any investigation of the possibility of testing passengers in our airports?  I appreciate that it would be extraordinarily difficult to accommodate the numbers and to distance and segregate those who are tested from those who are not.  Significant space would be needed to do that.  Having spoken to the officials in Shannon Airport, while they would clearly not be able to do the testing, they would be able to accommodate it.  It may well be that other airports in the country would also be able to.  It might open the possibility of passengers flying from Europe to North America via our airports, using the existing paradigm of customs pre-clearance.  Has the Taoiseach considered that?  If not, will he consider it and will he task the diplomatic corps to see if there is any possibility of that going ahead?</p></speech>

Everything in healthcare is at a premium at the moment, whether PPE or testing kits.  Everyone is looking for the same stuff and the cost is very high, but I think the cost of testing will come down.  The Deputy is right that in Austria, one can have a test done in the airport but one has to bear the cost of &euro;190.  No work has been done in our airports that I am aware of to see if we can set up testing there, but we can give it consideration.  The direction of travel in policy is probably a bit different.  We currently have a 14-day quarantine for people coming into the country through our airports and ports.  We would like to get to a point at some stage in the future, within months rather than weeks, where we can lift that quarantine requirement if people are flying to or from another country where the virus has been successfully suppressed, and then we would not need to do testing at all.  As things stand, neither Britain or America is one of those countries.</p></speech>

A lot of young people need to sit their driver's tests to get a licence to get to work.  Perhaps social distancing is not even being observed to get them to where they need to be.  Is there any possibility of reinstating driver testing in cases of need, particularly in rural Ireland?</p></speech>

I totally appreciate that we need to get testing started as soon as possible.  A car means freedom in large parts of the country, particularly rural Ireland.  People need to do their tests so they can take up employment that they need.</p></speech>

First and most important, I wish to express my sympathy to the family and friends of those who have been lost to this disease since I was last in this House.  It is important to say that each private loss is also a loss to our country, and we offer our deep and sincere condolences to all those impacted.  </p>  <p>  I am pleased today to be able to report some good news to the D&aacute;il.  The modelling data, compiled by Professor Philip Nolan and his team, confirms Ireland&rsquo;s reproduction number is now between 0.4 and 0.5 this week.  It suggests a stable transition where we have kept this virus under control while moving to the first phase of reopening our society.  This, and other key indicators, give grounds for cautious optimism.  The modelling also shows the key measures of severity.  The number of people in hospital and intensive care has also remained stable through the last week.</p> <p>We have seen one to two admissions a day to intensive care units and ten to 15 admissions a day to hospital.</p> <p> It seems at this stage that despite some more businesses opening, and more people moving, we, the Irish people, have managed to keep control of this virus so far.  That is down to the people of Ireland.  It is down to their incredible efforts and their incredible self-discipline.  People have adapted their behaviour to the realities this virus brings.  They have kept their distance, they have washed their hands, and they have adopted the public health advice.  They have worked with us to try to find a safe way of living alongside the virus.  That is really what the next number of weeks have to be about, namely, while the virus is here, how can we safely live alongside it?  We are very grateful to the Irish people for all they have done, all they are doing, and all they are sacrificing.</p> <p> All of our efforts now, our entire national effort, must be to keep the reproduction number below one, and to keep cases low so that we can keep this virus as weak as possible.  Once that reproduction number remains below one, this virus is continuing to be suppressed.  The understandable temptation might be to think the battle is won and we can drop our guard at last.  That would be an extremely dangerous position to adopt because unfortunately this is certainly not the case.  The more we open up our society and economy, which is what we want to do, the more the obligation falls on each and every one of us as an individual to continue to keep ourselves and others safe by following the public health advice that has been shown to date to work.</p> <p> We are all rightly concerned about the possibility of a second wave of Covid-19 in our country.  We have to be clear about who is in control of that possibility.  It is not someone else.  It is us.  This disease cannot come forward on its own.  It can only move through being transmitted by people.  It is our actions that will decide the behaviour of this disease.  We have kept it at bay and we can continue to do that if we stay focused and continue to push home our advantage, as we move to reopen our society and our economy.  We hope to move forward, but we will continue to be led by the data on the behaviour of this disease and our capacity to respond to it, and by the public health advice that has brought us this far.  Cabinet will decide towards the end of next week if we can move forward to phase 2, based on public health advice.</p> <p> I know there has been significant debate, and rightly so, in this Chamber regarding nursing homes and long-term residential care facilities.  I want to assure this House that the Department of Health, the HSE, HIQA, nursing home operators, and front-line staff have all worked tirelessly to help stem the spread of this virus and protect our most vulnerable.  People will seek to apportion blame but we should not forget that the villain here is the virus.</p> <p> Over the past number of weeks, I have made contact with residents of nursing homes across the country using FaceTime in order to talk directly to them.  They are full of steel, resolve and determination, but they also spoke of loneliness.  When we took the decision to introduce visitor restrictions we did so with a heavy heart, knowing the impact this would have on people in nursing homes, and on their friends and families.  I am pleased to report the health service is examining the issue of easing some visitor restrictions and assessing whether we can allow visitors to meet members of their families outside.  I am not suggesting that we can return to normal with visiting, and I do not wish to raise any false hope, but I want residents in nursing homes today, and their families, to know we are looking at this and we are hoping to be in a position to make progress on it shortly.  There has to be a safe way of bringing about some level of visiting, and I have seen very innovative ways of doing this in other countries as well.</p> <p> I also want to update the House on the outbreaks in nursing homes.  As we know, we have experienced a significant number of outbreaks in nursing homes.  Today I can confirm outbreaks have been stemmed in 29 of those.  This means there have been no new cases of Covid-19 in those clusters more than over 28 days.  I want to thank nursing home owners and staff for their heroic efforts in the face of great challenge.  I am also pleased to see there has not been a new outbreak in a nursing home in over a week, according to the chief clinical officer of the HSE today.</p> <p> The protection of those in our nursing homes continues to be my priority.  As I mentioned earlier, we have established a Covid-19 nursing home expert panel, following the recommendation of the National Public Health Emergency Team.  Until now the actions we have taken in relation to our nursing homes have been designed to assist the sector to prevent and control outbreaks of Covid-19.  We recognise this virus may well be with us for months and perhaps years to come.  We must, therefore, continue to plan how to best protect residents and staff in our nursing homes into the future, asking how can we do better, what are our current measures like and are they effective, what are other countries doing and can we learn from them, and what is best international practice.  That planning will be undertaken by the Covid-19 nursing home expert panel.</p> <p> I am really pleased Professor Cecily Kelleher agreed to chair this for me, and I met with her yesterday.  The expert panel will assess, as I have said, the measures already taken, both nationally and internationally, as well as emerging responses to what is still a new virus, to ensure we are doing everything we can in our nursing homes to prepare for and respond to the ongoing threat of this disease in the months to come.</p> <p>I very much look forward to the first report and the recommendations from Professor Kelleher, due at the end of next month.</p> <p> We talk a great deal about older people, and rightly so, but on the other side of the age spectrum I am concerned about the impact this pandemic is having on our children.  Childhood is a time of joy, innocence and exploration.  This pandemic has deprived them of time with their friends and of school time, and that is bound to have an impact.  Summer is here and, while it will not be a normal summer, we must look at ways to help our children resume some form of normality.  I hear from children right across the country and from their parents.  This is a very tough time for our kids and I am not sure we are talking enough about the impact of this pandemic on children.  I am pleased to tell the House that NPHET is currently examining the matter of how we provide more guidance and assistance for children and their families, and it hopes to be in a position to make some decisions on this next week.</p> <p> On the matter of travel, from tomorrow it will be mandatory for passengers from overseas, irrespective of nationality, to complete a Covid-19 public health passenger locator form on their arrival in our country.  We have put this measure into law because this form is very important in our overall public health response to this disease.  The form facilitates follow-up checks to make sure that people are staying where they said they would stay and it allows us to do more accurate and faster contact tracing in the event of a confirmed imported case.  It is really important, as we continue to suppress the virus here, that if there is an imported case we can move very quickly to contact trace and isolate.  We will require all passengers, with exceptions such as for aircraft crew, to complete this form.  The regulations will be further reviewed by me on 18 June.  If they must be continued, they will be kept under very regular review so that they will only be in force for as long as they are necessary.</p> <p> The introduction of this measure, along with the public health advice for self-isolation for 14 days and, I must say contrary to what I heard on the airwaves this morning, the continuing public health recommendation against non-essential travel off the island of Ireland are to ensure that we can continue to protect the progress that we have made against this disease.  I will continue to take my travel advice from public health experts.</p> <p> It is tempting to look only to the future and to wish to leave behind the sacrifices and the hardship of these last months as quickly as possible.  It is very understandable but we must guard against moving too soon or too fast.  We must remain patient and be vigilant but there are signs for cautious optimism.  If we continue to practice the behaviours that we know will keep ourselves and others safe, we will keep saving lives, we will weaken the virus and we will strengthen our position in being able to take more measures and more moves forward in terms of our roadmap, hopefully by the end of next week.</p></speech>

They paint a very dark picture of staff having to use painter's overalls and goggles from local schools to protect themselves; of four-week delays in testing; and of no voice on NPHET or even on the subgroup looking at nursing homes.  The Minister said to me recently that HIQA was its voice.  I put that to HIQA yesterday at the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response.  HIQA said it was not the voice of nursing homes on those groups.</p>  <p>  The correspondence is damning when it comes to patients being transferred from hospitals to nursing homes.  It began in early March.  It began before there was guidance in place for the testing of those patients, before there was guidance in place for nursing homes on how to care for those patients, and before nursing homes had the PPE needed to care for those patients.  </p>  <p>   When some nursing homes refused, the HSE wrote to them on 6 March.  Here is one of the things it concluded.  It concluded that there were no grounds for greater concerns about discharges from hospitals at that time, as every possible risk assessment and medical assessment necessary would have been carried out before the patient was confirmed suitable for discharge.  That was before any guidance was issued.</p>  <p>  The guidance was issued four days later, on 10 March, and it was sobering.  Patients from hospitals that have Covid patients, but where Covid has not spread around the hospital, were not tested and were not isolated.  Regarding patients from hospitals where there were Covid patients and Covid was spreading through the hospital, if those patients were asymptomatic, they were not tested.  If they were not a close contact of a Covid patient, they were not even isolated.</p> <p>If they were in a hospital where there were Covid patients and where Covid was spreading, and they were a close contact of one of those Covid patients, they were not tested; they were just isolated for a few days.  The representatives of nursing homes asked for stricter measures and said that the guidance contained "no practical guidance to nursing homes on how to reduce the risk of transmission" or to inform regarding the procedures to care for residents or staff who may present with symptoms.  No information was provided with regard to accessing PPE.  The nursing homes were screaming for help.  On the same day of that guidance, NPHET actually advised that the visitor restrictions that nursing homes themselves had put in place were unnecessary.  That is where NPHET was.</p> <p> A week later the Minister launched the Government's 60-page action plan, which mentions nursing homes once.  The only mention of nursing homes was that they were somewhere that patients should be discharged to.  That was it.  As of today, 884 women and men have lost their lives in nursing homes due to Covid.  It is over half the total number of fatalities.  Does the Minister accept that the transfer of non-tested and non-isolated patients from hospitals with Covid in them most likely contributed to those clusters happening in nursing homes?  Will he commit to finding out how many of those outbreaks in the nursing homes were likely to have come from the patients who were transferred?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.214" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="16:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700038#SS00200"><p>I watched much of the committee hearing yesterday.  It was disappointing that officials from the Department of Health were not invited to a committee hearing on nursing homes.  Their ears must have been burning but they were not in a position to speak.  Nor were representatives of the HSE invited to give an opening statement setting out what it has been doing.  However, be that as it may.</p>  <p>  Action 4 of the national action plan on Covid, caring for people who are at risk or vulnerable, is all about protecting older and more vulnerable people.  There was engagement with the nursing home sector as far back as 19 February, when the head of the HSE met representatives of Nursing Homes Ireland.  His note of that meeting specifically refers to his conversation about preparedness for Covid.</p>  <p>  I am very conscious that the transfer of patients from one setting to another is done on the basis of clinical guidance and a clinical viewpoint.  It would be done on the basis of a doctor deciding that it would be appropriate to transfer somebody.  It is true to say that our position on testing evolved throughout the crisis.  Ireland is probably one of the only countries to have decided to test all residents and staff in nursing homes regardless of symptoms.  I do not accept - because I do not yet have the evidence to accept - that the clusters were caused by the transfer of patients from acute hospital settings.  I am not sure that the timeline shows that either.  I very much accept the point the Deputy made that this is something that should be established.  I hope that the expert review panel, chaired by a public health expert with a geriatrician and a senior nurse on it, could also look at the overall issue of admissions and transfers, and discharges from hospitals.  The Deputy raised a fair point in that regard.</p></speech>

In recent days older people in County Wexford received a letter stating if they did not wish to restart their home support service by 8 June 2020, their service will cease and they will be placed on the waiting list for home support services - in other words, use it or lose it by 8 June.  Many elderly people are concerned and have contacted me about this.  They have had to rearrange their home situation, often having to move into the home of a son or daughter because the normal care cannot look after them.  This letter is totally inappropriate at this stage.  It is basically telling older people they will have to move home and reuse this service or they will lose it.  Based on the most recent figures, almost 900 people in Wexford are on the waiting list.  Bizarrely in Carlow-Kilkenny there is nobody.  The fear in Wexford of being put to the back of the list is very real.</p>  <p>  I have a second question.  I was contacted by a healthcare worker this morning.  She was in contact with asymptomatic but Covid-positive patients.  She has been waiting 14 days for her test results.  I ask the Minister to comment on this and ensure healthcare workers are not waiting for 14 days for test results.  She has been out of action for that length of time.</p>  <p>  I have a final comment.  There is now effectively cross-party support for the publication of the refreshed Vision for Change.  Can that please be published?</p></speech>

We are eager that people feel comfortable to resume home care again and to have vital supports back in their home but I understand that different people will think differently on that.  I will pursue it with the HSE and the Deputy might provide me with the correspondence.  </p> <p> On A Vision for Change, my hope, if not expectation, is that a new Government will be formed in June.  I would like to see it bring A Vision for Change to the Government in its first weeks.  The document is ready but traditionally new policy initiatives are not taken to Government, that they need to be owned by the new Government.  It is something with which the new Government should hit the ground running.  It has been through Cabinet committee.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Jim Daly, has put much work into it and it is ready.  We should aspire to have it published in June.  If a new Government is not formed in June, I can introduce it on behalf of the current Government.  We should commit to publishing it then.</p></speech>

While this has been a very significant week, we can never forget these people or their families.  I also acknowledge the vast work done across the country but today I focus on my own county, Mayo, with the work done by health workers, carers, home helps, family carers and other professionals, which has been immense and under hugely challenging circumstances.  There are specific difficulties which I have spoken to the Minister about.  I would like his reviews.  There are difficulties in Mayo University Hospital in particular.  Staff have contacted me and other public representatives on the continuing, up to last week, cross-over of staff between Covid and non-Covid units.  Staff are moving between units, traversing through one unit to get to the other.  Second, they have raised the inadequate physical space in the hospital between the Covid unit and the non-Covid unit which makes this crossing over between units inevitable.  Third, they have raised the absence of an isolation unit in Mayo University Hospital and also the district hospitals in Ballina, Belmullet and Swinford.  Are there plans, as we catch our breath from what may only be the first wave, to invest in capital facilities in hospitals across Mayo and the rest of the country, looking at the lessons learned in recent months and putting investment in place to ensure that these hospitals are ready for what may be an ongoing Covid situation?</p>  <p>  What are the testing levels of staff at Mayo University Hospital as well as all district hospitals and health facilities across Mayo?  Some weeks ago, great effort was put in.  Has that continued?  Has it been updated?  What percentage of staff at Mayo University Hospital were tested?</p>  <p>  Finally, there is the matter of derogation.  An issue has arisen across the country where HSE occupational health may advise someone who is defined as a close contact not to work but their line manager can ask or derogate them to work.  What are the rules around that policy?</p></speech>

I often feel somewhat uneasy when we speak about progress in statistics and figures but we are not talking about them in a vacuum.  This is a virus that has caused a lot of tragedy to an awful lot of people and we think of them.  I thank Deputy Calleary for raising the matters on Mayo hospital.  He was in direct contact with me on these issues.  I am advised by Saolta hospital group that appropriate control measures are in place in Mayo University Hospital for Covid-19.  As is the case across hospitals, Mayo University Hospital has adjusted how care is delivered to patients as well as continuously implementing updated national advice.  Actions taken include streaming patients into Covid and non-Covid pathways.  This did require some physical changes to the hospital, including a new entrance.  Where possible, patients are treated in single rooms.  However, given the infrastructure of the hospital, it is not always possible to provide single rooms for patients, which was the point the Deputy made about isolation facilities.</p> <p>Patients who attend the hospital through the emergency department are also separated into suspect and non-suspect Covid-19 patients.  Suspected Covid-19 patients who attend the emergency department are tested in rapid turnaround time.  While every effort is made to ensure patients are streamed separately, occasionally it will happen that a person in a designated non-Covid space will turn out to be positive, but he or she may not have shown any symptoms.  Patients who develop symptoms consistent with Covid-19 on a ward are tested rapidly and transferred to a Covid-19 ward if diagnosed positive.  The hospital has separated its clinical staff into teams to minimise contact and to reduce the risk of healthcare worker and patient infection.  Again, that is all based on the national guidance provided at that time.</p> <p> Saolta has provided executive microbiology and infectious disease input into the management of Covid-19 in Mayo, but in light of the serious issues Deputy Calleary raises I will now ask the CEO of the HSE for a report on the matters he raised with me, and that report to include information on the testing levels of staff.  My understanding is that the national public health emergency team is likely to broaden the case definition for testing at its meeting tomorrow.  It is certainly something under consideration.  I will also ask specifically about the supports for the district hospitals in Ballina, Swinford and across Mayo, and for a view on the derogation.  I will get the Deputy a written report from the CEO.</p></speech>

Our sympathies and condolences must go to the bereaved families who have suffered tragic losses in recent months due to the Covid-19 crisis.  We must all acknowledge that there has been a tremendous national effort by everybody involved across the country.  We also acknowledge the very dedicated work by all the front-line staff, especially but not just in the health service.  I refer to those people who work in supermarkets and shops and who look after people getting food and allow them to go about their daily business.  They are all putting themselves at risk by being out there, but I know that most employers have good arrangements in place to ensure social distancing.</p>  <p>  The Minister might be happy to hear me say this: it is impossible to get every decision 100% correct during a pandemic.  That must be acknowledged.  Some of the issues that did arise showed up previous shortcomings, such as the treatment of nursing homes.  For years, they have tried to be involved with national committees but the Minister refused several times to agree to that.  Other issues that came to light relate to the promises to process 5,000 and 10,000 tests in the next week.  We have long heard the over-promising of testing.  Private hospitals have not been used to their full capacity.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund must be stepped up to pick up a lot of the slack because there will be a lot of people on waiting lists.</p>  <p>  People might agree or disagree with it, but I am happy to hear there are differences of opinion among the members of the national public health emergency team, their advisory committees, the Government and the Department of Health.  I would be very worried if everyone was sitting there mute and they were all yes-men and yes-women.  I am pleased there are differences of opinion because we would not have got to where we are unless people had teased out their various points of view.  I do not have a question for the Minister.</p></speech>

I have sent the names to him.  I have a very brief question on the national children's hospital.  After much discussion, construction has restarted.  I would have thought the hospital would be a priority project.  As I often say to my daughter, it is the thing that she is going to be paying for out of her pension, but we do want to see it built nonetheless.  My information is that work has not restarted.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that.  Will there be an additional cost for the delay and, if so, how much will the additional cost be per day, per hour or per week?</p></speech>

I do not make the rules.</p> <p>I thank Deputy O'Reilly for raising those screening matters.  I will come back to her directly on the cases she has raised with me.  </p> <p> The Office of Government Procurement, OGP, has been considering how to support a co-ordinated approach to the resumption of public sector construction projects.  This has resulted in the publication of notes providing guidance, which are available on the its website.  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, has statutory responsibility for the delivery of the national children's hospital.  Health and safety on the construction site, including workforce health and safety, is the responsibility of the main contractor.  Construction-related work on the site of the hospital stopped on 31 March due to the restrictions.  Health and safety is a priority for everyone working on the new hospital and the reopening of the construction site needs to be carried out safely and in compliance with regulations, in the interests of the well-being of those working on the site, members of staff, visitors to St. James's Hospital and local residents.  The NPHDB has been informed by the main contractor that it is currently updating the construction stage health and safety plan in preparation for the reopening of the site.  A date for the resumption of construction works has yet to be finalised.  When the site reopens, it is expected that work will resume on a phased basis to accommodate social distancing.  </p> <p> It is too early to fully assess the impact of health and safety requirements associated with Covid-19 on the new national children's hospital.  Unlike others in this Chamber, I do not think we should pick figures out of the air at random and throw them out there.  We need to see the impact of the safety measures.  </p></speech>

We are going to pay for it.  I wish to quote a text message I received from a cousin of mine, shortly after her father passed away in a nursing home:</p> <blockquote> 	Is it the case that nursing homes were hit so hard because patients, some already showing signs of Covid-19 were transferred out of hospital to free up beds?  They were not only moved once &ndash; in some cases they were kept for 2 weeks in one home and transferred on.  You can understand my alarm. </blockquote>  <p>I received this message on 26 April.  I indicated to my cousin that I would ask that question and I did.  I asked HSE officials during a Zoom meeting.  They said that the testing regime meant that nobody was transferred out until they had two negative test results.  I asked the Minister about this in the Chamber at my next opportunity.  I understand that work is ongoing and I appreciate that he has been talking to people in nursing homes.  The reason I have quoted this text message to him is that I want to make it clear to him that families want answers.</p><p>Yesterday evidence was given by representatives of private nursing homes.  The same issues exist in both public and the private homes.  It seems that there was no plan.  Mr. Tadhg Daly said: &quot;The point we have been continuously making is that given the vulnerability of the age profile and the complexity of care of older persons, there should have been a national plan&quot;.  He maintains that these people were categorised as low risk.  On 10 March, a request was made to the HSE and the Department of Health for all patients to be tested, risk assessed and medically assessed.  I cannot tell my cousin whether this was done, but I know what she believes.  We have spoken about this several times.</p><p>Many of those families felt somewhat vindicated by what was said here yesterday.  They had been told that this could not have happened, or had been shown graphs to show that it could not have happened that way.  These families cannot be dismissed.  They are real people.  This family wants to know how this virus got into the nursing home when they could not visit their father.  They had to wait outside.  They observed all of the rules and they believe the staff did their best and followed best practice.  However, on 10 March, when the nursing home sector was looking for guidance and assurance that people would be tested, it was not forthcoming.  I note that there are now more than 400 delayed discharges in the acute hospital sector.  There is a possibility that those people will be transferred <i>en masse.  </i>Can the Minister make a commitment that in the event of this happening, this testing will be carried out? </p></speech>

I extend my sympathies to her cousin on her loss and I thank the Deputy for sharing the text message.  I can only imagine what a traumatic time this must be.  I understand what the Deputy is saying and I do not want to show a graph or a chart or be cold in my response.  These are valid questions.  However, I note that the first cluster in a nursing home occurred on 16 March.  The first case in Ireland was 29 February.</p> <p>People are now looking back to January and February as though there was a knowledge and understanding of this virus when perhaps there simply was not one here or in many other places.  I heard the Minister of State, Jim Daly, say there should have been a plan, but there was and there is.  There is a national plan, for starters, but on top of that national standards for infection prevention and control of antimicrobial stewardship for nursing homes were published and adopted in September 2018 that every nursing home in the country is meant to adhere to.  There was a meeting with Paul Reid, the HSE CEO, on Covid preparedness on 19 February and a meeting with the Minister of State on 28 February-----</p></speech>

The Deputy can indeed.  Interim guidance on transfer between care facilities was circulated to NHI on 10 March and there was an agreement to provide PPE on 12 March.  I do not wish to use the Deputy's time going through all of this but I reject her assertion.  Some 400 pages of correspondence show there was an awful lot of contact between incredible people in the HSE, the Department and nursing homes.</p></speech>

As general secretary of the largest representative organisation for mental health workers, he is surely well placed to make such an appraisal of the past few years of the Government's and the political establishment's approach to the system.  I join his call.</p>  <p>  This crisis has highlighted not just the gaps in our services, which are plain to see for anyone who cared, but also the failure of the outgoing Government to do anything meaningful about them.  It is generous to say the Government did the bare minimum during the austerity years but the damage done in the wake of that austerity is simply not good enough.  For years, the Government has misled the House, the public and campaigners for mental health funding with delays, retractions and re-announcements.  The costs have been far greater than the money needed to boost services or the false economy of savings on our vital health services.  Mental health represented just 6% of planned health funding before this crisis.  Unfortunately, I do not have enough time to go through all the issues but I will ask three brief questions.</p>  <p>  We need to publish the refresher report on the A Vision for Change strategy.  This is something the Government has talked about for almost five years, and it has used it as a smokescreen for an in-depth public assessment of the system, as would be done by a full, permanent mental health committee.  The previous Government wound up the temporary Joint Committee on Future of Mental Health Care in 2018 and has ignored its recommendations.  I ask the Minister to publish the report now.  It was carried out under his time and reflects the reality of the services under his time, and he must take ownership of that.  He must also ensure that any Government negotiations deal properly with mental health and that the public can be informed to scrutinise adequately any proposed Government on mental health.  The Minister has the report and told me he would leave it to the next Government.  I ask him to publish it now.  There is cross-party agreement on the matter.</p>  <p>  I also want to raise the effect of Covid-19 on our mental health services.  Mental health staff must be provided with adequate PPE and safe and secure working conditions to protect themselves and those in their care.  Social distancing presents serious issues in an overstretched, understaffed and overcrowded system.  This cannot be done effectively and safely with the problems the system has faced due to years of neglect.  The Mental Health Commission has expressed grave concerns about the delays in testing in the mental health settings, and it was only one month ago that all mental health staff were required to be tested, despite working with many high-risk and vulnerable people in crowded conditions.</p>  <p>  Finally, I raise the problem of precarious work conditions for mental health professionals in the community and voluntary sector.  Those organisations have been fantastic and much needed bodies for people who cannot access public services that, in too many cases, do not exist in their communities.  Mental healthcare is not a charity.  It is the right of the people and the duty of the State and the public service.  We must protect the vital workers in these organisations and ensure that the expertise is not lost to fundraising difficulties or reorganisation during the crisis, as seen by Pieta House.</p>  <p>  Any new Government needs to take mental health seriously, fund it properly and heed Peter Hughes's words.  I have asked all parties to join together to form an Oireachtas mental health forum to support the permanent mental health committee.  This is vital.</p></speech>

Many of these cleaners work as front-line workers in hospitals and care facilities in the battle against Covid-19 and they were expecting a 40 cent pay rise at the beginning of March, which would have brought their hourly rate of pay to just &euro;11.20 per hour.  According to SIPTU, which represents these workers, contract cleaning companies have reneged on this pay rise, which had previously been agreed on proposal.  The decision to withhold this pay rise beggars belief.  Contract cleaners who are putting their lives on the line while working in our hospitals are paid just &euro;10.80 per hour.  One of these workers has already lost his life due to Covid-19.  Hundreds more are affected.  SIPTU negotiated the 40 cent increase in good faith with employers.  I understand that the Irish Contract Cleaning Association is now refusing to implement this pay increase.  The Irish Contract Cleaning Association, which represents all the big cleaning companies in the State, needs to immediately honour the 40 cent per hour increase, backdated to March, and to apologise to those employees.  The issue again highlights what happens when good public jobs are privatised.  Cleaners employed directly by hospitals are paid at least &euro;3.20 per hour more than those employed by private cleaning companies who also have no pension or sick pay entitlements.</p>  <p>  I have spoken recently with a worker in University Hospital Limerick who told me that she worked 37 hours overtime last week at double pay, and yet the hospital does not hire staff.  That 37 hours at double pay would hire two staff members.  I put it to the Minister, but perhaps it is a question for the next Government, that there needs to be a major review of those privatised services when we come out of this Covid-19 emergency, with the aim of bringing them back under direct hospital contracts that would be better for workers and cheaper for taxpayers.</p>  <p>  I have two questions for the Minister on separate issues.  The trolley crisis at University Hospital Limerick, which I raised constantly with the Minister in the last D&aacute;il, is coming back again.  There are 29 people waiting on trolleys there today.  What will the Minister do specifically about those people on trolleys?  How will they practise physical distancing while they are waiting?  In response to a parliamentary question tabled by my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, on the issue of private hospitals, the Ministers said that Bon Secours Hospital Limerick, which is located at the old Barrington's Hospital site, had only 1% utilisation under the plan agreed with private hospitals.  Will the Minister explain the reasons for that?</p></speech>

I too would like to see that agreement honoured.</p>  <p>  On the Bon Secours Hospital Limerick, they are the figures I gave to Deputy O'Reilly.  The updated figures I have today show 30% of inpatient beds now being used in the Bon Secours Hospital Limerick.  I will forward a refreshed table to Deputies Quinlivan and O'Reilly.  I remain committed to the development projects at University Hospital Limerick and to getting them opened as soon as they are ready.  I take on board the issues made to me in this House and in other fora by Deputies Quinlivan, Kelly, O'Donnell and Leddin that we cannot see a return to the overcrowding there.</p>  <p>  I wish to be clear for the benefit of Deputy Buckley that the Government did not wind up any committee.  The Government does not have the ability to do that.  It is a matter for the Oireachtas to decide what committees to set up.  I take seriously Deputy Buckley's work in the area of mental health.  It is my intention that A Vision for Change will be published in June.  If I am still in office I will do it in June and if not I hope the new Government will.  We have provided additional funding to the &euro;8 million with &euro;1.1 million also allocated for online counselling services.  The issues raised by Deputy Buckley on mental health are important.  Peter Hughes has a degree of expertise in this and I thank him for the work of his members during the pandemic.</p></speech>

I live less than half a mile from one of the biggest of those private hospitals, the Bon Secours Hospital Cork.  There is a view, communicated to me through much correspondence, that there is underutilisation of many of these facilities.</p> <p>I know that a decision is to be taken in the next few days about extending that beyond the end of June.  Will the Minister clarify how we can make more efficient use of those facilities over the next four weeks?  If we wish to retain all or some of those facilities after 30 June, can we put in place a process which will allow some people back into providing the care that they were providing?  I have a case of an 11 year old boy with autism.  It is an intellectual disability and he is non-verbal.  He needs urgent care.  He had a programme of care but that stopped because the consultant he was under did not sign the category A contract.  Will the Minister provide some clarification on that?  Will a decision be made on this matter in the next few days?  If so, can we get an indication of how we can progress making more efficient use of those 2,000 beds?</p></speech>

That is thanks to the incredible efforts of the Irish people.</p>  <p>  It is clear that we are going to require additional capacity for the foreseeable future, however.  Even providing non-Covid care services is going to be much more difficult now.  One will have to keep vacant beds in public hospitals.  One cannot go back to having massive numbers of people on trolleys.  Accordingly, we will have to keep some additional capacity.  I have an open mind on how we arrange that.  One could look to finesse or improve agreements in that regard.  The Cabinet will consider this on Friday.</p>  <p>  We have seen the relocation of a number of services from public hospitals to private.  For example, with medical oncology services, there has been the relocation of day wards from St. Vincent's public to St. Vincent's private, Tullamore to the Hermitage, Waterford and Wexford to Whitfield and Kilkenny to Aut Even Hospital.  Urgent surgical oncology services have moved from the Mater public to the Mater private, from Galway to the Galway Clinic, from St. James's to Blackrock and from Waterford to Whitfield.  There are real benefits to non-Covid services which are now beginning to be ramped up.</p>  <p>  This is the Deputy's point about how we make better use of that capacity now that we have the virus in a very different place to where it could have been.</p></speech>

As the Minister is aware, a 60-bed block there has been under construction since the start of the year.  In addition to that, as part of a Covid response, another 48 beds have been earmarked for UHL which brings that up to 98 beds in total.  Of the 48 additional beds, 14 are due to be completed and opened in June with 24 beds opened in July.  In addition, another 24 beds are to be provided in Croom for completion in July as well.  Will the Minister give an assurance that resources will be in place to ensure UHL can recruit the necessary staff in order that these units are open when completed?  As the Minister will be well aware, Limerick and the mid-west region has a bed capacity issue outside of Covid.  I am looking for a reassurance about resources.  I know the buildings are under way which is great news for Limerick.  However, will the resources be in place to ensure staff can be recruited and be in place when the 122 beds are completed at the units in UHL and Croom?</p></speech>

I visited it quite a while ago.  I am delighted to see it is progressing and nearing completion.</p></speech>

The short answer to the Deputy's question is "Yes".  We will need all of the additional capacity we can get.  I will give the Deputy a commitment that it is the intention of my Department to ensure those beds are fully funded and can open as quickly as possible.  Of the 48, 24 are due to be ready to be opened in June and the other 24 in July.  I will look into the opening of those in Croom.</p></speech>

I thank the people of Ireland for the work they have done to help effectively flatten the curve.  I wish to bring the thoughts of many of my constituents to the Chamber.  The 2 m rule has been mentioned already and I know that a meeting between the Chief Medical Officer and Cabinet is ongoing as I speak.  It is something many people are beginning to articulate and while I understand that we will take the advice of the Chief Medical Officer, it is an issue that needs to be brought to the D&aacute;il Chamber.</p>  <p>  We have been dealing with Covid for a long time now but the health service is continuing to work away.  I was coming back from the D&aacute;il last Wednesday night and ended up in Sligo University Hospital.  Everything is fine and despite what people say, politicians do have hearts.  I thank the ambulance staff, the clinical nurse co-ordinators, the doctors and all the staff in Sligo University Hospital.  The work they are doing is absolutely incredible.  I was very proud and thankful for my experience late on Wednesday night.  We are very fortunate to have such dedicated professional service staff who are doing tremendous work.  I was asked to bring their thoughts to the Minister today, and I will be talking to him off the record as well.  I again thank the staff at Sligo University Hospital and all the front-line staff around the country.  I saw first hand the work they do.  I ask the Minister to elaborate on the issue I raised.</p></speech>

One cannot keep a good man down.  I am pleased he is well and that he had a good experience in our health service.  I join him in paying tribute to the staff in Sligo University Hospital, and the paramedics as well.  I had the pleasure of visiting Sligo University Hospital some time last year.  There are exciting plans in place in terms of capital redevelopment, as well as plans for the hospice facility in Sligo.  It is a very well-run hospital but it is in need of significant extra capacity and that is something we are going to have to work on together in the weeks and months ahead.</p>  <p>  On the 2 m rule versus a 1 m rule, as the Deputy rightly said, we will be guided by public health advice.  It is very clear that if someone is 2 m away from me, there is a 99% chance that he or she has a degree of protection if I cough or sneeze.  If that person is 1 m away, he or she will still have protection, but not as much.  Let us be honest; there will be some sectors in which 2 m of distance will not be possible and we will have to look at how we can put other mitigating measures in place there.  It would be hard to get one's hair cut from 2 m away, for example.  We will have to look at those sectors in other ways, but the general public health advice is that our citizens should follow the 2 m rule as much as possible.  It is the best way of disrupting transmission of the virus.  Very interesting research is being done on this issue in the Mater Hospital, as was shown on RT&Eacute; last night.  It is very hard for the droplets to carry further than 2 m.</p></speech>

I want to talk to the Minister about Limerick.  There is concern in my city and county at the rise in trolley numbers at University Hospital Limerick, UHL.  While I acknowledge the Minister's response to my constituency colleague, Deputy Quinlivan, many people locally have questions about the spare capacity in Barrington's hospital and why it is not being used.  I do not want to make a political issue of it, but I plead with the Minister to give this House and the public some cause for hope.  In recent years, the issue of overcrowding has been very damaging for confidence in the health service in the mid-west and while people have been very understanding of hospital workers throughout this pandemic, we need optimism that the situation can be solved in both the short and long terms.  If we continue to make progress in reducing the spread of Covid-19, does the Minister expect the trolley numbers in UHL to return to pre-Covid levels in the coming months?</p></speech>

I pay tribute to the staff in UHL, led by chief executive, Ms Colette Cowan, and clinical director, Dr. Gerry Burke, for the excellent work they do.  It is a hospital, and a hospital group, that does not have adequate capacity relative to the size of the population, which will not come as news to anybody.  I do not want to use up all the time but, as we have been discussing, there are now exciting and ambitious plans to try and grow that capacity.  There will be a 60-bed ward block.  I am looking at Deputy Kelly because he regularly raises this issue with me.  There will be an additional 48 beds in UHL and 24 in Croom Hospital.  I saw the latest figures for the Bon Secours Hospital in Limerick and it is true that there was only 2% inpatient occupancy in the week 11 May to 15 May.  That increased to 30% in the week 18 May to 22 May.  In light of Deputy Leddin raising the matter, I will specifically seek an update from the HSE on the utilisation of that capacity.</p>  <p>  I do not want UHL to be allowed to go back to the significant overcrowding issue it had.  That was not a fault of its own but rather of decades of failure to deliver additional bed capacity.  I argue that we have put the plans for that capacity in place but we need it to come on stream as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

I highlight the issue of section 39 service providers to disability and intellectual disability service users.  It is commendable how they have adapted so quickly to the changed set of circumstances and how they have managed to keep Covid-19 infection at bay but they are now facing a dual challenge of the cost incurred due to risk of infection coupled with a perfect storm of underfunding and a 1% efficiency cut imposed by the HSE.  It is simply not feasible for section 39 providers to take hit after hit and be expected to provide the same high level of care that is, in many circumstances, beyond a basic social care model.  Those providers need the support of the Minister and the Government to deal with the additional costs.  Will section 39 providers be compensated for expenses incurred as a result of this pandemic, including the purchase of PPE, taking on agency staff and other costs?</p>  <p>  Thanks to the collective efforts of front-line staff, all agencies, the Minister, the Government and the people of Ireland, we have managed to suppress the spread of the virus in the community.  We have prevented the overwhelming of our healthcare system.  We now face the new crisis of ever-growing waiting lists for non-Covid hospital appointments.  Waiting lists were at a critical level in the public system for some time before the pandemic and that point is now also being reached in the private system.  I seek the support of the Minister to design an element of flexibility within the arrangement between private hospitals, consultants and the HSE.  Even at this stage as we, hopefully, exit the health phase of the crisis, we can offer an opportunity for consultants and private hospitals to again see their patients, to deal with non-Covid patients in the public system and to build capacity once again to reduce those waiting lists.</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned my constituency and Aut Even Hospital in Kilkenny which is running at between 33% and 36% bed capacity.  Healthcare staff want to do their jobs and reduce the burden on services.  We do not know if there will be a second wave of Covid-19 coupled with a winter flu later this year and we need to prepare for that.</p>  <p>  Will he come to an arrangement to urgently allow a degree of flexibility for consultants to see their patients?  There were, as I understand it, proposals around B and C contracts to build in that flexibility but they were denied at the time.</p>  <p>  Will he provide the House with an update on the commencement of videofluoroscopy scans at Temple Street Hospital?  Many families are awaiting vital scans for their children while Temple Street is awaiting clear direction from the HSE to recommence scans.</p>  <p>  Is there a case to be made for the provision of PPE to allow an opportunity to family members and loved ones of patients in a hospice setting where there is no virus to pay a final visit and say goodbye?  My understanding is that this is currently not the case and that direction is required from the HSE and NPHET regarding family visits to hospice settings.</p>  <p>  I tabled a question, No. 380, to the Minister on the Covid channel on 27 April.  In response, the Minister referred the matter to the HSE for answer.  It is now a calendar month later.  I have followed up on the matter twice and still have received no response.  Is it not important when a roadmap to our country's recovery is based on statistical information that we know how many people were referred for testing because they presented with symptoms but were never tested, or tested too late to give a positive result?  Does the Minister agree that the prevalence of referral without follow-up has led to a lack of public confidence in the HSE's capacity to test in a timely manner and will he explain the delay in the HSE's provision of this data?</p> <p>I wish to commend the network of community sewists across the island who are making and distributing DIY cloth face masks to vulnerable groups.  Will the Department run television advertisement campaigns to highlight their effective use and washing?  Will the Department advocate for more widespread use of cloth masks?</p> <p> Finally, can the Minister provide the House with an update regarding progress towards achieving a second cath lab for University Hospital Waterford?  The deficits within the south east have been well documented and the region needs absolute clarity on this matter.</p></speech>

First, I had a meeting with the Disability Action Coalition, the Disability Federation of Ireland and the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers in respect of a number of the issues that the Deputy has raised regarding disability funding.  There are three elements to it.  First, there is the 1% efficiency cut, saving or whatever one wishes to call it that they were meant to achieve this year.  Being blunt and honest, they will not be in a position to achieve it and I have made that clear to them.  We need to look at how we can formalise that and provide them with peace of mind in that regard in the coming days.  Second, there is the issue of Covid costs.  They have experienced Covid costs.  They have done an incredible job of adapting their services.  I have heard from them and from service users, particularly of the use of technology, which is something we will want to keep.  My Department would like to support them in meeting the Covid costs like we have for other sectors.  The third element is we need to see the full implementation of the Catherine Day report.  That will be a job for the next Government.  It should feature prominently in any programme for Government and this House should make sure that it happens.</p>  <p>  In relation to private hospitals, we need to be intelligent enough to say when the situation changes in terms of the route of the virus that we need to show our flexibility but I need to be clear the HSE's view is that it will require that capacity, and that is my view too.  That is how we make sure we get that right in addressing the issues the Deputy raises.</p>  <p>  I must come back to the Deputy on the video fluoroscopy scans in Temple Street.  I am not familiar with that but I will come back to the Deputy on it.</p>  <p>  On the issue of visitor restrictions for hospices or for nursing homes, as I stated earlier the National Public Health Emergency Team will look at this.  It cannot be beyond us as a country to work out ways of ensuring visits on compassionate grounds.  One can get sick of loneliness.  It has been a lonely and long time for people.  Obviously, I am acutely aware of the issue the Deputy raises regarding people in hospices.</p>  <p>  I am very sorry and angered that the Deputy has not received a response one month later.  I will follow that up for the Deputy.</p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of face coverings, I am a big believer in these.  There is now public health guidance that one should wear face coverings on public transport and in indoor areas where it might be difficult to socially distance.  We use the term, as the Deputy did, "face coverings", instead of "face masks", and that is intentional.  It is easy to make these at home.  We have advertisements to do that but so far these are on social media.  I take the point that a wider public awareness campaign could be useful.  I will take that up with the HSE.</p>  <p>  On the issue of University Hospital Waterford and the cath lab, which is an issue I get asked about a lot, I will send the Deputy an up-to-date note because I do not have the information at the top of my head.  The development of a second cath lab is funded and under way.  It is crucial that Waterford has a second cath lab before it can provide a 24-7 service.  There is a national cardiac review under way which will inform whether to provide a 24-7 service, and in what parts of the country too.  I will return to the Deputy in writing on that.</p></speech>

The fact is it is the most discriminated hospital in Ireland.  The region is discriminated against, with the lowest amount of beds, consultants, nurses etc.  The plan, not only the beds, needs to happen.  The Minister complimented Ms Colette Cowen and Dr. Gerry Burke and I thank him for doing so.  The Minister might also wish the same Dr. Gerry Burke, probably the most publicly-oriented clinical aide I have ever met in my life, the best on his retirement tomorrow.</p>  <p>  I have six questions for the Minister.  I will list them off and give the Minister time to answer them.  On nursing homes, the 400 pages of documents and the famous letter that everyone is talking about that the Department received from HIQA, the Minister might send us a copy of that letter but also might tell us when he himself read it.  The Minister stated yesterday that the Department read it when it arrived and passed it on straight away.  I accept that but when did the Minister himself actually read it?  We need to correlate outbreaks versus that document.  We need to see whether HIQA was on the money with its concerns.  I am sure the Minister has done that already.</p> <p>It would not have required a huge exercise by anyone in the Department to correlate the information.  Has it been done?  If not, it is bizarre.  When I was a Minister sitting where the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, is sitting now, one of the first things I would have asked yesterday was whether we could see what happened in all the nursing homes listed in the letter and about which we are concerned.  The Minister might tell us the position on that.  He should please tell me he has done what I have mentioned.</p> <p> My next question is very direct.  Regarding the nursing homes that have had outbreaks, was the Minister's Department or the HSE made aware of any care concerns beyond those related to Covid but arising from patients having to be transferred or nursing homes having to be taken over because of Covid?  I will leave that with the Minister.</p> <p> I have a straight question on private hospitals.  Given the work of a number of Deputies, including me and Deputy Shortall, does the Minister believe it is a good idea, in order to fast-forward the bed capacity we all know we need under Sl&aacute;intecare, to nationalise some of the hospitals?  It is a straight question demanding a straight answer.  I am not saying a Government would approve the proposal but I want to know what the Minister for Health believes.  He obviously knows my views on it.</p> <p> On cancer screening, which I always speak about, I presume the Minister has measured the changes in outcomes.  I refer to issues relating to morbidity, delayed outcomes, delayed diagnoses, etc., because screening is not happening.  Could we have a table for each month?  I presume this work is ongoing.</p> <p> With regard to the famous children's hospital, which has not gone away, what is the Department's current estimated cost?  I presume the work is continuous.  As of today, what is the estimated cost?</p> <p> The Minister announced a change regarding the vaccine recently.  I still do not understand why we are not just giving the vaccine to everyone for free for the coming year.  It would be cost-effective.  The Government does not even have to commit to providing it every year.  It could be provided just next year, and maybe the year after.  I would prefer it to be every year.  Why will the Minister not commit to it?  Considering that we are always talking about public health, and presuming every single person in NPHET believes in vaccination, why could the Minister not ask NPHET to consider it?   Given that we go to NPHET for so much, all I am proposing to the Minister is that we ask it whether this would be a good idea.  Must I write to it myself?  Will the Minister please ask NPHET whether it would be a good idea and appropriate to introduce free vaccination for everybody in the country so we will not have to deal with both the normal flu epidemic and Covid in the coming year?</p> <p> My final question relates to the National Maternity Hospital.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the concerns Dr Peter Boylan has been expressing.  While the facility, worth &euro;500 million, is very much needed, are we 100% certain there is no issue in regard to the letter that has been sent from the Vatican regarding the transfer of ownership and allowing for the alienation and transfer of the lands to a secular body?  I fully hope the information I have is true.  Can the Minister confirm it is the case and that it is his interpretation?  As far as I am concerned, it will be a first from the Vatican, so we are creating history.  Could the Minister please confirm this?</p></speech>

What I wish to say in this regard is important.  I would like these documents to be shared with the Covid committee.  I am aware the Deputy asked for the documents concerning Nursing Homes Ireland and the Department.  I would have thought it important for the Deputy to have the documents involving the Department and HIQA also.  That is quite important; it is actually more important.</p> <p>On 13 March, HIQA wrote to the Department of Health about 19 HSE nursing homes that had been identified as having multi-occupancy rooms, which created challenges for infection prevention.  This was sent on to the HSE.  Dr. Colm Henry, Mr. David Walsh and other really good people in the HSE were doing work, recognising that multi-occupancy rooms make it harder to contain the spread of the virus, as the Deputy can imagine.  HIQA did that.  I believe there is a lack of clarity in one respect; on 31 March, NPHET asked HIQA if it would assess all nursing homes for risk.  NPHET made this request of HIQA, which is represented on NPHET, if that makes sense.  HIQA carried out this assessment.  It produced a document of two and a half pages which I have here and which we will publish.  I will not read it all because I will not then be able to answer other questions.  One part of it said that in the context of managing the Covid-19 outbreak, HIQA estimated that 124 public and private nursing homes, out of a total of 580 nursing homes, would potentially need some level of additional support.  This list was shared with the HSE.  In addition, the provider was mandated to report any Covid-19 outbreak to the chief inspector and to share an updated status report to include a risk assessment with the HSE each morning.  The Deputy should have time to read this document and can then come back with further questions but that is the status with regard to HIQA-----</p></speech>

I asked only today for that correlation to be considered.  We thought in the same way in that regard.  The question the Deputy put to me as to whether there are any other concerns makes me believe he has an answer which I am not aware of.  He will need to be clearer on this question to me because I do not quite understand it.  I would welcome clarity in that regard.</p>  <p>  On the issue of private hospitals, I am in favour of creating a universal healthcare system in line with Sl&aacute;intecare.  That is my view as Minister for Health.  I am not in favour of compelling the nationalisation of all private hospitals.</p></speech>

My current priority, however, is providing for the needs of the HSE with regard to capacity.  We should be clear that we will need that capacity beyond the end of June.  That is my very strong view.</p>  <p>  With regard to cancer screening, I met representatives of the national cancer control programme - I believe it was yesterday, it was certainly this week - to initiate a conversation about screening.  I have spoken to Ms Anne O'Connor, chief operations officer of the HSE, and Dr. Colm Henry.  I have asked that the screening roadmap be a part of the non-Covid framework which the HSE is due to publish within the next week.  I spoke to the CEO and chairman of the HSE about this matter again this morning.  I will ask that information be made available.  I do not have it but it is fair for the Deputy to request it.</p>  <p>  On the national children's hospital, the cost remains the same.  I am running tight on time but, as I said earlier on, the impact of health and safety measures relating to Covid-19 on the cost of many capital projects is not yet known.  It certainly requires an in-depth look rather than a representative of the construction industry just deciding in this Chamber what it will look like and then having to retract that.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the flu vaccine, I will ask NPHET, as the Deputy has requested.</p>  <p>  I cannot give the Deputy the assurance he requests in respect of the National Maternity Hospital because I am in the middle of a global pandemic.  I welcome the fact that a letter has issued from the nuns but the matter will have to go through due diligence and proper scrutiny and return to the Government before it is decided to proceed.  I outlined very clearly the tests I want to see met before the hospital project proceeds.  Those tests still apply.  I welcome the letter but it needs to be legally and robustly scrutinised.</p></speech>

The first related to infection control reports.  HIQA had carried out annual assessments and repeat offenders came to light - nursing homes about which there were particular concerns.  We were told by the chief inspector that this list was sent to the Department in February and March and drew attention to HIQA's concerns in respect of Covid and poor infection control standards.  The Minister made reference to 13 March.  It was said that this letter was sent to him in February and in March.  That is when these details were sent to him.  This date, 13 March, was within the first two weeks of the virus arriving here.  Will the Minister tell us what action was taken on foot of this letter?  It was flagged to him that HIQA had serious concerns about 19 nursing homes.</p> <p>Can he be more explicit about what was done at that stage?  Surely alarm rings should have started to ring.</p> <p> The second question I posed to Mr. Quinn was in relation to a point HIQA has been making consistently, which is that it had serious concerns about the lack of clinical oversight of the nursing home sector, and private nursing homes in particular.  When I put the question to him about what he did with those concerns, he said he would have been in touch with the Department on several occasions in relation to them.  I am asking the Minister what happened in response to those concerns being raised about the manner in which the nursing home sector operates and the fact, in an extraordinary way, that there is no clinical oversight of private nursing homes catering for the most vulnerable in our population.  What did his Department do, if anything, in response to those serious concerns being raised?  Perhaps he will come in on those two questions before I move on to the next.</p></speech>

Regarding correspondence from HIQA, I will have to check what was received in February, because my note says 13 March.  I will revert to the Deputy on that and I am not doubting what Mr. Quinn said.</p></speech>

I do not mean it in any sort of smart way when I suggest that it will not come as a surprise to anybody in the Department or the HSE that multi-occupancy rooms have extra infection prevention challenges.  On the same day, 13 March, that information was sent on to the HSE.  Dr. Colm Henry wrote back to the Department in April stating:</p> <blockquote> 	Please forgive the delay in providing you with a response.  As you know, our engagements with you on the issue have been ongoing since then.  I appreciate the items requested are now discussed daily but I would like to share the requested information with you. </blockquote>  <p>He went on to say:</p> <blockquote> 	Regarding the list of HIQA-identified residential centres with multi-occupancy rooms, I can assure you that all centres mentioned in your communication are included in the ongoing implementation of the specific capital plan for the redevelopment.  Progress has been made to enhance these environments.  At the time your query was received... </blockquote>  <p>Dr. Henry then goes through each of the items.  In the interests of time, I will share the letter with the Deputy rather than going through them all now.  There were very clear actions taken.</p></speech>

It is a long-known fact - indeed, the Sl&aacute;intecare plan speaks very much to this - that there is a lack of integration between our nursing homes, be they public or private, and the HSE in general.  I am not sure GPs and others would fully accept the view that there is no clinical involvement or governance, but I do think it is a shortcoming in relation to the long-term residential care setting in Ireland and it is something that needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

The other issue I want to raise is the question of mental health services and the review or refresh of A Vision for Change.  Several of us have raised this with the Minister previously and he has responded that while the review was completed and passed by Government and all of that, going back to December or January, that it is not his intention to publish the review because he would be criticised for it.</p> <p>Today, a letter was sent to the Minister from representatives of Fianna F&aacute;il, Sinn F&eacute;in, the Green Party, the Social Democrats and, afterwards, a couple of the Independent groups calling on him to publish the review of A Vision for Change.  I have just received word that the Minister of State, former Deputy Jim Daly, has also written to the Minister urging him to publish it.  The Minister has political support for doing it and I put it to him that given the urgency of the situation with mental health services he should commit to publishing the review.  Everybody wants him to do it and nobody is going to complain or criticise him for doing so.  Will the Minister commit today to publishing it immediately?</p> <p> The reason I am saying it must happen immediately is that, apart from the fact that there has been a delay of several months, we are facing a situation where the level of mental health problems is huge at this point not only with regard to ongoing issues in mental health but also with regard to Covid-specific issues that are arising across the population.  We know that is the case in every age group.  There are major levels of stress for older people cocooning and for those in nursing homes.  There is also stress with the impact of Covid-19 on family members.  There is stress for front-line workers.  Given the nature of their jobs, they are under enormous pressure and stress, which result in issues with mental health.  In the case of young people, in particular, there is the fact that there are big question marks over their futures, their education, the restrictions on their social lives and so forth.  Covid-19 is having a major negative impact on people's mental health across the population.  For that reason it is extremely important that the review of A Vision for Change is published as a matter of urgency, the implementation group is established and the group draws up an immediate response to the immediate problems arising from Covid-19 and also the medium-term and longer-term responses.  I strongly urge the Minister to publish it immediately.</p></speech>

It has not been brought to the Government.  It has been brought to a Cabinet committee but it has not been approved by the Government.  Frankly, I find it hard to mount an argument to what the Deputy said.  I will give a commitment to revert to the Deputy by the end of this week and see if it is possible to bring it to the Government, as I will have to get permission to do that.  I believe an early and quick publication of this is important for the reasons the Deputy has outlined.  Mental Health Reform makes the point, and I am not trying to speak for the organisation, that it does not wish to see another <i>ad hoc</i>or willy-nilly process put in place.  It wants it to be aligned with A Vision for Change.  That makes sense and its representatives told me that when I met them.</p><p>I have not seen the letter from the parties and groups, but I will respond to it by the end of this week with a view to seeing if I can get permission to bring it to the Government immediately.</p></speech>

The Minister will appreciate that many different proposals are being made by people because there is such anxiety to have an immediate response to the largescale mental health problems that are emerging now, as we can see around us.  There is no point in setting up task forces, sub-committees or the like.  It should be the main implementation body for our mental health strategy and it has to be put in place at an early stage.  I welcome the Minister's commitment and look forward to positive news next week.</p></speech>

If we run out of time, I will accept written answers from the Minister.  Earlier I heard one of the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies say it is impossible to get everything right during a pandemic.  Nobody doubts that, but I wish to talk again today about how wrong we got the care of our elderly.  Yesterday showed me that the model of an overwhelmingly private care service for the elderly has utterly failed us.  Where did that go wrong?  It started with a political and policy decision of Fianna F&aacute;il, supported by Mary Harney and with a tax break given by Charlie McCreevy, which was continually implemented by successive Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments.  A study by Julien Mercille shows that investors in the sector were attracted by the opportunity to avail of tax breaks rather than an interest in, or an understanding of, the dynamics of the care of older persons.</p> <p>Multiple health Ministers, from Mary Harney to the Minister, Deputy Harris, have advocated and encouraged a regime where international investors were attracted to building and running private nursing homes.  Ironically, it was a Deputy from the Minister's party who pointed out yesterday that this is a lucrative trade attracting the great and the good of the Irish wealthy and international investors with a keen eye for profit.  I refer to companies like Bartra Capital, vulture funds etc., which have recently invested in this lucrative industry but how lucrative it is we do not know because many of them are registered offshore and do not have to publish their accounts.  We do not see the profits they earn or the taxes they pay but we do know from international studies that where private care is given to the elderly, lower standards and poorer care emanate and the staffing levels are generally 20% or more lower in those settings.  That said, I wish to compliment the staff in those settings and thank them very much for the care, extreme courtesy and compassion they showered on the people who lost their lives in those settings.  The tax base and the largesse showered on these investors is not acceptable and, at the same time, this State has cut back the real supports that could have helped to keep people in their homes and their communities.  All of that has been privatised and micromanaged to such a degree that it is impossible for the workers in that sector to look after elderly people in their homes.  We have failed them at every hand's turn because we see elderly people and the provision of pensions as a burden.  As we live longer we see that as a problem rather than something to celebrate but there is nothing surer than we are all going to get older and that we need to think in the future about the way we are delivering the care of the elderly, both in settings and in their homes.</p> <p> The committee meeting yesterday showed that there was a very clear neglect of the need of those homes when the Department of Health was alerted that they lacked staffing, PPE and testing.  We were very slow to deliver that.  To pretend otherwise is a nonsense because as I said yesterday, we passed the parcel from one agency of the State to the other but, in reality, there was a total failure and the eye was taken off the ball.  That is why I repeat the call I made for an independent public inquiry into what has gone on, not to look back in anger or examine who failed who, how and who is not telling the truth, but to learn.  The Minister said here recently that he believes the entire system needs an overhaul.  I doubt that if we sit down and discuss the kind of an overhaul he believes it needs we will agree.  We need a national health service in this country, not a Sl&aacute;intecare but a national health service that is publicly run and publicly funded from the cradle to the grave in order that every aspect of our healthcare is accountable and in the interests of the public and that no individual, vulture fund or set of investors profits from people's health.</p> <p> I have a couple of questions for the Minister.  First, will his expert panel examine how we can achieve that and begin that discussion as soon as possible?  Second, what steps is he and his Department taking to ensure that the homes listed as the most vulnerable by HIQA will be properly staffed and equipped to deal with a possible second wave of Covid-19?  Third, can the Minister confirm the exact date his Department received the list from HIQA of those homes thought to be vulnerable to Covid-19?  It was not clear yesterday from the questions and answers and from the accusations, toing and froing, what exactly happened here.  I am prepared to accept those answers from the Minister in writing.</p></speech>

Last week, 40% of all new Covid-19 cases in the entire country were among meat workers.  That crisis was preventable but the State agencies, and the Ministers responsible, were asleep at the wheel.  Does the Minister agree that it is scandalous that there were zero on-site Health and Safety Authority, HSA, inspections in regard to coronavirus until Monday, 18 May?  More than two months after the pandemic really hit Ireland there were zero inspections on-site despite the fact that there had been close to 300 complaints.  Does he agree that it is inexplicable as to why the Minister responsible for the HSA and the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, Deputy Humphreys, would say last Thursday that she did not know how many meat factories had been inspected at that point in time and that she did not need to know?</p> <p>We were having a special debate in the D&aacute;il about this catastrophic crisis and she did not have any figures and did not think that she needed to.  Does the Minister agree that it is outrageous that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine dismissed concerns raised almost a month ago about meat factories as an attempt to smear factory owners?  Does he agree that we need urgent inspections of meat factories?  This is a significant problem in that only 67 HSA field inspectors have been allocated to deal with coronavirus-related issues.  Where will the needed inspectors come from and when?  I have a second question which I will come back to.</p></speech>

The substantive issue about the 67 inspectors is important.  The Deputy is right that 67 is not an adequate number with the volume of work that we need the HSA to do.  I am pleased to let the Deputy know that my Department will provide approximately 200 environmental health officers to supplement the HSA's work.  We will make sure that they work with the HSA to incorporate compliance with the protocol in its usual programmed inspection activities.  The environmental health service is responsible, among other things, for enforcing food legislation, hence its relationship with the food businesses.  Approximately 45,000 food businesses in the country fall into that category.  Further consideration is also under way with regard to an appropriate public health support to the HSA.  We have significantly increased the number of people working to make sure the protocol is implemented.</p>  <p>  I believe on-site inspections at meat factories are very important for public health and I am pleased that they are now happening.  I am also pleased that there is a national outbreak control team.  I have spoken to the clinician who leads that team.  I am also pleased that between 55% and 60% of people in meat factories who had Covid-19 have recovered and returned to work.  I look forward to that number increasing further.</p></speech>

Will he clarify if all 200 officers who are being allocated by the Department of Health will be engaged in on-site field inspections, and if not, how many will?  That is crucial.  It was reported in the <i>Irish Examiner </i>on 19 May that the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation had assured people that the HSA was getting additional inspectors from the WRC to inspect workplaces.  I do not know if that is still the case or the plan.  I have seen internal emails, which show that the management of the WRC is not planning to redeploy any site inspectors to the HSA.  Due to Covid-19, it has suspended all on-site inspections for its regular work and is instead phoning and emailing employers about employment disputes.  I do not know if the Government is counting on that but it is certainly saying internally that it is not doing that.</p></speech>

They will do so as part of their usual programmed inspections.  Environmental health officers already do that and we are basically saying that they already have a remit for a significant number of businesses, with 45,000 food businesses in the country, and telling them to inspect sites under the Return to Work Safely Protocol.</p></speech>

On 24 April in this House, the Minister expressed to me his wish to see the second Waterford cardiac cath lab built, with a construction tender to be awarded as soon as possible.  Last Thursday in the House, the Taoiseach also committed to seeing this project get over the line while acknowledging the inordinate delay it has suffered since it was first announced on 18 September 2018.  I thank both of them for their public commitment to this project.  This development has suffered inexplicable delays since the Minister's original order to approve it.  In fact, 20 months have elapsed and we have yet to approve a formal build tender for construction.</p> <p>Given the inordinate, unexplained delays, on behalf of the people of Waterford and the south east, will the Minister provide Oireachtas Members from the south east a contact liaison within his Department concerning this project?  The Department has circulated completely new timelines for this development and I believe elected representatives could provide support to ensure that further slippage in proposed delivery schedules are avoided.  I believe everybody in the House understands the significant Covid pressures that are dominating health planning at present.  Appointing a Department liaison available to Oireachtas Members from the south east would deliver enormous comfort to the people of Waterford and the region while we await the second cardiac catheterisation laboratory and the improved standard of regional care it will help to deliver.</p> <p> I refer to other health matters relating to Covid risk and disease management.  On 23 April, I asked in this House why senior nursing staff in residential care settings were not being tasked and trained to take Covid swab tests of residents in their care.  I believe it is happening in a small number of centres, but clearly on-site staff managing that activity would help improve the turnaround times that are so critical to the safe running of residential care homes.  It would also minimise the trauma to vulnerable patients by having invasive swab testing taken by people known to them.  As well as taking patient duress into account, faster response times improve the management of isolation needs and possible staff shortages where self-isolation is required.  Faster test times also reduce the Covid care burden protocols where a negative test result is found.</p> <p> Can we agree that it should not take weeks of deep analysis to decide if we should let nurses nurse?  I know that for some a small amount of training will be required, but I believe every qualified nurse working in residential long-stay and short-stay settings is more than capable of managing this task, and would be happy to do so as a proactive infection-control measure to safeguard the patients in their care.</p> <p> I also highlight another significant headwind affecting the private nursing home sector.  More than 100 small nursing homes are facing insurance renewals over the coming weeks and months.  They have been advised that no business interruption cover or liability cover is on offer for anything Covid-19 related.  Lack of liability cover is a major concern as these operations do not have the financial reserves to protect them against a significant Covid-related injury claim.  Many of these homes are already losing revenue because they are keeping isolation capacity available.  Allowing them to be further unsupported because of our dysfunctional insurance environment will force many to close their doors permanently.  It would be ironic if Government action to save residential care lives could not be harnessed to support these same patients who are at risk of losing their present care facility and their quality of life because of insurable risks.  I ask the Department to seriously look at this matter.</p> <p> The Minister recently announced the creation of a Covid-19 nursing home review panel.  The panel complement does not have a contributing member from the nursing home sector with recent direct and material experience of the challenges that befell nursing homes following the arrival of Covid-19.  As I feel this is a lost opportunity to examine and fully understand the sectoral problems, I ask the Minister to consider the appointment of such a person to this review body.</p> <p> As part of continuing NPHET Covid planning, the Department may wish to extend the private hospitals contract for a further period.  I and other Members of the Regional Group are of the opinion that conditions and terms of this contract need to be reviewed and significantly revised before the Government commits to any further extension.  Given the significant cost involved at &euro;115 million per month, bed occupancy and service activity at private centres must be maximised where currently they are well below available capacity.</p> <p> Although some elective procedures and day case services have been decanted from public hospitals to private hospital settings, these are largely being carried out by public doctors.  This is because a significant number of clinicians, operating as private subcontractors in the private healthcare area, have found themselves presented with changed working conditions to which they cannot agree as they have no offer of recompense for the cost overheads they are forced to carry.</p> <p> The private hospitals deal secures the facilities but not all the staff to provide the clinical services.  These private consultants operate on a fee-per-procedure model, reimbursed by private health insurers, but since this contract was initiated, insurance fees have not been payable for such activity.  This is having a significant effect on both public and private waiting lists as these doctors could be treating both hospital patient streams under the present arrangement if revised.  As a member of the Regional Group, I ask the Minister that if he is minded to extend the private hospitals contract, he should sit down with the private health insurers, VHI, Irish Life and Laya Healthcare, to devise a new temporary service contract arrangement to include these subcontracting clinicians.</p> <p>A new arrangement could ensure both our public and private patient streams can benefit from maximum participation of all medical care givers.</p> <p> As we welcome the continuing phased release from required lockdown measures, many are cognisant of the possibility of a future upsurge in Covid infection rates and a possible increase in hospital activity.  That said, it is fair to state we have learned a great deal about the transmission, management and mitigation options in respect of the disease.  Hopefully that will guide us towards finding appropriate balanced strategies in the future. One analytical tool required for greater understanding of the impact of Covid is the publication of patient range data, by decade of life, for Covid infection rates and clinical outcomes.  The data, purely for statistical analysis, should record just gender, age, care pathway and clinical outcome and would not create any issues in respect of data privilege.  The information is needed to risk-assess future strategy.  I ask the Minister to prevail on NPHET to publish these data to allow greater and wider analysis by our healthcare experts.  </p> <p>  As we get further into 2020, society is coming to terms with living with Covid-19 while we wait for a scientific breakthrough to overcome this virus.  We must begin to rebuild our shattered economy with specific attention on the small and medium-sized enterprise sector.  Possession of these pertinent data will allow both public and private thought leaders contribute to best planning, mitigation and treatment strategies in the future.  It will also allow for more effective public health policy planning and in so doing, hopefully will ensure we will have learned from some of the avoidable mistakes of the past and will have made adequate provision for the future.  </p></speech>

We had quite a good arrangement during the last D&aacute;il, when we were all allowed to meet in person, and I am eager to keep it up, whereby local representatives are brought together to provide us with the benefit of local knowledge and local connections to get this project moving.  I want to see the delivery of the cath lab.  I note the new timelines referred to by the Deputy.  Contractor selection is under way, the tender will be completed during the summer and construction will commence in the autumn.  There cannot be any more slippage - I get that - and we are all eager to see that delivered.</p>  <p>  On testing by nurses in long-term residential care facilities, the Deputy will be glad to know that not only do I agree but so does Dr. Tony Holohan and the HSE.  That will be part of our testing strategy in nursing homes.  We have a lot of extra capacity and how we best use that will be considered further by NPHET at its meeting tomorrow. </p>  <p>  On the insurance industry and the renewal of premiums, I met representatives of Nursing Homes Ireland on this matter, I think during this week.  I asked an official to link with that group.  Nursing Homes Ireland was going to provide examples of nursing homes experiencing challenges in this regard that we then would provide to colleagues in the Department of Finance.  I am also conscious that the Central Bank has a role in this issue from a consumer protection perspective.  I would hate to hear or see any price gouging or any attempt by an insurance company to make a quick buck off the back of nursing homes and, most importantly, the interests of their residents during this pandemic.  We should all keep a very close eye on that.  I certainly intend to.  </p>  <p>  I take the point on the need for expertise on the nursing home expert review panel.  I spoke to the group's chairperson, Professor Cecily Kelleher, a very eminent public health lead, yesterday.  There will be a geriatrician, a senior nurse and a public advocate.  I have made it clear to Professor Kelleher that if she needs further inputs or membership, I will look very favourably on her advice.  One way or another, there will be a significant consultation.</p>  <p>  On private hospitals, as I have already set out, the Government will consider this matter further on Friday.  We will need extra capacity but the question of what is the right agreement in the future is under consideration.</p>  <p>  I will ask the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, if it can provide the information relating to data. </p></speech>

The thing that hurt me and many others the most, which I raised earlier with the Taoiseach, is that people died in nursing homes and hospitals without any family member being with them.  I do not know who made that decision.  We must go forward.  The Government did several things right but there were a number of things that were not done right and this is one of them.</p> <p>This is one thing I feel should not have happened.  My own father died five years ago but I can remember every one of the last hours and minutes that I was with him.  If I was denied being able to be with that man after all the years, or thought that nobody was with him, it would break my heart forever.  I might as well be dead as well.  I feel for all the families that went through this.</p> <p> I ask the Minister to devise a way to let people in to see their family members who are in nursing homes.  I have been asked about that several times, including this morning and yesterday.  What benefit is there in stopping people from visiting their mother or father?  I had another person contact me after lunch today on the same matter.  I ask the Minister to review the situation.  Discussions are going on to assess the benefit of that approach.  I do not think it was of any benefit.  Visiting could have been allowed in a controlled fashion for five, ten or 15 minutes.  That would have kept many people happy.</p> <p> I want to go forward.  We must try to scramble out of the place we are in now to get back to where we were.  We pay a lot of money to the WHO, which says that 1 m social distancing is sufficient.  If the Government does not follow that recommendation,  many places will not go back to where they were.  Many hotels, restaurants and pubs will not open because it is not possible to manage a distance of 2 m in small places.  Rural places are different.  We are told that this pandemic is affecting and will affect rural places more than urban locations such as cities and bigger towns.</p> <p> I heard the Taoiseach say home care packages could be the way to go.  No one asked for an increase in home help hours more than I did in the previous D&aacute;il.  Day after day I asked for it because I know that people really want to spend as long as possible, or even the last days of their lives, in their own homes.  I was glad to hear the Taoiseach say that might be the way to go or that he was considering doing that but the fact is that at the height of the pandemic he cut the home help to many people.  I am sorry about that.  Many of those who worked in the home help area did not get another job.  Perhaps they were being kept back in case they were needed, but the fact is that it did not happen, and many people were left without their home help.  I ask the Minister to restore the home help that was taken from people and to increase the home care packages so that people can remain longer in their homes and have the same people dealing with them.  If that happened, they would not have to go into nursing homes or hospitals.  I ask the Minister to ensure that happens.</p> <p> Testing is not sufficient.  A man got out of his bed at 4 a.m. last Sunday morning and finished up in a hospital.  The doctor said he should be tested but some other official came along and said he could not be tested because he was not being admitted.  That is not an adequate response.</p> <p> Many people were in touch with me to help them get the Covid payment but yesterday and the day before two people contacted me who are trying to get off it.  They must go online to do it but they have no broadband.  They tried to make calls and were kept waiting at the end of the telephone line.  They are like the two fellows who were stuck on the train who wanted to get off at Mallow.  They finished up in Cork because the train was going direct to Cork.  I am sorry, I have gone into my colleague, Deputy Mattie McGrath's, time.</p></speech>

It is shocking.  I know the reason we took them over and now it is time to give them back.  Private health cover is not a privilege in Ireland; it is a necessity, as many middle-income families are not entitled to a medical card.</p> <p>It was right at the time but it is wrong to continue it now.  It is shocking.  I have received figures from a woman from Cork who contacted me about her sister.  Her case is so sad.  For the last 45 years her sister has paid into the private health insurance to cover all hospital stays.  She has never asked the taxpayer to pay for her medical treatment.  She is now 66 years of age and in need of urgent surgery for a stage 3 prolapse which could progress to a stage 4 emergency at any minute.  Her consultant tells her she will have to wait until July or maybe September.  Each day this surgery is delayed means further damage to her body.</p> <p> This is shocking.  There are thousands of cases like this around the country.  It is particularly upsetting at the moment, when private hospitals have the capacity to deal with the situation at no expense to the State.  It is shocking to be blackguarded this way after 45 years paying insurance.  This woman also gave me figures concerning the inpatient beds and bed occupancy in hospitals in Cork.  She has provided the figures for Bon Secours Hospital in the weeks of April 14, April 20, April 28 and May 7.  I hope the Minister is listening to this and knows what is going on.  On April 14, Bon Secours Hospital had 30 occupied beds.  There were 16 the following week, 85 the next week and 103 the next.  That is out of 300 beds.  This is a shocking waste of facilities.</p> <p> Mater Private Hospital Cork has a capacity of 102 beds.  Its counterpart in Dublin is probably worse.  There were six beds occupied one week, 25 another week, 37 the next week and 23 the next.  This is shocking.  Women there are waiting for cervical smear tests.  There are all kinds of checks to be done and private consultants to do them, but they are not being done.  The Government is fighting and wrangling over accounts.  What is going on?  Is this a scamdemic or a pandemic?  I think it is a scam and this is a scam.  People are being bled dry.  They pay &euro;100 a week for health cover and they cannot get it.</p> <p> Another poor man from my own constituency contacted me last night.  Mr. O'Brien is a decent man, a grandfather, father and husband.  He spent 17 years in the Irish Defence Forces.  He attended the accident and emergency department in Clonmel at 11 p.m. last night and was discharged again at 2.30 a.m., having been told that no urologists were available.  He was in excruciating pain.  His family brought him to University Hospital Waterford.  I support the previous speaker on the cath lab for the south east.  Today the family were informed that there is no urologist on duty at University Hospital Waterford due to the current situation.  What is going on in the hospitals?  The authorities suggested transferring him to a care home, without being tested for Covid-19 or anything else.  What is the Government doing?  Is this man no longer fit for a hospital or for treatment because he is 73?  Is he just to be put into a nursing home?  People with the Covid were put into nursing homes and infected all that was inside of them.  That is what the Government did.</p> <p> Ministers and senior officials are being held to account today in the Supreme Court of Spain.  That will have to happen here too.  Wilful waste makes woeful want.  There is blackguardism going on here.</p> <p> I also want to ask the Minister about St. Bridgid's Hospital, a community district hospital in Carrick-on-Suir.  It is a wonderful place.  I have outlined its benefits before.  There are three hospice beds there as well as other beds for convalescing.  They have been commandeered for Covid-19 and now nobody is in there and the lights are out.  When will that be reopened?  When will the families who raised funds for those hospice beds be allowed to see their loved ones in their last moments in hospice care?  That facility has the palliative team to provide this care and an excellent staff and management.</p> <p> Another big fanfare surrounded Our Lady's Health Centre in Cashel.  The Minister saw it a couple of years ago with a group of TDs which included myself.  His jaw dropped when he saw the conditions it was in when empty.  Hey presto.  If Covid-19 would grant one wish, we thought it might open up the beds in Cashel.  There are still no patients in there, despite the groundwork laid outside and the new flowerbeds and kerbs.  What the hell does that have to do with anyone in the hospital?  Now the hospital cannot get curtains.  I heard the Minister on the "Six One News" saying that he could not buy a curtain because the home care shops are closed.  Surely to God the HSE can procure curtains, blinds, or something to put up in the windows to cover them some way.  This is a scamdemic.</p> <p> It costs &euro;200 per test.  I have heard from people who have been tested twice when going into hospital and people who have not been tested at all, as described a moment ago by Deputy Danny Healy-Rae.  The availability of capacity is a matter of the luck of the draw.  People are making a lot of money out of this.  A sum of &euro;200 per test is outrageous.  It is extortion.  It should not be allowed.  I heard from a woman who visited Cork University Hospital.  She was instructed to get a test, which she did.  Three days later she was told that the test was out of date and she should get another one.  That was &euro;400 down the drain, not for her thankfully but for the taxpayers.  Where is this going to stop?  When are we going to get the private hospitals and the consultants back?  We have listened to Professor Michael O'Keefe and many others and to the doctor here in Dublin who resigned because of the blackguarding and the lack of oxygen available for patients in nursing homes.  How can the Minister sleep at night thinking of this?  How can Dr. Holohan and these people introducing these laws?</p> <p> A very close relative of mine attended Cork University Hospital last week and was asked to keep a social distance of 1 m in the hospital.</p></speech>

Perhaps there will not be quite the same level of fire in the belly, as it were, but it is just as heartfelt.  I raised the matter with the Minister last week and about three weeks ago with the Taoiseach.  At the time the contract was put in place with the private hospitals, it was the right thing to do.  In fact, it was the only thing to do.  Circumstances have changed, however, and while we know we could be hit with a second or third wave, we have nonetheless put structures in place to help us contain, hopefully, a spike if it were to occur.  The Minister stated a few moments ago that when circumstances have changed, one has to show intelligence and flexibility.  It is beyond urgent that we put in place a system that maximises the capacity in our public and private hospitals.  I get a sense, not from the Minister but from others, that there is intransigence here.  It is about marking territory and, to some extent, about ideology.  We just want a system that works for people.</p>  <p>  We have many reasons for this.  The figures released today that outlined the medical background of those who have, unfortunately, died from Covid tell us something, namely, that almost 84% of them had underlying conditions.  That term "underlying conditions" strikes terror into the hearts of people but it has a human face.  It is about heart issues, diabetes, cancer etc.  Those chronic conditions require ongoing treatment and management, and many people are not getting that, which means they are at greater risk from Covid if they contract it.  Think about all those people who are on waiting lists, perhaps for a biopsy or other urgent surgery, knowing that if they do not get it, they will end up with an underlying condition.</p>  <p>  I said to the Minister last week that it is like a slow car crash.  I ask him again to do whatever he can, because he is the person in charge, and to intervene to ensure that patients - non-Covid and Covid - can access the maximum capacity in our hospitals.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.341" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1624" speakername="Simon Harris" time="19:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700058#NNN01700"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter and for being honest and truthful.  I share the view that there was no alternative option, when we were looking at what was happening in other countries, other than to ensure we had every possible bed, ventilator and ICU bed.  That is what everybody in the House was rightly questioning at the time and, thank God, we secured that capacity and, even better, did not have to use it all.  That is a sign of success.</p>  <p>  I share the Deputy's concern that this cannot be about ideology.  This is not about anyone becoming Nye Bevan or about advancing the legitimate issues the House may wish to advance in respect of Sl&aacute;intecare and the like in what one might call "peacetime".  It has to be about showing pragmatism and common sense in getting the best outcome.  The current arrangement is, effectively, an arrangement for five months with a break clause after three months, which will come in at the end of June.  We have an automatic right to extend for a further two months, which would bring us to the end of August.</p> <p>The Government will consider this matter on Friday.  There are two things we need to try to achieve.  First, we will need to have more capacity for a potential second wave, which is a very real prospect.  I would not like to be the Minister who gave up that capacity and then needed to start looking for it again in a second wave.  Second, we need more capacity now to deliver non-Covid-19 care also.  Deputy Harkin spoke passionately about people with cancer and we are now seeing a lot of public health services beginning to be provided with the private capacity.  Cancer services for public patients have moved from St. Vincent's University Hospital to St. Vincent's Private Hospital and from the Midland Regional Hospital Tullamore to the Hermitage Medical Clinic, and so on.  It is about providing the potential for a Covid-19 surge capacity that we may need.  If we are even to provide the normal health service, inadequate though that may be in trying to provide more capacity, it is about trying to get that balance right, which we will do over the next few days when the Government considers this again on Friday.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.343" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1577" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="19:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700059#OOO00200"><p>I will ask again about private hospitals and nursing homes.  Having read what I have read, I am more convinced than ever that nursing homes were not put to the top of the list.  The Minister said many times in this D&aacute;il that HIQA was the voice of the nursing homes.  I looked at the minutes and I did not see HIQA as the voice of the nursing homes.  HIQA had the expertise and the knowledge, more than any other body in the State, on this.  If the Minister, the Government, or any of the experts of NPHET, had asked, they might have found this out.  HIQA was fully aware of all the gaps in the nursing homes and it has carried out reports year after year.  HIQA was in position in December and January and should have been the first port of call for the Government to ask, "What have you identified for us and what are the gaps?", but the Minister did not do that.</p>  <p> I now turn to the issue of private hospitals.  I preface my comments each time in the D&aacute;il, and I preface them again, that I am an absolute passionate advocate of public medicine.  What has happened here, however, with the Government's agreement with the private hospitals is nothing short of scandalous.  The two private hospitals in Galway are operating at between 20% and 30% capacity.  If the Minister has better figures, I ask that he please give them to me.  Most unusually, I am relying on information I am getting from private consultants.  I would be happy to be corrected.  On top of this, the rehabilitation department of Merlin Park University Hospital, of which I am very proud - I had a family member there as a patient - was moved completely.  The Minister might explain this to me.  The gymnasium and all the facilities stopped and the patients and therapists were moved to Bon Secours Hospital Galway, which is a private hospital.  The nurses were moved down to the public hospital to sit in a lobby to be called and put into a different ward every single day.  Patients and therapists are all gone to the private hospital while Merlin Park University Hospital has been left empty.  Perhaps the Minister will explain the logic of this.</p>  <p>  A private consultant, who is a specialist in gynaecology, was interviewed on "Drivetime" on Monday.  The consultant explained that she has 350 patients, 50 of whom need urgent surgery but she cannot do it.  There are 300 awaiting consultations.  The more I reflect on the Covid-19 crisis, the more it seems to disproportionately affect women and children.  There is no cervical screening, no BreastCheck, no elective surgery carried out and emergency surgery is very limited.  This is while we have the two hospitals practically empty.  It is certainly 70% empty and God knows what the percentage is in Merlin Park University Hospital.  I could pull a figure out and say 50% but I imagine it is much higher.  We are paying &euro;150 million per month, in advance I understand, for empty hospitals for three months and then we will renew it.  There is absolutely no pathway to tell me that the women and men who are waiting for surgery will be seen.  The list builds up and up and those in the private sector are now told to go into the public sector, which puts even more pressure on it.  Even after they have been diagnosed and seen by consultants people are now going in to get a further diagnosis.  Incredibly, consultants who are on a different contract in the public system are allowed to still see private patients, while the private consultants cannot see any of their patients.  Inequity is built in to every part of this agreement.  Furthermore, the ultimate insult is that we cannot see the contract because it is commercially sensitive.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would deal with some of those issues.</p></speech>

The up-to-date figures I have for the Bon Secours Hospital Galway are for an inpatient bed occupancy of 48% on the week of 11 May to 15 May.  That dropped to 41% on 18 May to 22 May.  The Galway Clinic figures show 15% for 11 May to 15 May, and this increased to 26%.</p> <p>I get the point that there are challenges and difficulties.  However, I still believe it was absolutely the right thing to do.  I get the point that we need to finesse it and get the best possible arrangement in using all of the facilities.  I also get the point, however, that we cannot allow public patients with cancer not have their services and private patients with health insurance continue to get them.  In Galway city, in the Bons hospital we had 378 public patients discharged from inpatient beds, along with 298 day-case procedures.  We had 434 public patients in the Bons hospital in Galway, who would never have been able to darken the door before, actually have diagnostics carried out there.  Some 710 public patients had outpatient appointments in the Bons hospital in Galway as well.  I can give the Deputy the figures for the Galway clinic as well but I will not waste her time.  I will send them to her.</p> <p> This is about equity of access.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.356" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1510" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="19:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700062#UUU00100"><p>I thank the members of the Business Committee for agreeing to have this discussion today.  As I have not had a chance to speak yet in this D&aacute;il, I want to place on the record of the House my own sympathies for those who have been bereaved in the current crisis, as well as my appreciation for those on the front line both in the health service and right across society, not least in the local government sector, which we are going to spend the next two hours discussing.</p>  <p>  Our local authorities have been part of the front line of Ireland's response to the Covid-19 crisis.  They have provided local leadership and support to communities throughout the country.  They have proved once more how responsive and agile they are in the face of the crisis.  They have found new ways of maintaining services and indeed creative new ways of delivering new services.  The provision of support and care to vulnerable sectors of society, whether those in emergency accommodation or those in our communities forced to remain at home in cocooned isolation, has been at the heart of the local authority response to Covid-19.  Just as the virus has forced us all to find new ways of working, coping and communicating, so it also has demonstrated the reach and flexibility of our 31 local authorities.  The local authority system has played a pivotal role in protecting the most vulnerable in communities, namely, those in emergency accommodation.  It has worked closely with NGOs, the HSE, the Garda and other key stakeholders to put in place really strong supports for those in emergency accommodation.  It has also moved quickly to secure additional accommodation, with more than 1,000 new spaces secured in Dublin and more than 400 secured outside Dublin.  There is more capacity above and beyond that.</p>  <p>  It has also planned and acted strategically in maintaining key essential services.  These have often been delivered in different ways and from different locations throughout the crisis, while planning carefully for the phased resumption and ramping up of more activities in line with the timetable set out in the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business, and consistent with the Return to Work Safely Protocol.</p>  <p>  The urgent requirement to keep the planning process open is recognised by all.  While the public participation process in planning had to be protected by extending statutory timelines for several weeks, the focus now is on a prudent reopening of planning offices to facilitate a steady return to this critical element of economic activity across the country.  Since Monday, planning offices have been open right across the country to public inspection.</p>  <p>  From the very beginning of the emergency, it was recognised that people who were cocooning would need extra help, particularly if their usual networks of support were not able to reach them at that particular time.  For that reason, and to put in place a safety net for such people, national government came together with local government and the community and voluntary sector to launch the Community Call initiative.  This initiative recognised that local authorities are at the heart of every community in the country and that they have a unique democratic mandate and capacity to bring people together, and all the principal response agencies in the public sector, as well as huge numbers in the community and voluntary sector locally.</p>  <p>  On Friday, 27 March, immediately following the announcement by An Taoiseach of strict measures to control the spread of Covid-19, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, directed all local authority chief executives to establish a dedicated forum to respond to the needs of the most vulnerable in their communities.  Forums, dedicated help lines, and support systems were put in place in all 31 local authorities over that weekend.  I want to take this opportunity to commend the local authorities, the staff, elected members and indeed other agencies on their leadership in responding so effectively and so rapidly to that call.  I thank also the other bodies involved, including the HSE, the Garda, Civil Defence, the GAA and other sporting bodies, community and voluntary organisations, volunteers and everyone else who has come together with such commitment and generosity of spirit.  The Community Call initiative has brought together key local bodies with national organisations such as ALONE and An Post, is helping to ensure that everyone who needs support is identified, that the support required is carefully assessed and the appropriate support is provided by a tried and trusted source.  ALONE, the organisation supporting older people, is operating the national support line to provide emotional support and reassurance to vulnerable people and is cross-referencing callers through the appropriate local authority as required.  Similarly, local authorities are referring appropriate calls to ALONE.</p> <p>Special credit is due to An Post, whose staff have not only delivered critical Covid-19 informational material to households but are also checking in on vulnerable people and helping to ensure that they can stay connected.  I thank my colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, who has worked in close partnership on this initiative.  I also wish to mention and support the work of the forums in support of which, through Deputy Ring's Department, the Government has launched a &euro;2.5 million fund.  These include the local authority Community Call forums and the community and voluntary groups they are working with, such as Meals on Wheels and other community and voluntary services throughout the country.  Each Community Call forum is providing practical supports like collection and delivery of food, meals, fuel, medication, pensions and other essential items.</p> <p> Since 31 March, the 31 Community Call forums around the country have met 310 times remotely and have handled over 41,000 calls, some 750 calls per day on average, with more at the start.  A total of 24% of the calls related to the delivery of food; 20% concerned social isolation or engagement; 8% concerned the delivery of meals; 6% concerned medical matters; and 42% fell into the other category, such as volunteering and people who hoped to give support to their local Community Call forum.  </p> <p> Since its launch on 9 March, the ALONE national helpline has received 21,000 calls and has supported just under 15,000 older people.  The service provided by the Community Call forums will continue to operate as long as needed.  It is quite important.  There is a lesson to be learned for local government in the future from the engagement of so many new people, particularly in the community and voluntary sector, during the Covid response.  It is important that we build on that in the future in terms of developing our local government structure.  Important links and working relationships have been built among service providers and users at local level.  A key consideration of the review of the initiative, which will commence shortly, will be about sustaining those links.  </p> <p> Importantly, given the breadth and reach of the bodies involved, some vulnerable and isolated people in our communities have been identified as part of the work of the forums.  They have now been brought under the wing of their local communities and support organisations, which should allow them to continue to live independently in their homes for longer.</p> <p> The Community Call fora also play an important role in the In This Together initiative, which aims to help everyone in Ireland to stay connected, to stay active and to look after their mental well-being throughout the emergency.  An important element of this will be the work of the network of local authority libraries, which have already seen an expansion in their digital and online services.  </p> <p> In terms of finance, the Department has worked closely with the local government sector, particularly with the County and City Management Association, CCMA, to deal with the very significant financial and funding challenges that Covid-19 has presented to the sector.  Rates income, budgeted at &euro;1.54 billion in 2019 and &euro;1.66 billion this year, provides approximately 30% of the revenue across all local authorities and up to 50% in some cases.</p> <p> Recognising the critical nature of rates to local authorities and local communities, I ensured that the Local Government Rates and Other Matters Act 2019 was enacted last year. The act modernises the rates system.  Important elements have already been commenced and the commencement of the remaining elements is being progressed with a view to them becoming operational for the next budgeting period beginning in the fourth quarter of this year.  Obviously, however, the impact of Covid-19 on business and ratepayers has been very significant and Government has responded by announcing on 2 May a waiving of rates for all businesses forced to close due to public health requirements from 27 March for a three-month period.  This will come at a cost of &euro;260 million to be met by the Exchequer.  The Department is currently finalising further guidance for local authorities on that initiative and the Cabinet will be meeting to discuss this guidance further on Friday.  The position will be reviewed as part of a wider review of supports to enterprise and employment and associated local authority funding.  </p> <p> We are also involved, as Members will be aware, in the restart fund for micro and small businesses, which was announced by the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys.</p> <p>There are a number of other issues on which I will answer questions from Members. </p></speech>

I would like a response from the Minister of State during my time so I will be quick.  The Minister of State referred to the micro and small business restart fund.  Has the Department looked at other rateable organisations such as sports clubs and other community organisations, which are paying rates and have staff but cannot apply for that restart grant?  It seems inequitable, given that they are ratepayers too and should be able to apply for those grants.  To stay with local government matters, the Minister of State noted that rates have rightly been waived for this three-month period.  I put it to him that we will have to do that for a longer period of time - potentially for the rest of this year - to give the SME sector, which is crucially important to this country, a chance to breathe.  Have financial projections been carried out within the Department on potential lost revenue over those coming weeks?  The Minister of State mentioned a figure of &euro;260 million in that period.  In that context, has the Minister or the Minister of State discussed a local authority recovery fund to compensate for that lost income?  I want to record my sincere thanks to all local authority staff all over this country.  I have had personal experience of them doing phenomenal work, from housing officers to biodiversity officers and those working in operations and sports.  The whole lot of them have gone above and beyond.  They have been part of our front-line response to this emergency and so we need to ensure they are funded.</p>  <p>  To turn to housing, which is part of the Department's brief, 7,700 builds were targeted for this year between local authority and approved housing body, AHB, housing.  Has the projected output within the social housing sector for the rest of this year been revised?  The last time we had questions on housing, I mentioned that the construction industry was projecting that we would complete 18,000 units this year because of the Covid crisis and the slowdown.  That has been further reduced to approximately 14,000, which is understandable but also shows the scale and challenge the next Government will face in ramping back up delivery of public, social and affordable homes.  Has there been a revision in the projections on housing within the Department?  What does the Minister of State believe will be delivered this year?  As regards social housing sites that are back in action right now, what is in the pipeline for the rest of this year on the active sites that are up and running?  Does the Minister of State think the capital envelope for local authority builds this year is secure enough to deliver the required housing for the rest of this year?</p>  <p>  I raised the Rebuilding Ireland home loan a number of weeks ago.  I am glad the Department is giving forbearance to mortgage holders who will not be charged interest in that intervening period.  That is the right thing to do.  I wish our financial institutions would do the same and I am ask them to do so.  Does the Minister of State have an update on extending the forbearance measures for a further three months, should that be required?</p></speech>

We had housing questions in the House recently but today's session is not specifically about housing.  However, I will get the Minister to directly answer the questions Deputy O'Brien has raised.</p>  <p>  The restart grant is being funded through the local authorities and local enterprise offices and is a rebate of rates.  I have encountered some businesses that might have a very small rates bill or do not have much of a physical premises.  The Deputy mentioned sporting and community organisations.  The scheme is under constant review, with the aim of capturing the maximum number of businesses.  I will bring the Deputy's specific concerns to the attention of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, which is the Department responsible for the grant.</p> <p>The Deputy asked if the waiving of rates for three months is not enough.  A figure of &euro;90 million per month was worked out, in conjunction with the County and City Management Association, as the cost of Covid-19 to the local government sector.  An amount of &euro;260 million has been committed to but a commitment was also given that the period for which rates are waived will be extended if businesses continue to be forced to close or seriously affected by the Covid epidemic.</p></speech>

I commend all the workers in local authorities who have helped in the front-line effort throughout the Covid crisis.</p>  <p>  Recent grant schemes are very welcome but, sadly, we are doing little more for the SME sector than, effectively, subsidising next year's rates bill.  Will the Minister of State's officials confirm to me in writing later today or tomorrow if it is envisaged that the rates holiday of three or four months will be extended?  Much of the SME sector, particularly those in hospitality and tourism, could do with that being extended to 12 months.</p>  <p>  Will the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government commit to replenishing whatever rates are forgone by local authorities?  Smaller local authorities should be prioritised because, as we know, at any given time in a normal year, Fingal County Council might have &euro;100 million on deposit whereas authorities in smaller counties, without the benefit of having Dublin Airport in their rates base, have limited resources.  Such authorities do not have the benefit of many services that other local authorities have.  For example, local authorities in Mayo and Kerry have four or five tourism officers whereas authorities in Sligo and Leitrim might be lucky to have one.  </p>  <p>  Those are my questions and they relate to grant aid for people and the business start-up grant, and whether the Minister of State will be in a position to replenish the amounts that are forgone in commercial rates income for local authorities nationally.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.363" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1493" speakername="Niall Collins" time="20:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700065#XXX00300"><p>I raise the issue of finance for small builders and contractors.  A number of small builders and contractors in my Limerick constituency have raised with me the issue that Home Building Finance Ireland will provide funding only for schemes of five houses or more.  We know that small builders will be the engine for the delivery of value for money housing as we try and get more housing units, particularly social and affordable housing units, up and running.  The financing scheme should be amended to allow building schemes of two, three and four units to be built and they should be financed accordingly.</p>  <p>  I also raise the issue of homelessness in my constituency of County Limerick.  Much of the debate and discussion about homelessness has focused on cities and urban-based homelessness but I have a particular issue in my constituency where I feel the Department and the local authority are not providing enough of a service and outreach in rural County Limerick.  I am dealing with four cases where people are sleeping rough or in their cars.  There is a need to better fund the homeless action team in Limerick City and County Council to deal with this issue.</p>  <p>  Linked to the issue of homelessness, there is an acute shortage of one-bed, small type accommodation in Limerick, particularly for vulnerable men who have come from broken marriages or have other issues and find themselves on the local authority waiting list.  We need a focus on that.</p>  <p>  I also mention the issue of student accommodation at the University of Limerick.  This issue also arises in other parts of the country, such as Tralee and other areas of student accommodation, but I am interested particularly in the University of Limerick.  Yesterday, the governing authority recommended to itself, because it wholly owns a company that operates the student accommodation, that refunds should be given to students.  They have a complex corporate web of ownership and it is laughable.  I would like the Minister of State, his colleagues or the Government to take a position on this matter.</p>  <p>  A housing scheme in Hospital in my constituency in Limerick got Part 8 planning for 26 houses.</p> <p>A contract has been signed with a contractor.  He is now only going to build nine houses because Irish Water has decided it cannot service the site.  It has gone through the planning process and the procurement process.  Irish Water is now coughing up problems and 16 families are going to lose out.  I would like the Department to look into this.  I ask the Minister of State get back to me in his own time in writing with replies to those issues.</p></speech>

One has to be like Usain Bolt to get points out in this Chamber.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State might respond to my queries and questions since my time is limited.  I want to get out of the Chamber to comply with the social distancing rules.</p>  <p>  I quickly want to draw the Minister of State's attention to inconsistent planning decisions by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It recently dealt with two almost identical planning files in County Clare relating to mobile phone masts - one in Quilty and the other in Doonbeg.  Both communities are coastal and visually vulnerable, in beautiful scenic areas.  In both instances, they were refused planning by Clare County Council but when it went to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Quilty decision was upheld but planning for the Doonbeg mast was granted.  Locals are utterly perplexed and frustrated.  We need consistency in that regard.  The Department is the supreme custodian for planning policy.  The Minister of State will probably tell me he cannot intervene.  If nothing else, there needs to be consistency.</p>  <p>  The second issue I wish to raise is that of local government funding.  In a normal year, Clare County Council bills its ratepayers approximately &euro;44.7 million in rates.  However, following the closure of businesses due to the Covid pandemic, the council anticipates a loss of income in the region of &euro;19.7 million.  In Clare, there is high dependency on the hospitality sector, which will not reboot overnight, and Shannon Airport, which pays in the region of &euro;2 million in rates per annum.  The presence of Moneypoint power station in west Clare throws up another anomaly in funding in that it accounts for one quarter of all the rates based in the country.  The Minister of State needs to look at this because Clare will be disproportionately hit by all of this.  The recent Covid regional economic analysis report published by the three regional authorities has Clare in the highest exposure category with its businesses operating in the worst affected areas.  Clare ranks fifth on that list.  I would like to know whether the Department will intervene in this regard.</p>  <p>  Finally, I refer to a topical issue and I do not expect the Minister of State to respond to it.  In the past hour or so, Aer Lingus has announced a significant number of job losses directly impacting on my constituency.  The company has done it unilaterally, without engagement with unions or workers.  We need to set up a task force.  We need to have a session here next week to deal with Aer Lingus job losses and the regional impact in Shannon and the Clare hinterland.</p></speech>

During the lockdown, local authorities have parked commercial rates, they have suspended or removed parking charges, and there has been a reduction in some cases in rent and mortgage repayments for its customers.  The Minister of State must look at extending that, now more than ever.</p>  <p>  As we move through the phases, what will happen with local authorities?  Will services have to be cut?  We have discussed the great services that local authorities provide and we have praised them, particularly during the Covid pandemic.  We cannot cut services, for example, to the elderly whom we deal with daily.  I refer to the mobility grants and housing adaptation grants for windows and doors.  I can speak for Carlow County Council, as the Minister of State will be well aware, in my constituency.  We get one of the lowest capital funding allocations from central government.  He needs to make sure that we deliver our services to the local authority and that no services are cut going forward.  That is so important.  I ask him to come back to me in writing with a commitment that no local authority, particularly Carlow and Kilkenny, will have services cut.</p> <p> Regarding the amendment to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, the measures in place were to ensure no terminations of tenancies and no rent increases for a three-month period.  Are they to be extended on 27 June?  Local authorities and homelessness charities are predicting a massive surge in homelessness applications once the measures are removed.</p> <p> It is now over eight years since there has been a review of the income threshold to qualify to go on the local authority housing list.  Carlow had one of the lowest levels.  This matter is so important.  People are not qualifying to go on the local authority housing list because there has not been a review in over eight years.  This is unacceptable.  I ask the Minister of State to guarantee a review as soon as possible because what is occurring is making people homeless.  We have a homelessness crisis in addition to Covid.  I am looking for a commitment from the Minister of State.</p> <p> The Construction Industry Federation representatives were here last week and said there might be an increase of between 10% and 15% in the cost of home-build projects.  I have major concerns about this.  Several people have rung my constituency office about it.  Can we have information on this?  It is a worry and concern.  I thank the Minister of State.</p></speech>

We have since learned that half of that money is not guaranteed to offset the rates cost because the local authority start-up grant will not be required to be used to offset rates, either through a waiver or a direct payment by the relevant businesses.  This means there is already a shortfall from what we were originally told about.  No member of the Government has talked to us about the non-rates revenue shortfall.  Could the Minister of State speak about those two enormous concerns?  Managers have to manage their budgets for the year prudently, but if they do not have funding certainty by July or August, they will have to consider cutting services so they will not have to front-load all the losses into 2021.</p>  <p>  With respect to planning, it is very disappointing that no extension of the consultation period for live planning permissions has been announced.  I acknowledge there have been some but there clearly needs to be a further extension in line with the Government's exit plan.  Could the Minister of State give us an update on that?</p>  <p>  Planning applications are still being received for co-living developments, a style of housing that was certainly not suitable before Covid-19 and is definitely not suitable now, with its 9 sq. m of personal living space and with 40 people sharing communal kitchens and other areas.  Could the Minister of State give us an update on whether he is willing to review that?</p>  <p>  I echo other Deputies' calls regarding renters.  Perhaps this could be raised with the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  Renters urgently need clarity.  They need to know whether the Government is going to extend the moratorium on evictions, notices to quit and rent increases.  We also need to hear from the Minister&rsquo;s colleague, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Ms Regina Doherty, because the emergency rent supplement payment is due to expire at the end of this week, on Sunday.  It also needs to be extended.  We urgently need additional funding for homelessness day services.  I am aware the Minister of State cannot answer those questions but I would appreciate it if he could communicate them to his senior Minister.</p></speech>

On the non-rates shortfall, one of the issues that is unique to the refund of the rates loss for every local authority is that there is no local authority in the country that collects rates at a level of 100%.  The refund will be 100%.  That is with the intention of offsetting some of the other costs.  These will vary from local authority to local authority, including in regard to parking charges and planning fees.  There are many smaller sources of income that have been curtailed because of Covid-19 but it is absolutely true that the highest collection rate of local authorities is 92%.</p></speech>

As I said in response to Deputy Darragh O'Brien, the monthly shortfall in terms of commercial rates is about &euro;85 million or &euro;86 million.  We should also bear in mind some of the other fees that councils are not gathering now because of decreases in the number of planning applications and reductions in car parking charges.  Deputy Murnane O'Connor mentioned Carlow and other places where parking charges have been suspended for the duration in question.</p>  <p>  I will bring the issues related to housing to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.</p> <p>The &euro;250 million for the restart fund and the &euro;260 million for the offset of commercial rates total more than the &euro;500 million the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, mentioned here three weeks ago.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.390" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="20:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700068#AAAA00200"><p>As I have said, the Minister of State does not understand the difficulty the local authorities are in or the position of the County and City Management Association, CCMA.  The CCMA was of the understanding that there was a pot of approximately &euro;500 million which would get them over the first three months - that is the &euro;260 million - but also that they could plan for the future because they expected that the &euro;250 million from the start-up grant would be used as either a direct rates waiver or a contribution towards rates.  Managers are now trying to plan services for June, July, August and September but they have no certainty on funding.  That affects every local authority in the State.  Dublin City Council has a projected shortfall of &euro;150 million.  For Donegal County Council the figure is &euro;4 million and for Wexford it is &euro;4.5 million.  I am naming those although they are not my own local authority because these figures show the scale of the problem.  Managers need certainty and the sooner the Government can provide that, the better.</p>  <p>  I would also appreciate if the Minister of State would come back to me very briefly, in the half a minute remaining before my colleagues come in with their allocated time, on the need to urgently review the progress of co-living planning applications, which in my view should be prohibited.  In addition, is it intended to extend the deadline for submissions on planning applications?  Many people are unable to travel to their local authorities or to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to view, for example, strategic housing development applications and do not have access to files online.  This is a legal requirement for proper consultation.  The Minister of State needs to guarantee that this will happen.</p></speech>

Many Members of the House are keen to reactivate the planning process with regard to exiting Covid-19 measures.  The points the Deputy made are valid and I will certainly bring them to the Minister's attention.</p>  <p>  With regard to co-living, any private operator or State agency may want to apply for planning permission.  I cannot remember the word the Deputy used but I, as Minister of State, cannot determine the planning applications people can make, nor would I like that to be the case.

Beidh thart ar tr&iacute; n&oacute;im&eacute;ad agam f&eacute;in agus n&oacute;im&eacute;ad amh&aacute;in aige.  I will share my time with the Minister of State.  I will use approximately three minutes myself and give a minute to the Minister of State to respond.</p>  <p>  Last week a report was published that revealed that only four councils in the State collected the vacant sites levy, which means that 27 did not collect these vital funds for the provision of much needed housing.  This report shows that millions are owed to councils.  We are speaking of a sum greater than &euro;9 million.  This is deeply concerning to me and is also of great concern to the people I represent.  We need far greater clarity on the collection of both the vacant sites levy and the derelict sites levy.  </p>  <p>  Just down the road from where I live in Galway city, there is a dilapidated building on the site of the former Corrib Great Southern Hotel.  This is one of the most prominent locations on the east side of the city and one of the first buildings one passes when entering Galway.  Not only is it an eyesore, a waste of valuable space in Galway city and a fire hazard, but it has also been on the derelict sites register since January 2015, well over five years ago.  Despite numerous requests and a freedom of information application from me, there is no clarity on the levies that have been paid to Galway City Council in this regard.  That is simply not good enough.  It is very clear that we need far greater transparency regarding what is owed and where.  </p>  <p>  In the middle of a housing crisis, we cannot afford to have land lying idle in our urban areas.  In the middle of a global pandemic, we cannot afford to leave &euro;9 million in uncollected levies.  As we have heard today, local authorities are being squeezed for funding and, in light of the impact the coronavirus is having on local economies, we know that they will be squeezed even further.  It therefore makes no sense not to collect these levies. </p> <p>T&aacute; g&eacute;arch&eacute;im ann maidir le maoini&uacute; do chomhairl&iacute; &aacute;iti&uacute;la.  Ba ch&oacute;ir aon airgead at&aacute; dlite don rialtas &aacute;iti&uacute;il a bhaili&uacute; mar gheall go bhfuil s&eacute; ag teast&aacute;il go g&eacute;ar.  While certain Deputies are getting hot under the collar claiming that &euro;350 is an excessive weekly income, there is little mention of the &euro;9 million in uncollected levies.  That tells us a lot of where the political focus is and the understanding of what it is like to struggle to put food on the table and to keep a roof over one's head.</p> <p> Mar sin, t&aacute; tr&iacute; cheist agam for the Minister of State.  One, why is this money not being collected?  Two, do local authorities require greater powers to collect it?  Three, can the amounts paid and owed for the derelict site levy be published?  Public funds should be public knowledge.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.398" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1510" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="20:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700069#BBBB00200"><p>I agree with virtually everything the Deputy said.  The collection of these moneys is a matter for each local authority and it has not been brought to my attention that councils need any extra powers in this regard.  At the time the vacant site levy was introduced, and in respect of the amending legislation which was brought in afterwards in relation to farm lands, the powers were put in place.  I saw the report to which the Deputy referred and she is right to point out her concerns.  I am not trying to underestimate anything Deputy &Oacute; Broin said earlier regarding local authorities and the squeeze on funding.  However, this is why we elect local councils and it is their responsibility to collect the levy.</p>  <p>  I am talking about my own council here as well as Deputy Farrell's and every member of all local authorities.  I am not trying to cast aspersions on all members but we have 31 local authorities.  Being Minister of State in charge of local government is a misnomer because I actively want them all to be different and to do their own thing locally.  In their Covid-19 response, local authorities have really shown how they can do that.  It is because they have those local contacts and a local knowledge that they are able to do it.  As I said, it certainly has not been brought to my attention that they need any additional powers.  It is a matter for each local authority to collect that funding and the Deputy is right that they should be collecting it, particularly at this time but also outside of this crisis.</p></speech>

He will know that there are many thousands of homeowner families across the State who have been devastated by a range of serious latent defects in their homes, from the pyrite crisis in Dublin and north Leinster to the scandal of Priory Hall and the mica and pyrite problems in Donegal and Mayo, as well as the fire safety and structural defects discovered in homes all across the State.  We have resolution schemes for pyrite and for the Priory Hall residents.  Today, I want to talk in detail about the mica and pyrite resolution schemes for Donegal and Mayo and call on the Minister of State to outline what he is doing for all the families in the State affected by latent defects.  It is devastating for all of them and we need solutions in all cases.</p>  <p>  In my county of Donegal, thousands of families have been absolutely devastated.  I have been in homes where people have been in tears.  They are destroyed because their family homes, their wee castles to which they look for security, is literally crumbling around them.  People have had to move out of their homes and we are talking about thousands of homeowners.  They have waited for years for a resolution and there has been a long campaign led by the Mica Action Group in Donegal.  That campaign is related closely to the campaign in Mayo and the two schemes are linked.</p>  <p>  As I said, I want the Minister of State to spell out clearly today what he is doing for all the families affected by latent defects.  In the case of Donegal, we need to know when a scheme is going to start.  When can people bring engineers from the engineers panel out to their homes to assess the damage and see what needs to be done to make their homes safe so they can start to plan for the future and start to breathe again?  When will that commence and when will people be able to draw down the funds?</p>  <p>  Finally, the scheme that has been announced will be 90% funded.  If we are talking about a home that will cost &euro;250 million to completely rebuild, refurbish, put in furnishings and so on, 10% is a lot of money for people to find.  There is also the cost of accommodation rental and storage of household goods during the long period of construction and refurbishment.  It is a huge amount of money for the families who have waited all these years.  Will the Minister of State reconsider the 90% limit or, alternatively, will he engage robustly with the banks, which still own many of these properties and assets and will benefit hugely from the scheme, so that they step up and make up the 10%?</p> <p>I await the Minister of State's responses with anticipation.</p></speech>

I am recording the questions and I will relay the ones that fall into the housing category to the Minister.  Local government does not have a direct responsibility for the mica and pyrite issue.  However, the Deputy is right.  My wife is from north Leitrim so I know south Donegal.  I have seen at first hand, as well as some of the images of, the houses that have been affected by mica, as well as the houses affected by pyrite in and around the greater Dublin area.  It is very important.  I was delighted a number of months ago when a scheme was finally announced.  I will get the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to refer to the 90% and also to when full implementation of the scheme will happen.</p></speech>

He spoke about his Leitrim connections.  I believe the last time I met him was for breakfast in his adopted family home in Dromahair in north Leitrim.  He is very aware of the issues in that county and, indeed, in all the counties throughout the country.  I wish to discuss three issues.  The first has been raised by other Deputies.  Will he outline to the House how and when he expects to be able to reimburse smaller local authorities such as those in Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon and Donegal for the loss of their rates base in 2020?  How are they expected to be able to continue to afford their services without Government assistance?  Should larger county councils that currently sit on banks of capital be asked to assist?</p>  <p>  It has been a very difficult year for those smaller counties.  There was flooding in Leitrim and particularly Roscommon in the first few months of the year.  The resources of the local authorities and all the stakeholders were just incredible.  They were there every day keeping the flood water out and trying to protect businesses.  Once we got over the flooding the Covid-19 crisis arose, which has been the same throughout the country.  With regard to the front-line workers and all the workers in the local authorities, we should be very proud of their vocation, dedication and professionalism.  The first six months of this year have certainly been very difficult.  However, there is a very serious issue regarding smaller local authorities and, like other Deputies, I believe we must address it.</p>  <p>  The second matter is social housing delivery targets under Rebuilding Ireland.  The local authorities were quite successful when the downturn happened.  There was a great deal of good quality and affordable accommodation and it was great to see that it was bought on the open market by the local authorities on behalf of the public.  It certainly helped with the housing stock.  However, they were competing with other people.  The new directive is that more houses be built by the local authorities.  The lengthy approval process of 18 months where one had to go through four stages has effectively been removed, but I am a little concerned about the one-off house.  I am aware of one area where the council might not be in the best position to buy a one-off house.  It is still on the market.  What are the exact requirements for the local authority to buy the house?  Is it as easy or as open as it was previously?  I believe there is still an opportunity.  Sometimes in areas such north Roscommon, Leitrim, Sligo or Donegal there are affordable houses for &euro;60,000, &euro;70,000 or &euro;80,000.  One just could not build them for that.  It is a big opportunity.  It is not always one size fits all.</p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to raise an old chestnut.  I am delighted the Minister of State is here as I did not realise he would be.</p> <p>We have an issue with the spelling of Enniscrone, whether it is I-N-I-S-H-C-R-O-N-E or E-N-N-I-S-C-R-O-N-E.  It has become a huge issue in towns and villages across the country.  We did not think it was such an issue but everywhere we go we put our destination into Google maps and this issue is causing serious damage in terms of tourists, businesses and people going to the town.  We have the Irish spelling, which 95% of the people do not recognise and want to change.  We had a meeting attended by more than 700 or 800 people.  We also had a very productive meeting with the Minister of State but the people want to have a plebiscite.  I have said previously that there is a type of turf war going on between the Gaeltacht and the non-Gaeltacht Departments.  We were very close to getting legislation in place until the Government fell.  Can the Minister of State outline the position on that legislation?  Will this issue get top priority if a new Government is formed?  The issue with the placename is causing a great deal of confusion and people cannot understand why it cannot be changed and have the Departments come together to try to address this issue once and for all.  It is not just an issue for Enniscrone.  There are many towns and villages throughout this country dealing with a similar issue.  We had it years ago with An Daingean-Dingle.  People simply cannot understand that it takes so long and so much legislation to deal with it.  I am aware it has to go through a plebiscite in terms of the local authority but can the Minister of State inform me of the current position on this very interesting situation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.406" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1510" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="21:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700071#DDDD00200"><p>I confirm to the House that, hopefully, following the Cabinet decision this Friday, it is the intention to reimburse local authorities, large and small, as soon as possible thereafter, certainly early in the month of June.  There would have been extensive consultation between the Departments, both at official and political level, with local authorities across the country in regard to their financial position.  All of them indicated that until the end of June, their financial position was okay but they do need a longer-term plan, as Deputy &Oacute; Broin mentioned earlier.  It is very much our intention that that money will be released as early as possible in June so that the first part of that long-term planning can happen.</p>  <p>  To go back to one of the points Deputy &Oacute; Broin and others made earlier about rolling over the three-month waiver, a commitment was given by the Minister, Deputy Murphy, when the final announcement was made that it would be rolled over for businesses that are still closed due to the effects of the virus.  What will also be discussed at Government on Friday is businesses that have been severely impacted.  There is no uniform solution to this.  That is the reason we need to give local authorities the maximum flexibility.  What do I mean by that?  Some of the pharmacies in the middle of this city or in a big urban centre like Kilkenny, Carlow or Wexford would have been quite quiet, particularly during the height of the lockdown period.  However, pharmacies in some of the smaller locations on the periphery or even in smaller villages and towns would have been very busy during the lockdown period because people were at home and not travelling, so it is very difficult.  We are keen that, as part of the scheme, if it is approved by Government, there would be an appeals mechanism also to ensure that in terms of those specific discrepancies that may exist in one category of business throughout the local authority there would be flexibility to deal with each case.</p>  <p>  Deputy Feighan is right about the one-off house.  There are still many parts of the country where it is cheaper to buy a second-hand, one-off house than it would be for a local authority to construct a house.  As I understand it, there is still flexibility for local authorities, in conjunction with the Department, to make those types of purchases but I will get the Minister, Deputy Murphy, to revert directly to the Deputy.</p> <p>On the age-old issue of Inishcrone, as the Deputy will be aware, the Local Government Act which passed the Houses last year drew up the criteria under which a plebiscite could be held.  We had plebiscites on the issue of directly-elected mayors in three local authority areas.  That would also work in the case of a naming issue, such as Inishcrone.  In this particular situation, there is a conflict between legislation, in that the official languages legislation falls under the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  I will endeavour to get an update and response from it about where it stands with the review of that legislation and ensuring the plebiscite can be put to the people of Inishcrone about the spelling they wish for their town.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for his statement.  Remote working will likely have a significant impact on the future of employment for most Irish businesses.  We have an opportunity to encourage people to stay at home while working.  This will help us to achieve the 2030 target of a 7% reduction in carbon emissions.  The Civil Service and public service have taken leadership in this move and should be commended on doing so.  With just civil servants working from home, we can achieve a significant reduction in our carbon emissions.  The research by Trinity academic Dr. Brian Caulfield and his colleagues on emissions reductions from remote working shows it would also decrease congestion on our road networks and public transport, which in turn will make public transport more attractive and reliable.  However, F&oacute;rsa has stated that the Government needs to deliver greater support for those who work from home.  Health and safety concerns need to be taken into account in many areas.  Will the Minister of State outline what actions local government is undertaking or will undertake to ensure remote working will be an option for as many civil and public servants as possible?  Will the Minister of State confirm how the necessary health and safety regulations for their new working environments will be met, especially with regard to work-life balance and mental health?</p>  <p>  Since the pandemic began and human activity reduced, wildlife has started to flourish again in many parts of Ireland, yet wildlife still faces plenty of issues.  As nesting season started, hedgerows and other sanctuaries have been burning all over the country.  While devastating to our struggling wildlife, it leaves us vulnerable to a worse problem.  Last year, we saw illegal burning destroy a huge part of Killarney National Park.  We lost hundreds of acres of our last remaining native oak forest and thousands of wild animals.  Fires like these have devastated areas such as Australia and California.  We are not immune to them.  We need to ensure that, as our climate changes, we are ready for increased demands on our water supply.  Drought hit farms in 2018 and we have had minimal rainfall in the past two months.  Ireland was one of the first countries in the world to recognise the climate and biodiversity crisis.  However, we need action, not words.  We have already started to create local, community-led projects that encourage biodiversity.  However, too often, grass and hedgerows are cut short as they start to improve things for our wildlife and pollinators.  Will the Minister of State outline what resources are needed by local authorities to ensure the continued destruction of our hedgerows will cease and that our local, community-focused re-wilding efforts will be sufficiently monitored to maintain protected areas?  Will the Minister of State outline what measures are being taken to reduce the risk of drought in Ireland and to ensure there are no water shortages for our homes and farms in the coming months?</p></speech>

One of the key proposals by the outgoing Government in that regard was the national broadband plan.  In the current crisis, we have seen bottlenecks in people's connectivity in many rural areas in particular, but also in some urban areas.</p> <p>The importance of the delivery of that plan has never been more apparent than it has in recent weeks when so many people have been either in a position to work from home or needing a connection to be able to work from home.  As part of the existing poor connection system that is available in many parts of the country, some private operators are going to extraordinary lengths to ensure people get a connection.  Others with more fixed lines are actually proving very unhelpful in many cases in terms of delivering connections particularly to rural and smaller urban locations.</p> <p> The points the Deputy made about meeting our emissions targets are absolutely valid.  They are nearly more obvious than his second point about work-life balance.  Before this crisis hit, people did not have enough time to have that proper work-life balance.  Yesterday - perhaps it was this morning - the Taoiseach indicated in answer to questions that he believes incentives may be needed to ensure that people will be able to work more from home in the future.</p> <p> Regarding local government, we need to look at streams of funding other than the traditional commercial rates that have existed heretofore.</p></speech>

However, the cars are coming back.  Has the Department considered the extensive roll-out of temporary cycling infrastructure as has been done in other countries and cities, including Milan?  Will this infrastructure be made permanent post the Covid pandemic, to allow children to cycle to school?</p>  <p>  This Friday is the deadline for submissions to the urban regeneration development fund.  This fund is vital to ensure that enough new houses will be constructed in the State.  Considering the lockdown, housing delivery will stall in the coming months.  Will this deadline be extended?</p>  <p>  Throughout this pandemic, many local authorities have secured extra accommodation to house their homeless.  We need to ensure the accommodation that has been secured will remain with the local authorities for as long as they are necessary.  What measures have been taken to permanently secure those Airbnb short-term lettings that are currently being used to accommodate homeless people?</p>  <p>  With the lack of almost all commercial activity in recent months, many businesses have been unable to pay business rates and many commercial tenants have been unable to pay their rents.  In recent weeks, the Department has provided assurances that local authorities would be reimbursed to cover the shortfall in the receipt of rates on commercial premises.  The payment of these funds after the date and the treatment of the rates waiver are still unclear for small and medium businesses.  This uncertainty is putting both businesses and local authorities under duress in the planning of their recovery.  I ask the Minister of State to outline the agreed plan and the advice to local authorities for businesses unable to pay their rates and tenants unable to pay their rent.</p>  <p>  As we look around the Chamber, we are reminded of the Covid restrictions and how even the D&aacute;il cannot meet in its full capacity.  This is also the case in many regional council chambers.  We need to ensure legislation is altered to allow council meetings to be held virtually.  What provisions have been made to our local government officials to ensure they are able to carry out their roles in light of Covid-19 restrictions?</p>  <p>  In previous D&aacute;il sittings, I have mentioned that the rent freeze and eviction ban currently in place need to be extended by three months.  The Department has alluded to reviewing this date.  I ask the Minister of State to confirm that there will be an extension to the rent freeze and eviction ban?</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has committed to the extension of the rent freeze and the eviction ban as part of a general check on where we are regarding the crisis.  Once that time period elapses at the end of June, he has not given a commitment, but he has said it will be firmly looked at depending on where we are in terms of the point of reopening and recovery.</p> <p>I acknowledge that it is unlikely that we will be much further advanced in three or four weeks than we are now in the reopening of the economy.</p> <p> Earlier the Deputy asked about local authorities' role in meeting our targets around emissions, biodiversity and climate generally.  One scheme introduced when I was a councillor 20 years ago was the heritage officer scheme.  I think Kilkenny was one of the first local authorities to take it up.  Green Party policy includes the introduction of biodiversity officers.  I am always struck by the amount of land, whether it is in the hands of local authorities, the HSE, the Office of Public Works, Transport Infrastructure Ireland - the thousands of acres in each local authority area - which is not used as productively as it should in terms of biodiversity.  I drive through it every time I come up from my constituency, with thousands of acres not used.</p></speech>

Many councils were very quick to write to the Department or to me about how they were to hold meetings.  It is a matter for themselves.  Most have now amended their standing orders to allow for meetings in lecture theatres and so on.  All 31 councils now have facilities for their AGMs which fall next month.  There is a place for virtual meetings in terms of briefings but when making statutory decisions, I still believe a physical meeting is necessary.  Local authorities have it in their power and they have all adopted a situation where they can use theatres or lecture halls to ensure those meeting take place.</p></speech>

We are well into this crisis and we have not had any debate about local government until now.  As others have said, local authorities have very much been a frontline service.  In my county of Wexford and across the country they have been the first port of call for many and the anchor bringing together community organisations.  The GAA and everyone else who all wanted to help rallied through the local authority and the local councillor who was on the ground, listening and feeding in centrally.  Local radio has also been an extraordinary resource in this, as have local papers.  We now need to sustain that.  They have been critical and remain critical in dealing with the community response to this unprecedented crisis which the nation is facing.  They will also be equally important in the next phase, the reopening and rebooting of the economy phase and they need to be prepared for that.</p>  <p>  I will focus on the funding difficulties which they now face.  I wish to hear clearly the Department's thinking on meeting the shortfall in funding that many Deputies have mentioned and the Minister of State has talked around, but I want to give the Minister of State time to answer on the specific issues.</p>  <p>  The total estimate for local government income this year for all local authorities is &euro;5.7 billion.  That is the figure they expected to receive in normal times.  Of that, &euro;1.66 billion, or 33%, was coming from commercial rates and &euro;1.3 billion, 26%, from goods and services which local government supply and is paid for.  I want to hear how the shortfall in those two areas will be met.  First, commercial rates was expected to take in &euro;1.66 billion or roughly &euro;133 million a month.  The Minister announced a waiver for three months and allocated &euro;260 million to meet its cost.  The expected income, if all the rates were paid, was &euro;400 million.</p> <p>That is for the three months.  The Minister of State is saying he is going to pay &euro;260 million or 65% of the expected sum.  How has that been calculated?  Obviously, not every business is going to be affected.  There will be some which will be able to pay full rates, and that is fine, but this is not an absolutely accurate calculation.  The Minister of State does not know.  He instanced himself, for example, that some pharmacies might do very little and might not be in a position to pay but others might be doing normal business or even more.  The Minister of State has an expectation that 35% of the estimated rates income will be paid.  If it is not, how much of that will he meet?  That is my first question.</p></speech>

The 100% of what was sought by the CCMA is included in the &euro;260 million figure.  It is very much my intention that if the guesstimate underestimates the amount of money that we expect businesses that have stayed open to contribute in commercial rates that we would meet the full balance of it.  That is the intention.</p></speech>

My second question relates to the goods and services income of &euro;1.3 billion.  Again, that is &euro;108 million per month or &euro;325 million for three months.  It is obvious that this crisis is going to go beyond three months.  Again, some services will not be impacted but others will be very significantly impacted.  The Minister of State himself instanced car parking for example.  There are incomes that will never be recouped.  They are not going to come back and pay for all the car parking lost.</p></speech>

That is not going to happen.  In fact, I think that will be a permanent reduction.  There are others that will also be lost such as planning fees.  The situation will very much depend on the local authority.  In my local authority, harbour dues, for example, will be lost.  Significant portions of the &euro;108 million per month will be lost.  So far, in answer to other Deputies, the Minister of State has indicated that the Cabinet will consider this on Friday.  I want to know what they are considering.  I hope the Minister of State will give me the same clarity in this answer as he gave me in the last.  Is it his intention to meet the entire loss, or what portion of the loss of the &euro;1.3 billion annually, amounting to &euro;108 million per month, does he propose to meet for the duration of the crisis?</p>  <p>  I am very conscious of the time.  What I am being told by finance officers across the country is that they estimate that, at a minimum, the most optimistic forecast is that they will be down by &euro;10 million of the &euro;108 million per month.  They estimate that the total amount that will be lost of their overall &euro;5.7 billion is of the order of &euro;100 million per month.  Is that the sort of support the Minister of State is going to announce and pony up to local authorities on Friday?</p></speech>

I will take six minutes and she will take four.  I have two questions for the Minister of State.  There will be ample time for him to respond.  I want to look at changes in construction output due to Covid-19 and how this will affect the delivery of social housing by local authorities.  Private sector construction is projected to decrease quite severely as a result of Covid-19.  More than 70% of new social housing builds in 2019 was bought from the private sector by the State, local authorities or approved housing bodies as turnkey acquisitions.  Moreover, the number of turnkey acquisitions purchased from the private sector increased to 74% in 2019 from 55% in 2018.  Turnkey acquisition has become local authorities' main source of new social housing units.  In light of these facts, what is the projected impact of the reduction in private sector construction on the delivery of social housing by local authorities?  Does the Minister of State agree that there is a need to reduce local authorities' reliance on turnkey purchased from the private sector units as a means of delivering social housing?</p></speech>

This is another situation that is not uniform across the country.  I am acutely aware of what Deputy Feighan said earlier.  There are still chunks of the country, and I suspect there will be more, where existing second-hand units or new build construction will be delivered cheaper than housing provided directly by the local authority.  I understand it is acutely different in large parts of the country.  I come from a very rural part of the south east where the situation is more balanced.  As I said, I am recording the questions and I will get the Minister to respond directly to the specific question the Deputy asked.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.450" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1550" speakername="Cian O'Callaghan" time="21:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700076#JJJJ01400"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  He is correct that it is different in different parts of the country.  It is of particular concern that in Dublin the amount of new build social housing units built directly by the local authority is very low.  In 2019 only 45 newly built housing units were directly provided by Dublin City Council.  About half of those were Priory Hall units that had been brought up to standard.  It is very concerning.</p> <p>It relates to the Minister of State's comments earlier about homelessness services and where the units for moving people out of homelessness are coming from.  One of the issues that sets us apart from most other countries dealing with homelessness is that local authorities are sourcing most of those units from the private sector, which means there is not a consistent and sustainable supply.  Compared with countries such as Finland, which has come very close to meeting its targets of eliminating homelessness, we have been going in the opposite direction.  One of the key differences between us and them is that we rely heavily on the private sector for units.  There is a competing demand all the time, which pushes up housing costs for first-time buyers and so forth.</p> <p> Given the issue of rent arrears in the private rented residential sector and how that will impact on local authorities dealing with homelessness, and given the increased problem of homelessness that will result when rent arrears surface once the ban on evictions is lifted, what measures is the Government considering to protect tenants and landlords in terms of rent arrears?  Will it consider initiatives such as a statutory alternative to evictions such as repayment plans, debt forgiveness schemes, mediation and so forth?</p></speech>

I will have to get the Minister to respond directly.  What I have found from talking to a number of both elected members and officials in local authorities is that the emergency response on housing during the Covid crisis has had a positive impact, by and large.  I was struck by the question from Deputy Niall Collins earlier and I ask him, if he is watching the debate somewhere, to send on the information about the four families he mentioned who experienced homelessness in the midst of the crisis.  The reports I have heard from throughout the country are very much that the local authorities are stepping up to the plate, in conjunction with voluntary housing bodies and other agencies involved in this area, to meet the demand for additional accommodation that the crisis presented over and above the homelessness figures that existed before Covid arrived on our shores.  I will ask the Minister to revert directly to the Deputy with a response to his question.</p></speech>

Departments, local authorities and businesses need to work together.  I am surprised and disappointed, therefore, at Cork County Council&rsquo;s persistence in developing a Kildare Village-style retail outlet centre in east Cork, despite the planning regulator's objection, and the fact that it is contrary to the original county development plan. </p>  <p>  Small businesses cannot compete with this kind of development.  The proposed retail outlet will further local closures and add to the existing tragic number of derelict buildings.  The Cork Business Association and University College Cork researchers have expressed concern for its negative impact on surrounding towns and the city.  Too often we are expected to jump at the mention of jobs, but the creation of jobs cannot be at the expense of existing ones. </p>  <p>  The British company behind the development promises employment, but we need only look at Debenhams to see the absence of loyalty to workers and communities from corporations.  People need dependable jobs.  For generations, shops on main streets have been providing them better than conglomerates ever can, and with that comes so much more, such as vibrant high streets, strong communities and places that attract visitors.  When visiting Cork, would someone send home a postcard depicting an industrial scale retail outlet or would he or she be more inclined to send one of Kinsale or Baltimore?   The proposed development flies in the face of shop local and buy Irish campaigns.  Moreover, it is a car-dependent model that champions fast fashion during a climate crisis.</p>  <p>  During this emergency, family businesses have gone above and beyond to help others.  Central and local government need to help keep jobs in towns and villages before they are completely hollowed out.  The planning regulator&rsquo;s independent evaluation recommended against the proposed development, stating it "fails to set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned".</p> <p>In light of Cork County Council&rsquo;s appeal, do the Minister of State and the other relevant Ministers intend to follow the independent, impartial recommendation from the Office of the Planning Regulator?  Will the Minister of State indicate the criteria for making the decision?  More broadly, post Covid-19, can the Government assure existing small business and family-run shops that local authorities will prioritise protecting and enhancing our towns and villages?</p></speech>

I would like to respond but suffice to say I wholeheartedly agree with the Deputy's points on the effect of Covid-19 on our towns and villages across the State, and with regard to the fear that exists in many of those places for the businesses on the main street or in the three or four streets that usually comprise the centre of market towns throughout the country.  Some parts of Ireland survived the worst of the last recession better than others.  Some towns in west Cork, in the Deputy's constituency, got through the last economic crisis much better than some parts of the constituency I share with Senator Murnane O'Connor.</p></speech>

I should probably be directing this question to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, but I will ask it anyway.  I have made fairly well known my views that the box-room, rabbit-hutch accommodation known as co-living is not something that should be allowed in this country.  It is just a way to make money for developers and to maximise the value of a site, rather than providing decent quality accommodation for people.  If that was true prior to the outbreak of Covid-19, and I believe it was, is there any recognition from the Government now that we must immediately shelve and prohibit these co-living developments from a public health point of view?  There is one planned in our area for 200 box apartments with shared kitchens.  I believe that 40 or 45 people are to share a kitchen.  This absolutely cannot happen in the era of Covid-19.  The council in Croydon, for example, recently approved planning for a co-living development of more than 200 units but it is now saying it cannot go through with it anymore.  Is the Government considering prohibiting these co-living developments on public health grounds?  If not, why not?  I put it to the Minister of State that all that is required is for the statutory ministerial guidelines of 2018 to be amended to prohibit these box co-living apartments.  Will the Government do this?</p></speech>

I have no responsibility on housing.  I understand the point being made, and the Deputy mentioned a local authority in another jurisdiction.  As I understand it, county and city development plans are another mechanism by which local authorities can set out the criteria under which planning applications should be judged.  We are all familiar with them.  I do not know what the local development plan in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown says on the issue of co-living.

The guidelines just need to be changed as this is public health we are talking about.  These overcrowded conditions were unacceptable from the get-go but now they just simply are not compliant with public health guidelines.  Accordingly, these guidelines should be changed.</p>  <p>  One of the rather grim facts of the Covid-19 situation is the pretty awful spike in domestic violence and violence against women which has been reported by Women's Aid, the Rape Crisis Centre and other bodies that deal with this.  That is an awful vista.  In my area, it particularly highlights something that is just unacceptable, namely that we are one of the only counties, if not the only county, that does not have a women's refuge.  For those counties which do have refuges, the capacity is not sufficient for the number of people seeking refuge when faced with domestic violence and abuse.  Is the Government doing anything about increasing the capacity for women's refuges?  At a minimum, should it not be the case that every single local authority area should have at least one women's refuge?  We have none in our area and it is a real problem that has now grown worse as a result of Covid-19.</p></speech>

Extensive consideration was given to the issue of centres in local authorities and if there was sufficient capacity.  The population of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown is around 250,000.  Some local authorities, like my own, have a population of 100,000 while others have 60,000.  There is not a uniform, one-size-fits-all solution.  In some population centres, we need more than one.  I recall from that meeting that D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown is not the only one and that there are two or three.  What was discussed at that particular meeting, with a view to being brought to the Cabinet subsequently, was the plans in place to fill the gaps in the local authority areas where there is not either a centre provided or an arrangement with an adjoining local authority area with capacity.</p>  <p>  I will get the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to respond directly to the Deputy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.485" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1522" speakername="Mick Barry" time="21:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700079#MMMM00400"><p>We were informed that for the end of March the numbers living in emergency accommodation had gone below the 10,000 mark for the first time in quite a long time.  Apart from anything else, that does relieve pressure on local authorities and it shows the value of having a ban on evictions.  There has been a crisis, however, in the private rental sector for a good while now.  It is about to get a major new twist with the Covid crisis.  There is the probability of a major spillover putting local authorities under more pressure, not just in terms of emergency accommodation, but in terms of demand for housing.</p>  <p>  Recently the Irish Property Owners Association, a landlord organisation, corresponded with its members.  Among the points it made, it stated rent is a contractual obligation and must be paid.  It stated a deferment of rent still means that rent must be paid at a future date and that tenants will be in debt.  The moratorium on rent increases and evictions runs until 27 June.  Were it to be lifted on 27 June, in a short time we would see a spike in evictions.  It would not just bring us back to the position that we had previously but could possibly far outstrip it, given the number of tenants who have fallen into rent arrears during the course of the Covid crisis.</p>  <p>  From that point of view, the Government needs to extend the moratorium in question.  I listened with interest to what the Minister said on this earlier.</p>  <p>He seemed to indicate that the thinking might be to extend it a bit in line with the reopening of the economy, but that would be completely inadequate.  Such is the build-up of rent arrears that we will have a real crisis unless the moratorium is extended for a longer period.  I would like it extended forever, but some housing campaigners are saying it should be extended into next year at a minimum, which I support.  Unfortunately, we do not have statistics on rent arrears.  However, we have a lot of anecdotal evidence, which indicates that they are piling up in a big way.  Given the high level of rents, it is not realistic to expect people to continue to pay a high level when the crisis lifts and also pay back all the arrears.  That points to the need for a scheme for writing off those rent arrears.  I accept that some smaller landlords could be impacted significantly by that, but if we put a levy on the bigger landlords such as I-RES REIT and so on, there could be a pool of money there for the State to use, and if a small landlord was in that particular situation, he or she could apply for a refund from that fund and the tenant's rent arrears could be written off.  Is the Department considering extending the moratorium and if so, is it considering 2021 as an option?  Does the Minister of State accept that many tenants will never be able to pay back the arrears and that there is a need for a scheme to write off debt?  What arrangements or preparations are being put in place to accommodate the extra demand for local authority housing that is inevitably going to arise in the next period?</p></speech>

I cannot directly answer the questions because I have no direct responsibility for housing.  When I was speaking earlier, I was paraphrasing what the Minister said last week regarding the consideration of extending the moratorium on evictions and rents.  The points the Deputy makes are valid.  I will collate all the questions relating to housing and the Minister, who is responsible for that area, will revert to him</p></speech>

They are in a state of disrepair and require work to bring them up to the standard for families to live in them.  I have spoken to council officials on many occasions regarding this matter and they have constantly told me that the council has not been given the funds by the Government to bring these homes up to the standard where families could live in them.  Many of these homes are in established residential areas where community services exist, including schools, health centres and shops.  These homes should be brought back into the housing stock immediately.  It is a disgrace that these homes continue to lie idle and fall into further disrepair.  There is a danger that many of them will become dens for drug addicts and alcoholics.  I cannot understand why the Government will not provide the council with the funds to bring these homes back into the housing stock.  Surely it would be more cost effective to retrofit these homes and bring them up to standard, rather than going ahead and putting in new homes, which seems to be what is happening.  Those homes in County Louth would take 100 families off the county council housing list.  That is 100 families who would now have a home and be moved from the homeless list.  Why can this not be done immediately?  Can the Minister of State confirm how many homes Louth County Council currently owns that are vacant because of disrepair?  Can he also confirm what plans the council has for these homes?</p> <p>Will the Minister of State also confirm what funds the Government is committed to providing to Louth County Council over the coming 18 months to provide new homes and refurbish others under the Rebuilding Ireland scheme?</p> <p> It is clear that the housing crisis has been handled badly by this Government.  Too much support was given to private developments to solve the housing crisis when we should have concentrated more on development solutions for the county councils.  As a small token of the Government's commitment to solving the housing crisis, there is an opportunity to support Louth County Council and bring these houses back to the housing stock.  Will the Minister of State confirm that he, or his Department, will help and support Louth County Council in taking these vacant houses back to the housing stock?</p></speech>

I repeat that there are vast differences between the delivery of different services depending on local authority areas.  Louth County Council is a great example of an authority that is at the cutting edge in the issue of dereliction and bringing buildings that are derelict back into use.  The council has used compulsory purchase orders and I know that compulsory sales orders are also being discussed.</p>  <p>  I am surprised by the comment from Louth County Council about voids because there has been an unprecedented level of funding from the Department.  I will have to ask Deputy English to respond directly to the Deputy with the figure for Louth but in terms of the speed at which houses are being turned around, that figure has been dramatically cut in the past few years.  On the specific funding to local authorities to deal with voids, some local authorities are better than others at delivering and drawing down funding under different headings but there has been an unprecedented amount of resources and capacity devoted, at Department level, to ensuring that voids are returned to use quicker than previously was the case.  I could name a couple of local authority areas where I know, from first-hand experience, that the turnaround of voids has been noticeably improved in the past couple of years.  I will ask the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban development, Deputy English, to furnish Deputy Fitzpatrick with the specific information for Louth.  From a Government perspective, the issue is not caused by a lack of funding from central government.  This issue, on the face of it, sounds like a classic example of where service delivery varies from local authority to local authority.  It is not because there is a shortage of funding.</p></speech>

There are also big towns such as Ardee and Carlingford.  I go through these towns on a daily basis and the amount of houses that are boarded up is an absolute disgrace.  Every time I approach the county manager or the housing manager, they tell me that the Government will not give them money.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could contact the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister of State, Deputy English, because this has been going on for far too long.  One hears about hundreds of millions, or even billions, being invested in housing.  There are more than 100 families who could be allocated these houses with the expenditure of a small amount of money.  I ask the Minister of State to do that.</p>  <p>  I deal with constituents on a daily basis in respect of their loan applications under the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme.  It was introduced with great fanfare and promised to help people to get onto the property ladder more easily.  My experience of the scheme has been different.  A constituent of mine is in a difficult situation with regard to this scheme.  He was approved for a loan under the scheme in early December 2019, sourced a suitable home and agreed to purchase it in late February 2020.  He paid a holding deposit of &euro;5,000 to the auctioneer and proceeded to get the surveys and all the other bits and pieces he needed to get done at his own cost.  He is now in a position to close the purchase of this family home and has been attempting to contact the local authority for over two weeks.  He has learned that the person responsible for his case is, unfortunately, out of work due to illness.  He is now being advised by the council that it will not be processing any more of the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme applications as they are not deemed to be part of an essential service.  It is now May and no definite decision has been made as to when the council can reopen to the public what is, in my opinion, an essential service.</p>  <p>  This person's approval is due to expire shortly and he is afraid of his life of losing his house.  He is currently working from home and his company is due to reopen towards the end of June.</p> <p>If this approval expires due to no fault of his own, his biggest problem is he is afraid of losing this home.  At present, he is living with his parents, who are both in their 70s and cocooning.  This man has for years tried to save up a lot of money.  Can the Minister of State reassure me about this applicant?  After this, I will forward his details to the Minister of State.  This is not only happening in Louth.  I am sure it is happening everywhere else.  Can the Minister of State give me a guarantee that the person I am talking about and others like him will get the money?</p></speech>

However, I fully understand the point the Deputy is making.  The person in question is obviously afraid that he will lose the house that he has identified under the scheme.</p>  <p>  At different points during the measures the Government has announced and different agencies have implemented across the State, there have been adjustments and changes.  In relation to the Property Registration Authority, there was a particular bottleneck identified and working with that agency, it was able to be dealt with.  I do not see why the Department, working with each local authority, cannot ensure that people in the situation Deputy Fitzpatrick outlined and who are worried about losing a house they have identified would be dealt with.  My officials will contact the local authority directly on the issue.  In the broader sense, that it would fall under essential services in the reopening of services by local authorities is a valid question and something I would like to see happen.</p></speech>

For the past number of years, I have been challenging the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister of State, Deputy English.  In the past two or three years, they keep telling me it is the European court and this and that will be sorted out.  People who live in villages, who want to stay in their own community and who want to build their own house cannot get planning permission.  These can be farmers' sons and daughters.  I do not know why it is so because in certain parts of the country, one can build a house anywhere.  In my native county of Louth, the number of people who cannot build houses in a rural area is significant.  I can understand the difficulty in urban areas of getting a house at present with density and everything else, but people want to go home and live beside their family.  As people get older, they want their family beside them.  What is the plan with local needs going forward?</p></speech>

There are plenty of people in Ireland who would not like to see any more houses built in rural areas for ideological reasons but it is crucially important for the future of the shops, the post offices, the schools and the clubs, not just people who have strong obvious local links-----</p></speech>

Unfortunately, at the instructions of Ms Justice Reynolds, yesterday morning at cockcrow a force of 20 garda&iacute; evicted four different people from a house in Clontarf and brought them before the courts, and rendered them homeless at the behest of vulture funds.  This is going on all the time at pace, in spite of commitments that it would not go on.  I want the Minister of State to investigate it and have the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, investigate it as well.</p>  <p>  I have to give credit to our local authorities and their staff and the services, along with the local media and local radio, and of course, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and all the community groups which have worked so hard and rose to the challenge, as they always would do.</p>  <p>  One issue I have is the anomaly with the local authority restart grant for those who are not operating out of rated commercial premises.  I refer to people who operate their businesses from their van such as the construction workers or owner-operated lorries delivering concrete or blocks.  There are many such businesses, including a plethora of taxi drivers and mini-bus drivers for school runs and everything else.  They cannot get a bob because they are not rateable.  They are parked outside the house.  Theirs is a mobile and uncertain business and they were significantly affected in the previous economic crisis.</p>  <p>  On a local authority level, some of the questions have been raised by other Deputies.  How does the Department envisage supporting local authorities to continue with their full services, despite the large amount in respect of the rates holiday?  They will not be able to collect the rates from businesses, which will not be able to pay them this year if we do not change soon, cop ourselves on and facilitate the small businesses, which are the backbone of rural Ireland.</p> <p>We can get the Tescos, Aldis and all the rest open but the small man behind the counter who is employing two or three, supporting every community issue and providing all the spot prizes is not allowed to do anything.  The ridiculous 2 m rule is an issue.  I see the Cabinet was overruled again today by Dr. Holohan.  Who is in charge here?  I am aware the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan, is not in the Cabinet but, by goodness, it is strange that one man can dictate to seven or eight members of the Cabinet and the whole country.  It is time this nonsense were stopped and that the people were supported.</p> <p> The local enterprise offices have been brilliant and very helpful during the lockdown, having had a number of progressive and engaging schemes since the start.  From my engagement with the staff in the offices, I am aware that schemes have been totally oversubscribed.  We see that.  An example is the business continuity grant.  Will the Department consider extending the funding for the schemes?  The offices are doing great work and there is no point in having the schemes oversubscribed.  They were announced in a fanfare and now people are going to be disappointed.  The local enterprise offices are vital.</p> <p> On the LEADER companies, we must get LEADER back to where it belonged - of the people, by the people and for the people.  There was a smash and grab by the local authorities and Big Phil, the Minister of State's former colleague, destroyed what was recognised throughout Europe as a model to be worked on.</p> <p> I fear for the future of schemes such as the town and village renewal scheme.  The schemes have proven to be beneficial in our communities.  I am referring to where groups have been awarded funding but have not had the opportunity to date to work due to the lockdown.  They fear they might not be able to get the work completed, given the tender process and everything else.  I met the secretary of a Muintir na T&iacute;re group this morning in my village, Newcastle.  I salute the community there.  The secretary was out for the first time in ages.  She was cocooning and looking after her husband, and rightly so.  She is worried and wondering whether the work will get done, whether the money will be pulled or whether the grant will be honoured.  God help us, I do not know where we are going to go next year.</p> <p> The local improvement scheme is great.  We have funding in Tipperary this year.  It is not have enough but the scheme is wonderful.  It was wiped off after the most recent economic recession.  Will it be an easy target again?  The rural people are entitled to have these schemes.</p> <p> Why has the Department not announced the community involvement scheme funding?  It is overdue.  It is the end of May but the rural works would normally start before St Patrick's Day.  Why has the funding not yet been announced to councils?</p> <p> Mar fhocal scoir, I would appreciate it if the Minister of State wrote back to me with replies.  Small businesses, including hairdressers, are ready.  I saw the job Willie Walsh in Clonmel has done to get ready.  The businesses have to be allowed to operate.  They are the backbone of the economy.  They bring people into the town and these people go to the coffee shop and elsewhere.  The black market is thriving.  There must be common sense here.  The 2 m rule is ridiculous.  As far as getting a pint in a small pub is concerned, I do not know when we will have one.  I wish we had one before.  Small pubs cannot operate according to the 2 m rule.  It is patent nonsense.</p> <p> We all talk about and give out about Hungary and have said here that powers were grabbed there.  The Minister of State's leader and the Fianna F&aacute;il leader attacked Mr. Viktor Orb&aacute;n, the Hungarian Prime Minister.  The Hungarians kept the number of deaths down to 500, although it has many borders.  The Republic of Ireland is almost an island; we share one border, with Northern Ireland.  Bearing in mind our ineptitude over the sealing of the ports, we should note that Hungary is back up and running and has opened its borders.  Hungary had 500 deaths, although it has a population two and a half times greater than ours.  We had 1,600 deaths and this number is growing.  I said earlier this evening there has been a scam, a scamdemic, over this pandemic.  We need answers.</p></speech>

I thank Radio Kerry, the Garda and all the voluntary workers around the county who have done tremendous work for people cocooning and those who are very isolated.</p>  <p>  It is only now that we realise the value of businesses and employers.  I have mentioned several times here that Friday evening is not long coming when someone has a team of men or women to pay.  These are the very people who are paying for each and every one of us here.  Consider what happens when they stop working.  We see now there are no rates.  There has been a lot of commotion over extending the three-month waiver in respect of the rates but in Kerry County Council there has always been a waiver system or reduction system for those not working or whose turnover is reduced, no thanks to the current Government.  The question is whether the Government will replenish the money that would normally come in from the businesses to keep the services going.</p> <p>Does the Minister of State or his Department have anything to do with the cut to the travel allowance for workers in our local authority?  It is very wrong to cut the travel allowance of these people, who are under a lot of pressure to keep services going.  Temporary workers have also been told that their contracts will not be renewed even though some have been working for the local authority for two or three years.  That is not fair or right.  They threw their lot in with the local authority.  We are going to have reduced services if we have a reduced workforce.</p> <p> On infrastructural projects, we have been promised that we will work our way out of this financial problem.  I appeal to the Government to keep infrastructural projects that are ready to go, such as road and water schemes, on track and to keep them going.  I ask the Government to ensure that the roads programme is not cut because, as Deputy Mattie McGrath said with regard to local improvement schemes and community involvement schemes, people in rural Ireland, including in Kerry, are every bit as entitled to good roads to their doors as people in Dublin 4.</p> <p> With regard to planning in rural areas, perhaps the powers that be will now realise the value of people living in rural Ireland.  They are isolated from these kinds of viruses.  Perhaps we will now appreciate the value of people living in rural Ireland instead of living on top of one another here in Dublin.  With regard to rural cottages and demountable homes, the previous Government certainly let rural Ireland down.  For the period 2016 to 2021, 13 rural cottages are to be built in Kerry even though there are almost 70 people on a list who wish to build houses on their own land, possibly their farms, to be near their own people.  We have had only one demountable home sited in the past three years.  When a house in which an elderly man lived fell into disrepair, the local authority used to bring in a demountable home in which he could remain until the end of his days.  </p> <p> Applicants are being excluded from the housing list.  Perhaps that is how the Government is reducing the numbers on it.  When a couple with three children begins to earn more than &euro;33,600, they are thrown off the list.  Who could buy a house or get a mortgage on that income?  It is totally unacceptable.</p> <p> I ask the Government to keep the Killarney bypass progressing on track.  I ask that the doors of the local authority buildings that supply and deliver services be opened as soon as possible.  When the bank and shop on a street is open, what difference would it make to open the doors of the local authority in order to bring normality back to our country?</p></speech>

I join in that tribute.  They have shown us the way forward.  If we have learned anything, it is that we cannot go back.  We must go forward with a completely different vision.  Development in Galway has not been sustainable for a very long time.</p>  <p>  I know the Minister of State cannot answer questions on housing but it is important that I put the situation in Galway in perspective.  I am aware of somebody who will be on a waiting list for 15 years in July and who has never once been offered a house in those 15 years.  That really shows the measure of the housing crisis in Galway.  A mother with three children will be on the waiting list for ten years in October.  She has been in emergency accommodation for two years.  She and her children are in student accommodation courtesy of the university for the summer.  They will then probably go back to bed and breakfast accommodation.  That is the extent of the housing crisis in Galway.  That is just a pen picture.</p> <p> The market in Galway opened last week, which was positive, except that it was closed by the Garda later in the day for failure to comply with social distancing.  It seems to me that this good news story was absolutely spoiled by a failure to anticipate what might happen in advance and take proper precautions in a proactive and positive way.  I ask the Minister of State to look at the guidelines issued to the local authorities so that they can comply with them, rather than having those guidelines make their life difficult.  It is a similar situation with allotments, which should never have been closed.  That only happened because of a rigid interpretation of the guidelines from Departments, which was nonsensical.</p> <p> The vacant site levy has been mentioned by a Sinn F&eacute;in colleague.  The source of that information is the Parliamentary Budget Office, which I thank for the tremendous work it has done.  The Minister of State might read its report.  It tells us that the local authorities have repeatedly brought to the Department's attention the difficulties in the administration of the vacant site levy in terms of lack of staff, inconsistency and difficulties interpreting and enforcing the legislation.  That issue has been brought repeatedly to the attention of the Minister of State.  The most damning thing that stands out in the information provided is that the local authorities have suggested that approximately 18,000 total units could be added to the housing stock if they were able to implement the levy properly.</p> <p> It is really back in the Department's lap to look at the problems the local authorities have highlighted repeatedly to the Minister of State.  I am not in the game of blaming local authorities, which is what he seems to be doing.  I spent 17 years in local government and I know the local authorities inside out.  Indeed, I have been extremely critical of them, and continue to be so, for their failure to deal with the housing crisis.  However, for a long time, there was no funding.  At any given time, there are 70 empty properties in Galway.  It is an absolute scandal and I am not sure what the Minister of State's Department is doing in that regard.</p> <p> Finally, I wish to raise the failure by local authorities, particularly Galway County Council on this occasion, to draw down and use moneys.  It has meant that vital work on na c&eacute;anna ar Inis Me&aacute;in agus Inis O&iacute;rr was not done.  The Minister of State's colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, Senator Kyne, has been extremely critical of the county council in this regard.  Again, I am not sure the blame game is the best way to look at this.  There needs to be an analysis by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government of what has happened that such vital work, with health and safety implications, was not done.  The work needed on the quay on Inis O&iacute;rr is minor relative to what is needed on Inis Me&aacute;in, but it does require safety railings, by-laws and so on.  None of this has happened.  Nothing has happened with c&eacute;im a tr&iacute; maidir leis an gc&eacute; ar Inis Me&aacute;in.  Where does the interaction between the Department and the local authority come?</p> <p> I have not left the Minister of State much time to answer but I thought that if I raised the issues, he might reflect on them and come back to me.  I have asked, first, about empty houses in Galway; second, about the seriousness of the housing crisis; and, third, about the failure to utilise moneys that are available.  In the case of the latter, is that due to a lack of staff?  Certainly, all their energy, and all my energy, for quite some time was taken up with preventing the amalgamation and highlighting the lack of resources to both local authorities, particularly the county council.</p></speech>

One of the advantages of being the final speaker is that one has the opportunity to hear what is said during the debate, some of which I have been listening to in my office.  I raise the issue of the rates waiver.  Three months was a good start but, as the Minister of State knows, some businesses will not be able to reopen after three months.  Of those which do, perhaps in three or four months' time or whatever, many will take a long time to return to profitability.  The last thing they want to think about is being faced with a rates bill they cannot pay.  The Minister of State will correct me if I am wrong but I thought I heard him say that the Government is actively considering - perhaps it is even in its plan - to extend the rates waiver.  I ask that he also consider, when people are back in business, a <i>pro rata</i>rate payment to reflect the level of profitability of businesses.</p> <p>The other side of that, of course, is the local authorities.  They are starved of funding.  It is not just the loss of rates but also the loss of parking fees, planning permission fees and so forth.  The Minister of State said that the three months of rates money would be in the bank accounts of local authorities in early or mid-June.  That is good news.  They will be delighted.  However, is the Minister of State also considering assisting those local authorities with income forgone from the areas I mentioned such as parking and so forth?  What precise commitments can he make?</p> <p> My final question has been raised by a number of other Deputies.  In a Zoom call with Leitrim County Council last Monday one councillor after another raised the issue of one-off rural housing as their highest priority.  The Minister of State's party councillors were the same as the others.  The problem is that in 2019, planning permission for just two one-off houses was granted in County Leitrim.  We all talk about remote working from home.  Unless the people in County Leitrim are to be denied that possibility there must be a change in how planning regulations are implemented.  I am not saying there are no issues because there are.  There are issues with soil suitability, for example, but there are innovative solutions.  My request is that we stop looking at this with an urban mindset or from an ideological perspective.  We should try to find solutions.  It will be good for the environment, with fewer car journeys and fewer CO2 emissions.  Issues with childcare can be more flexible and there can be a better work-life balance for people.  There are many wins here, but the mindset must change.  The Minister of State said he was close to completing guidelines or regulations on the building of one-off houses.  Will he examine this issue with an open mind and a willingness to find solutions?</p></speech>

It has to be far too much ideology in terms of rural planning in general.  It is a multifaceted answer but there are two obvious issues.  First, there are the serviced sites on the edges of our towns and villages.  There is also the dispersed rural housing, the once-off rural house.  I am acutely familiar with some of the issues in Leitrim.  The guidelines I referred to are as a result of the European Court of Justice decision - I cannot remember the name of the case - that kicked out our local need criterion as it currently stands.  I believe we must drop the blinkers that apply in some quarters to the issue of rural housing and recognise that, in the midst of the crisis we have had, there have been huge advantages for people living in rural areas both for themselves and their families and also for the rural communities.</p></speech>

These are truly extraordinary circumstances.  I know he is used to it at this stage but even though I think I am jointly the longest serving Deputy in the House at the moment, I am certainly not used to these circumstances.  However, I am glad to have the opportunity to account for my stewardship as a caretaker Minister.</p>  <p>  I want first to thank my officials and the agencies under my remit for their work during the Covid-19 crisis because they have literally kept the lights on, kept our communications network intact, kept our waste collection systems going, kept us informed of what is happening and delivered objective information.  It has been a very important service and we only realise the importance of many of the services when they are challenged in this way.</p>  <p>  To go through them briefly, obviously, electricity and gas are crucial to the service at this time and indeed all the time.  We have made sure that they have delivered efficiently and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, has played a very considerable role in that.  We have protected people by suspending all domestic gas and electricity disconnections, as Deputies know.  We have made other changes to make sure that people do not run into difficulties on billing and other such problems that could arise.  We have continued to press on with our renewable energy auctions, which I know for many Members are very important as we seek to make our electricity network more sustainable and dependent on renewable electricity.</p>  <p>  In terms of broadcasting, people will know the sterling service that RT&Eacute; in particular and TG4 have delivered but also the local radio stations.  It will be no surprise to Members of the House to hear that there have been difficulties in terms of revenue streams for those bodies.  We are in discussions with RT&Eacute; about its particular problems, and NewERA is involved to see how we can find some solutions together.</p>  <p>  In terms of the local broadcasters, I was in a position to bring in some measures that have been of help to them such as suspending the broadcasting levy for six months, which is worth &euro;1 million to them; having a round of Sound &amp;amp; Vision 4 funding of &euro;2.5 million; and there is an additional round for community radio of &euro;750,000.  That has given some relief to these very important channels of communication that have been so important in getting fair and objective information to people at a time of tremendous worry.</p>  <p>  Members will realise that the communications network has come under particular pressure and it has stood up well to that pressure.  It is delivering far greater service.  We have assisted that by releasing additional rights of use for radio spectrum on a temporary basis, and that has helped.  The retail providers have signed up to a seven-point charter which ComReg has negotiated with them and that has been of value to service users.  Importantly, a complaints mechanism run by ComReg is particularly useful.</p>  <p>  People will not be surprised when I give a plug to the national broadband plan, which I know came in for considerable criticism in the previous D&aacute;il, but in this crisis people can see the value of services like ehealth, being able to be connected regardless of where one is living and having the opportunity of remote working.</p> <p>The reasons we pushed ahead with that are becoming clearer to people and the benefits of delivering service remotely are also more valued.  I have asked my officials to investigate the feasibility of accelerating the roll-out of the national broadband plan so that those now in years six and seven can be brought forward.  The target is to try, from the second half of next year, to accelerate the roll-out.  I hope that can be achieved and I think it is a very important service.</p> <p> An Post has been very imaginative in its response to the Covid crisis.  It has the check-in service that many people know about.  It has helped to deliver Government booklets on Covid and also delivered many other services that people have valued.  It has launched its 3.2 million free postcards.  It recently launched &euro;2 million of practical supports for businesses that are trying to get back to full operation.  That has certainly helped.</p> <p> We have liaised with the waste management service.  It is answerable to local authorities in the first instance, but that service has continued to deliver.  It has had to cope with more household waste but less commercial waste.  We have provided some ring-fenced money to have an anti-dumping initiative during this Covid crisis.  I know that has been a real problem.</p> <p> I know we are restricted on time.  The Covid crisis has brought into sharp relief the scale of the climate challenge that we face.  While this is a significant shock to our economy and society, it is important as we build a recovery that we seek to embed the structural changes that have been accelerated by this experience so that we have a different way of working and a different consciousness of the problem of protecting our environment and also reducing our use of fossil fuels.  There is an opportunity as people re-evaluate their priorities in a society and economy that is opening up that we seek to embed the changes and build momentum to address the climate challenge.  The last D&aacute;il unanimously passed a declaration of emergency in this respect.  It is up to this House to carry on and deliver the ambitions embedded in that motion.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.518" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1475" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="23:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700088#ZZZZ00300"><p>I am sharing time with a few colleagues.  I will be slipping out to let them in.  I pay tribute to the staff on the front line and offer my sympathies to all those who have lost their lives due to Covid-19.  It has taken more than 1,600 lives in Ireland and more than 350,000 worldwide, caused untold mental strain, severely damaged businesses and disrupted many young people's education.  Every single person across this country has had to make sacrifices as we continue to grapple with this problem.  Amid all the suffering, hardship and uncertainty, there has been one good change, as the Minister referred to, which is in emissions.  While the true extent of our emissions reductions will not be fully known until next year, the early indications by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland are that we will see a 12% drop.  The actions which have been required to achieve this are not sustainable in the short-term and many will be lost in the coming months.  However, while this reversal may be necessary, many important lessons have been learned, which should now be added to the actions required to tackle climate change properly and meet our commitments.</p>  <p>  If we are to achieve the goal of decoupling economic growth from carbon emissions as we recover, we must act.  We must act on issues relating to transport, energy and retrofitting and embrace the climate opportunity and a new green deal so that we can properly decarbonise our economy.  The soft barriers to working from home on an unprecedented scale have been removed.  Employer concerns in particular have been addressed by the necessity of our circumstances.  While barriers exist for those without high quality broadband, many who need to access childcare and others are now open to the potential for long-term practices to be developed.  The large-scale closure of businesses was necessary to prevent further loss of life.  It is a reality that some of those businesses will never reopen.  The coming years will require a significant increase in reskilling and retraining and the process is something we hope to provide.</p> <p>The reskilling process can address some of the key concerns over the scale of retrofitting which is required if we are to scale up our climate ambition.  It could also support the development of the expertise required to undertake the next phase of the roll-out of offshore wind energy which needs to be prioritised if a new government is formed.</p> <p> These will be issues for the next government and the forthcoming recovery.  However, two issues need urgent attention and action on behalf of the Department.  The first relates to the recommendations of the just transition commissioner.  I welcome Kieran Mulvey's report.  My colleague, Deputy Cowen, and I have been in touch with the Minister about this.  We are five months into 2020 and not a cent of the just transition fund has been spent as far as I am aware.  This needs to be urgently addressed.  The midlands were already experiencing job losses as a result of decarbonisation.</p> <p> The second issue is the ongoing crisis in public service journalism.  As the Minister knows, print newspapers are experiencing serious short-term declines in advertising revenue and reductions in circulation numbers as a result of the ongoing crisis.  While the Minister has announced supports for radio and a review of RT&Eacute; is under way, we have seen nothing from Government for some local and regional newspapers.  An Post has stepped into the breach to provide some supports, but these are limited through no fault of An Post's.  For example, particular difficulties exist for free publications which are reliant on advertising.  Unfortunately, some of them have collapsed which will have a major effect on local journalism in many areas.</p> <p> I accept the Minister will say he has no responsibility for this element of public service journalism.  However, he has responsibility for all the other major elements.  I have written to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, on the issue and it has also been raised with the Department of the Taoiseach.  While I received a response from the Minister, it gives no indication of any targeted measures being introduced.  We urgently need ownership of this issue.  Without this we risk more closures, job losses and lay-offs.  While some may be inevitable, others may not.</p> <p> I would welcome the Minister's comments.  As I have 50 seconds of my own time, I would appreciate if he was brief.  What is the Government doing for public service journalism specifically?  The Minister needs to provide some actions in that area or else we will see other newspapers collapse.</p></speech>

I am extremely concerned about its impact on young people, children, the elderly, people who are suffering from non-Covid illnesses, our economy and indeed those people in society who are the most financially insecure.  I am also concerned that too much responsibility has casually been delegated by Government to our public health advisers.</p>  <p>  As I said previously, it made absolute sense back in March that we introduced measures for the lockdown.  In fact, I was critical that we had not introduced some soon enough, such as restrictions on travel into the country from Italy.  However, now we need to recognise that the process of lifting the lockdown provisions needs to be expedited.  I call on the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to take that back to his colleagues in government.</p>  <p>  We note that the numbers of deaths have fortunately reduced quite significantly.  When looked at objectively at present, the death numbers in Ireland were quite high but we have managed to get the death numbers down and we have also got the number of cases down.</p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that it is the job of our public health advisers to provide public health advice, but it is not their job to weigh that public health advice along with other factors.  That is the function of Government.  The Government needs to start introducing some balance and proportionality into the decisions it is about to make as to when and whether the restrictions should be lifted.  As I said, I believe they need to be lifted sooner rather than later.</p>  <p>  The reality, as I said previously, is that we will need to continue to live with Covid.  We need to recognise that we will have to live with a certain amount of risk.  It has never been the case that public health advice was mandatory on people.  We also need to recognise that the purpose of the lockdown was to stop our hospital intensive care units being overrun.  However, we cannot now transform the purpose of the lockdown into being that we want to use it for the purpose of stopping people getting sick.  That was never the purpose of the lockdown and it would be highly unusual if that was to be the purpose of its continuance.  The Government has been extremely cautious to date.  I can understand why politicians are extremely cautious because if they get it wrong, they get heavily criticised.</p> <p>I ask the Minister to take back to Cabinet the message that we need to be less cautious in expediting the lifting of the restrictions.  There will be a benefit if they are lifted sooner rather than later.  They should not be left in place simply because it is the cautious and safe thing to do.  A dichotomy is developing between those who are economically secure and those who are not.  We need to take into account the latter, as well as the broad impact the lockdown is having on our society.  I ask the Minister to speak up at Cabinet and I call on the Government to get its testing regime in place.  That is at the heart of curing this problem and enabling society to get going again.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.523" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1456" speakername="Michael Moynihan" time="23:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700090#BBBBB00200"><p>We could discuss a raft of issues that fall within the remit of the Department but I will focus on broadband and working from home.  In recent months, society has changed in ways we could not have possibly imagined.  Policymakers would have argued that it was not possible to work in these ways because a raft of barriers was preventing decentralisation and so on.  Working from home has worked and is being enabled by broadband.  There are two issues with broadband.  One relates to the current contract with Eir under which the provision of broadband stops at a particular line, for example, a junction beyond which there may be two, three or four houses.  There must be flexibility in that regard.  The House discussed this last September or October.  The matter was not treated with the urgency that was needed.  I could name places in my constituency where extending the coverage of the Eir contract by 150 or 200 yards would take in several more houses.  I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices to ensure flexibility in the contract so that people can get a broadband connection because they are getting very frustrated.</p>  <p>  The Minister stated he had asked his officials to increase pressure to expedite the roll-out of rural broadband.  The events of recent months have shown us that we can be connected and we can all be equally productive, whether we live in north Cork, large urban centres or rural communities.  We need to do more than hurry on rural broadband.  The issue must be at the centre of government.  This is a policy that can change and transform society.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.524" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1597" speakername="Joe Flaherty" time="23:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700090#BBBBB00300"><p>I grew up in the shadow of the ESB power station in Lanesborough and the broad, majestic Mount Dillon boglands were the backdrop to my youth.  For 75 years, our community was the cradle of the Irish energy revolution.  Now, with the race to decarbonise with bright, new, shiny alternatives, we are unfortunately no longer fashionable.  We must remember that Bord na M&oacute;na led one of the most ambitious housebuilding programmes in this country, building housing estates for its workers right across the midlands.  Bord na M&oacute;na and ESB workers did much more than power this country from the banks of the River Shannon.  They built communities and how we go about repaying that commitment will probably define the success or otherwise of the just transition fund.</p>  <p>  I have not met a Bord na M&oacute;na or ESB worker who does not accept and understand the need for decarbonisation, but they do not want to be afterthoughts in the process as we set about dismantling what has been a core part of our communities.  We must also get real about the money.  Currently, the fund stands at &euro;11 million.  When we closed the sugar industry in 2005, a fund of &euro;145 million was provided.  The just transition commissioner, Mr. Kieran Mulvey, has said that the fund needs additional financial muscle.  It is also imperative that a mechanism is found to compensate Longford County Council for its annual loss of more than &euro;1 million in commercial rates.  Decisions taken by two semi-State companies and the move towards decarbonisation are set to dismantle 75 years of town, country and community in my county.  I welcome Mr. Mulvey's call to replicate the Border region Brexit package which is worth &euro;28 million.</p> <p>We need a similar enterprise-led package for the just transition fund area.  I would also expect this House to support Mr. Mulvey's call to increase the fund next year to &euro;25 million from the carbon tax allocation.</p> <p> It behoves me to tell the Minister that the people of south Longford have given blood, sweat and tears to Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB over those 75 years.  Many local groups, projects, local enterprises and Longford County Council will make robust submissions to the EU Start engagement process next month.  I appreciate that Mr. Mulvey has said there will be a geographical spread criterion when it comes to the allocation of funding, but the process must allow a weighting for the immeasurable contribution of my community to the Irish energy revolution and the now detrimental impact on the community following the sudden dismantling of an entire sector with the flick of a proverbial switch.</p></speech>

I too acknowledge the fabulous work An Post has done in connecting in with people in recent weeks.  However, the two issues I wish to address this evening are broadband and our new engagement with social media.  Is the Department engaging with the Department of Education and Skills on creating a heat map to ensure teachers have connectivity to deliver the class work that is required in the event of a second wave of Covid and that they are able to continue to support children, especially secondary school children in examination years?  One of the downsides that has emerged in the education debate is that not every teacher or child had the opportunity to log on.  We have an opportunity now to create a heat map and see exactly where teachers are located.  It is only a matter of the teachers linking in with schools to provide their Eircodes and then identifying what sort of broadband service they have.</p>  <p>  The next part of my question relates to communication with social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, which are based here in Ireland.  Have they continued to work at full speed to address online bullying and hate speech?  Has a full suite of measures been put in place to ensure that children are protected online?  It is not just children that need to be protected online; adults also need protection online.  In the past 72 hours, I have been the subject of online bullying.  As politicians, we all understand exactly what it is like.  It is incumbent on us to address the issue.  The parties to my right must ensure they lead by example and must not lead out on hate speech or vicious, vulgar attacks on people online.</p></speech>

I want to go over and back during the time if that is possible.</p>  <p>  I want to deal with two issues very quickly.  We only have six minutes so I would appreciate if the Minister could be as succinct as I will be in putting the questions.  The first is on the just transition fund after which I will ask questions about the media.  There are three key parts to the just transition strategy, namely, the just transition fund, the midlands retrofitting, and peatland rehabilitation.  How many of these parts are currently in operation?</p></speech>

Interested groups can register under an arrangement that is already in place with the councils.  We will publish the final criteria in about three weeks and we will have the selection thereafter.</p>  <p>  The contract has already been awarded for the first tranche of bog restoration.  Bord na M&oacute;na won that contract and it is being rolled out.</p>  <p>  The retrofit programme is at a very advanced stage of preparation in terms of identifying how the tenders will be delivered and the homes that will be used.  Unfortunately, due to Covid-19 the important next stage of surveying the work before the issue of tenders has not been possible.  Until the Covid-19 restrictions allow indoor surveys, we will not be in a position to press "Go".</p> <p>Moreover, a lot of the retrofitting will involve indoor work.  Again, it has been postponed until a later stage in the phased relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions.</p></speech>

How many of those are benefitting from either the just transition fund or the retrofit programme at this point?  The answer is "None of them".  The Minister says these initiatives are at an advanced stage and the just transition fund is open for tenders, but a lot of those workers are worried that their jobs will be gone by the end of this year and the just transition fund will pass them by.  How many of the workers in Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB are due to lose their jobs at the end of the year?</p></speech>

Roughly 180 workers who are directly involved in the plants' operations will not be retained.  Unfortunately there have been other requirements on Bord na M&oacute;na as a result of Covid-19.  There has been a decline in electricity demand, which has resulted in less use of the higher-cost solid fuel elements Bord na M&oacute;na provides.  That has resulted in the company having to put people on temporary-----</p></speech>

He gave it to me and then he waffled about other issues that have nothing to do with the question I asked.  There is every prospect that a lot of the workers who are going to lose their jobs will never see a transition.  Unless the Minister puts his skates on, the only transition they will see is a transition from their current jobs onto the dole queue.  There will be no just transition.</p>  <p>  I have two minutes left.  I wish to ask a question about the media.  I would like to ask the Minister very directly whether he has received any requests for additional funding from RT&Eacute;.  We know that RT&Eacute; is benefitting from the wage subsidy scheme, which means it has seen a reduction in its revenue of at least 25%.  In response to a parliamentary question I submitted, the Minister stated that he was waiting for a report from RT&Eacute; on issues the broadcaster faced prior to Covid-19.  Has the Minister had any recent requests for additional funding?  If so, what was the nature of that request? </p></speech>

The National Parks and Wildlife Service's bog restoration programme will create 40 jobs.  Bord na M&oacute;na has won that tender.  The advanced rehabilitation of Bord na M&oacute;na's bogs will create more than 200 jobs.  The company intends to start that work before the end of the year.  The retrofitting of homes in the midlands will provide 400 jobs.  We are taking definite steps to ensure that workers in Bord na M&oacute;na have the opportunity to reskill to obtain those jobs.  We are seeking to create employment opportunities for those who are displaced.</p>  <p>  I have discussed RT&Eacute;'s funding problems with both the chairman and the director general.  As Members can imagine, advertising revenue has taken a severe hit.  Revenue has decreased very significantly.  As a consequence of that we have commenced an evaluation, to be carried out by NewERA, which advises the Government in its capacity as shareholder.  This review will work out what changes are necessary and how to address RT&Eacute;'s funding needs.  That work is ongoing.  I or my successor will be in a position to report to the House in due course.</p></speech>

I raised some of these issues with the Minister by email at the end of April.  At that time, between 190 and 230 Bord na M&oacute;na workers were laid off due to the impact of Covid-19.  That was the reason given to employees in Bord na M&oacute;na's direct communication with them.</p> <p>At that time, they put some workers on the wage subsidy scheme and left the majority of seasonal and contract workers with nothing.  These seasonal workers were given a couple of days' notice in writing and were told their jobs and income were gone.  This was a disgraceful way for Bord na M&oacute;na to treat the employees.  In a very selective way, Bord na M&oacute;na decided who would be kept on or let go, whose wages would be secured, and who would receive a letter to say they might be eligible for the pandemic unemployment payment.  They are workers with mortgages, families and bills, and they have been affected in the same way as any other worker from Covid-19, yet they have been treated very differently.  The loss of wages does not impact just on the individuals and their families but also on local economies and communities, from Lanesborough and Shannonbridge to Blackwater bog.</p> <p> I also raise the issue of the alternative work being offered to laid-off workers, again on a selective nature to some employees.  I understand that some of the job offers are in Dublin.  Given that 24,000 commuters from that region travel to Dublin, mostly for college and work every day, we need to be looking for alternative work in the area and not push more and more people into Dublin.</p> <p> We need clarity from Bord na M&oacute;na on the redundancy severance packages it is offering to workers.  Some workers have sought redundancy but have not been able to access it, and there are concerns for workers who have been laid off and whether this will negatively impact on their redundancy payments.</p> <p> Is it acceptable that some workers at Bord na M&oacute;na are being locked out from the wage subsidy scheme?  Will the Minister seek clarity from Bord na M&oacute;na on the alternative job opportunities it is offering to some employees who are being recalled for work?  Such opportunities should be available to as many workers as possible and not just be on a selective basis.  Finally, will the Minister ensure that workers have full access to information about redundancy?</p> <p> The idea put forward by Kieran Mulvey for the midlands to become an energy hub is exciting and we all welcome it, but a just transition for the many towns and villages that will be directly impacted by the early exit of peat is crucial.  Entire communities, families and businesses depend on us to get this right and, unfortunately, time is not on our side.</p></speech>

Bord na M&oacute;na has topped up the temporary wage subsidy, so people are retaining their full basic wage.  I understand that seasonal workers are eligible for the pandemic unemployment payment.  They are not part of the full-time staff.</p>  <p>  On the other issues the Deputy raised in respect of industrial relations matters, the company has responsibility and trade unions are involved.  I do not get involved in the day-to-day decision making of the type the Deputy outlined.</p></speech>

As a result, hundreds of jobs are in jeopardy-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.545" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1491" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="23:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700093#EEEEE00500"><p>I will congratulate him on that in a moment.  Turf cutters in Laois, Offaly and throughout the midlands who depend on Bord na M&oacute;na plots have not been able to cut one sod of turf.  Thousands of households throughout the midlands, from Laois and Offaly up to Roscommon, depend on this as a source of fuel for the winter.  They do not have &euro;50,000 or &euro;60,000 at this point for a deep retrofit and heat pumps.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la sat on the permission for Bord na M&oacute;na to apply for substitute consent for months.  Leave to apply was supposed to be granted in March but it did not come until May.  As I said to two Ministers in the Chamber last week, someone needs to pick up the phone.  While the Government cannot direct what decision should be taken, somebody could ask the board to get a move on, because this year's harvest will be lost and turf cutters are losing their plots this year.  A programme for Government is being negotiated among Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party, and the rights of domestic turf cutters need to be enshrined in that.</p>  <p>  The transition in the midlands from brown to green energy was supposed to take place over ten years, but due to the failure to deal with it by successive Governments, workers and communities in the midlands now have ten months.</p> <p>We are where we are.  For years Sinn F&eacute;in has called for the midlands to become the heart of renewable energy.  I echo the welcome for some of the plans put forward by Kieran Mulvey.  The midlands urgently needs an ambitious plan to be put in place and a major stimulus package to reboot the economy.</p> <p> I welcome the commissioner's report but the scale of the transition facing the midlands deserves a commission on a firmer footing, not a part-time commissioner.  A just transition commission must be established on a firmer footing.  There is no new money with the report launched last week.  There is only the money that was announced last autumn, and the &euro;5 million from the ESB.  That is all welcome but it is not enough.  The just transition commissioner has suggested and has called for another &euro;25 million.  This needs to be front loaded.  We need to access finance from the European Investment Bank's just transition fund and the low carbon innovation fund.  The midlands also needs to see part of the public service obligation levy, PSO, repurposed for renewable projects and perhaps the Minister will respond to that if he can.</p> <p> We need to take advantage of the strategic location of the three midlands power plants in Lough Ree, west Offaly and Edenderry, and use them as energy hubs.  Bord na M&oacute;na should continue to operate the Edenderry plant and convert from 42% biomass to 100% biomass.  The Shannonbridge and Lough Ree plants must be retained in ESB ownership and move to biomass or biogas and, crucially, be used as energy connection points for solar, wind and other sources of energy.  They are strategically located on the national grid and those sites need to be retained in Bord na M&oacute;na and ESB ownership.</p> <p> The surplus heat from the three plants could be used in horticulture, as is done in other countries.  Hot water is pumped into rivers, which causes problems, but the water could be used to heat glasshouses for horticulture.  As a key company in resource recovery, Bord na M&oacute;na, which is already successfully involved in recycling, has the expertise, sites and facilities.  It needs to become a major player in this area.</p> <p> Laois cannot be left out of the just transition process.  It has gone through a transition but there was no just transition for Laois.  I say this as a former Bord na M&oacute;na worker in Laois.  Hundreds of people with whom I worked were thrown onto the scrapheap.  Some of them have never been able to get back into a job.  The Coolnamona site at Portlaoise offers an excellent opportunity.  I have spoken to Bord na M&oacute;na management and to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, about the development of new industry there on a number of occasions, because of the size of that site and its location, which is at the crossroads of Ireland.  The M7, M8 and N80 are all within half a mile.  It is also adjacent to a main rail line.</p> <p> The &euro;20 million retrofit  money is welcome and is a starting point, but it must be part of a larger package.  The Mount Lucas construction training centre in Offaly must be designated as the centre of excellence for apprenticeships and training in energy efficient construction and retrofitting.  Good work is being done there currently by the Laois and Offaly Education and Training Board.  I am aware the Minister was involved in trying to advance some of that, which is very welcome, but it needs to be scaled up to become the national centre.</p> <p> The ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na are good, State-owned companies that have put huge money into the economy through income tax, dividends to the State each year and through numerous other sources.  The companies have a proven track record of contributing to the local and national economy and they must be supported to be central to this just transition.  Perhaps the Minister will respond on my query on repurposing part of the PSO levy.</p></speech>

Many Members in the Houses use the national broadband plan as a political football and now the same people are calling for greater access across the State.  They are demanding more connectivity.  The broadband operators are seeing 30% more use in broadband.  Politicians in this House are using broadband and I do not know how we would have gotten over the Covid-19 crisis only for that huge connectivity.  The weather is also helping.</p> <p>People are demanding greater broadband access across the country.  If the Minister does not mind, I will be parochial in asking for an update on the roll-out of the national broadband plan in counties Sligo and Leitrim, as well as a timeline for its completion.  Will the Minister furnish me with a statement on this in the coming days?  What are the Minister's views on the broadband plan in rural areas such as those I have raised?</p></speech>

I am now seeking to accelerate it so that people in the sixth and seventh year could be brought forward.  My officials are in discussions with the company to see if we can accelerate the roll-out from the end of the second half of next year.</p>  <p>  Regarding this year, 80 of the broadband contact connection points will be rolled out by the end of summer with the rest of them, some 298, to be done by the end of the year.  These will be flagship projects which will provide the opportunity for hubs to be developed.  The kit-out of those broadband connection points is being organised by my colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, and his Department.  The tender for that has been allocated and that work is being undertaken.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, I do not have information on the particular situation in Sligo or Leitrim.  There will be broadband connection points there and I will get the Deputy additional details on this.</p></speech>

The impact of the company closure on those families who have worked for generations in Bord na M&oacute;na cannot be underestimated.  I was with the Minister last year in the Lough Ree power station.  There we saw first hand the impact the closures were having.  I welcome the just transition report.  Future Governments need to continue to resource it to ensure we can diversify.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the potential creation of 600 jobs in the region.  It was heartening to hear Kieran Mulvey during the week refer to two expressions of interest he has had already from significant companies in the manufacturing and food sectors.  That needs to be followed up with our stakeholders, be it Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland or the local authority.  It is important we are strategic and ensure we take advantage of all opportunities that are presented.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact Bord na M&oacute;na has won the tender for the bog restoration project which will provide 40 jobs in the area.  It is important the midlands retrofitting scheme is resourced.  I welcome the fact the Minister said it has the potential at least to create 400 jobs in the region.  This is very close to my heart.  The Lanesborough&ndash;Ballyleague town team along with Councillor Gerard Farrell have been on to me about working with key stakeholders.  These are community people who have a view about shaping their community and working to take advantage of any schemes provided by the Government.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Feighan said, broadband is key for our areas.  One thing that this pandemic has shown us is that we need the capacity to work from home.  We need the capacity for our children to be able to take advantage of e-learning.  One can see this with the different lectures and lessons provided to the family home through, for example, Zoom.  It is important to take advantage of these opportunities at this difficult time.  It is important we improve broadband access.  I welcome the Minister's announcement in terms of bringing forward some of the broadband plan.  It is important that we accelerate it in any way we can.</p>  <p>  I raised the matter of Inland Fisheries Ireland and the restocking of our lakes with the Minister of State responsible, Deputy Canney.  I come from Westmeath, the Lake County, and they are important for our tourism industry.  The Minister is aware of how much he had to work during a difficult time in our economy in the past to get jobs back.</p> <p>We are presented with that challenge again and the tourism sector can embrace and lead the response to it.  Lakes in Westmeath and everywhere else must be restocked.  There seems to be some confusion about how to achieve that during the phased reopening of our economy.  It is very clear that restocking lakes is outdoor work but there seems to be confusion about it.  There was also confusion regarding fish farms on a previous occasion, during a period in which Government formation took place, and it was something the political system had to rectify.  If the lakes are not restocked, it will have a significant impact on our anglers and fishers.  The lakes are a key attraction for areas in the midlands and it is very important that the message goes out loud and clear to Inland Fisheries Ireland that restocking them this year must be a priority.  As already stated, the value of those lakes cannot be underestimated in the context of attracting investment into our region, and tourism will be one of the key sectors emerging from this.  The Minister will be well aware of how much our agriculture sector and exports led to the previous recovery, to which he was central as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I would welcome his comments.</p></speech>

He did an exceptional job.  He is a man of great experience who comes from the midlands and he worked with everyone.  It shows the value of appointing an independent commissioner to pull those strands together.  His work is very valuable.  We are honouring all those pledges, including providing &euro;36 million this year to support the midlands.  Of course, it will be for another Government to work on the implementation of Mr. Mulvey's other recommendations, but we have contacted all Departments and the implementation of his report will come under a group chaired within the Department of the Taoiseach, so it will be led from the very heart of the Government.  It is also worth recognising that there is accelerated ambition from the European Union for a just transition.  The midlands have been included in that process and a territorial plan will be drawn up.  As and when money becomes available from the European Union, the midlands will be in a strong position to draw upon it.  I am conscious of how Bord na M&oacute;na is woven into the community and the suddenness of the change is the reason we in this House and the Government had to respond in this way.  That work will continue.</p>  <p>  I will seek to obtain additional information for the Deputy on the issue of inland fisheries as I do not have it to hand.  He made a very strong case in that regard.</p>  <p>  I again thank the Deputy for his continuous support for the national broadband plan.  Deputy Michael Moynihan, to whom I did not get a chance to respond, stated that this can be at the heart of a transformation of our society.  I believe that is true.  One could not envisage a successful future for rural Ireland that did not include high-speed broadband delivered to every home.  It is about that more visionary element of looking at where our future can be carved out, and the national broadband plan plays to that more visionary view of the future of rural Ireland.  Rural Ireland suffers when many of its traditional aspects are undermined as customs and patterns change but this is infrastructure for the future for rural Ireland.</p></speech>

I acknowledge his hard work as Minister in recent years and thank him for it.  He has always shown my colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, respect and courtesy in the D&aacute;il and I will endeavour to engage constructively with him and his successor in the very important work carried out by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p>  <p>  The first issue I wish to address is the potential of wind energy in our seas.  As has been stated many times in this House, our marine territory is ten times larger than our land area.  We have already started to harness the potential for wind energy in the Irish Sea and I note the Minister's announcement last week of the progression of planning on some wind projects.  However, the real potential lies in the immense energy reserves off our western seaboard.  We are now at a stage, with projects being announced in Norway and elsewhere, where offshore floating wind is on its way to becoming commercially viable.  That could allow us to leverage private investment to power much of the nation's electricity needs, and indeed, to export electricity with the appropriate infrastructure.</p> <p>I believe that these developments will deliver significant benefits and employment to Kerry, Limerick, Clare, Galway, Mayo and Donegal.  Offshore wind, with its higher capacity factor, has potential to deliver not only significant constant baseload to our electricity supply, but the employment potential per MW is much greater than for onshore wind.  We will need marine infrastructure for construction and maintenance.  Large numbers of skilled engineers and construction workers will play a critical part in writing this new chapter in the Irish energy story.</p> <p> We can plan now for the moment in the perhaps not-too-distant future when both the technology and economics of floating offshore wind converge and that this great potential energy resource becomes realisable.  When this day arrives, the main obstacles to harnessing it will be our ability to store the renewable electricity that exceeds our own national requirements and our ability to transfer it to the larger electricity markets in Europe.  </p> <p> One emerging technology in this regard is green hydrogen.  This is not a party political broadcast but a very real prospect.  Excess renewable electricity from our offshore wind farms can be used to create hydrogen using the electrolytic process.  This can then be used in transport, heavy industry, and perhaps also in power generation to balance our grid, replacing natural gas as we push for a net zero emissions target by 2050 or sooner.</p> <p> These developments are a few years away, but not many.  We can plan now and give a signal to our industry.  We must give that signal if we are to spur it to achieve this ambition.  Critically, it would also be a signal to our communities that there is a bright future, one that is synonymous with innovation, technology, education and prosperity.  What potential does the Minister see for communities in Kerry, Limerick, Clare, Galway, Mayo and Donegal in the future, as we seek to harness the potential of wind energy off our western seaboard, together with innovative technologies such as hydrogen storage?</p> <p> I move to discuss the just transition.  Having read through the progress report prepared by the just transition commissioner, Mr. Kieran Mulvey, on the just transition in the midlands, there is great reason for optimism and confidence in the efforts of our towns and villages in rural Ireland.  Communities, workers and local businesses have been shown to be dynamic, resilient and ambitious, particularly when faced with far-reaching challenges such as the changes facing the peat industry.  The efforts in the midlands in transitioning away from carbon intensive activities could set a strong precedent for future efforts across Ireland as our country and society will undoubtedly undergo significant changes brought on by Covid-19, but also brought on by other trends such as increased digitalisation and automation.  In welcoming the publication of the just transition report, I ask what potential the Minister sees in extending the just transition approach to communities across the country as we seek to work towards a more sustainable future.</p></speech>

As the Deputy probably knows, we have pencilled in offshore wind for 3.5 GW in the period up to 2030 and hope that we will exceed that.  That is our ambition and we are consulting on what sort of a grid network would be appropriate to try and do that in a quick way.  Should it be done by the State, creating a platform, or should it be done by individual connectors?  That is something that would certainly accelerate this process.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is right that the focus at the moment is on the east coast but the west coast has enormous potential.  When one tots up the amount of sea space in this country, it is ten times the size of our land space, and the west coast has considerable potential in that respect.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy is also right that we will need floating technology.  That is in demonstration stage at the moment and is not yet at a stage of commercial exploitation.  Its cost levels are currently much higher than its competitors but the Deputy is also right that the direction of travel is that this will open up a significant opportunity.</p>  <p>  The last assessment of the west coast suggested that it could have between 23 GW and 27 GW of potential.  That would go way beyond supplying Ireland's needs and we would need to see how we could integrate that into a European network or, as the Deputy said, develop hydrogen.</p> <p>The EU has indicated, in the context of the European Green Deal, that this is an area in which it wants to invest research funding in order to accelerate the capacity to have a hydrogen industry that will use excess renewable energy when it is available.  I refer, for example, to circumstances where the wind is blowing but the energy produced not needed for the grid.  There is real potential here.  Development will be further down the line, but the benefit of the auction approach we take is that, as the technology starts to come on stream, we could have pilot pots for elements within the overall auction to give emerging technologies an opportunity to prove themselves.  We would be open to that.</p> <p> On the just transition, the reality is that we are only starting on an accelerated pace of decarbonisation.  The midlands has certainly been the most severely hit because of the fact that peat is a solid fuel and the way in which matters have progressed much quicker than had been planned.</p> <p> I agree that just transition has to be looked at in a much broader context.  The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, has been given the role of overseeing the way in which we implement just transition.  The first experience, through Kieran Mulvey's work, shows the potential of bottom-up participation and we have to imbed that into any other approach that we take.  No doubt there are other sectors and regions where we will have to develop this and I am sure, as we become familiar with the process of just transition, people will see a more permanent structure being put in place that can deal with the challenges which emerge in different sectors.  Deputies will understand why we needed to get an effective response in the midlands to something that came much more suddenly than anyone expected, and that is why we took the approach outlined.  The lessons from Mr. Mulvey's work will inform the future direction of the just transition strategy.</p></speech>

I hope the Minister agrees that adapting to and trying to mitigate climate change will require massive State investment in changing the way we live our lives and run our societies.  It is vital to ensure that the post-Covid stimulus package required is not wasted on reinstating the <i>status quo</i>.  It is vital that we kill two birds with one stone by investing in green industry and putting workers and communities at the heart of that just transition.  In that context, I welcome and recommend the paper, &quot;Approaches to Transition&quot;, recently presented to the NESC by Dr. Jeanne Moore, which provides context for the choices we need to make.  We need to put workers and their trade unions at the centre of the policies, strategies and approaches outlined in that report.</p><p>The immediate effects on our communities are apparent from the interim report produced by the just transition commissioner, Kieran Mulvey.  While we welcome this report and we thank Mr. Mulvey for it, I would like to ask the Minister if he really believes that we are doing everything we can.  Is he satisfied with the pace and scale of action?  We need to ensure that employees in Shannonbridge, Lanesborough, Littleton in north Tipperary and east Galway and seasonal workers across the region who have relied on Bord na M&oacute;na for their incomes are not abandoned.  We need to look after those who have already lost their jobs as well as those who are about to.  The greatest challenge for us all is ensuring that new jobs are available in places where the older jobs are being lost and that the gap between the old jobs vanishing and the new jobs appearing does not destroy people's ability to sustain themselves and result in the economic destruction of our communities.</p><p>Running quickly through some of the measures the Minister outlined in the Government's response to the report, I ask whether they really give a sense that we are acting fast enough.  On the just transition fund, &euro;11 million seems a meagre enough investment in the context of training and business supports.  Is it enough?  In his response, the Minister stated, &quot;The Department ... will write to State agencies and enterprises to identify land and facilities&quot;.  I get no sense of urgency from this.  How long will the Department wait for a response?  The Minister also stated: &quot;The Department and ESB will commission a study to examine the potential for using the existing infrastructure in the West Offaly and Lough Ree power plants as an Energy Hub in the Midlands.&quot;  Does this really convey any urgency?</p> <p>Is this information not quickly available to both the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na already?  Digital hubs and remote working are worthy objectives.  Many have experience of them right now, but will they really address the needs of those directly affected?  I agree absolutely that more electric charging points are needed but a bit more detail is also needed.  The midlands retrofitting scheme, worth &euro;20 million, is a great project but we need to know the scale.  The centre for climate change and just transition represents an excellent project if the scale is sufficient.</p> <p> Does the Minister have any idea when we will have detail on specific support for the midlands under the European Green Deal?  The overall impression I have is of a holding pattern.  We need to grasp the nettle and realise that a large number of people will be left behind if we do not act faster, increase invest and consider more radical solutions to immediate problems.</p> <p> In view of the success of the Covid-19 pandemic wages support scheme and pandemic payment schemes, has the Minister considered proposing targeted, long-lasting direct supports, modelled on pandemic measures, for affected workers in order to bridge the gap between job losses and the creation of new industries?  As with Covid, jobs are being threatened through no fault of the workers.  It is a strategic, external threat of global magnitude.</p> <p> I strongly welcome the recent move by Coillte to reclassify its forests in Dublin for non-commercial recreational use.  I hope a more balanced strategy of development for Coillte can be extended across the country as part of our climate emergency.</p></speech>

I agree absolutely that the climate challenge is the greatest challenge humanity faces.  It will preoccupy this House for the next ten years and for the 20 years thereafter.  We are seeking to reduce our emissions of carbon dioxide over the next ten years and to eliminate them entirely over the following 20.  That will mean a dramatic change in the way we live our lives.  It will require investment on the part of the Government but it will also require the mobilisation of considerable private capital.  Our financial institutions will have to change their attitude in order that the capital can be mobilised.  It will require changes to the habits of a lifetime so everyone, whether they are householders, enterprise staff or farmers, will have to look at the way they do their work.  It will require us to accept new infrastructure in our communities.  There has been a great deal of resistance to some of the renewable infrastructures but these represent the pathway to clean energy that does not have an impact on our climate.  This pathway will, of course, require leadership, engagement and the designing of just transition policies by the Government.</p>  <p>  We are engaged in a very large-scale programme of transformation.  I do not underestimate the scale of the challenge or the importance of the work but I believe there was resolve in the previous D&aacute;il to take on the work.  I am of the view that the resolve to which I refer is even greater in this D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked whether we are doing enough in respect of the just transition within the midlands.  We have moved very swiftly.  I have been around this House for quite a long time but I was impressed to see, within a matter of weeks, a budget involving an investment programme of &euro;31 million and to see the ESB top it up with an additional &euro;5 million.  This means that in the first year of a just transition there are significant funds available.  We now have a report that plots a path and recognises the major role the regional enterprise strategy and the midlands transition task force can play.  The latter has been very ably led from within Offaly County Council.   The opportunities and difficulties associated with the transition are identified in the report of the just transition commissioner.  The strategy is being taken very seriously in that it is being implemented from the Taoiseach's office.  We have drawn together the strands of government to ensure that we deliver on this programme.  We are doing a lot.  The Deputy could certainly say we could do more; I do not disagree with that.  Obviously, 2021 will be a new year and we will have to make provision later this year.</p>  <p>  On the European Green Deal, I engaged with the incoming German Presidency just today.  It is determined to push ahead with both the climate Bill and the various elements of the deal.</p> <p>The Deputy is right; until a financial framework is nailed down the just transition fund and some elements within it will not reach their full scale or be triggered.  We will be engaging with the European Union to draw up the territorial plan necessary to trigger drawdown.  That will be an important element across the European Union.  For the first time in a long time, the European Union has a project with a genuine vision similar to the vision of the Union's founders.  It has lost its gloss for many citizens in recent years.  It is associated with austerity and so on.  I believe, however, that this is an opportunity for the European Union to reassert itself.  Many people are sceptical of the value of sharing sovereignty within the Union.  I am a big supporter of it and I believe this will breathe life into the cause of those who support it.  I know the Deputy's party also strongly supports this.  I am optimistic about the prospects.</p></speech>

I echo that acknowledgement.  In particular I acknowledge the work being done by An Post.  From those who engage with communities and help those who are isolating, to the management team that has come up with innovative supports for bookshops and small enterprises, its staff have really done incredible work since Covid began.  In our post-Covid economy, our SMEs will have to pivot their business models towards online shopping.  An Post will play a large role in this regard ensuring that, for those going online, it is easier, faster and financially viable to shop in an Irish online shop rather than in one overseas.</p>  <p>  I will focus on two communications issues.  The first is the broadband connection points programme currently being rolled out across the country.  The second is the important issue of access to Internet training and supports for our older population.  In November last year, the Government announced the deployment of 300 broadband connection points across the country.  This programme was intended to be a stopgap for communities with the worst broadband coverage.  It was a very welcome announcement for those in our rural communities.  These broadband connection points were heralded as high-speed Internet hubs that would enable rural remote working.  The locations selected by the Department to host the broadband connection points were primarily community centres, GAA clubs and schools.  In principle, this is a worthwhile programme.  Remote access to the Internet is vital for any rural village or town, even more so now that, post Covid, our focus will be on enabling people to work remotely from home or from within their locality.  </p>  <p>  I absolutely believe that our schools and community facilities should have access to high-speed Internet.  I have worked with a number of primary schools that have had difficulty with their Internet connections to such an extent that the Internet in one school with which I worked failed on its technology day.  All the children had to put away their devices and the school could not go through with it.  There are problems with Internet connections in our schools.</p>  <p>  We need rural co-working hubs that offer people the opportunity to work remotely and we need our schools connected and enabled to teach in a progressively technological manner.  I cannot see, however, how providing high-speed public access broadband to schools and sport centres under this programme will meet the needs of either those facilities or the local community.  I certainly cannot see how many of them will meet the needs of remote workers.  For example, how does the Minister envisage a school providing an opportunity for remote working for local people?  Would a person just drive up, sit in his or her car and access the Internet from there?  Would schools have to open in the evening to facilitate remote access to the Internet?  There are significant child protection issues associated with using schools as remote working hubs.  Conflating the two needs, providing broadband to schools and providing for remote working opportunities, will mean that neither need will be sufficiently met.</p>  <p>  What selection criteria were used in selecting the facilities to host broadband connection points?  Was consultation carried out in the selection of those premises?  Do these clubs, community centres and schools actually want to provide this service to the broader community?  I have seen it reported that the Government has allocated &euro;120 million next year to deliver the rural broadband scheme, much of which is to be spent in installing these broadband connection points.</p>  <p>That is a significant amount of money.  If the Government is going to spend such money on providing rural public access to the Internet in order to enable remote working, it should first prioritise premises that are suitable for that use.  For example, are there empty Government buildings, such as HSE offices, that could be reconfigured to provide dedicated co-working spaces with high-speed Internet access, meeting rooms, hot desks and television and video conferencing?  These are the kinds of facilities to which rural communities should have access.  Rural Ireland requires a broadband solution that meets its needs.  I urge the Minister not to short-change people in those areas by providing solutions that do not stack up and which promise remote working facilities but do not deliver.  I ask him to look again at the locations that have been selected and consider expanding the number in light of the much heavier demand for authentic and professional rural remote working facilities in our post-Covid world.</p> <p> I will now move on to digital literacy.  It has become obvious in recent months that broadband is about more than just communication.  It is also about connection, whether that be connecting with each other, our local communities, the country or the world at large.  However, not all of us are connecting, and this is particularly the case for older people.  It is not that they cannot or will not connect online, but that nobody is helping them to do it.  There are some startling statistics on digital literacy in Ireland.  According to the 2018 EUROSTAT figures, over half of Irish people aged between 65 and 74 have never used the Internet.  Only 3% of those over the age of 75 have used it.  When we combine these statistics, we see that more than 70% of the total population aged over 65 have never been online.</p> <p> Our recent experience with Covid shows us that it is more important now than ever that our older population should be able to connect to friends, family and businesses online.  Unfortunately, this is not happening.  According to Age Action, the key issue around technology is that it has been designed, rolled out and funded to exclude a large group of people in society, whose members now have limited access to social, educational, financial and commercial opportunities when compared with any other sector of society.  We cannot underestimate the impact that digital literacy has on a person.  Being able to navigate online increases a person's access to services and information and means that older people can stay independent for longer.  People who have access to broadband save more money, continue to learn and teach new skills, and keep up with the news and cultural events.</p> <p> Crucially, older people with digital literacy skills benefit from increased participation in the development of national policy.  This is a key point which shows that digital literacy is good for democracy.  A lack of digital literacy in older people results in a reduced ability to participate in public policy development and consultation.  Age Action notified me that of eight open consultations on nationwide public policy documents in November 2019, only one offered public consultation workshops offline.  On 15 May, there were two public consultations open, both of which are online.  In real terms, this means that approximately 300,000 people aged over 65 cannot easily contribute to the policy-making processes that affect all our lives.  It is clear that digital literacy is more important now than ever as we learn to migrate online and stay connected.  Older people are losing out significantly more than any other cohort in this regard.</p> <p> Despite the importance of digital literacy, the successful digital skills for citizens grant scheme, run by the Minister's Department, is currently halted and under review, with apparently no plan to continue the training.  The funding stopped mid-programme when Covid hit, which means that many of the participants have been left without access to this very successful support and those who give the training have been left in limbo with their funding ceased.  Will the Minister examine how this training can continue to function on an online basis and will he consider reinstating funding for this very important programme?  Does he have any other plans to focus on and encourage more online learning for the older members of our communities?</p></speech>

She is absolutely right in commending An Post.  That organisation has been imaginative in recognising a very good commercial opportunity for itself while also helping companies to migrate their business to a more successful platform.  An Post has been remarkably successful when one considers that, a couple of years ago, it was facing into very dark financial circumstances.  The company has been completely turned around and remade and it continues to be very innovative.  That success is a tribute to the workers and the management.</p>  <p>  The selection of broadband contact points was made through the local authorities via their broadband officers.  There was a lot of local consultation to seek to identify the most appropriate spots.</p> <p>That resulted in almost 300 being selected.  A small number have fallen away since.</p> <p> The Deputy is correct that there is a difficulty with schools.  The schools are private patron models so they most likely will not be making their premises available so workers can come in and be involved in remote working.  However, they represent a small proportion of them.  I believe 75 to 80 of them are in schools.  In an ideal world one would see our schools being more open to that wider community participation, but in the past when I was Minister for Education and Skills I found it very difficult to bring patron bodies along to support new activities.  That is likely to be a problem.</p> <p> Obviously, kitting these out will be crucial.  A tender has been successfully awarded by the Department of Rural and Community Development.  The company that was successful will kit those out to develop the hubs.  It is recognised that some will be more suitable locations than others and we will try to ensure that those that have the capacity to be kitted out with hot desks and so forth will be developed in that way.  My Department is determined to do that.</p> <p> I will see if we can reinstate the digital education scheme.  No doubt it was arrested for good reason.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.565" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1486" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="00:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700102#OOOOO00200"><p>I am sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy.  I have no questions that require an answer now, but I wish to make a few comments on the climate crisis in light of the Covid-19 crisis.  It has been said by many commentators that the Covid-19 pandemic is only a slight foretaste of the type of disruption to society and economics that we can expect as we move further down the road to catastrophic climate change.  There are certainly many lessons for us to draw from it on what will work for climate and the far-reaching radical action that we need.</p><p>We now have billions of people effectively in lockdown across the globe.  We have dramatically reduced road and air transport and we are seeing reductions in CO<sub>2</sub>emissions never recorded in history.  However, this gigantic fall will, at most, lead to a reduction in annual levels of between 4% and 6%.  The International Energy Agency says the world will use 6% less energy this year, equivalent to losing the entire energy demand of India.  Carbon Brief shows that emissions will fall by 4% to 8%, between 2 and 3 billion tonnes of warming gas.  That is between six and ten times larger than during the last global recession.  To quote one scientist:</p> <blockquote> 	We are still emitting more than 80% of our previous CO<sub>2</sub>emissions. That is a massive number. So personal behaviour really isn't going to fix the carbon emission problem. We need a systematic change in how energy is generated and transmitted. </blockquote>  <p>One lesson we should take from the crisis is that a climate policy that rests overwhelmingly on changes in personal behaviour to tackle the greatest crisis in human history will fail because the issue with climate and CO<sub>2</sub>is systemic and not the behaviour of ordinary people.  I say to the Minister, Fianna F&aacute;il and especially the Green Party that an emphasis on carbon taxes aimed at personal individual behaviour is a massive error and will waste the time we have left to avert catastrophe in the climate.</p><p>The other lesson relates to the over-reliance on the free market as the provider of key public services.  This can turn out not only to be a costly mistake with regard to broadband, CervicalCheck or schools or hospital building, but when we hits a major crisis like this pandemic it can be fatal for many.  From the failures of nursing homes to a dysfunctional two-tier health service to the failure of childcare provision, it is clear that reliance on the market or international investors will not give us the type of services we need either in good times or in this emergency.  Our climate policy continues to place its hope in private companies and investments in offshore wind energy.  We will remain dependent on their prospects for profit in the years to come.  The seven proposed offshore wind projects mentioned in the past month are very welcome, but there is no mention or vision of a State-led investment programme that can rationally plan the scale and the necessary timing for the transition away from fossil fuels.</p><p>Similarly, the announcement of the just transition report and its &euro;11 million investment fund are meant to deliver just transition for workers and communities devastated by ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na closures, but in the meantime workers continue to be thrown on the scrapheap and treated abysmally by their State employer.</p> <p>This fund will at best be a sticking plaster over the abandonment of many thousands of people, pensionable jobs in favour of private industry working, lower pay, precarious contracts and with, of course, a coat of green wash.</p> <p> There is no vision of what just transition really means.  There is no ambition to use that skilled workforce in a State-led renewable energy project.  That is not surprising.  For the past four years, this Government has obstructed legislation that would curtail fossil fuel use and exploration.  It has supported plans for liquified natural gas, LNG, facilities and it continues to parrot, even in the teeth of the evidence from science, that gas is a transitional fuel.</p> <p> Like other Deputies, I have been receiving emails from climate campaigners urging me to support a programme for Government that accepts and acts on the best climate science.  I assume they are hoping that it will give an impetus to talks between Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party.  If those parties arrive at a programme, it will probably mention climate more times than any other previous Government programme.  It will be full of inspirational rhetoric.  It will tick a lot of boxes and may fool some climate activists for some of the time but it will not deliver the far-reaching radical action that is needed.  Both Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael are ideologically committed to neoliberal policies.  Both are the architects of inequality in housing and in health.  Both are defenders and champions of the fossil fuel industry and the private investment interests.  They will never deliver the systemic change the Covid-19 crisis has shown us that we need.</p> <p> We want to see a science-led response on climate change, now one led by economics posing as climate science.  We need to look elsewhere and build a movement that is required for climate change.  We need to change the system and not just change the climate.</p></speech>

The Minister spoke earlier about the need for everyone to change their habits.  I agree with that, but who could have imagined the kind of changes in people's habits that currently are taking place?  Consumption has collapsed and huge parts of the economy have effectively been in cold storage for months.  What is the impact of that in terms of climate change?  The projected impact on a global basis is that global emissions will only drop by 8%.  That is completely inadequate as well as completely unsustainable because of the way it is being done.  What is the conclusion from that?  The conclusion is that there is no solution to the climate crisis, which is coming toward us extremely fast and with horrific consequences, within the framework of the profit system.  There is no solution to it as long as the decisions about our economy are made by the big oil companies.  There is no solution to it as long as the decisions about the nature of our agriculture are made by big agribusiness.  It underlines the desperate need for system change instead of climate change.  It makes the case for that change to be socialist change whereby the key sections of the economy are in democratic public ownership and that we are able to plan to put people's needs, and our planet's needs, before profit.</p>  <p>  To be more concrete, I give an example and a comparison between the drop in electricity usage between the South of Ireland and the North.  In the North, electricity consumption has fallen by 20% but in the South it has only fallen by 10%.  The underlying reason, in a more concrete way, demonstrates that point.  The developmental model that the Government has chosen is not sustainable in terms of our environment because that 10% difference is made up basically of data centres.  It is a core part of Government policy to attract big multinational companies to establish data centres here that provide very little in the way of ongoing jobs.  They are expected to add at least 1.5 million tonnes of CO2 annually to our emissions by 2028 but the Government designates them as critical infrastructure in order to be able to attract more of them.  It demonstrates that the Government is not putting the interests of our people or our planet first.</p>  <p>  I agree with the slogan of ICTU - No Going Back.  For me, what that speaks to is that there is no going back to a society where it is okay for people to get worse healthcare because they are poorer.</p> <p>It speaks to the need not to go back to a situation where evictions are legal.  We were told it was unconstitutional to make evictions illegal.  A similar situation applies to increases in rents.  There is no going back to the disconnection of people from nature and the pressurised, stressed lives many people still have, but which were the norm for almost everybody before the pandemic.  There is a substantial task for the trade union movement and the left to produce a vision and build a movement to fight for that sort of eco-socialist change we need.  That should be based around the idea of a green new deal with socialist policies.  The interests of climate justice absolutely overlap with the need for social justice and how we are going to function safely and in a healthy way with the situation caused by coronavirus.</p> <p> For people to travel safely, we need substantial investment in public transport.  That means private operators will not be able to make a profit like they did in the past.  We should just invest, treat it as a public service and make it free.  There should be free, significantly expanded public transport for all.  We need a significant increase in the number of care jobs in society.  To be able to teach properly, we need many more teachers.  To have proper healthcare, we need many more doctors and nurses.  To be able to have proper childcare, we need more people working in that area.  All of that requires a significant investment.  They are low carbon, quality jobs.  Similarly, we need fewer people to be in crowded workplaces and a four-day week without loss of pay.  The only way we will get any of those things is with a movement.  They will not come from a Fianna F&aacute;il-Fine Gael Government but require a movement from below.</p></speech>

The local newspaper industry as we know it is dying before our eyes and if it is allowed to continue, it will not just herald the end of an industry but it will also mark the end of an era.  The threats faced by the local print newspaper industry are many.  Falling advertising revenue, rising production costs and the growing popularity of online news are touted as the biggest dangers to the survival of local newspapers.</p>  <p>  However, the mass takeover of newspapers by big media companies is the greatest threat of all.  Originally, local newspapers were largely family-owned.  This gradually changed to ownership dominated by Irish, Scottish and Northern Irish companies.  In more recent years, media conglomerates arrived.  They swept the country, buying up title after title for a mere fraction of the price their predecessors had paid.  In doing so, they changed the heart of local newspapers.  In my constituency of Tipperary, three of the four titles are now published by the same company, Formpress, a subsidiary of Iconic Newspapers.  It now controls these three titles that heretofore thrived on their competitiveness and individuality.  This clearly represents a media monopoly, which in turn is a disincentive to journalistic autonomy and traditional rivalry.  Dedicated local journalists and contributors made these titles household names.  Their hard work, local knowledge and empathy with communities, combined with the integrity of their reporting, built a bond and trust with the public.  These titles are being ransacked of their unique, distinctive style and character.  Most of these titles are limping along, devoid of funds, with no clear direction.  The human touch seems to hold no value in this so-called progression of local journalism.  It is no longer about bringing the stories and spreading the news.  Local papers are now the focus of ambition and greed.</p>  <p>  When the Covid virus struck, many journalists were stood down, not knowing whether it was temporary or permanent.  Little or no conversation, discussion or explanation happened, just a crude swing of the axe and a distant diktat.  Numerous people working for these publications feel hurt and disillusioned by the manner of their treatment.  It is sad to see journalists who we admire and respect being treated so shabbily.  Covid will have severe implications for everyone.</p> <p>It will also impact in many other ways such as lifestyles, traditions and customs.  We all know and accept that change is inevitable.  Irrespective of the business, one can only survive by adapting and embracing new ways of doing things, responding to consumer demand and trends.  In some instances it will be difficult to distinguish between the genuine need for change and those who will use Covid-19 as the excuse for rationalisation.  Unfortunately, some companies and organisations will take advantage of Covid to make sweeping changes with consequences for job security and terms of employment.</p> <p> I fear for the future of traditional provincial publications as they bow to monopoly ownership.  While primarily businesses, local newspapers are also a vital service provider.  They are the windows of local communities.  They give a snapshot of all that is relevant to local people at a given time.  They reflect the lives and concerns of people in their area and provide a platform for local voices.  These newspapers keep people informed on issues that matter locally and every week they provide what will one day be an invaluable history of every corner of our country.</p> <p> Local newspapers scrutinise and hold local decision makers to account.  In order to do this, they need to be an independent voice.  I ask the Minister to listen to their voice.  I ask him to explain how media conglomerates were permitted to sweep across Ireland and buy up almost every newspaper title in the country.  Why does this sector not come under the ambit of a regulator, similar to local radio?  What regulations are in place for media ownership?  I ask the Minister not to allow what has been happening to local newspapers to continue.  The incoming Minister with responsibility for communications must sit down with the National Union of Journalists as a matter of urgency to address the problem of media ownership in Ireland, to acknowledge the issues plaguing the industry on the ground and to formulate a way forward that restores, supports and secures the future of local print media.</p> <p> The outgoing Government signed off on a &euro;3 billion national broadband plan.  Just four months later we found ourselves in the midst of a pandemic that ground our country to a halt.  Life changed completely in a short few days.  Offices and businesses across the country closed and those who could do so were asked to work from home.  Students left their desks and their education continued with online classes and electronically submitted homework - that is for those who lived in an area with dependable Internet and a good broadband connection.  Never before has the need for reliable high-speed broadband in rural Ireland been more apparent.  I have come across cases where people were unable to work from home and where students could neither receive nor submit assignments.</p> <p> The issue is further compounded in areas of Tipperary where high-sped broadband has been introduced, but major black spots remain.  It is common to find rural roads where the majority of properties have access to broadband but a few homes or businesses in the middle have no service.  As recently as this morning I was contacted by a farmer living in Tipperary in an area currently covered by a fibre broadband network.  For more than 12 months his neighbours have had access to high-speed connection.  While the actual fibre connection passes this farmer's entrance, he has been told his connection cannot be completed because his property, like many other traditional farm settlements is approximately 400 m from the main road.  He has been informed it is not commercially viable to provide him with a connection and he will have to wait to be connected under the State intervention plan.</p> <p> Simply put, high-speed broadband is not a luxury for rural Ireland; it is in fact a necessity.  I ask the Minister if the plan is in line.  I ask him to advise me in writing or this evening as to the progress made in the roll-out of broadband across Tipperary and the timescale involved for its completion.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that they have been very severely impacted, obviously by the collapse in their advertising revenue, the greater difficulties in circulation, and I suppose by the migration to online media sources.  That has certainly been aggravated by the Covid-19 pandemic.  The Government has stepped in.</p> <p>Many of those newspapers are receiving the temporary wage support scheme, which has helped them to keep their staff together and be in a position to recover and rebuild.  </p> <p> I am very conscious that the whole media world is changing very rapidly under the impact of the changed ways in which people communicate and absorb information.  It is highly related to age.  People under a certain age have a completely different attitude towards newspapers.  They use sources that are not the conventional linear broadcast media.  This is posing a huge challenge for the quality of public service media.  For this reason, the previous Government appointed Professor Brian MacCraith to look at this concept.  While he is primarily focusing on public broadcasting, his terms of reference also include the wider media.  It is important that the D&aacute;il consider how we ensure the quality of news coverage and journalism, even as the methods through which people receive media change so rapidly.  We cannot pretend that we can continue as things are because people are voting with their hand-held devices to absorb their media in a different way.  We need to think very deeply about this.</p> <p> Any takeover of a newspaper will be judged by the Competition Commission and by my Department in the context of plurality.  Concentration in the market and the plurality of information available are both examined.  I cannot give the Deputy an answer as to why any particular takeover was approved but the reasons will be on record as each case will have gone through the process that has been put in place.</p> <p> I will revert to the Deputy on broadband for Tipperary. </p></speech>

Communities in rural Ireland, isolated areas and everywhere else depend on these media, especially during this difficult period.  Information over the airwaves from Tipp FM and Tipperary Mid West Radio are a lifeline to many.  I hope they and the local newspapers will receive adequate support from people as well as from the Government because businesses do not have additional income to give them at the moment.</p><p>I express my sincere disappointment in the owner of Iconic Newspapers, Malcolm Denmark, for his appalling treatment of hardworking journalists, staff journalists and local correspondents.  Deputy Lowry also referred to this.  It is unbelievable but this is big business in modern Ireland.  This pandemic is a scamdemic for big businesses.  This behaviour was happening before the pandemic ever started.  This man has destroyed the local papers and does not care about them.  He paid himself the handsome sum of &euro;3.1 million last year, yet staff have not received a wage increase since 2008.  Benefits such as maternity leave and sick leave have been abolished.  He is recklessly riding roughshod over good, decent, hard-working journalists with families and who have served their communities well for decades.  To add insult to injury, he is claiming the Covid payment to pay his staff even though the business is profitable.  He is not interested in the <i>Tipperary Star</i>, <i>The Nationalist, The Midland Tribune, </i>or any other newspapers, right up as far <i>The Donegal Democrat </i>in Deputy Pringle's constituency.  It is outrageous what the Minister has allowed happen but it happened across the beef industry, with the broadband contract and everywhere else.  It is Fine Gael policy to let these big business people do what they like to whom they like.  The Minister talked about the regulator.  He might as well talk about Santa Claus.  These people do not care about regulation.  Look at the way Malcolm Denmark has treated these newspaper titles, which have served their counties for decades and, in some cases, centuries.  They have some excellent journalists but four were let go in <i>The Nationalist </i>and four were let go in the <i>Tipperary Star.  </i>Two or three people are expected to do the work that seven or eight were doing.  They are being driven like that and there is no respect.  People must respect their workers.  </p><p>I have questions on broadband.  I have received complaints about Eir.  Eir is much worse than it was 20 years ago.  I remember when Albert Reynolds waved a phone at a Fianna F&aacute;il Ard-Fheis, which I was proud to attend, and said he would have a phone to everybody in a month.  Now, it would take three, four or six months for an older person to get a phone repaired.  It is disgusting what has happened.</p> <p>Will the Department please provide specific details of the deployment of fibre broadband in County Tipperary?  How many properties in the county were supplied with broadband to date in 2020?  How many properties in the county will be supplied with broadband between now and the end of the year?  When will the deployment of the national broadband plan be made available?  There have been more announcements on this than I have had hot dinners but people do not have it.  I refer to farmers, students and those working from home, children trying to access their school work or even teachers who need broadband in order to be able to liaise with them.  Farmers need to be able to fill out their application forms.  Students need to be able to fill out their CAO forms.  Broadband is a necessary tool now and we are being blackguarded in rural Ireland.</p> <p> What is most frustrating for people is when they realise they are located only a few hundred yards from properties in the blue area with a broadband connection point but they still cannot get connected, nor can they get any answers.  Another issue that needs to be addressed concerns Eir customers.</p> <p> The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland comes under the watch of the Minister.  It was said there was loads of money and a large number of applications were made, but there is not money and contracts have not been paid.  People cannot say a word because they have their hand inside in the dog's mouth and that dog bites if one says something.  A contractor recently contacted me who came off the payment to go back to work and he was not allowed to go back to work.  I believe the simple reason is that it is another scam and the Department does not have the money to pay him.  He is working on a building site on his own or perhaps with one other person.  I believe the Department does not have the money to pay him.</p> <p> A lot has happened in dear mother Ireland.  She is living with O'Leary in the grave.  I will tell the Minister about Fine Gael policy.  Now Fine Gael is cobbling a Government together again with Fianna F&aacute;il and others to try to ensure the big businesses survive and thrive.  They do not only want to survive, they want to thrive and walk on workers, small businesses and companies.  Deputy Lowry mentioned conglomerates but he did not mention anything about the racing industry conglomerates we have in Tipperary.  I totally support the racing industry, but what about the conglomerate that is the Coolmore equine industries.  It is buying up all the land, gobbling every parcel of land that can be bought in Tipperary and beyond.  One cannot criticise it either or one will be banished to hell or to Connacht.  It is nearly the new god in places.</p> <p> It is time to rethink our approach to the pandemic and let Ireland live and operate again.  We must open up our churches and let people of whatever faith go to worship.  We must change the 2 m rule.  It is codswallop at this stage.  We criticised Hungary for what it did but we should take a leaf out of Hungary's book and see how it dealt with the pandemic.</p></speech>

I hope that no more post offices will be closed down.  I thank the local broadcasters, especially Radio Kerry.  I also thank the local journalists.</p>  <p>  I wish to highlight that there has been difficulty accessing Zoom meetings.  It has been explained to me that it is a problem right around the country.  It is not fair that people cannot link in.  Remote working is the order of the day but in Kerry it is hardly possible at all because of the number of places that are without broadband coverage.  As I explained to the Minister previously, there are pockets of coverage.  There is fibre passing outside one man's gate who urgently needs it but there is no break in the line of fibre and the black box that is required is some 400 m or 500 m up the road.  A black box covers 11 houses.  We are told by Eir that National Broadband Ireland is going to do it and will be paid for it so Eir will not do it.  There are pockets between Doocarrig and Beheenagh, between Gneevgullia and Kilcummin, Rareagh and Tooreencahill where various places have been left out.  Children and farmers are expected to go online.  This year, farmers were told they had to submit their single farm payment applications online.  This was very tough on those who had to get someone else to do it for them.  It is not fair that they had to do that.</p>  <p>  Every minute of every day, someone is talking about climate and climate change.  The one thing we are clear and sure on now is that it is not the farmer who is to blame.</p> <p>They are farming away, but looking up at the sky, it can be seen that the planes are missing.  One morning, on 21 August 2019 at 5.45 a.m., I looked out the door and up at the sky - 33 lines of jets passing overhead and a blue sky over that.  When I went out ten minutes later, all the droppings from the planes had merged together.  There was no sign of my blue sky - gone completely.  In recent times, however, we have seen a blue sky as far as we can see on either end, and we are glad to see that.  It is very easy, however, to blame the farmer or the poor man or woman going to work, or the hauliers are going through every hoop to deliver what they have to and who are penalised in every way, and now we are talking about increasing carbon tax.  It is very easy to blame these people when, with emissions, really it is up we should be looking and not down.</p> <p> I love our environment as much as anyone else, and seek to protect our rivers and our lakes in every way.  Instead of talking about the climate, why do the Minister and the Government not talk about the treatment plants around the country?  Take our county, for example.  Kilcummin has been waiting for a treatment plant for 18 years, Castleisland has been waiting for an extension to a sewerage scheme for 33 years, and then there are places like Curragh, Scartaglin and Brosna.  People cannot get permission there to build houses around the villages because there is no treatment plant, which only draws them into Killarney.  The Government is to blame as much as farmers and other people for damaging our environment.  It is a fact that the local authorities right around the country, not alone in Kerry, are to blame for the most pollution of our rivers, lakes, and indeed our bathing areas.  Ballybunion and other places have gone from excellent to very good, or whatever, water quality.  That is where we are going because the Government is not looking at the things it should be dealing with and putting money into them.  Several Governments - the previous one and the one before - have let rural Ireland down when it comes to providing treatment plants and dealing with the environment, in our county anyway.</p></speech>

Deputy Harkin and I will take five minutes each.  There are two topics about which I wish to ask questions, and then Deputy Harkin will take over.  Mention was made earlier of offshore wind power and its potential.  The Minister mentioned a target of 3 GW by 2030.  One of the biggest barriers to the development of offshore wind generation is the lack of proper foreshore legislation.  I know that is not the Minister's responsibility, rather that of the Department with responsibility for the environment, but it should be of direct interest to the Minister.  What contacts does the Minister have with the relevant Department to facilitate offshore wind generation?  There is huge potential in the development of offshore wind generation, including construction and maintenance.  Many of my neighbours in Killybegs work in the offshore sector in Scotland, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany.  What they are developing there could be developed in Ireland.  The local boat yards could be used to develop and build the vessels used in this work.  There is huge potential right across the board.  I would like to ask the Minister about that.</p>  <p>  I would also like to raise the issue of rural broadband.  Issues have arisen throughout the country.  Deputy Connolly has asked me to refer to Galway, where broadband and mobile service has been unavailable in north Connemara, Maum, Cleggan and Recess for several days.  This is causing huge problems for people trying to access the broadband networks, including elderly people and teachers communicating with students.</p> <p>It is right across the country and in Donegal we have the same problem.  For example, in Drimarone and Letterbarrow in recent days, the Eir fixed lines have been down, as have the Vodafone mobile phone lines.  I think this is due to a lack of staff to maintain them.  Will the Minister comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-05-27a.584" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1549" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="01:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020052700109#VVVVV00200"><p>I am glad to say a new Bill has been created that will deal with the gaps in the foreshore problem to which the Deputy refers.  We also have developed a unified planning system, which as the Deputy noted is not under my Department, and the Minister of State, Deputy English, has made an announcement in respect of that.  There will now be an integrated planning process, which will be regarded by the offshore sector as a significant step forward.  That infrastructure is being put in place but it will have to be passed by the House.  It is priority legislation from the point of view of the outgoing Government, as I am sure it will be of any incoming Government.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy stated, offshore wind is a significant potential opportunity and it is an area where other decisions will need to be made about the type of infrastructure we use to underpin it.  It will have to be decided whether we will require individual providers of offshore wind farms to make their own landfall or whether we will try to create a State-funded infrastructure that would make it a more integrated package.  We will need to make decisions early on that and there are a number of crucial points along the way.  The first offshore wind auction will be in the latter half of next year and a number of legacy projects will be enabled to compete in that, although it will also provide the opportunity for others to come in.  We are determined that the framework will be there to support the sector because it is a significant opportunity for Ireland.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy would care to send me details of the interruptions, I will see whether there is anything we can do.  A great deal of effort is being put in to maintain the level of telecommunications service.  The reports I get show a very high level of performance, despite in some cases 60% growth in the demand coming onto the systems.  As I said earlier, we have made spectrum available temporarily to try to support the delivery of service.  If there is a pattern of gaps, I would be happy to pursue that with ComReg.</p></speech>

He stated he will examine the feasibility of accelerating the roll-out of high-speed broadband.  In that context, will the Minister consider including in his criteria the chronic underfunding of investment in various sectors throughout the regions, whether that be roads, education, health or whatever?  I ask that the Government use that information as part of its criteria for the study.  The roll-out of high-speed broadband would help to bridge some of those gaps in investment.  Many regions usually find themselves bottom of the list.  Taking all that into consideration, will the Minister ensure, or try to ensure, that those regions do not remain at the bottom of the list and that he will broaden the criteria?</p>  <p>  My second question is about measuring carbon sequestration in agricultural practice.  As the Minister will know, it is crucial in mitigating the more negative aspects of climate change.  It is important for the new Common Agricultural Policy, the biodiversity strategy etc.  How are we planning to measure it?  Teagasc has about 100 signpost farms but my issue is that not many of them are on peatlands or wetlands, which sequester more carbon and, furthermore, do not become saturated.  Do we have plans to measure accurately the sequestration of carbon?  Who will benefit from this?  Will it be the individual farmer or will it be a national benefit?</p> <p>If it is a national benefit, how do we propose to reward or incentivise farmers who manage their agricultural holdings in such a way as to significantly sequester carbon?</p> <p> My third question is on the building of a liquified natural gas, LNG, import terminal.  It has been reported that Fine Gael has said it does not make sense.  Will the Minister confirm this?  If he can, will he say that it is not Government policy to apply to the Connecting Europe Facility for funding for something that does not make sense?</p></speech>

We will work to try to deliver that.</p>  <p>  The only element that has nodes picked out is the interim offering we are making in the course of this year.  It is a flavour of what is to come.  We will light up, not with fibre, but with high-speed broadband 150 Mbps capacity and some 270 broadband connection points.  Those points have been selected by local authorities and are in every county.  They have been designed and selected to have that sort of hub capacity in them.  They have been surveyed and solutions have been found for most of them.  The Department of Rural and Community Development, which is the Department of the Minister, Deputy Ring, has done the contracts so they will be kitted out.  Not all of them will have the same capacity as others to be a hotspot.  It will depend on their makeup and so on.  They have been selected on that basis to make an impact.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is right that the whole issue of carbon and land use is very complicated, and measurement is a difficulty.  As the Deputy will know, unfortunately Ireland's land use overall is emitting carbon and is not absorbing carbon.  We are in a negative in that regard because of the drainage and the management of certain lands and how we manage various activities on the land.  Currently it is not positive and is a negative.  I agree with Deputy Harkin that we need to try to get recognition for the work we put in now to repair, rectify and improve that land use for sequestration.  Much of that is about forestry and some is about rehabilitating bogs like what we will do with Bord na M&oacute;na.  Currently we do not get recognition in the immediate term.  We could plant to our heart's content, but we would only get recognition for it from 2030 onwards.</p>  <p>  With regard to the LNG terminal, I have always said that we would not support it until a security evaluation is done.  I believe policy is moving on and people recognise LNG will not have a place, but that is a matter for a Government to decide on.</p></speech>
