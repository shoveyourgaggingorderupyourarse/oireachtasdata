This is one of the most significant reviews of the rail network on the island in many years and it will provide a framework to develop a much-improved network for the future.  I expect to receive a final report on the review by the end of the year.  I believe this is the first time such a review has been conducted on an all-island basis.  As such, it will consider the potential of rail from a different perspective than reviews of the past.  This all-island perspective will allow us to consider afresh issues such as rail connectivity to the north west, in addition to the potential for high- or higher-speed rail between the island's major cities.</p>  <p>  I am a firm believer in the potential of rail to contribute to economic and social development across the island of Ireland, provide faster and more frequent connectivity, connect communities and help us reach our climate goals.  I do not think I am alone in that belief.  I understand that just over 7,000 responses were received during the recent public consultation on the review.  This is a very large response by comparison with responses to similar public engagements.  All the responses are being considered and will inform the development of the overall review and offer a genuine insight into the views on, and expectations and hopes for, rail of interested stakeholders across the island.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Canney knows, this review started by examining high-speed connectivity between Dublin, Belfast and Cork, but the remit has broadened.  It broadened first and foremost to include the issue of connectivity to the north west.  I have a particular interest in what I regard to be underutilised lines or sections of lines that could be inserted into the network to make better use of it as a whole.</p>  <p>  Rail freight is another aspect that is critical to the wider review.  Initially, there was a very narrow focus - on high-speed rail between cities but there is now a much broader remit.  That will provide a useful direction in a variety of ways.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1482" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300003#A00700"><p>I thank the Minister.  Let me develop the point he made about high-speed connectivity between cities.  I am concerned about the west and the absence of a connection between Galway and Mayo, in addition to the break in the line between Claremorris and Athenry, which means we do not have connectivity between the likes of Westport, Ballina, Galway, Limerick and Cork.</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned the potential of rail freight and alluded to the potential to open up rail freight lines along the western corridor.  With the potential for offshore energy generation and all that will play out in that regard, it is important to have the infrastructure in place to exploit the potential to create jobs in the regions.  As the Minister knows, the north west is an area in decline and has been designated as such by the EU.  Therefore, it is important to create the infrastructure necessary to build our jobs potential for the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300003#A00800"><p>The Deputy's knowledge of the area is far better than mine but I am not too sure that I would characterise the part of the country in question as being in decline.  What we want to do is see it develop faster.  We want better-balanced regional development.  In that context, the section of rail the Deputy mentioned is important.  The section from Athenry to Claremorris has to be seen as part of a longer whole.  In my view, the western rail corridor starts in Waterford, strangely enough.  The line is completely underutilised, particularly from Waterford to Limerick.  The lines from Limerick to Ennis and from Ennis to Galway have seen a revival and a return of passenger services, but not to the extent that would see the full use of the existing assets.  The really interesting question concerns the completion of the western corridor, running from Ballina right down the west coast to the south east.  It is in that context that we must consider that section of rail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1482" speakername="Se&aacute;n Canney" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300003#A00900"><p>I agree we have to consider it in light of the national rail network framework.  It is important that we do so with a view to providing transport modes that are different if we are to take cars off the road and create a better environment.  I am not saying the west or north west is in decline but that the EU is telling us it is and that it is subject to underinvestment.  It is a fact from the EU.  I applaud the Minister's vision and ambition, which I support 100%, but it is important not to let this opportunity go.</p>  <p>  Several weeks ago, there was talk of Intel creating a microchip facility in Oranmore.  I understand the site was not picked because it does not have the necessary infrastructure to get people in and out of the area and to have services and supports there.  That is why the infrastructure is necessary.  We need to support Shannon Foynes Port, Waterford, Cork, Galway and Rossaveal, so it is important that we create the infrastructure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300003#A01000"><p>I am not too sure that Oranmore has lost out on that yet.  Even if Intel makes the investment in another jurisdiction, the site, like others across the country, is ripe for development because we have the key raw materials needed for economic investment.  We will, as the Deputy stated, have high-quality, low-carbon power supply when we develop our offshore wind resources.  We have significant water resources.  Water is scarce in other parts of the world.  We have some of the best workers and high-quality precision-manufacturing capability.  Even if the plant in Oranmore is not advanced, I am sure alternative options will be available.</p> <p>I am sure alternative options will come forward.  I am aware that in a low-carbon world, having a low-carbon transport system and an infrastructure to back that up is part of the deal.  In that regard, I agree with the Deputy.  This is a long-term investment and we must think long term here.  When we are building rail networks, we must think of decades, not just years.  In that context, I am looking forward to the review and what it has to say.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300004#B00500"><p>The Deputy will have been aware that the Doolin volunteer team was stood down due to concerns about the safety of its operations in the circumstances pertaining at the time.  I am happy to confirm that the unit has been reconstituted on an interim basis, with a core group of volunteers who, the Coast Guard believes, can work and operate together.  This follows extensive engagement by Coast Guard management with volunteers in Doolin, culminating in my appointment of Mr. Kieran Mulvey as mediator.  Mr. Mulvey&rsquo;s report made a number of recommendations in respect of the service in Doolin.  I can advise that the Coast Guard is currently fully engaged in the process of rebuilding the Doolin unit, guided by the recommendations outlined in Mr. Mulvey&rsquo;s report which was issued on 10 December 2021.  The serving Doolin volunteers were advised by letter on 16 December 2021 that the previous unit had been stood down on a permanent basis, with all volunteer memberships terminated.  Mr. Mulvey advised that the Coast Guard and my Department should move with immediate effect to reconstitute the Doolin unit and to reinstate those members of the unit who management in the Coast Guard believe can work and operate together in a collegiate and co-operative manner.  The report advised that the reconstituted unit should be given sufficient time to develop a culture between them of mutual respect and trust.  It was also recommended that, within a further period and when deemed appropriate, a further expansion of the unit should be considered to build the unit back up to full strength from local volunteers, and preferably before next summer.</p>  <p>  I can confirm that the selection of volunteers to provide service to the reconstituted unit has been completed and those selected have been informed.  Management within the Coast Guard will soon commence the process of recruitment to the Doolin unit on a permanent basis.  Once the detailed arrangements for the process have been finalised, all Doolin current and former volunteers will be advised of those arrangements and the timeframes which will apply to the submission of applications.  We expect to be in contact with all former volunteers in relation to this recruitment process by mid-April 2022, bearing in mind Mr. Mulvey&rsquo;s recommendation to allow the reconstituted unit sufficient time to develop a culture between them of mutual respect and trust.</p></speech>

That was a real concern and still is, in many respects, because the Doolin unit has not yet been fully reconstituted.  What is the volunteer complement at the moment, on an interim basis?  How does it compare to the full capacity?  Is the Minister of State satisfied that the interim arrangement is safe, comprehensive and fit for purpose, on an interim basis?  Recommendations were made on further engagement in respect of training, operations, equipment and activities.  I ask her to provide an update on the progress made with that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300004#B00700"><p>On the complement of the team, there are currently eight members.  It is difficult to comment on the numbers of the reconstituted team.  Certainly, there will perhaps be 12 members of the team to start with.  Currently, additional cover is being provided from Kilkee and Killaloe.  Helicopter and other emergency services are also being provided.</p>  <p>  The other recommendations of the Mulvey report are being actioned by the Coast Guard in relation to the areas outlined by the Deputy.  As part of the recommendations, I have recommended an associated review of the Coastal Unit Advisory Group, CUAG, which is the official representative group of the volunteers.  I have recommended that the CUAG's terms of reference, grievance, complaints and disciplinary procedures are reviewed.  That was also a recommendation of the Mulvey report.  I have recommended that that review is completed by the end of this month.  It is absolutely critical.  The CUAG members are working with the Coast Guard on that to ensure that the CUAG plays a very strong representative role, representing the volunteers of the Coast Guard.  Along with my officials, I have been engaging on a regular basis with the CUAG in relation to that work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300004#B00800"><p>That is where I was going with my supplementary question.  As the Minister of State is aware, much attention has been focused on cultural and operational difficulties within the Coast Guard.  Indeed, committee members in particular, and people more broadly, have been contacted by volunteers and former volunteers about the issue.  A dire picture has been painted.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications has engaged with the Department and the Coast Guard.  We intend to pick up on those engagements again in April with the Irish Coast Guard Volunteers Representative Association, ICGVRA, and the CUAG.  I welcome the Minister of State's update in relation to the CUAG and the timeline she set out.  I am aware that the Minister of State has previously stated that she will not meet with the ICGVRA.  I ask her to keep that door open and to listen to what the representatives have to say when they attend the joint committee in April.  I am trying to be helpful here.  It is most important that we create space where all voices are heard.  I ask the Minister of State to keep the door open for that group.</p></speech>

It is important to state that the current and only recognised representative group for volunteers is the CUAG, which has been in existence for more than 20 years.  What I want to do, and what is happening as part of this review, is to ensure that any gaps that are there from the CUAG's perspective, whether around grievance or disciplinary procedures, are addressed and volunteers are represented fully.  According to the terms of reference, the CUAG is the representative group.  It acts as the consultative body on matters pertaining to management, training, equipment, administration and roles of the Coast Guard unit.  The CUAG has been very effective.  This review is going to be key to ensuring that the CUAG has a very strong representative role in relation to HR matters, including grievance procedures, and how they work.  That is the work that is ongoing as part of the review of the terms of reference.  That was also a recommendation made in Mr. Mulvey's report.  The work that is currently being done, hand in hand with the Coast Guard, is absolutely critical to ensuring that volunteers have all the equipment and wherewithal to deal with grievances and issues that arise.  We must remember that these people are volunteering across the country.  We must ensure that they are equipped to carry out their role.</p></speech>

In order to mitigate the impact of fuel price increases for hauliers, the diesel rebate scheme offers a partial excise refund to qualifying operators.</p> <p>In light of the challenges arising from Brexit and the uncertainty facing the sector, in budget 2020 the marginal rate of compensation at prices over &euro;1.32, VAT inclusive, was doubled up to the maximum repayment rate of 7.5 cent per litre in recognition of the vital role of the haulage sector to the economy.  In addition, businesses that are registered for VAT may deduct the VAT charged to them on the purchase of business inputs such as road diesel and other motoring costs.</p> <p> The Minister, Deputy Ryan, and I met with the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, on 10 December 2021 and again on 10 February 2022 to discuss the spike in fuel prices for hauliers and the need for the sector to make progress towards decarbonisation.  Although no way forward was agreed at those meetings, discussions on these issues are ongoing at official level. </p> <p> Similarly, the driver shortage is not a problem confined just to Ireland.  It has been a growing issue across Europe and globally for several years.  It is a multifaceted issue with a range of contributing factors, including the pandemic, which has clearly had a significant impact on many sectors.</p> <p> In 2019, my Department established the national logistics and supply chain skills group, the key objective of which is to support the promotion of careers, skills development and sustainable employment in the logistics and supply chain sector.  The group includes haulage and logistics sector industry representatives, education and training providers and all the relevant Departments.  Last year, I asked the group to examine the HGV driver shortage.</p></speech>

For hauliers, particularly small hauliers with several lorries on the road, the margins are squeezed unbelievably because of the increasing cost of fuel.  What has the Government done in response?  Based on the reply of the Minister of State, the answer is "Nothing".  It has done nothing to respond to the runaway fuel prices.  When I raised this with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, at the Oireachtas committee a couple of weeks ago in advance of the cost of living crisis, he said the Government is looking at this but it needs to be wrapped up in environmental measures.  That is all we seem to hear from the Government.  There is nothing more than that one line.  There is no detail of what it means and certainly no response in terms of addressing the immediate crisis within the sector.  Immediate action needs to be taken in respect of the rebate in the first instance.  Is the Government going to do that?</p></speech>

I am not taking away from the crisis for the sector, but just to outline what the Government has done, in budget 2020, arising from Brexit challenges, the marginal rate of compensation relating to the diesel rebate scheme was doubled.  That increase has been maintained since.  In budget 2022 there was an expansion of the accelerated capital allowance scheme for gas vehicles and refuelling equipment.  There is also the alternatively fuelled heavy-duty vehicle purchase grant scheme of March 2021 which had a significant uptake within the sector.  That is not to take away from the points the Deputy is raising in respect of the impact on the haulage sector.  I will be the first to say there are no alternatives for hauliers at the moment.  Decarbonisation is critical and they have said they are up for that.  We are dealing with a crisis in fuel prices.  There are extra pressures as a result of what is happening in Ukraine.  I and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, are engaging with the sector and considering what can be done to provide reliefs for hauliers, who are under particular stress at the moment.</p></speech>

The ball is firmly in the Government's court in terms of coming up with solutions.  The hauliers have put their hands up.  They are crying out for support.  The Minister of State mentioned the alternatively fuelled heavy-duty vehicle purchase grant scheme.  Approximately 60 vehicles bought under that scheme are currently parked up because they are not affordable to run due to compressed natural gas, CNG, not being included in the rebate.  It is a perfect example of a failure of an environmental transition.  It seems to me there is a significant element of the Government burying its head in the sand in respect of what immediately needs to happen to support the sector.</p>  <p>  I refer to the skills shortage.  There is a four-step process involving employment permits, visas if required, residency permits and then all the other pieces.  That process needs to be streamlined and the Minister of State knows it does.  It is an international crisis but there are particular issues in Ireland on which we can do more.</p></speech>

That includes the skills shortage.  It involves working with the third level sector and raising awareness of the apprenticeships in Institute of Technology Sligo and the technological universities in Cork and Dublin, as well as communicating the courses and careers that are available.  That work is ongoing.  We are working with the Department of Social Protection on recruitment drives to attract hauliers here and to encourage Irish people to engage in these apprenticeships.</p>  <p>  The cost of fuel is a key crisis at the moment.  I have been engaging constantly with the IRHA, which has been very proactive and constructive with me and departmental officials to try to find a solution.  There is no lack of will but these things will take time.  Given the impact of Covid and what is happening in Ukraine, the crisis is evolving.  The Deputy can be assured that engagement will continue and we will try to find a solution to support the sector.  That is something on which I am very much working.</p></speech>

What measures are in place to offset the additional costs of having to renew the licence every three years, compared with every ten years for other persons?  I ask the Minister to make a statement on the matter.  This relates to people who have diabetes.  Every three years, they have to renew their driving licence.  It is costing them &euro;50 or &euro;60 straight away to get a report from a doctor.  Will something be done about that?  This is causing untold unfairness.  These people are being treated differently from other citizens.</p></reply>

Under the EU directives, a person with an identified or specified illness, such as diabetes, is required to provide a medical report when applying for a learner permit or driving licence.  The medical report must be completed by a general practitioner, GP, and a licence may be issued for one, three or ten years.  The period of issue is based on the GP's assessment of the applicant and his or her recommendation.  This is based on the medical advice determined by a GP when the person presents to him or her.</p>  <p>  A clinical guidance document, Sl&aacute;inte agus Tiom&aacute;int Medical Fitness to Drive Guidelines, is compiled by the Road Safety Authority in conjunction with the National Office for Traffic Medicine.  It provides guidelines for medical professionals to assist in their assessment of an individual applicant's fitness to drive a motor vehicle.</p>  <p>  A ten-year driving licence costs &euro;55.  A reduced fee of &euro;35 is charged for a three-year licence, while there is no charge for a one-year licence.  I hear the concerns the Deputy is raising in respect of the costs and I will certainly follow up with the RSA in respect of the cost differential.</p></speech>

Where I am coming from is that the three-year licence costs &euro;35.  It is cheaper than the &euro;55 for a ten-year licence, but within that the ten-year period, these people have to take out four three-year licence, so they actually paying approximately &euro;140 or &euro;145.  That is not the issue, however.  It is not about whether it is a three-year, one-year or ten-year licence.  Thanks be to God, if I go looking for a medical certificate for driving a lorry or whatever, I can get a ten-year certificate.  However, if a person has an underlying condition such as diabetes, there are rules and regulations.  It needs to be tied in with the likes of the HSE that there is something done so these people do not have to pay to go to a doctor three times extra on top of the other costs.</p> <p>There is no doctor charging less than &euro;60 for working people.  These people do not have medical cards or anything like that.  The problem is when one adds these numbers together.  I ask that the Minister talk to the Road Safety Authority, RSA, to try to resolve this issue.</p></speech>

The other issue may be a Department of Health one as it involves going to a doctor for a medical checkup.  It is not my area but I do not believe that is covered by the GP card but I will certainly talk to the RSA around the licence fee issue.</p>  <p>  I reiterate that this is a vital road safety tool and I appreciate the Deputy has not questioned that.  GPs have to do their work and many conditions are degenerative or may be volatile if they are not managed properly.  That is where the GPs expertise comes in, where patients may require regular monitoring to determine if they are safe to drive.</p>  <p>  I will also say that not all licences for people with a specified condition are issued for shorter periods.  It is up to the GP and contingent on his or her clinical assessment of that.  I will commit to speaking to the RSA on the fees question.</p></speech>

I wish to clarify one matter, please.  Did the Minister of State state that if the GP says the person is okay to drive longer than the three years, that that is acceptable as I may have picked her up wrong on that point?</p>  <p>  I welcome what the Minister of State said and I ask her to focus on this because there are many people who, unfortunately, have diabetes and other underlying conditions and we have to try to help people who are working and finding it difficult.  </p>  <p>  I will check the GP question but what happens in general is that when a person goes to a GP for a letter, he or she is paying for it.  I have seen people who have medical cards being asked for money for such a letter.</p></speech>

It is up to them, as they are the medical experts, to give the clinical assessment as to somebody's ability to drive.  It is completely within their remit.</p>  <p>  That comes from the National Office for Traffic Medicine, which was jointly established by the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland and the Road Safety Authority, and which brings the specialty of traffic medicine to Ireland.  It was brought in in 2011 and we are looking at road safety and at clinicians leading on this in respect of that assessment.</p>  <p>  I will follow up on the other issue for the Deputy.</p></speech>

It will inform the development of the railway sector on the island of Ireland over the coming decades.  The review will consider the potential scope for improved rail services along various existing and potential future corridors of the network, and that scope will also include the potential afforded by disused and closed lines such as the Kingscourt line.</p>  <p>  Separately the Deputy will be aware of the work under way by the National Transport Authority in its review of the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area.  The draft review is recommending the development of a rail line to Navan by 2042.  I understand that this rail line will utilise the old Kingscourt line over a short distance to connect the proposed Navan central station and a proposed Navan north station. </p>  <p>  More generally, I can assure Deputies that as well as looking at issues relating to inter-urban and inter-regional rail connectivity and the potential for high and higher speeds, the rail review will also consider improved connectivity to the north west and the Border region.</p>  <p>  I have already stated my belief in the potential of rail.  It is essential that we identify current constraints in the rail sector, then balance decarbonisation priorities, economic growth and rural connectivity objectives to achieve a strategy which allows rail to fulfil its potential as a resilient and sustainable mode of transport and generator of economic growth for people across Ireland.  The strategic rail review will assist in and inform this debate, including I hope, on the reopening of the Kingscourt line, and I look forward to the completion of the review later this year.</p></speech>

I was always very struck by the Minister when in opposition, and when I was also an opposition Member, because he always admired the ambition that I had for that rail line coming to a county along the Border in Cavan.  If one looks at the map of Ireland and looks to see where the main arteries and infrastructure is, one can draw a line from Dublin to Galway.  North of that we have, as a State, neglected that part of this island.  I am very hopeful for this project with this Minister in post.  I am aware Meath County Council is doing terrific work in ensuring that the rail line comes to Navan.  We need to be ambitious for the whole Border region and to start to look at that.</p>  <p>  Great work has been done with the greenway on the existing rail line that is there but alongside that, we need to have the ambition and to encourage our local authorities to do this, with the support of the Minister's Department in the relevant areas, to ensure they have this kind of ambition and these kinds of plans are put in place.</p></speech>

There is a great opportunity here and we have made submissions to the overall rail review.  The Joint Committee on Transport and Communications is looking at various aspects of this.  I will mention two of these.  The Minister has already discussed the western rail corridor, WRC, and some of the opportunity this presents.  This is an ambition that needs to realised.</p>  <p>  There is the focus on the Navan rail line extension, which is very significant and has the potential to be the first step in a series of steps.  Communities further up the line would also like to see this development.</p>  <p>  I will also make the point to the Minister that it is important that we act early, including on the planning process, as there are prominent figures in the region who are receiving national media attention already in their opposition to that project and how they intend to frustrate it and that needs to be overcome.</p></speech>

It is utterly shameful that the western rail corridor connecting Athenry, Tuam, Milltown and, ultimately, Enniskillen, if it is extended all of the way, a vital piece of public infrastructure, has been left to rot for the past 40 years.  It is bringing no economic benefit whatsoever to the west of Ireland and to my constituency.</p>  <p>  What we simply need to do here is to make a decision.  Every report that has been published over the past decade has concluded that there is no economic case to be made for the reopening of any rail service on that line.  The Minister's Department arrived at the same conclusions.  Irish Rail published a report last July outlining its rail freight strategy for the next 20 years to the year 2040 and there was not one single word about the western rail corridor.  The Minister referred the most recent WRC report to JASPERS, the Joint Assistance to Support Projects in European Regions partnership body, and the most respected think tank when it comes to the economics of developing transport infrastructure, and its conclusion, quite simply, was that: "... there is no evidence of specific transport or social constraints, nor of clear objectives that any investment in this corridor is required to meet."</p>  <p>  I ask that the Minister finally make a decision to build a railway with a greenway alongside it or to build a greenway.  I ask also that the Minister, who has done extraordinary work in this area of active transport, not to leave this line to rot for another 40 years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.59" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300006#D02100"><p>There are two or three different issues here but they all have the one same connecting issue in that they all involve increased connectivity to the north and west.  The Navan rail link, north and west of Dublin, has been assessed as part of the draft greater Dublin area strategy and I agree with the assessment that the case has been made and that it will be included once the greater Dublin area, GDA, strategy becomes fully legal in our plans.  It will take time.  In respect of the constraints, there is not a lack of ambition or urgency here but there is one reality we have to face.</p> <p>There are already approximately &euro;70 billion worth of projects within the existing transport projects in the planning process and we have a &euro;35 billion budget for this decade.  That is a real constraint and difficulty.  However, it does not undermine the case for that line to Navan.  If that proceeds, it raises the question of whether one could go further.  Could one go from Navan along the old route towards Kingscourt?  One could even consider, if one was massively ambitious, that this was an original line up through Monaghan, Omagh, Strabane and into Derry.  Part of the strategic rail review recognises that the north west of the island has been neglected in terms of transport connectivity and in that really big long-term context it makes sense.  However, it is much more challenging because that rail line has not been used for a significant period.  There is quite a lot of quarrying, industrial and other activity in that part of the country and perhaps we could look at whether that would be a way of reopening the line, holding the reservation, getting trains back and then seeing if passenger services can follow on.</p> <p> When it comes to the north west and the western rail corridor, as Deputy Cannon said it could potentially run up to Sligo or Enniskillen.  Again, that is a very long-term prospect.  Once one goes north of Claremorris, the line is not extant.  Everyone is agreed that the section north towards Collooney and Sligo is highly unlikely in the immediate future to be considered for rail services.  I believe there is broad agreement that it should be a greenway, except I am not certain whether Mayo County Council, Galway County Council and Sligo County Council are in agreement as to how and where that route should be devised and designed.  From my perspective, that is one of the biggest obstacles to providing a greenway in that area.  The section from Claremorris to Athenry is a different issue.  From Claremorris one can join onto the existing rail network towards Ballina or Westport.  There is a strategic question in a much wider national context which the original rail reviews did not look at in that section of line.  If one looks at it in a narrow context, is there is a demand for commuting from Claremorris or Tuam into Galway on rail?  The answer is clearly "No", as Joint Assistance to Support Projects in the European Regions, JASPERS, said.  However, is it potentially a part of a strategic western rail corridor which extends all the way from Ballina down the west coast through Limerick towards Waterford?  That is a different question which neither JASPERS nor anybody else has asked yet and which the strategic rail review is now looking at.</p></speech>

As I said, there is incredible work being done in developing it as a greenway, but I believe we must be ambitious.  We must have a vision of reopening that as a rail line to Kingscourt because the potential it has to open the Border region is huge.  A large proportion of the population in Cavan and Monaghan commutes to Dublin.  If we are serious about getting traffic off the roads, that is the way to do it.  I know the Minister wholeheartedly believes that, but the local authorities and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann need the support of the Government to have that imagination and ambition and lay down the plans.  Let us not allow these rail lines to rot into dust.  We have a real opportunity.  There is a climate emergency.  There is no need for me to tell the Minister that because he has been preaching it to us for long enough.  Let us do something about it.  Let us have that ambition and reopen that rail line.</p></speech>

The opportunity is available.  If one maps our rail infrastructure and our forced car dependency, there has to be very significant development if we are to achieve a modal shift.  Much of that will be to an improved public bus network, but rail has a very important role to play.  I am speaking about Navan but also about the west and north west.  Communities are chomping at the bit for this.  They have their hands up and they want to see this delivered.  I believe that if it was built, it would be used very extensively.  I raised the question of funding with the Minister during climate questions last week.  That is going to be a continuing challenge, not just at the Irish level but also at European level.  We need to look at the window that is closing in the climate context.</p></speech>

The west of Ireland is not the Ruhr valley with steel mills pumping out tons of steel every day or coalmines pumping out tons of coal.  The west of Ireland is securing its future in technology, pharmaceuticals and in medical technology.  It has no, and will have no, demand for rail freight to any great extent for the foreseeable future, if ever.  The EY-DKM report drew the same conclusion.  Research by the EU suggests that rail freight only makes financial sense when the distances involved are greater than 150 km.  Almost all of Ireland falls within 150 km of a port and, as such, the demand for rail freight is anticipated to be muted.</p>  <p>  The Minister has done incredible work in putting in place a budget of &euro;1 million for every day for the lifetime of this Government for investment in active travel and sustainable travel infrastructure.  We need to see that investment being made in the west.  Please do not be the Minister who does nothing and leaves this crucial piece of public infrastructure bringing no benefit to the communities that urgently need such a benefit, not in the future but now.</p></speech>

I believe this is one of low-hanging fruit pieces of rail infrastructure.  We can get that open if we wish in a matter of just a few years.  There is talk of trying to get it open in time for the Ryder Cup, but I believe we can do it sooner than that.  If we open that rail line in the next 24 to 36 months, we can connect Limerick city, Patrickswell, Adare, Rathkeale, Askeaton and Foynes.  There is a freight reason for this particular line in the west because of the nature of the industry around the Shannon estuary.  There is also a passenger case to be made for it.  It would also feed into the wider plans to develop a suburban rail network around Limerick.  I ask that this be raised in the Minister's priority list and that we get it open sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

We have a real challenge in that the number of Cavan and Monaghan people commuting to Dublin is very significant and they are coming into a city that is not going to have the same road capacity.  When we introduce the BusConnects scheme, all the cars commuting from long distances as well as vans and trucks will be meeting a Dublin road network that is at capacity and restricted in terms of access.  The remote working that will occur post the pandemic may help in that regard.  It may help towns and villages in Cavan and Monaghan see a big revival.  What my colleague, the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, is doing with the new hubs is an opportunity to rethink the way we work and commute.  Rail can provide a massively useful component in that.  It would help us meet our climate targets as well as address commuting.</p>  <p>  However, I return to the fact that there is a constraint here, which is capital.  Even if we do for the next decade what we do in this decade, the existing projects will eat up all that money.  Every part of the country is looking at rail projects.  There are also rural bus projects that we have to fund, and the Connecting Ireland plan is the most significant and important investment we have to prioritise.  There is a challenge, therefore, in how we prioritise or how we do it, but I would not rule it out.  I would go further in terms of reallocating more of our roads funding towards public transport that might help us overcome some of that difficulty, but that is something we have to agree on politically and that will be a challenge, as the Deputy knows.</p>  <p>  To respond to Deputy O'Rourke regarding the Navan rail line, it is now very much in train as part of the series of projects that we will fund over the period of two decades.  The route validation exercise for that route has been completed.  There are two routes.  Route A is 34 km as per the draft railway order completed by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in 2011.</p> <p>Route B is similar to route A but with a section to the east side of Dunshaughlin.  It is in planning and is being considered.  Cost estimations for each of these route options is expected to be completed soon.  It gives a clear picture of how it fits in with the real challenge we have in meeting all of the capital we need.</p> <p> To come back to the north-west rail corridor and the future of freight, Deputy Cannon is right there are real challenges in Ireland because of the shorter distances and because we have developed road dependency.  We have put tens of billions of euro over the years into closing our rail freight system and opening up alternative road-based systems.  It is not a surprise the economics are challenging with regard to the shunting yards and all of the other equipment that would help make rail freight possible.  I do not believe it is completely finished, however, or that it will not be part of the solution in meeting the climate challenge and having a vibrant modern economy.  In Europe and throughout the world people are looking again at sustainable solutions.</p> <p> Forest products are still moved by rail.  A number of products from the north west are carried from Ballina by rail freight at present.  As Deputy Leddin said, we will reopen the Foynes line.  One of the reasons we will do so, as well as to get golfers to the Ryder Cup in a sustainable low-carbon way and benefiting the communities he mentioned with stations along the route, is that we expect new mines to be developed along the existing rail lines.  It would be insanity to ship mine ore by road.  It will go by rail.  Once we start to have some products moved by rail the economics will begin to make sense because we will cover the main line costs and the incremental costs will begin to decrease.  Earlier we were speaking about big industrial investment in Oranmore close to the rail network and on the rail network.</p></speech>

As the Minister knows there is a commuter hell experience for people living in County Meath in terms of trying to get to work in Dublin.  There is a cost of living crisis with the increase in fuels.  There is a global warming crisis happening at present.  A rail line from Navan to Dublin would fix all of these issues.  It has been spoken about for years.

I am aware that this issue is one that generated a significant number of submissions during the public consultation held by the NTA in November 2020.</p>  <p>  On the proposal itself, the assessment report undertaken by the NTA was published as a background paper to the draft transport strategy at the end of 2021.  It considered again the strategic rationale for such a rail link, assessed rail and bus options, re-examined the potential alignments of a rail link and provided a high-level assessment of cost and demand.</p>  <p>  The wider appraisal, which examined the qualitative and quantitative benefits of the Navan rail line, has shown that the scheme has the potential to deliver significant economic, environmental and social benefits along the Dublin-Navan corridor.  On the basis of the assessment, the report concluded there was a strong strategic rationale for the proposal and this is why it has been brought forward for inclusion in the draft strategy. </p>  <p>  The NTA's transport strategy is subject to a formal statutory approval process and a final version will ultimately be submitted for my approval later this year.  If included in the final strategy, this project will require significant planning and design before construction can commence.  As it stands, the draft strategy proposes delivery of the Navan rail line in the latter half of the strategy period.</p></speech>

I know everybody comes in here thinking their own county is a special case.  This morning, the majority of workers in County Meath left County Meath to go to work.  This happens in no other local authority area in the 32 counties of this great country.  People from Meath commute further to work than people in any other county.  I know the damage it is doing to people.  I know of people spending three hours commuting a day.  They do not get to see their families during the week.  They get to see their families at the weekend alone.  It is having an enormous economic impact.  Travelling these journeys on a daily basis costs families thousands of euro never mind the cost to the environment.  The problem is that we have had dozens of feasibility studies.  We have had analysis and reviews coming out of our ears for decades in County Meath.  It is in a draft plan at present.  What is missing is the political will.  I have confidence that if it is going to happen it will happen under the Minister's stewardship.  I ask the Minister to give it the political will.  I ask the Minister to say today that it will happen.</p></speech>

I am on the record in the House and elsewhere saying I believe it does make strategic sense because what the Deputy says is true.  We have developed a completely unsustainable planning, housing, development and transport model particularly in the eastern region but also throughout the country.  We have had doughnut development where we go out and out and out.  It still continues.  According to the latest statistics 74% of all new houses in the country are being built in the greater Dublin area, including counties Meath, Kildare, Louth and Wicklow.  Half of the building in the area is in these surrounding counties.  There is a real problem that if we do not start switching our commuting patterns away from road-based systems towards rail and public transport systems the maths just simply will not work.  Many of the commuters coming into Dublin city will hit an M50 that is at capacity where no additional capacity can be provided.  It is inevitable gridlock.  The Deputy spoke about the human cost of long commuting times and being stuck in traffic as well as the environmental and economic inefficiencies of it.  I am very supportive.  This is why through the process with the NTA any time I have been asked I have said that it seems to make strategic sense.  The NTA has come back to confirm this.  We must now do the cost estimations.  As I said to Deputy O'Rourke earlier, this is what we are doing.  We are on track.  It will take time.  There is a queue and planning in this country takes inordinate time.  There is no lack of commitment to the project.</p></speech>

Ireland is a lopsided economy at present.  Dublin is overheating.  The Dublin commuter belt goes into Ulster, Connacht and Munster.  Much of regional Ireland is being emptied of its young people.  We have a situation where the average age in Baldoyle is 33 and the average age in Killarney is 45.  Young people are being forced into this commuter belt.  These young people are the collateral damage of this.  Their lives and existence at present are a catastrophe.  I know people from out as far as Castlepollard and Clonmel who stay in Dublin during the week because getting in and out of it is so difficult.  People bought houses in County Meath 20 years ago on the promise there would be a rail line in 2010.  We were promised it in 2015.  My worry is that unless a solid gold commitment is made by the Minister to deliver this it will remain in feasibility studies forever.</p></speech>

Originally the Planning Act 2000 was a very good Act but it has been amended so many times and is so complex, multilayered and multifaceted that it is very hard for anyone to implement.</p> <p>The review, updating and recalibrating of that legislation is one of the most important projects the Government has under way.  It will be completed by the end of the year and will help not just this project, but a whole range of projects, to get through the planning process more quickly.  I keep coming back to the point that we should be straight and honest that, to get the country more balanced in this way, we will also have to invest in rail in Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick.  We will have to invest in rural public transport and build a metro in Dublin, about which I am going to be asked questions.  That is one reality.  Planning is one issue but the allocation of capital expenditure will mean that not every project will be built tomorrow.  However, as to the question of whether we should or will build the Navan rail line, we certainly will.</p></speech>

The focus of the current work of the PRDO is looking at options and the feasibility of zones along corridors for the east and north east serving the city centre and Parkmore.</p>  <p>  The areas currently being considered include zones adjacent to the Coolagh roundabout and junction 19 on the M6, locations on the N83, the old Dublin Road and the R339.  Consideration is also being given to supporting additional park-and-ride facilities at Oranmore rail station.  Detailed site options analysis and feasibility studies are ongoing for each of the areas identified.</p>  <p>  The PRDO has undertaken site visits to the area and topographical drone surveys of lands in the zones identified have been carried out.  These surveys give detailed information on the physical characteristics of the area, which help identify any potential constraints and inform the preliminary design and layouts of the proposed park-and-ride developments.  Other information such as information on ecology, archaeology, flooding and public transport capacity, in addition to land title searches and traffic data analysis, is being utilised in a multi-criteria analysis to determine the preferred sites to bring forward to planning.</p>  <p>  The development of the particular sites will be aligned with the delivery of other supporting infrastructure, in particular bus corridor infrastructure with a view to bringing sites forward for planning in the latter half of 2022.  The appropriate planning consent process will be determined on a site-by-site basis.</p></speech>

These objectives were included in the city development plan in 2005 by the councillors.  The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, was there at the time.  It was positive and proactive.  We recognised that it was important.  Yesterday or the day before, we saw the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which spelled out the terrible consequences there will be if we do not take action.  The National Transport Authority was involved in developing the transport plan in 2016.  At that point, it was fully aware that no action had been taken since 2005.  The Minister's response today shows me that some progress has been made with regard to the east side of the city.  The west has been completely forgotten.  In previous answers, which I have to hand, I was told that sites on both the east and west sides were being looked at.  They are the objectives in the plan.  Here we are in 2022 dealing with an objective from 2005 and not one single site has been identified for park-and-ride facilities as traffic congestion in Galway worsens.</p></speech>

I hope I am not being controversial and I mean no disrespect to anyone in Galway but Galway is probably where we have our biggest and worst problem with regard to sustainable transport.  The city has been very successful in developing but it has an unsustainable transport model that prioritises and promotes transport based on individual cars.  I do not blame or fault people who have to use their own cars but it becomes completely unsustainable when a certain level of traffic is reached.  That is where we are at in Galway.  We need to accelerate some of the sustainable transport solutions in Galway, particularly some of the active travel and BusConnects infrastructure, which would help people use the infrastructure we are discussing, and the development of the railway station at Oranmore, which we mentioned earlier.  That integrated approach is required.  Park-and-ride facilities have to be part of wider sustainable transport solutions.  We should also have bike-and-ride facilities.  There is significant potential in providing bike parking, particularly at rail and bus stations.  Particularly in light of new electric bikes, there is capacity to rethink how our cities and rural communities work.  We need to accelerate development not only of the park-and-ride facilities, but of the active travel and bus travel infrastructure that needs to go with those facilities as part of an overall solution.</p></speech>

We did this in our time as councillors.  We asked for an integrated traffic solution.  All of the eggs were put in the basket of the outer bypass and nothing was done.  Reading the response, I see that we are still talking about some distant time in the future while the west of the city has gone off the record altogether.  Of course, park-and-ride facilities are only one feature.  Cycling, light rail, using Oranmore and Athenry and increasing the frequency of trains are all also features.  The most frustrating thing is that Galway is a city destined to grow.  We cannot destroy its natural beauty.  Thanks be to God, we have a beautiful city.  However, we have certainly messed up the planning and we continue to do so.  We do not have a city architect or an overall master plan for the city that is a plan for the common good.  We have no recognition of the urgency of lifting traffic off the road and providing sustainable alternatives.  You cannot complain about motorists without providing sustainable alternatives.  There is no recognition of how urgent this is in view of the climate change emergency.</p></speech>

I am particularly pleased that he makes specific reference to the double-tracking of the line from Athenry to Oranmore and to the enhancement of those stations.  I thank him and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, for making this a priority.  I ask that this be developed with the greatest expediency possible.  Athenry is a town of just over 5,000 people.  The population has doubled over the last 20 years.  Oranmore is also a town of 5,000 people whose population has doubled over the last 20 years.  In its most recent analysis, the Central Statistics Office tells us that there are 1,850 people commuting to and from Athenry and Oranmore to Galway city every day, almost twice the number of people commuting from the whole of County Mayo.  This is the investment and this is the urgency.  This double-tracking and increasing the frequency of the trains is exactly what we need to see happening, as Deputy Connolly has already said.  Finally, there is a serious inequity between the fares paid by people from the commuter belt of Galway city, and those of Limerick, Waterford and other cities, in comparison to the fares paid by people living in the greater Dublin region.  Irish Rail needs to look at that urgently.</p></speech>

Transport is a particular issue.  In addition to the planning review to be carried out with the Attorney General's office, which I mentioned earlier, the Government has agreed to establish fast-track teams in a number of key areas.  We need to set targets and work programmes for the remaining three years of this Government.  One of the key project teams will be working on the area of sustainable mobility.  These teams are only starting.  The key project for that sustainable mobility team is to look at cities like Galway to see what transport-related emissions are projected for 2030 and what we could do in the next three years to move away from the current completely unsustainable high-carbon model, which will not be tolerable for any modern city seeking to place itself at the forefront of civilisation and where we are going.  That sustainable mobility project team will look at the likes of the delivery of the BusConnects projects, the active travel projects and the park-and-ride projects that must integrate together and start to be delivered in that three-year period, although not every element will be completed within that time.  We need to make progress.  We are not moving fast enough.</p></speech>

Locals are raising questions about various aspects of the road and in particular the two tie-in points with the existing road at An Sliabh Riabhach on the west and at the Lee bridge at the eastern side.  On the western side locals feel they might end up having to travel up to 2 km to loop around to get on the road to Cork.

Once funding arrangements have been put in place with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015, and in line with the national development plan, the planning, design, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads is a matter for TII, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.</p>  <p>  The ongoing new bypass project consists of the construction of a dual carriageway from Macroom to Ballyvourney, finishing just before the county bounds of Kerry.  The project comprises a 22 km dual carriageway with four junctions beginning west of Ballyvourney passing north of Macroom and rejoining the existing N22 south of Macroom.</p>  <p>  Construction commenced in the first quarter of 2020 and is due for completion in the first quarter of 2024.  Construction is progressing to plan, with significant earthworks operations under way.  Construction of a significant number of structures is ongoing.  The longest precast concrete beams in Ireland, at 49 m, were manufactured for a bridge on this scheme and were successfully lifted into place in December 2020.  In addition, a large steel deck was successfully launched across a river and valley in March 2021.  A number of structures with decks in place will facilitate the mass haul of earthworks on the scheme from west to east.</p>  <p>  Overall, works are approximately 60% to 65% complete with full completion expected in 2024 and a possible early opening of a section of the scheme in late 2022 or early 2023.</p>  <p>  TII has informed my Department that signage will be provided at both ends of the scheme to warn the oncoming road users of the new road layout ahead.  Cyclists and pedestrians will be asked to use the old N22 which will be adapted, where possible, to accommodate active travel modes.</p>  <p>  Cork County Council is reviewing the existing junctions to ensure road safety.  The N22-R585 Castlemore junction is currently under assessment and will be subject to safety improvements in early next year.  Other junctions on this section of the N22 will be reviewed in order of priority, taking account of accident data.</p></speech>

It would be very welcome if there was an opportunity to open the piece around the town ahead of the rest as much of the work has already been done with bridges in place and so on.  I would encourage the Minster to raise that with TII and the various authorities to see if it is possible to open the piece around the town first.</p>  <p>  I wish to focus on the tie-ins, at the western end at An Sliabh Riabhach and the eastern end at the Lee bridge, which should be safe for locals - not people who are on the new road but people accessing the old road immediately adjacent to it.  Every effort should be made to ensure it is safe at those points, for example coming up at An Sliabh Riabhach or at the Lee bridge and going up to the Danone plant.</p></speech>

His first suggestion about the early opening of the section in order that Macroom town would be bypassed makes eminent sense.  It is a town that has struggled and suffered from the volume of traffic through it.  It is a beautiful town which I think will rise once the bypass is built.</p>  <p>  I really hope that Cork County Council will consider removing through traffic from the centre of the town or providing for access only.  We do not want to restrict anyone's access.  Of course, the Deputy knows the town square very well.  There would be enormous benefit if we take out that through traffic thereby creating a civic space which could bring a concentration of life back into the town.  It became very much a commuting town for Cork, Little Island and so on with people commuting to work.  By bringing the centre back to a really amazing public place, we will get people working and living in Macroom and a really strong sense of community.  Putting the bypass in provides an opportunity to take the through traffic out and we should start with the main square in Macroom.</p></speech>

The progress on the bypass section is very positive.  The section just east of it remains a concern, especially for people getting on and off the existing road, for example, turning in at the Danone plant or at Dunisky, Ballytrasna, Killcondy, Stage Cross, Cloughduv or Castlemore cross.  Both junctions will remain there, totally independent of the bypass because they are east of the town.  Can measures be put in place to make it safe for people to get on and off the existing road between Ballincollig and Macroom?  Some people cross over and back, including students going to secondary school in Coachford, coming from Cloughduv, Aherla, Crookstown and Ovens, are over and back that road several times a day, as are people from Farran going to &Eacute;ire &Oacute;g for training.  There is much back and forth traffic and it is important for those junctions to be made safe.</p></speech>

However, as I said earlier, I will ask Cork County Council and TII to look specifically at how the existing road network fits in.  We do not want a major national artery which divides local communities.  It needs to give them safe and easy access into the town.  I fully accept the Deputy's point and will ask the engineers to look at it in detail.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, that ceased at that time.  As we know the local improvement scheme provides for the upgrading of more minor local roads which are particularly important for rural communities.  At present, most counties have a significant backlog of such roads in need of urgent attention.  There is a limited scheme at present, but we need substantial investment by the line Department on an annual basis to ensure this backlog is eliminated as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The estimated cost of the backlog is in excess of &euro;5 billion.  For this reason, grant assistance from the Department continues to be focused on the protection and renewal of the public road network.</p>  <p>  It bears restating that the public regional and road network is over 96,000 km in size and while grant funding has increased significantly in recent years, it has not been possible to address the backlog of works across the country even with 90% of available funds being directed to protection and renewal works.  For this reason and in view of the funding being provided under a local improvement scheme by the Department of Rural and Community Development, I consider that I need to continue to concentrate funding on public roads.</p>  <p>  If I were to consider allocating funding for non-public roads, this would reduce the funding available for public roads.  In this context, one initiative taken since the Department of Rural and Community Development's introduction of a local improvement scheme is the provision by my Department of ring-fenced funding for the community involvement scheme.  This scheme is designed to provide for the repair of more lightly trafficked public rural roads, which tend to be considered only towards the end of road authorities&rsquo; annual roadworks programmes.  Under this scheme, &euro;29 million approximately was paid to local authorities over 2020 and 2021 and this year's grants include funding of a further &euro;15.2 million for the community involvement scheme.  All available grant funding for 2022 has been allocated.  There was an increased allocation recognising that new investment in our local roads is important for safety and for rural connectivity.  It also saves money in the long run because if we let them go, it is much more expensive to get them back.  On that basis, we allocated the funding.</p></speech>

The reply prepared by the Department is somewhat inaccurate in that the backlog does not go back to 2008; it began in 2012.</p> <p>The Minister and I were members of a Government that, until 2011, provided very substantial funding for the local improvement scheme.  I agree that we need huge investment in our regional and local network.  When the Minister met Fianna F&aacute;il Oireachtas Members with me, he may recall that I highlighted the need to maintain investment in the non-national road network to ensure we did not lose the investment that had already been made.  At the same time, I know many laneways and local roads along which ten or 12 families live.  These are people of all age groups and people who, thankfully, have come back to live in their local communities.  In many of those areas we have the social infrastructure in place, be it schools, sporting facilities or whatever.  I now have queries from people who want to move back to rural Ireland.  They want to go back to live in their home places and they ask me whether there is any chance that the roads along which they have their sites will be brought up to an acceptable and appropriate standard.  These people pay their taxes, as do people living in urban areas, who have good roads and road surfaces, footpaths and public lighting.  These people are being denied proper road surfaces leading to their homes, which is not acceptable.  The Minister will agree with me on that, I am sure.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right that the Government formed in 2008 did a lot in very difficult times and with very stretched funding.  It prioritised this investment.  We need to do likewise in this post-Covid moment, when there is a chance to see a revival of rural Ireland.  I accept that.  That means we have to fund the new Connecting Ireland rural public transport system, which will be of huge benefit and help people in rural Ireland.  That is why we increased the funding for local roads and made sure we maintained the funding for public road maintenance.  If we let that go, it costs a lot more to bring it back.  That is why the Minister for Rural and Community Development doubled the funding for the local improvement scheme under her budget allocation in 2021, providing an additional &euro;10.5 million up to &euro;21 million in funding.  It is not that there is no recognition of the importance of rural connectivity.  I refer to those three measures, namely, bus services, public roads and, through the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, local improvement scheme funding.</p></speech>

In the past, as the Minister will recall, when the Department of Rural and Community Development had a CL&Aacute;R programme, it used to involve a top-up to the line Department's funding.  The people I am talking about live down small local roads where no public transport goes but they are entitled to a proper standard of road leading to their homes.  The policy is contradictory.  We want people out of the major urban areas and less pressure on housing in our major cities and towns.  We have the infrastructure in place, by and large, in rural Ireland.  With a relatively small investment, that important road network could be brought up to a proper standard.</p>  <p>  Does the Minister happen to recall what capital funding in 2021 his Department did not draw down?  If there is an underspend on the capital side in his Department during the course of this year, it should be reallocated to councils and allocated specifically for a local improvement scheme.  That would see great value for Government investment.  I appeal to the Minister again to look at the particular needs of rural communities of all age groups.</p></speech>

Since the introduction of that ring-fenced funding in 2018, there has been a significant increase, with funding allocated in two-year tranches.  Approximately &euro;14.3 million was paid to local authorities for the community scheme last year.  A new round of funding is starting this year for the 2022-23 period.  While community contributions in the range of 15% to 30% had been required previously, depending on the mix of works and moneys, the contribution rate has now been reduced to a minimum of 10% for monetary contributions and 20% for work contributions.  It is not that our Department does not have any involvement.  Through that mechanism and through the Department of Rural and Community Development, what we spend on public roads and the new money we will spend on rural bus connectivity, I hope, will attract back those people who, as the Deputy said, are thinking of coming back to live in rural Ireland.</p></speech>

I assure the Deputy that I will continue to support Shannon Group in its engagement with the relevant local authorities to secure the future of the sites currently within Shannon Heritage.  I advise the Deputy that Shannon Group continues to work with the relevant local authorities, including Clare County Council, to reach agreement on the transfer of Shannon Heritage sites and its business.  My Department is engaging with Shannon Group, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to ensure the smooth transfer of these sites.  As the Deputy will be aware, the transfer of the sites is subject to agreement between the parties, completion of the required due diligence and the applicable consents of the Ministers for Transport and Public Expenditure and Reform.  The agreement of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will also be required.</p>  <p>  I also advise the Deputy that the OPW has agreed to re-engage on its maintenance responsibilities and role in respect of the maintenance of Bunratty Castle and King John's Castle.  In preparation for undertaking this role, the OPW has been carrying out the necessary assessments of both buildings to inform the programme of works needed and the associated costs.  My Department continues to engage with the OPW in that regard.</p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that the Government acknowledges and appreciates the strategic importance of these heritage sites to the mid-west region and the country's tourism offering and the contribution they make to our built heritage.  I understand that Bunratty Castle and King John's Castle are currently open on a four-day-week basis until March 2022.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that it is envisaged that those sites will reopen fully in April.  I am also happy to report that, as the public health restrictions put in place due to Covid were eased in the second half of 2021, visitor numbers to Shannon Heritage sites have increased.  With the removal of all the restrictions and the return of transatlantic flights into Shannon Airport this month, I am confident that visitor numbers to the sites will continue to grow.</p></speech>

In recent years, however, it has also run the heritage portfolio in the mid-west.  That has probably been a distraction, and Covid has exposed that.  Everyone in the region wants this to be a success, but what we have seen since that decision was taken by the Cabinet is that the Shannon Heritage sites have slowly been run into the ground.  Last Sunday I visited the tearooms, which were iconic.  So many American tourists went in there for their Irish coffee and slices of apple tart.  The roof of the building is falling in.  It is being repaired.  The thatch is falling off.  It is the same with the roof of the castle, which is 800 years old.  The castle has withstood sieges, fires and storms but its roof is now at risk of falling in.</p>  <p>  While the Minister of State's response is welcome, it strikes me that too many cooks spoil the broth.  We have the OPW, the Departments of Transport and Public Expenditure and Reform, local government and heritage organisations.  There is a lot going on here, and a lot of line Ministries seem to be passing the matter on.  The net loser will be Clare County Council because, at the end of May, it will take over these sites and it looks like there will be no subvention money coming.  We would like to know if there will be subvention coming.</p></speech>

Because of the complexity of the matter and the need for due diligence, we do need the Ministers for Transport, Public Expenditure and Reform and Housing, Local Government and Heritage to sign off on this.  Once the due diligence exercises are completed, the final business transfer agreements can be signed and all the necessary consents by the Ministers can proceed.</p> <p>This is an extremely important transfer and everything is being done to ensure its success.  There is a huge amount of engagement at Government level.  It is a positive that all of Government is looking at the maintenance.  The OPW's involvement is critical.  It has expertise in conservation of historic heritage sites.  We are working and engaging at every level to protect the staff as well.  There are many different factors involved.  I reassure the Deputy of the critical importance of these sites for the mid-west region.  Work is happening on that at Shannon Group level and all Departments are also engaging.</p></speech>

I am reassured by the commitment but it needs to be backed up with subvention.  Clare County Council wants to fulfil the wishes of Government and is fully engaged and committed to this.  When it carried out due diligence, it revealed structural damage like cottage roofs falling in and the castle roof in poor repair, as well as umpteen things across the grounds of the folk park that could probably be deemed unsafe for people to go into.  It is the same in Craggaunowen and Knappogue, where the beautiful walled gardens were not maintained and no longer exist.  I recognise and appreciate the Minister of State's commitment but we also need a commitment in terms of funding.  We are not sure what line Ministry that is coming from.</p>  <p>  I am concerned for the 140 full-time workers.  The supply chain is colossal.  Things have been run into the ground and due diligence has thrown up many issues.  We need to know where the funding is coming from and when it is coming in order that the May takeover and the summer season can both be successful.</p></speech>

For Limerick City and County Council, taking on these sites is a new departure.  The Minister of State and Department should support Limerick county council in every possible way as it hands over the iconic King John's Castle in the heart of Limerick city, which has vast potential.  That potential will not be realised unless significant and solid support is given by the Department in the context of the handover of the site.</p></speech>

Work and engagement is happening in relation to that site.  The OPW work is important in the context of ascertaining the costs involved.  We want to ensure that these sites are maintained and preserved.  Funding issues are part of the conversations happening at the moment to ensure a smooth transfer.</p>  <p>  I assure Deputies that my Department is liaising with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media because that feeds into heritage sites in the context of possible funding mechanisms.  Deputies can be assured of our commitment in relation to that.</p></speech>

Will the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage outline the actions he will take to reverse this clear trend since August of last year?</p></reply>

I flagged in advance that we expected an increase in homelessness over a number of months before we see it reducing again.  What we have seen is of serious concern to me, the Government and all Deputies.  We are acting to address it.  While significant work has been done, more needs to be done.  We are committed to doing that work.</p>  <p>  I have established the national homelessness action committee and asked it to prioritise the issue of homelessness prevention and look at all avenues to address this.  I have brought in a number of measures to enhance security of tenure for renters, including most recently in respect of tenancies of unlimited duration through the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2021.</p>  <p>  The exiting of landlords from the private rental sector is a complex issue, as the Deputy and others acknowledge.  Data from the Residential Tenancies Board in quarter 2 of 2019 showed the most common reason for issuing notices to quit is that the landlord intends to sell the property.  We need to retain small landlords to provide much-needed accommodation and the Government will support the continued participation of small-scale landlords in the rental market.  We are open to looking at further changes to ensure that can happen.</p>  <p>  The most effective way to increase exits from homelessness in the medium to long term is to increase supply, particularly of social housing, and to accelerate supply of housing over the next decade.  Significant progress is already being made under Housing for All to accelerate supply.  Recent commencement figures on the social and private sides are encouraging.  All additional measures we can take to address the rise in homelessness are being actively pursued.</p></speech>

First, we are seeing a significant exit of landlords from the market.  The Minister is right about that.  They are going and will not stay.  They are availing of high market prices to cease being landlords.  I have heard nothing from Government on what we do to prevent the families, particularly families on the housing assistance payment, HAP, and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS,  who are in those properties and who are at risk of homelessness.</p>  <p>  Second, we have seen a collapse in exits from emergency accommodation, particularly in Dublin.  The exits last month were 35, down from several hundred per month 18 to 24 months ago.  My question does not concern what will happen in two or three years' time, if the Minister's plan works at all.  What specific interventions will he make now to try to stop the flow of families into emergency accommodation and speed up exits next month, the month after and the month after that?</p></speech>

We are affected by the lack of new supply coming in over the past two years.  We could not build the number of homes we needed.  Much of that was down to Covid.  We will see a significant increase in social housing supply this year.  We will hit our target of 9,000 new builds.  That does not take into account acquisitions, the remainder of the leasing piece that will come in or vacant units coming back into use.  Increased supply this year will help.  We have had an issue in respect of HAP, which has been used as a mechanism to help people exit homelessness.  It is needed as an emergency response but finding HAP properties for our place finder teams is more difficult.</p>  <p>  A combined response on all these matters is needed.  The national homeless action committee, which is made up of NGOs and all Departments, not just mine because we need justice, health and all those included, is focused on prevention and exiting.  We are working through that.  Any additional measures we can take, we will take.</p></speech>

First, he could lift the effective prohibition on local authorities purchasing properties where HAP or RAS tenants are <i>in situ</i>and have been given notices to quit.  The problem, as the Minister knows, from the circular is that the councils are asked to prioritise vacant one- and four-bed properties and properties with disability adaptations in order to try to get people trapped in emergency accommodation out.  There is a limit of 200 acquisitions in the capital programme for this year.  We need the Minister to say to local authorities now that as an emergency measure, where a HAP or RAS tenant has a notice to quit and is at risk of homelessness, local authorities can purchase those in addition to the 200 vacant units the Minister is seeking to acquire.  He could also revisit the Focus Ireland amendment to ensure that landlords who availed of tax relief to purchase buy-to-rent properties are not able to issue vacant possession notices to quit and he could work with us to fast-track matters, either by means of Government legislation or our legislation that passed Second Stage in December, namely, Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (Extension of Notice Periods) Bill 2021, which was developed in conjunction with the Simon Communities.  The Minister can do these things now and I urge him to do them or these figures will continue to get worse.</p></speech>

We want to increase stock.  I heard Deputies rightly criticising the Government last year for buying homes out from under first-time buyers.  We have to have a balance.  The figure of 200 set across the board is there but properties can be purchased <i>in extremis</i>.  I am looking at further measures, particularly around Housing First, to allow additional properties to be purchased to come into that sector.  I may look at other options.</p> <p>I will provide that flexibility.  I had housing summits with all directors of services for housing from all 31 local authorities last week and the week before last.  The major focus was on delivery and on homelessness.  Therefore, we are looking at other measures.  If we can bring in changes, like allowing some flexibility on purchasing with tenants <i>in situ</i>, in extreme situations, I am open to that.  A moral hazard can occur in such situations as well though, and I do not want local authorities just buying instead of building.  The message going out from this Government is that we must increase our public housing stock substantially and that is the focus of Housing for All.</p></speech>

We have been told now that we will have to wait until next year for the implementation of those plans.  Land value sharing was a key recommendation of the Kenny report and we resurrected those principles in a Labour Party Bill from last year.  It is, effectively, as the Minister of State knows, a mechanism to allow the State to realise the benefit of an increase in land value when land is rezoned.  The aim is to ensure that landowners do not enjoy a windfall from flipping sites.  I ask for an update on these plans.</p></reply>

The 2020 programme for Government committed to reviewing how community gain could be captured through the development process.  The Housing for All policy includes a commitment to develop land value sharing measures to ensure that additional land value, which results from the zoning or designation, and the granting of planning permission, will be shared in a fairer way with the State and that communities will also benefit from improved infrastructure provision.  A general scheme of a Bill for land value sharing and urban development zones was approved by the Government in December 2021, with detailed drafting to follow an economic appraisal and stakeholder engagement, ahead of enactment in quarter 4 of 2022.</p>  <p>  Provisions for a residential zoned land tax were included in the Finance Act 2021 to impose a financial tax where land that is zoned and serviced is not brought forward for housing development.  Land value sharing and the residential zoned land tax are key elements in a new approach of active land management.  The lead-in time for their implementation is necessitated by virtue of preparatory work, economic appraisal and legislative enactment, in the case of land value sharing.  All of this is essential in ensuring that a fair, reasonable and evidence-based approach is taken and it would not be appropriate to introduce a windfall tax in the interim.</p></speech>

Nothing speaks to the issue of the financialisation of housing more than the practice of land being bought, flipped, literally overnight sometimes, and nothing being developed.  Genuinely radical measures, such as those called for by my colleague, Senator Rebecca Moynihan, must be introduced to address the issue of windfalls arising from the rezoning of lands.</p><p>I read yesterday in the commercial property section of <i>The Irish Times</i>about a parcel of land in Laytown in my constituency.  It is not zoned for housing and would ordinarily sell for about &euro;15,000 an acre, but it has been put on the market now for approximately &euro;72,500 per acre.  That has been done in the hope, from the estate agent's perspective, that the land may be rezoned in 2027.  This speaks to the issue of the financialisation of housing as being a major issue.  The Minister of State understands this and we need measures to be brought in urgently to address these problems.</p></speech>

The land value sharing tax will be a significant measure in driving the share to the State up to 50%, potentially, when it is included with the affordability mechanisms introduced by the Minister.  The Deputy will also be aware of the residential zoned land tax, whereby mapping procedures are now underway throughout the State.  It was also included in the Finance Act 2021.  Additionally, the Law Reform Commission is also preparing a report regarding reforming the compulsory purchase order, CPO, mechanism to allow the State to take a stronger hand in bringing derelict and vacant properties back into use.  Therefore, taking the trajectory in recent decades, several reports have found that the State must be active in this area and the Housing for All policy has provided the vision to breathe life into that objective.</p></speech>

I expect that DCC is working on some proposals in that context as well.</p>  <p>  Overall, 911 homes have been approved for funding, with the first 65 occupied by tenants last year.  The current pipeline for delivery this year is nearly 700 units, and that will increase.  The most recent vacancies have just been advertised by the Tuath AHB, in Parklands in Citywest.  It is a development of 44 two-bedroom apartments, with rents ranging from &euro;1,200 to &euro;1,300 per month, which is way below the market rent sought in the private sector.  CREL properties have so far been delivered as turnkeys due to my determination to respond in the short term.  That is why I set this criterion for near-term delivery.  As I mentioned to Deputy &Oacute; Broin earlier, however, I am providing more flexibility in the open call to allow all local authorities, including DCC, to make new proposals and this will result in a better pipeline.</p>  <p>  Specifically concerning DCC, we had one proposal for the second call, but that did not meet the criterion for delivery this year.  We do have other examples in Dublin, to which I will return in my supplementary response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.144" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300013#L01200"><p>I have no objection to the use of turnkeys in the short term while a pipeline of development of affordable cost rental homes by AHBs and councils comes on stream.  The difficulty, though, and as the Minister is aware, is that the price of purchasing turnkey properties in Dublin city centre means it is not possible to deliver the affordable element of the cost-rental proposition.  Therefore, I have a specific question.  Is the Minister actively considering any amendments to the cost rental equity loan scheme that would provide additional flexibility in the short term for the turnkey acquisitions?</p>  <p>  There is a real problem, in the sense that the Minister is right in respect of there being 716 cost rental units in the pipeline for this year, according to his officials, but half of those are units that were funded and agreed in principle in the context of last year's funds.  In fact, therefore, this year's additional cost-rental provision is about the same as what was meant to be delivered last year.  None of those units, however, is in the city centre.  What is the Minister considering to try to ensure that some cost-rental homes could be delivered at genuinely affordable prices in the city this year and next year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.145" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300013#L01300"><p>It is a new scheme and a new call and it is important that we recognise that this year we are going to have hundreds of families in State-backed affordable cost-rental units with rents up to 40% and 50% below the market rate.  It is something that is most welcome.  Equally, just to be clear, when I referred to turnkey units, many of these properties being developed are ground-up turnkeys.  There are not being purchased from someone else just to provide cost rental homes.  These turnkeys are being developed from the ground-up.  There are issues with costs and particularly so in our cities, in Cork and in Dublin.  Lancaster Quay will see the provision of our first tenanted cost-rental apartments in the heart of Cork city in quarter 3 of this year.  They will be tenanted this year.</p>  <p>  I am, however, looking at some changes in this regard and particularly concerning the management fees.  The Government is providing generous grants through the affordable housing fund to the local authorities.  Therefore, I envisage that DCC will be coming forward with further proposals in the open call to come for cost rental provision.  We already have the projects at St. Teresa's Gardens, which is an important one, and at Emmet Road, and we will have more questions on this later.  We also have our own projects which I want to see developed by our local authorities and we are going to do that.</p></speech>

Whether those turnkeys are developed from the ground up or are at any other stage of development, the cost is more than &euro;400,000.  As the Minister is aware, there has been some media commentary regarding correspondence between him and Bartra, in the context of the company seeking to charge somewhere - we do not know the full figures - between &euro;400,000 and &euro;440,000.  Under the current scheme, that would mean cost rents of &euro;1,600, &euro;1,700 and &euro;1,800 a month.</p> <p>Neither the Minister nor anybody on the Opposition benches would support that.<br/><br/>My specific question, which I will ask again, is whether the Minister is looking at any further changes to the way in which the cost-rental equity loan is currently operating to ensure the delivery of affordable cost-rental in Dublin city this year and next year.  So far I have not heard the Minister indicate that he is.</p></speech>

I want people in homes this year.  As a result, I set the parameters around the call to the local authorities and AHBs to bring proposals to us whereby the units could be delivered this year.  That is what I wanted.  Dublin City Council had a proposal that would not be delivered this year, and I stated that it would not be included in the call.  I look at all these proposals with my colleagues.  There will be further proposals and we will deliver cost-rental at scale.  We want to deliver 18,000 units during the lifetime of Housing for All.  It is a new tenure of housing and, of course, the scheme will evolve.  We have the first 65 tenants in place.</p>  <p>  I should be clear that when I mentioned management fees, I was referring to the managing costs and how we look at managing cost-rental versus what is done in continental Europe.  There could be significant savings, and I am looking at some changes in that space.  I will report back to the House or the committee when I do that.  I will keep Deputies advised of it because there could be significant savings in the management of these units that will help to drive down rental costs further.</p></speech>

The Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2021 provide that where a landlord terminates a tenancy because he or she needs vacant possession to substantially refurbish or renovate the rented property, that property must be offered back to the former tenant upon completion of such works, where the tenant provides contact details for such an offer to be made.  Such a notice of termination must contain or be accompanied by a written certificate of a registered professional under the Building Control Act 2007, such as an architect or surveyor, stating that the proposed substantial refurbishment or renovation works would pose a health and safety risk necessitating vacation by the tenants and that such a risk would be likely to exist for at least three weeks.</p>  <p>  The tenancy protections in place are not impacted by the funding stream used by landlords for such works.  A tenant may refer a dispute with regard to the validity of a notice of termination of a tenancy to the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, for resolution.  Since 2019, the Residential Tenancies Acts provide enhanced powers for the RTB to investigate and sanction landlords who engage in improper conduct, including non-compliance with the tenancy termination provisions.  A sanction imposed can comprise a written caution, a financial penalty of up to &euro;15,000 and RTB investigation costs up to &euro;15,000.  The operation of the rental market and the Residential Tenancies Acts 2004 to 2021 are kept under constant review and any necessary legislation will be introduced.</p></speech>

This is a problem and this public money could be used to incentivise evictions and rent increases.  Under current rules, there is an onus on the tenant to make a complaint.  Tenants often are not offered their tenancies back in such circumstances.  Will a change in legislation be introduced to protect tenants and stop this from happening, ensuring that a tenancy will continue unless a tenant chooses otherwise?  A tenancy should continue rather than end and be offered back to the tenant.  Will that change be introduced so that rents cannot be increased if a landlord is in receipt of public funds for renovations?  It is reasonable that if public money is being used, it should not lead to an eviction or rent increase.  What will the Government do to address this?</p></speech>

These might include a tenancy not existing in respect of the dwelling in the two years immediately prior to the current tenancy beginning.  Such works might include a permanent alteration to the internal layout, adapting it for a person with a disability, a permanent increase in the number of rooms or improvement of the building energy rating of up to seven points.</p>  <p>  There are robust mechanisms already in place and the vast majority of retrofitting works taking place in rental properties, such as installing attic insulation, pumping insulation into walls, etc., will be non-invasive.  In some cases, deep retrofits would not ordinarily require an occupier to leave the property.  The protections are there.  If there are specific examples that the Deputy has in his area, please provide them to us because we would like to look into them further.</p></speech>

The Minister acknowledged before that there have been evictions arising from renovations and it has been a problem.  He acknowledged it here in the Chamber while I was present.  I am seeking to find out what the Government is looking to do to protect tenants in such a position.  Saying the current provisions will not be changed is not good enough.  We should not have any position where public money could be used to incentivise evictions.</p>  <p>  The chairman of the RTB, Mr. Tom Dunne, told the Committee of Public Accounts recently that landlords may use the retrofitting scheme to evict tenants and he is an independent voice on this so his opinion should be highly valued.  What will we do now before public money is used to incentivise rent increases or evictions?  What changes will be introduced to address the matter before that happens?</p></speech>

As we referenced, there are penalties in place if that is not the case.  I referenced separately the point relating to substantial works around rent pressure zone areas.  It is important to provide specific examples because it would be really useful from our perspective to see what they are and where those cases exist.  The legislation is quite clear in protecting tenants in this regard.  These works will be really important.  They are not just for meeting our national retrofitting targets and they will also provide cheaper home energy bills for tenants.  Everybody will benefit.</p></speech>

These are in Cherrywood, in my constituency at Adamstown and in the Minister's constituency at Portmarnock.  Many of these developments include not only apartments but also duplexes and family homes.  Does the Minister accept that the measures undertaken by him and his colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to stop these institutional investors swooping in and snapping up family homes have failed?</p></reply>

I cannot comment on any individual case; I am not privy to private negotiations and nor should I be.  I cannot confirm either whether the reports are 100% accurate.  What I will and can say very clearly regards the measures that this Government has introduced.</p>  <p>  We have committed to introducing a form of owner-occupier guarantee - this has been done - to enable local authorities to specify the proportion of houses and duplexes in a development for owner-occupiers.  This is intended to build on the existing higher rate stamp duty measures that the Minister for Finance introduced and restrictions on planning permissions introduced in May 2021 that I brought forward by way of section 28 guidelines on the regulation of commercial institutional investment in housing.  The current guidelines ensure new own-door homes and duplex units in housing developments can no longer be purchased in bulk by institutional investors in a manner that causes displacement of individual purchasers or social and affordable housing, including cost rental properties.  It is really important that people understand this.</p>  <p>  Analysis and data - rather than reports - suggest that with the changes made by me, the Minister for Finance and this Government in 2021 on the purchase of single family residential units, the proportion of such purchases fell from 11% of residential deals in 2020 to 2% in 2021.  This is coupled with the fact that more than 30% of the 46,000 homes purchased in 2021 were bought by first-time buyers.</p>  <p>I am satisfied the Government's actions to increase home ownership for individuals and families are starting to work.</p></speech>

In the same article in the<i>Irish Independent</i>, the fund said that &quot;it is irrelevant what we pay for them.&quot;  It does not matter that the Government has increased stamp duty by a modest 8%.  These funds will make such a return at current market rents over the 50-year period that this fund, for example, says it will remain at these locations, that a modest increase in stamp duty will be quickly recouped by higher rents.  Likewise, the planning changes the Minister has introduced in the main will only apply to future planning applications.  The 80,000 live planning applications that are in the system are open game for these institutional investors.  In terms of what is coming down the pipeline this year, next year and the year after, the Minister's measures have failed.  Again I ask him what he can say to reassure those people looking to buy such properties in our constituencies that the measures he undertook last year are having any impact in squeezing out these funds.</p></speech>

He would say they have failed because that he what he would say.  There is no question.  He would never come in and say that any Government measure is working because his go-to point is to say that it is failing, everything is wrong and nothing is working.  That is what he does.  He is the one who said in his interview with <i>The Currency</i>and elsewhere that he meets these private investors and developers regularly.  He has met Johnny Ronan and all these guys and he talks to them about investment and the need for investment.  The Deputy is the one who said that in an interview, so that is fine.  Maybe he knows what is happening in Portmarnock or Adamstown.  I am telling him we need to increase the overall supply and we have brought in measures.  The analysis of those measures has shown a reduction from 11% to 2%.  They are the facts.  That is what is happening.  There will be investors in the market but the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has brought in a very significant increase in stamp duty and I have brought in planning changes that affect all future planning permissions.  That is working and it is starting to work.</p></speech>

The Minister is right that some of those were approved housing bodies and local authorities but the vast bulk of them were institutional investors.  They are now not just buying up new homes through forward purchase agreements but snapping up significant numbers of second-hand homes from which housing assistance payment, HAP, and rental accommodation scheme, RAS, tenants have been evicted and then leasing them back to the local authorities at extortionate prices.</p>  <p>  Of course I meet everybody.  How else can I do my job properly?  I cannot do it by not meeting people.  The difference between the meetings the Minister has and the ones I have is that I meet these organisations to make very clear that policy under Sinn F&eacute;in Government would change and funds would not be able to buy either houses or apartments.  The measures we would take would push them out of the market.  Instead, we would use public funding to buy those same developments for social housing and large volumes of affordable homes.  </p>  <p>  Again, what reassurance can the Minister give to his constituents in Portmarnock that there will not be more of these developments bulk-bought by institutional investors because they can pay over the odds and price young families out of the market?</p></speech>

We have changed planning and brought in an owner-occupier guarantee.  For the first time in planning we have recognised owner-occupier as a tenure of housing.  We are doing that and have done it.  I am at a loss to understand what Sinn F&eacute;in housing policy is.  I listened to the Deputy a few weeks ago talking about bringing in 10,000 vacant units in one year, which would supplement his magic 20,000 homes he wants to deliver.  We are grounded in reality.  The reality is that what we want to do and what we are doing is increasing housing supply on the public side, where we are going to build more social homes this year than ever before.  We are bringing in affordable housing.  We have cost-rental units in place.  Yes, we are increasing private supply too.  We need to get up to 33,000 a year.  How we do that is by delivering and by building, not by objecting and blocking.</p></speech>

Wastewater treatment is a key part of the development of any new housing infrastructure but it is a particular issue in my own constituency, where many housing developments are being held up in multiple settings.  Particular areas of concern are Midleton, Youghal, Killeagh, Mitchelstown and Carrigtohill.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State could furnish us with some details of his work in that area.</p></reply>

The National Development Plan 2021-2030 commits to almost &euro;6 billion in capital investment by Irish Water in the period 2021-2025, of which more than &euro;4.5 billion will be Voted Exchequer funding for domestic water services.  As part of budget 2022, funding of more than &euro;1.57 billion was secured to support water services.  This includes &euro;1.459 billion for domestic water services provision by Irish Water.</p>  <p>  Irish Water is supporting the delivery of Housing for All through investment in growth.  Irish Water has developed an approach to identifying future water services demand and prioritising it for delivery where there is clear evidence that strategic investment is required to support housing delivery.  On timely delivery of connections, Irish Water will ensure that its network delivery stream supports timely delivery of housing connections.  On self-lay accreditation, an accreditation scheme will be advanced to facilitate developers in providing water services infrastructure, provided agreed standards are met.  This is an accredited contractor scheme that will be led by Irish Water.  I think it has fantastic potential.  Irish Water and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities will review the water connection policy to address any issues with first mover disadvantage.  Water and wastewater capacity registers were published on the Irish Water website on 24 November 2021.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will understand that the progress of individual wastewater plants and infrastructure is a matter for Irish Water.  As we modernise our infrastructure it is inevitable that capacity constraints will arise in certain locations.  However, the funding provided by this Government is ensuring that water and wastewater infrastructure investment is supporting the Government's overall housing targets.  I am assured by Irish Water that it is also committed to this agenda and I know that they work closely with local authorities to ensure that local development plan-led priorities are aligned as much as possible.</p></speech>

Unfortunately in my own constituency there are many pertinent questions that still need to be answered.  That has been the case for a very long time, preceding the Minister of State's entry into government and the entry into the Department of the Ministers present.  I want to do a lot of work on this issue because we need it to build new homes in my constituency.  Many younger families cannot find suitable, affordable rental accommodation but aspire to buying their own home.  It is just not an option because there is such demand on the supply chain in the east Cork area, which has been exacerbated by poor wastewater infrastructure.  I appeal directly to my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, who is doing excellent work in his Department, to come down to Cork East.  It is something we have discussed.  I want to bring him to Mitchelstown, Midleton, Cobh and Carrigtohill to see for himself the inadequacies in investment.  They are unmistakably a serious issue when it comes to housing development in east Cork.</p></speech>

It is important.  The investment the Government has put in has been significant.  We are working with Irish Water to achieve those connections.  The CRU has published the information note on self-lay, which is an important step forward in getting competent and certified third-party contractors to work with Irish Water to pursue these projects.  At the end of quarter 4, Irish Water responded to 83% of connection inquiries and 76% of the connection applications within 16 weeks.  My colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, will give a commitment to visit and try to progress these schemes as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

I hope the visit can be arranged as soon as possible.  The reason I wanted to bring this to the floor of the D&aacute;il is that it has been enormously frustrating trying to get this issue moved on.  I have many concerns with the management structure of Irish Water as an entity, how we as parliamentarians and public representatives can have any input into the work it does and how accountable it is to this House and the political system when it comes to inadequacies and failings on its part.  I welcome that the Minister and Department will give a particular focus to this area.  Above all else, it is about getting houses built, which we need to do.  In the east Cork area, which is one of the State's key strategic growth areas when it comes to housing, we need this investment urgently because we can deliver the housing units that are so desperately needed for younger families.</p></speech>

These towns are certainly under pressure from the growth of Cork itself.</p> <p>It is critically important that our ambitions for housing delivery, as set out in Housing for All, are met and that these communities can grow and these important towns can develop and prosper.  The investment we are making as a Government is a significant proportion of that effort and, critically, we are working with Irish Water to ensure there is the capacity to deliver.  That is the really important part of it.  It is a critical issue in Cork and elsewhere in the country that we get our wastewater infrastructure up to a modern, efficient standard in order that housing can be developed and communities can grow and prosper.</p></speech>

I am looking for clarification in this regard.  The Minister of State said the office's responsibility is to issue advice to the Minister and so on.  The report that was issued by the OPR in the case of Cork County Council included a number of recommendations, with the chief executive alleging there are clear breaches of the relevant legislative provisions of the national and regional policy framework and-or the policy of Government as set out in ministerial guidelines under section 28 of the Act.  He went on to say there is a requirement to implement the recommendations he is advising.  In the context of the OPR's obligation to issue advice to and inform the Minister, the chief executive, in his communication, has identified clear breaches and highlighted the requirement to implement those recommendations.  Will the Minister of State clarify whether those recommendations are advisory or if there is a requirement to implement them?</p></speech>

Subject to a recommendation by the Mahon tribunal, the office was established to ensure Government policy is, in fact, running through to local authorities.  It is not long - 2008, in fact - since we had enough zoned land in the country to accommodate an extra 10 million people.  No one could predict where the infrastructure would land and the State does not have a bottomless pit of money.  We have evolved now to a situation where we have a plan-led system to deliver for all our citizens.  Further to the draft plan by Cork County Council, which I know from the correspondence that the regulator is impressed with, a number of recommendations were put and delivered on in terms of flood risk, development guidelines and mapping.  We are happy with the substantive response to them.</p></speech>

There is a continuation of the problem in Cork in regard to the joint retail strategy between city and county.  Clearly, the two local authorities are at odds in this regard.  Cork County Council was successful in its case for continuing with the proposals for its retail strategy for east Cork.  That is subject to another appeal to a higher court but the fact is that a court has dealt with the retail strategy issue.  The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, met recently with the chief executives and advised them of the overall strategy.  I ask the Minister of State to write to the local authorities and chief executives specifically outlining the situation in regard to serviceable lands and their inclusion or exclusion from the plans.</p>  <p>  Will he indicate whether there will be a review of the NPF in line with the census in a couple of years' time?  That would be a worthwhile exercise.</p></speech>

I must be very careful in that regard.  The legislation underpinning our role as Ministers and the role of the 31 local authorities is very clear and we are following what is prescribed.  It is up to the courts to interpret that subsequently.</p><p>In regard to our shared vision of the relevant plans that flow through Government, something that is very clear from all our engagement with local authorities is that if land is serviced and has infrastructure, the last thing we want to see is it being dezoned.  Such lands have the potential to deliver housing and are located in the right places.  Section 10 of the draft development plan guidelines clearly sets out for local authorities the trajectory in which we want to see them going.  I expect them to follow suit in that regard.</p><p>There will be a planned review of the NPF to take into account the updated information from the census.  There is huge capacity in the framework.  One of the things that often amazes me is that all but nine local authorities need to increase their housing supply targets by more than 100%.  Following the Covid crisis, there is plenty of opportunity and scope in the NPF to hive out that capacity.</p></speech>

Affordable homes for purchase will be made available through a combination of the first home scheme, the local authority affordable purchase scheme and LDA delivery.  A housing delivery action plan prepared by each local authority will underpin delivery to 2026.  The four Dublin authorities submitted the first iteration of their plans in December and our officials have now met with each authority.  I expect the final delivery action plans to be published in quarter 2, containing projected delivery to 2026.</p><p>The LDA, through Project Tosaigh and its strategic sites programme on State land, will also deliver affordable housing units in Dublin.  The agency is currently conducting due diligence on proposals received under Project Tosaigh.  Regulations setting out the eligibility criteria for affordable purchase will be issued in the coming weeks.  Homes have already been made available, with South Dublin County Council recently advertising affordable homes in Kilcarbery and Fingal County Council set to make available 39 affordable homes in Lusk.</p><p>The first home scheme will be available from the second half of this year.  This demand-led scheme targets 1,750 supports for 2022.  We expect that a significant proportion of these will be located in the Dublin area, proportionate to the newly constructed homes market.</p></speech>

That seems very low given the demand for affordable-purchase housing.</p> <p> What is the projected number of houses for the 56 ha of land the LDA holds in Dublin?  Some 29 ha of the 56 ha is on the north side.  What sort of affordable-purchase housing can be expected from the LDA?</p></speech>

On the LDA, a significant number of homes has been targeted.  There is currently staging under way in Dundrum, Hacketstown, Skerries, Castlelands, Balbriggan and Cherry Orchard.  Negotiations regarding other sites in Dublin are due to be completed shortly.  I understand phase 1 has been completed.  A majority of the houses will be affordable.  It is key to deliver those for our citizens.</p>  <p>  With regard to the scale in some areas, almost 600 homes have full planning permission in Shanganagh.  That will represent a significant injection for the local community.  The LDA currently has &euro;3.5 billion available to it to deliver on its aspirations.</p></speech>

I am not clear on why that is the case.  The impression I get is that there is a far higher appetite for affordable purchase than suggested by the allocation.</p>  <p>  How is it proposed to accelerate the throughput from local authorities on the affordable-purchase side?  We have seen many obstacles placed in the way of local authorities.  Some of these have been internal.  How can we accelerate the mixed development we need to see?</p></speech>

I understand the Government envisages a pipeline for affordable purchase this year of just 400 units.</p>  <p>  My specific question for the Minister of State is on the regulations because, as we know, the regulations on affordable purchase through the affordable housing fund are very delayed.  Cork City Council is currently telling its elected members that the Boherboy homes that are ready to go cannot be sold because the regulations have not been concluded.  They were meant to be concluded at the end of last year.  Could we have a publication date for the regulations because the sale of the very small but much-needed number of affordable-purchase homes in the pipeline is being delayed?</p></speech>

We understand from Dublin City Council that it is to go to planning at the latter end of this year and that construction may not commence until 2025, which means that the project, given its size, might not be tenanted until 2027 or 2028.  That means it will be ten years from announcement to tenanting.  What is the Department doing to speed up the process after planning, particularly regarding changes to the approval, tendering and procurement processes?</p></speech>

The planning application for St. Michael's estate was agreed by the council in 2016.  The project was announced in 2018.  At a housing committee presentation in 2020, we were told the planning application would be submitted in the first quarter of 2021.  Now it has been postponed again.  There is considerable frustration in the community over this.  The community hoped contractors would be on site by 2023 but it now looks like it will be 2025.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.212" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="11:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300017#P01800"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 119, 120, 168 and 173 together.</p>  <p>  I thank both Deputies for their questions.  I have an interest in seeing progress on this project also.  Emmet Road is a really important project for development, particularly in the cost-rental sector in Ireland.  The plan for a local authority-led financing structure is a key element in the long-term delivery of cost rental and one that could be replicated elsewhere.  A dedicated Dublin City Council project manager and project team are working on the development and have confirmed it is a key deliverable in the council's housing programme.</p>  <p>  I understand the concerns of the local residents who have been constructively engaging regarding the development at the site.  I had a very good virtual meeting with them last December.  I am aware of how rigorous the design process for such a large and important site can be and appreciate the work done to date, but, just like Deputies Joan Collins and &Oacute; Broin, the Government wants to see this move on.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to confirm that the council has advised that the concept design was presented to councillors on Tuesday, the day before yesterday, and to the Inchicore Regeneration Consultative Forum yesterday.  Although the designs are not finalised, current plans propose a mixed-tenure development of 548 homes, which represents an increase.  I welcome that because we need to maximise the use of the site by providing really good homes.  Of the 548 homes, 75% will be cost rental and 25% will be social.</p>  <p>  This design will be presented to the public during phase 3 of the consultation process.  The Deputies and all other representatives from the area will pay close attention to it.  The process will run from 8 March to 31 March.  The concept design includes the site layout, approximate unit numbers and mix, the number of stories and standard layout.  Therefore, it is a very important process.  I want this to be the last one and to move on from here.</p>  <p>  The council has advised that, following this consultation, some further refinements, including improved design efficiencies and the consideration of consultation feedback, will be required before the full design stage can be reached.  This will enable the design team to complete the environmental impact assessment report, update the cost plan and consequently submit a full planning application.  I expect that by the end of 2022.  That is what I want to happen, and I am strongly encouraging Dublin City Council to meet the target of proceeding to planning by the end of 2022.</p>  <p>  Delivery after planning is outside our remit but there are other things we can do.  In this regard, I must refer in particular to Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question.  As with the principle of cost rental, rents will depend on the overall cost of delivery.  This development already benefits from utilising State land in a prime city-centre location, but funding support from my Department will also help to reduce the ultimate rents paid by tenants.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Joan Collins will know, in December 2020 my Department and I approved &euro;18.75 million, in principle, for the cost-rental homes under the scheme.  That was under the serviced sites fund.  Under Housing for All, we have brought in the affordable housing fund, which provides a lot more flexibility, particularly in areas where there are acute issues with affordability.  While we allowed a subvention of up to &euro;50,000 per unit under the serviced sites fund, the Department now allows one of up to &euro;100,000.  In one respect, the delay talked about may benefit the overall delivery at the site and have a benefit in respect of the cost.</p>  <p>  I have revised the criteria and provided more flexibility and funding support to appropriate affordable housing projects, including high-density developments.  The council has indicated it is going to resubmit the application to me.  It is working on a new funding application based on the increased numbers for the site.  I welcome that and hope all Deputies will welcome the increase in the number of homes.  There are to be 548 homes for families in the area, 75% of which will be cost rental and 25% of which will be social.</p> <p>I cannot imagine anyone will have a difficulty with that.  We want to get the design right and I am going to provide increased funding for that.  I will come back in if there are additional questions.</p></speech>

We worked together in opposition to convince the then Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English, to progress this project.  I am hoping that we can continue to do the same in the future.  There are two specific problems.  The question I have relates to the stage after planning is approved.  The Minister's Department recently published the report into a review of the four-stage process, particularly for mixed tenure projects.  The difficulty is that there is nothing in that document that suggests, for example, that there will be any acceleration of that approval process for this project.  I urge the Minister, particularly in respect of recommendation 8 of that report on the single decision-maker, to use the St. Michael's estate site as a pilot to test run a single point of decision-making to speed it up.  We cannot have a two- to four-year approval, tendering and procurement process, which is currently how long it is taking in large projects such as this elsewhere in the country.  I also urge the Minister to look the finances again.  I ask him not just to look at the higher level of the affordable housing fund, but to stretch out the term of the loans to bring the rents below &euro;1,000 a month.</p></speech>

I cannot see why the same process could not be followed in relation to St. Michael's.  I am disappointed that we are still talking about the third quarter of 2022 for the planning application to go in.  We do not know how long it will take for the planning application to be approved or not.  I urge the Minister to push the council as much as possible to get its act together.  Not only is a full-time Dublin City Council project manager working on it, but one of the top and longest-established design teams in the country is working on it.  It should be delivered much more quickly.  I am delighted to hear about the &euro;100,000 but costs are going up all the time.  If we are talking about 2024 or 2025 before this project is under construction, more money may be needed for it.  It is also important that the term of the loan is extended from 25 years to 40 years.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Broin made a point about making St. Michael's a pilot project for cost rental.  That commitment was made when the former Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Eoghan Murphy, visited the estate back in 2018.  The local consultation is an issue of concern.  Yesterday, we received a WhatsApp message about events being held Richmond Barracks during the month of March.  Three different webinars are to take place.  That is good news.  However, like the other Deputies, I think the project needs to be accelerated, with a proper timeline set out for delivery.  After all, the community has been waiting for decades for this to happen.  They have been fighting in a comprehensive, clear and united way for it, and have worked with the parties in the area on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.217" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300018#Q00500"><p>I genuinely thank the Deputies for their contributions on this issue.  We worked on it together in opposition and I assure them that we will continue to do so.  I want us all to work together on it.  St Michael's is a really important site.  The Deputies and the rest of us all know that.  We want the project to be delivered.  I do not want there to be any delays.  I wish to make two points on the planning side.  In response to Deputy Joan Collins, obviously, the council cannot submit the project for planning permission until the design work is done.  There is revised design work but I am encouraging the council to prioritise that and to get the application in this year.  I am checking on this project regularly.</p>  <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question on what happens post planning is a very good one.  We have already changed the four-stage process to effectively a three-stage process.  I am also establishing a mixed tenure unit within my Department.  This scheme will go to one unit.  Given that it is going to be 75% social housing, 25% cost-rental housing, it will be given absolute priority in the stages.  There will not be inordinate delays with this project in the process.  We need to focus getting it into planning.  The public consultation is important.  It is happening from 8 March.  I am quite happy to keep Deputies regularly updated from my side of things.  I know they will keep the pressure on Dublin City Council through their own representatives in the area.  </p></speech>

Can he give us an indication of how long he thinks the process will take when the planning application goes to the unit?  Is he talking about January, February or March 2023, or will it take longer?  The Minister said that a new unit has been set up.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.220" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300018#Q00800"><p>I say this with all sincerity, but there is some scepticism as to whether the four-stage process will actually become a three-stage process.  We will have to wait and see.  The Department's report is very clear.  It does not confirm the establishment of a single decision-maker.  It states that it would be preferable, but there will be greater co-ordination.  I invite the Minister to meet the Deputies involved with this issue and the relevant officials from the Department.  Some of us may have helpful suggestions that could be piloted in this project to accelerate it.</p>  <p>  On the issue of rents, Dublin City Council is currently saying that the rents could be &euro;1,300 plus, even with the affordable housing fund.  The term of the loan is too short.  I know that the European Investment Bank, EIB, only provides that term, but with the Enniskerry Road project, the Minister was able to restructure the loan through the Housing Finance Agency, HFA.  While it is possible to get the rents at this location down to &euro;700, &euro;800 and &euro;900 for one-, two- and three-bedroom properties, that requires both &euro;100,000 from the serviced sites fund or affordable housing fund and much longer maturities.  I urge the Minister to work with us to ensure that the financing is restructured so that the project is delivered quickly and is genuinely affordable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.221" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1486" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300018#Q00900"><p>Deputy &Oacute; Broin's last point is a very important one.  We met and worked with many young people in the community who were trained, had been to college or worked in IT, and who were on reasonably decent wages, but could not afford to live in the area and have their own families there.  The point about keeping the rents at a level where the community is sustainable, so those who were educated and reared around St. Michael's estate can continue to live there at an affordable rate, is an important one.  The other issue that I am very concerned about is the timing.  Can we put definite timelines on the project?  I know that the Minister is sketching things roughly but we need very definite timelines on when all this is going to happen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.222" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1561" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="11:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300018#Q01000"><p>To clarify, for Deputy Joan Collins, the mixed tenure unit is the unit within my Department that will deal with the post-planning stage and the funding and approval of it.  The planning stage is separate.  That unit is being established.  In response to the point made by Deputy &Oacute; Broin, I can state that it will be a three-stage process.  I believe that St. Michael's is such a significant site that I am absolutely open to looking at how we can ensure that the project is expedited.  I will certainly arrange a meeting with interested Deputies, who are either from the constituency or are spokespersons, such as Deputy &Oacute; Broin and others.  Perhaps Deputy Cian O'Callaghan will be interested.  I will arrange that meeting at the appropriate time.  I think we need to let the public consultation happen.  I suggest that we do that.  The Deputy's question is very timely, because the consultation is happening between 8 and 31 March.  I have no interest in delaying this project.  I want to see it done.  In response to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith, I believe in cost rental.  That is why one of the first things I did when I took office was to work on the affordable housing legislation with colleagues to get it enacted to ensure that we have a national cost-rental scheme that is underpinned by legislation.  We have cost-rental tenants in place in homes in counties Dublin and Kildare.  There will be hundreds more this year.  We are not just talking about a concept.</p>  <p>  To deal with cost, the term of the loan and so on, the HFA may have a role to play.  While the EIB has its role, we will explore that with some of the bigger sites without complicating or delaying project further.  There have been no delays to the project from our side.  Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith mentioned that I am sketching out the timeframe.  I do not know what will happen in planning.  I do not know whether there will be objections to the project, whether there will be judicial reviews or whether people will go to court over it.  I do not know any of that, because it is independent of me.  I hope there will not be delays.  The way the council is approaching this project on a plan-led basis is correct.  People can see the detail of what we will be proposing to build there.  It is important to take the feedback from residents now.  I want the council to submit the planning application by the end of this year.  I can assure Deputy Joan Collins that I am encouraging Dublin City Council in a very positive way to make sure that that timeline is hit. I cannot say who is going to object to or make observations on the application.  I hope that it receives a fair wind through the planning process and is granted permission.  We already know that in advance of that, the council will be submitting proposals to me and the Department in relation to funding.  We can work that through in advance of planning permission being granted.  I am expecting a new application from Dublin City Council under the affordable housing fund.  I have not received it yet.  The council is working through it on the basis of knowing how many units are going to be on the site.  I expect and hope that the Deputies here will support the increased number of homes there.  We will deliver 578 homes there, 75% of which will be cost rental and 25% of which will be social housing.</p> <p>I hope they will encourage residents and work with them to make sure it gets through planning quickly.</p></speech>

The report not only focuses on the operational emissions of those buildings and the energy standards, but also on the embodied carbon.  Is the Minister aware of the report?  Has he read it?  Does the Government or the Department have a formal response to its recommendations?</p></reply>

My Department plans to retrofit approximately 40% of local authority dwellings not currently performing to a building energy rating, BER, of B2 to B2 cost-optimal level by 2030.</p>  <p>  There is also the national planning framework objective to promote compact urban growth and town centres first.</p>  <p>  In addition to these major actions that will make significant impacts on carbon emissions, our Department has a number of supporting actions that are critical to the reductions.  Specific actions under all of these policy areas are outlined in the climate action plan and my Department is working hard to implement all of them.</p>  <p>  I read the summary of the IGBC report.  The ambition in respect of green procurement for public buildings and other buildings is critical.  I remember having that battle at local authority level with regard to ground granulated blast-furnace slag, GGBS, cement, which is a low-carbon cement.  It should be the default that we consider low-carbon products throughout the building cycle.  The Deputy and I have spoken previously about older buildings, particularly early 20th century buildings that have a significant amount of embodied carbon.  The national policy on architecture, which will be launched soon, will give us an indication on how we propose to support those buildings into the future.</p></speech>

Second, the research shows that, even with the retrofitting programme the Government is planning, as the operational emissions of the built environment reduces, the embodied carbon required to build new buildings, homes, roads and infrastructure will actually significantly increase.  What the Department needs to do, therefore, is to absorb the research in the report and work with members of the Opposition because we share the same objective here.  There is no disagreement that as we work through the legally binding targets that will affect the Department of the Minister of State, for example, we should have a clear roadmap to ensure everything is done not only to make homes more energy efficient, but to dramatically reduce the embodied carbon in new buildings, particularly homes.  I would like to hear more information from the Minister of State as to how exactly that bit of the carbon emissions reduction targets will be met.</p></speech>

It is really important.  I wholeheartedly support what the Deputy is bringing forward.  There is also the sustainable products initiative, which will widen the scope of the eco-design directive to all products.  It will introduce requirements relating to durability, reusability, hazardous chemicals, energy and resource efficiency, carbon and environmental footprints, and recyclable content while also ensuring the performance and safety of products.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, is working on the circular economy and green procurement.  It would be worthwhile to try to tease out in more detail all of those combined elements at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  I again refer to older buildings, such as 20th century buildings, many of which, unfortunately, are being demolished in Dublin.  Some of them are only 40 or 50 years old and have significant amounts of embodied carbon that should be repurposed and reused.</p></speech>

The Minister of State may wish to use his influence with the committee Chairman to assist in that regard.  It would also be useful to hear at Oireachtas committee level what are the preparations of the Department for those legally binding targets that will have a profound impact on the work of the Department, as well as on the private sector.  There will also be a role for legislation here.  For example, a shift from high-carbon cement to low-carbon cement, which actually cost the same price to produce in the marketplace currently, will not happen unless it is required under law through a phase-out of higher-carbon cement.  Likewise, the shift from cement, steel and glass to more sustainable materials will require significant State intervention.  I understand Enterprise Ireland and the construction sector working group of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are working on these issues but, given the urgency and the fact the EPA believes we will not meet the targets for this year, the sooner we have that exchange at the Oireachtas committee and start to engage in the kind of solutions that we all agree are required, the better for everyone.</p></speech>

I refer to some of the elements that are already under way in our Department, such as the targets we have set in respect of vacant and derelict properties in the coming years and targets for local authorities, as well as the work my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, is doing around Town Centre First, which are bringing a significant amount of building stock back into use.  All of those initiatives will help in this regard.</p>  <p>  As regards low-carbon cement, it being the default is an open goal we could all achieve.  It is an issue on which I campaigned or worked ten or 15 years ago.  The use of GGBS cement is critical.  Cement is a very high-carbon product.  This is something we could do and achieve easily.</p>  <p>  Similarly, in the area of forestry policy we have Project Woodland that is being led by the Minister of State, Senator Hackett.  When timber is used in buildings, that locks up that carbon in them for good.  The appropriate place will be the Oireachtas joint committee.  I will speak to the Chairman, Deputy Matthews, to try to get a session specifically on this important issue.  I thank the Deputy for raising it.</p></speech>

It was designated as Ireland's first marine natural reserve in 1981.  However, it is unclear what resources are in place to protect and enhance this invaluable marine sea lough.  I ask the Minister of State to outline the status of the site's conservation management plan and the systems to implement that plan.</p></reply>

We do not usually get them on oral questions.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  Lough Hyne is a designated special area of conservation which is selected for three habitats listed in the habitats directive, as the Deputy is aware.  These are large shallow inlets and bays, reefs and submerged or partially submerged sea caves.  Detailed conservation objectives have been published for these habitats on the website of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS.  The targets outlined help to guide appropriate management of the site.</p>  <p>  My Department has been funding research to determine the cause of the decline of sponge communities in Lough Hyne since 2018.  The precise cause has not yet been determined, though there are already encouraging signs of recovery of these sponges.  Further research has been funded until 2027 and management measures will be put in place as and when the research indicates the appropriate steps to be taken.</p>  <p>  As part of our Department's continuing commitment to protecting our heritage amenities, I continue to explore ways to optimise the sustainable potential of heritage sites in my care in a way that is compatible with conservation objectives.  In 2017, a strategic partnership was established between my Department and F&aring;ilte Ireland.  A major output from this partnership was a master plan providing a high-level blueprint for the NPWS to invest in and better manage our parks and reserves network for conservation, biodiversity and visitor experiences alike.</p></speech>

As he will be aware, Lough Hyne is a natural site of incredible beauty with distinct ecological significance.  As a marine sea lough, it sustains rich biodiversity.  It needs to be protected.  Although the Department and the NPWS have a conservation plan in place for Lough Hyne nature reserve, there is no visible evidence of on-the-ground measures or personnel to achieve that.</p> <p>We were wondering if that is something that might happen.  We note the reference that it is to be developed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Lough Hyne is similar to many of our spectacular natural areas which has to balance conservation and tourism.  It has become especially popular with the increase in domestic tourism over the past two years.  This has, of course, lead to a substantial increase in traffic with many cars parked on small country roads leading to the site.  Residents are concerned about access for emergency services into their properties.  What resources or guidance has the Minister of State in place to support county councils in this case in managing these types of matters?</p></speech>

I will address the last question first.</p>  <p>  Specifically on this World Wildlife Day 2022, we will be announcing some measures in the partnerships that we have with F&aacute;ilte Ireland in the management of our nature reserves.  Throughout the Covid-19 period we have seen a very significant demand from the public to be out in nature.  That has created great pressures on our nature reserves and on our national parks.  It is something that we are conscious of and in which we have invested significantly, particularly in managing trails and walkways but the car parking issue is something that is altogether different.  In some of our national parks we are trying to use sustainable mobility, be it shuttle buses etc., but it is a persistent problem.</p>  <p>  On the question of the on-site activities having a potentially negative impact on Lough Hyne, we are working through our National Parks and Wildlife Service to have more staff on the ground.  The Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Brien, approved the appointment of additional conservation rangers, many of whom are now in place now and that will significantly help in the day-to-day management of very important sites like this.</p></speech>

There are 632 proposed natural heritage areas, including Garrylucas Bog near Kinsale about which I have spoken to the Minister of State before.  The status of the proposed natural heritage area does not provide the same level of protection as an actual natural heritage area.  I have been continually asking about Garrylucas and other sites and in the Minister of State's parliamentary question replies he refers to a review which always seems to be forthcoming.  Can the Minister of State provide an update on the status of the reviewing process of natural heritage areas?  I will push the Minister of State on the particular case of Garrylucas Bog, which badly needs the enhanced status.</p></speech>

At the outset, I completely agree with the Deputy and I condemn in the strongest possible terms this abhorrent behaviour.  While we may not be sure of the scale of it, it does occur from time to time and any time it occurs it needs to be condemned and we need to do everything we can to ensure it is stamped out.</p>  <p>  In respect of an update on this issue, we are totally committed to preventing and addressing sexual abuse and gender-based violence in all of its forms.  I have sought advice from the Attorney General on this specific matter and following receipt of that advice I wrote to my colleague, the Minister for Justice, on 12 January.  We are currently considering the matter between the two Departments as to the best legislative vehicle to deal with it.  It is a complex area and we need to look at all of the potential elements involved.  The current approach to dealing with this issue needs to be carefully considered and my Department and the Department of Justice are working together to bring options forward to myself and to the Minister, Deputy McEntee, about how we will legislate for it.  It includes assessing whether changes may be required to residential tenancies legislation or indeed through the introduction of criminal charges, but it may be both.  It may be both a justice Bill and amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act.</p>  <p>  People attempting to prey on the vulnerability of others seeking accommodation is completely and utterly unacceptable behaviour.  All possible avenues towards addressing this will be considered.  I will keep the Deputy and House informed specifically.  Myself and the Minister, Deputy McEntee, have asked our officials to prioritise this work.  I know that if we require legislation, which we will, I will be seeking the co-operation of the House to ensure that any additional changes or amendments to current legislation or new legislation will be brought forward and will be passed in an expeditious manner.  That is the current position with this matter.</p></speech>

The stories are completely heart-breaking.  I would not be able to read them to the House and I do not think that I need to, as everyone understands the seriousness of the issue.  I am glad that it is being worked on and there is no question but that there needs to be changes in the legislation in the residential tenancies sector.  If a complaint is made against a landlord and they are found to be doing this they should be struck off as a landlord and should not be able to register with the Residential Tenancies Board, end of story.  There should also be criminal charges brought in.  Both measures are needed.  I urge that a decisions is taken on that as quickly as possible.  I am aware that this needs to be done in the correct way but it also needs to be done urgently.  Perhaps the Minister might give the House an update on a timeline.</p></speech>

In the first instance, we are not aware of the scale of this issue but wherever it happens it needs to be condemned.  It is atrocious and reprehensible behaviour.  I want to assure the Deputy in the plainest language that I can that anything that we need to do from a legislative perspective on this issue, we will do.  Timeframe-wise, I hope to have something back from our officials by the end of this month with regard to what we are going to do.  That is not necessarily the legislation itself but it will advise us whether it is better to do it through legislation from the Department of Justice, residential tenancies legislation, or indeed both.  I have a fair idea myself of what type of sanctions we can bring to bear on this type of landlord.  Criminal charges will be another element.  It is important that we get it right, that it is robust and the Deputy is correct.  I commit through our housing spokespeople that we will give an update by the end of March as to where we are at and I will keep the House and the Deputy himself directly informed on this matter.</p></speech>

I ask that the Minister confirm as soon as possible that he will bring in legislation by way of criminal charges and that landlords would be struck off.  Both measures are needed.  I do not think that there will be any discussion or debate around that.  The quicker the Minister does that the better.</p>  <p>  We do not know the scale of this.  One of the reasons why this is the case is that there is no specific legislation that specifies this as a criminal offence.  An Garda, for example, does not specifically record this on the Pulse system.  That is why we need this to be tackled as quickly as possible.  I thank the Minister for the answers and for the commitments he has given the keep us all updated on this issue.</p></speech>

Like Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan, I firmly believe that legislation is going to be required to outlaw this abhorrent behaviour.  I pay tribute to Ann Murphy of the <i>Irish Examiner</i>whose sterling investigative journalism has exposed this issue and brought it to light for all of us.  I fully assure the Minister that if he and his colleague, the Minister for Justice, bring forward the required legislation, they will have complete co-operation for the speedy passage of it from our party as well as others in opposition.  This is urgent and necessary and we will work with the Minister to ensure that this type of behaviour is outlawed and punished very heavily if and when it occurs.</p></speech>

It is a priority matter for us.  We looked at trying to assess how we would quantify the scale of it but, from dealing with advocacy groups, particularly in the area of sexual and gender-based violence, we were advised that including that in a survey would not be the appropriate thing to do.  Suffice it to say that we know it happens and we want to ensure that where it occurs it is stamped out and that criminal charges are brought to bear.  I will report back to the House and I will write specifically to the Deputies who have raised the question and through the parties&rsquo; housing spokespeople to give them an update before the end of March.</p></speech>

I extend my best regards to him and his family.</p>  <p>  I welcome Ms Linda Ervine, who will be in the Seanad today to speak on Seachtain na Gaeilge.  We extend her a f&aacute;ilte m&oacute;r from this House and acknowledge the great work she has done on the Irish language in east Belfast.  Her work is well known throughout the Thirty-two Counties and beyond.</p>  <p>  I wish to record once again our absolute condemnation of the actions relating to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and to extend our solidarity to the Ukrainian people at this time.  I welcome the unanimous agreement of the D&aacute;il last night to pass a motion condemning Russia's actions and supporting the territorial integrity of Ukraine.  I welcome the significant and severe economic sanctions that have been put in place by the international community as part of the efforts to get Vladimir Putin to realise the futility of his actions.  Those sanctions are working.  One can see the impact they have had already on the Russian monetary system.  I hope this unprecedented diplomatic response will open up the possibility of a resolution to the crisis.  As with any conflict, I believe the way out of this is through politics and dialogue.</p>  <p>  Undoubtedly, the severe sanctions are going to impact on ordinary citizens across Europe and further afield.  The Taoiseach has acknowledged that this will be case.  The price of oil and gas on international markets is on the rise once again.  This follows the massive price rises that are already putting major pressure on households throughout the State and contributing to the massive increase in the cost of living.  That is particularly the case in the west of Ireland in counties such as Mayo, where half of the homes use heating oil as their main home heating fuel and, because of the lack of public transport, people have no choice but to use and ever-increasing proportion of their low incomes to pay for petrol and diesel.  One hospital appointment in Galway or Dublin can take up a full week's income for those already struggling to survive.</p>  <p>  What is the EU plan to help alleviate the impact the economic sanctions will have on ordinary people?  Have discussions in this regard already begun?  What is on the table to help households here and across Europe to negate the worst impacts of energy price increases on workers and families?  People want something to be done immediately.  They need to feel it in their pockets and in their household incomes.  They are already struggling.  I acknowledge the measures that have been introduced, but some of them, even in higher education, will not kick in until September.  The months between now and September are going to be long and arduous for many households throughout the State.</p></speech>

It is always a pleasure to have the opportunity to engage with another member of Sinn F&eacute;in, particularly one from Erris, a part of the country I know well.  It is always a pleasure to have a disagreement or an agreement on occasion with people from that part of the world.</p>  <p>  The situation in Ukraine is, as people will appreciate, unprecedented.  We came through the shock of a pandemic that nobody could have predicted and thought we were going to enter a period of relative stability and normality.  Vladimir Putin, by his actions, has upended all of that.  We are now facing another shock in terms of prices, particularly for energy.  There will be a meeting of senior Ministers this afternoon and there will be an opportunity to study a number of things, including how we can assist Ukraine, in both our political response and our humanitarian response, and Ukrainians who may come here.  There will also be a discussion on what else we need to do or are able to do to help households, businesses and farmers that are going to affected by the sanctions and the economic disruption caused by the crisis in Ukraine.</p>  <p>  Ireland does not have a lot of direct trade with Ukraine, Belarus or Russia, but there will be indirect effects.  Even though the coal in Moneypoint now comes from Colombia, not Russia, and our gas supplies do not come from Russia, the impact of Russian gas being slowed or potentially even being shut off will cause price rises and is already doing so.  We have seen the prices of oil, petrol, diesel and fertiliser rise significantly in the past couple of weeks.</p>  <p>  In terms of what we need to do, first, we must implement the actions the Government has already announced.  That includes the &euro;200 being deducted from people's electricity bills.  People will see that in the next couple of weeks and certainly by the end of April.  The additional money for the most vulnerable households, the extra &euro;125 in the fuel allowance, is being paid at present.  We will have to give consideration to any further actions we may need to take.  However, it must be borne in mind that the underlying cost of energy, coal, petrol, diesel, aviation fuel and home heating oil is not something we control.  That is rising more and more and the portion of that which is taxation is falling as a consequence - not the raw amount but the portion that is taxation.  We will see what we can do in that context.  There will be some co-ordination at European level as well.  Discussions in that regard are under way.</p></speech>

There has to be an immediate response, or one that is as immediate as possible.  There are growing conversations in many EU countries about ending imports of Russian oil and gas into the future.  Has the Government considered what the State can do to secure its energy supply if this comes to pass?  We were told all the time that the Corrib gas project would secure our energy supply.  That has not been the case, although a proportion is supplied from the Corrib field.  We must do something more and something immediate.  People are really suffering.  I welcome the fact that the T&aacute;naiste will be visiting Castlebar tomorrow.  He will be in a town where people are suffering as a result of rent increases and many other cost-of-living increases they are experiencing at present.  They are looking to the Government for solutions, answers and help at this extremely difficult time.</p></speech>

We used Russian coal to run the power station at Moneypoint.  That has now been switched over to Colombian coal.  We are not dependent on Russia or Ukraine for gas.  Approximately one quarter or one third of our gas comes from the Corrib - it is our own gas -  and the rest comes from the UK.  The latter is gas from the North Sea and liquified natural gas, LNG, brought through terminals in the UK.  We are confident at this stage that we will not face any disruption in the supply of gas, petrol, diesel or electricity.  The long-term security issue will be resolved by renewable generation and hydrogen, but that is many years away.</p>  <p>  We are more concerned about energy prices.  Everybody driving by a forecourt this morning will have seen the price of petrol and diesel, with the psychological &euro;2 per litre being seen in some stations.  We have already seen increases in our gas and electricity bills.  Unfortunately, because of the events in Ukraine, we are likely to see further rises over the next couple of weeks.  The Government will respond.  It has responded already in terms of the fuel allowance and the household discount for electricity bills.  We are looking at other ways of responding, but we would be dishonest if we did not say to people and businesses that the reasons for the increases in price are largely outside of our control.  The proportion of energy prices covered by taxation is falling, but we need to look at excise and see if we might do something there.</p></speech>

It relates to women's health.  First, I acknowledge Vicky Phelan and wish her the very best from the floor of the D&aacute;il, and I hope all Members share that with me.  I also acknowledge and thank Ms Lorraine Walsh, Mr. Stephen Teap and Mr. John Wall for their support and the work we have done over the past number of years.  They certainly have had the biggest impact on me politically, more so than probably anyone else.  It is four years since Vicky won her High Court case in April 2018, when she bravely refused to sign a non-disclosure agreement.</p> <p>We all know what happened with regard to CervicalCheck as a result of that.  Huge progress has been made, and I acknowledge that.</p> <p> We need to move on, however, in respect of a range of issues, such as a review of legislation on abortion to look at policy and the real problems with a lack of access for women and safe access zones.  We also need to look at the national maternity hospital to make sure it is publicly owned and controlled.  Nothing else is acceptable.  When the CervicalCheck tribunal was established in 2020, I stated that it was not acceptable.  I predicted that more than 200 cases would go to the High Court.  There are now more than 300 cases before it.  To date, it has received only 19 claims.  For me the concerns were never addressed.  It is never too late to do the right thing.  This is shameful and wrong, and it should be looked at.  Most of all, we have the final progress report of Dr. Scally on the recommendations of his scoping inquiry into the CervicalCheck screening programme.  There are four outstanding actions.  Will the T&aacute;naiste outline the status of these?</p> <p> The issue that really concerns me is the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019.  To be fair, the T&aacute;naiste has history on this.  It was published in December 2019 and debated in the D&aacute;il but has been stuck on Committee Stage ever since.  We need to get the Bill over the line because it would provide for mandatory open disclosure and ensure patients' voices are heard.  This is about ensuring that people have an absolute right to know information about their healthcare and that hospitals, screening providers and doctors do not keep information from them.  This has been going on for way too long.  I ask, on behalf of Vicky and everyone else, that we address this as soon as possible and finally get it over the line.  It is a dear request for me.  I want to see this legislation get over the line.  It is a big component of the recommendations in the Scally report.</p> <p> Will the T&aacute;naiste ensure the national maternity hospital is publicly owned and controlled?  Will he provide a status report on the remaining recommendations in the Scally report?  Most of all, and most importantly, will he indicate to the House that the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019 will be enacted and brought into operation very quickly?</p></speech>

Some people will say that the Labour Party has struggled to overcome its period in government.  Quite frankly, however, it has a lot to be proud of when it comes to the period it spent in government between 2011 to 2016, which was a very difficult time.  In the early part of that Government's term, as the Deputy will recall, I was the senior Minister in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and he was Minister of State.  While we did not always agree, we did get on and we managed to get a lot of things done.  I particularly remember integrated ticketing, as we called it at the time but which we now call the Leap card.  It had gone on for years and years.  It was one of the projects the Deputy was given responsibility for.  He really banged heads together.  Sometimes being a bit brash is not necessarily a bad thing in politics.  It required weekly meetings and it got done within months.  Another area for which the Deputy had responsibility was taxis.  It was very difficult and an area that people ran away from.  He managed to make some very important reforms that were good for passengers and consumers and for people who drive taxis.  I want to recognise all of that on this occasion.  They may seem like small things but they had not been fixed for a very long time.  They were finally fixed because, by and large, Deputy Kelly is the kind of politician who gets things done.</p>  <p>  In recent years, Deputy Kelly has taken a particular interest in issues regarding women's health, whether the eight amendment or CervicalCheck.  He has been a very strong advocate for Vicky Phelan and a number of women who were affected by that debacle.  I have seen their social media messages today, and they are very complimentary of the Deputy.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Scally report, significant progress has been made in implementing its recommendations.  The most recent progress report was published by the Department of Health just yesterday.  It shows that as of the end of 2021 four out of the 170 actions remain to be completed.  The Minister for Health has asked Dr. Scally to conduct a final progress review of the implementation plan.  That is now under way.</p>  <p>  Something that is of real importance, and the Deputy mentioned it, is the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019.  The latter includes a mandatory requirement for open disclosure where a serious incident occurs.  The Bill will also bring private hospitals within the remit of the Health Act.  It also contains provisions to protect clinical audit.  It was introduced in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 12 December 2019.  It has passed Second Stage and needs to move to Committee Stage.  I am informed it could go to Committee Stage as early as next week, but it will certainly do so in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

I appreciate them.  The Bill is extremely important.  I am delighted to hear that it will move to Committee Stage next week.  The right of citizens to have access to their information and for nothing to be hidden from them is critical.  It is the be all and end all of everything that came out of the Scally report.  I absolutely feel that in honour of Vicky Phelan and many other people, including Ruth Morrissey, who was treated very badly by the State, we need to ensure that the Bill completes its passage this term.  Will the T&aacute;naiste make a commitment, if at all possible and working with all of us on this side of the House, to the effect that the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019 will be brought into law before the summer?</p></speech>

This will allow us to make progress.  There are some changes the Minister wants to make.  Some of them follow on from the examination Dr. Scally did on this matter and the civil liability amendment situation and some input from members of the 221+ support group.  The plan is for it to move to Committee Stage next week.  It is not entirely within the control of the Government as to how long the process in that regard takes.  However, the Bill has been delayed a bit too long.  We should all endeavour to get the legislation enacted no later than the end of this year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.263" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1522" speakername="Mick Barry" time="12:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300022#U00500"><p>Ukraine's agony continues.  Some 1 million refugees have left the country and thousands of civilians have been killed.  Cities, homes and healthcare facilities have been bombed to smithereens.  Seven days after the Russian tanks began to roll across the border, Ukraine remains unconquered and the capital is holding out.  Amid the horror of Putin's war two key positives shine out, namely, the resistance of the Ukrainian people and the Russian anti-war movement.  Again and again, history has shown that people power holds they key to ending war and dictatorship.  The Ceausescus were overthrown not by NATO but by a mass uprising of the Romanian people.  The other Stalinist dictatorships were not ended by tanks but by the masses.  The beginning of the end of the First World War were the strikes and protests on the streets of Russia that overthrew the tsar and put capitalism into the dock.</p>  <p>  Next week, the Irish State will send representatives to Versailles for an informal European Council hosted by President Macron.  The question of building a European military machine is expected to dominate proceedings.  President Macron's views are well known on this.  He has said that we will not protect Europeans if we do not decide to have a true European army.  I suspect he will make this point more forcefully next week.  This week, the T&aacute;naiste told RT&Eacute; news he thinks Ireland needs to go deeper on the question of European military co-operation.  He said it needs to increase military spending and expressed a wish to open up a debate on such issues.</p>  <p>  The socialist left looks forward to engaging with the T&aacute;naiste and others in this debate.  In that context, I will make a number of points in the time remaining to me.  My first overarching point is that the history of Europe shows that dividing the continent into armed camps does not lead to peace.  If the T&aacute;naiste goes to Versailles next week, he should take a trip out to the green fields of France and he will see what I mean.  Ireland won her independence by way of a struggle against a great imperial power in the 20th century.  Ireland should not now align with the ruling classes of France, Germany and elsewhere that are seeking to make Europe a military power in the 21st century.</p> <p>We oppose any major increase in Ireland's military spending.  One of the three options in the recent Defence Forces report was to increase the military spend from &euro;1 billion a year to &euro;3 billion.  We think that the vast bulk of that money should be spent on housing, health, childcare and the like and that the majority of people in this country would agree with us on that.  We are in favour of spending to end the scourge of low pay in our Defence Forces.</p> <p> In conclusion, I again call on all people, especially young people, to come out onto the streets to say "No" to war and to show solidarity with and to encourage the two key forces that hold the key to progress here, the brave anti-war protestors on the streets of Russia and, crucially, the heroic ordinary people of Ukraine in their resistance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.265" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300023#V00200"><p>I echo and agree with the Deputy's remarks on at least two accounts.  The first is that we all admire the bravery of the Ukrainian Government and the Ukrainian people who are resisting this attack and this attempt to take over and occupy their country.  Even with regard to a city like Kharkiv, which is near the Russian border, in which most people are Russian speakers and in which there is, in many ways, a dual identity, Putin has made a big mistake.  If anything, he has cemented and strengthened the Ukrainian national identity.  Russian speakers and people who perhaps feel a little Russian and a little Ukrainian are feeling more Ukrainian today and are pushing back in that city against the Russian invasion.  To me, that says that Ukrainians and Russians alike want to live in a democracy and are willing to fight for that, as they are now doing.  I have immense admiration for those Russians who are attending protests in St. Petersburg, Moscow and other cities to say that this is not being done in their name.  It is a very brave person who protests on Nevsky Prospect in St. Petersburg or in Red Square.  We need to recognise that and offer them our solidarity and support.</p>  <p>  One thing we need to do, which we have not done enough of in recent years, is to start defending our system a bit more.  Our system is the system of the west.  It is based on liberal democracy, the rule of law, the social market economy and multilateralism in international affairs.  It is not a perfect system.  I know that.  We have lots of problems but nobody is trying to climb over walls or climbing into dinghies to get into China, Russia, North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela, Iran or any of those places.  We need to recognise the fact that we are very fortunate to live in a social market economy and a liberal democracy.  We are fortunate to be part of organisations like the European Union and the United Nations.  If anything, this attack on Ukraine should be a wake-up call for all of us to be willing to defend our system because a system worth building is worth defending.  If the European Union was worth building, it is worth defending.  If our independence was worth securing, it is also worth defending.</p>  <p>  Like Deputy Barry, I do not agree that we should increase defence spending up to &euro;3 billion.  That would be too much.  There are other priorities and other demands.  However, I do think we need to increase defence spending.  We need to pay our military personnel more.  We need better equipment.  We need to be able to guard our own seas.  We need radar over our own airspace.  The assumption that we have made for 70 years is that nobody would attack us because we are a country that is neutral militarily.  Ukraine was neutral militarily.  It was not part of any military alliance.  It was attacked because it was politically part of the west, or at least wanted to be.  We make the assumption that, even if we are attacked, the British and the Americans will come and save us anyway.  I am not sure that is the kind of assumption a sovereign country like ours should make.</p></speech>

We look forward to participating fully in that debate.  Part of the debate has to be the question of the links European governments had with the Putin regime and its supporters, including the blind eye that was turned in this country.  Some &euro;118 billion worth of wealth was sloshing through the IFSC from Russian entities between 2005 and 2017, dirty money laundered by oligarchs etc.  Why was a blind eye turned to this within a 15-minute walk of Leinster House?  Did the Government and Government Ministers really think this was just pensioner savings or communion money that was being kept in the IFSC?  We would argue that, in reality, the only consistent opponent of Putin and Russian gangster oligarch capitalism down through the years has been the socialist left.  This is part of the debate.  We look forward to engaging in that debate.  We are confident that our ideas will echo strongly among ordinary Irish people.</p></speech>

Far too many people in the west, including many western European governments, turned a blind eye to President Putin for too long.  We saw that after the Crimea crisis.  That sent a message to him that the west was weak and I would say he started making his plans around about then to take the rest of Ukraine.  However, it is not just about governments or government ministers.  Anyone who has expressed pro-Putin sentiments or who has been an apologist for Putin now has questions to answer.  There are a lot of them in Ireland, some in this House, and many outside of this House.  They should now be held to account for statements they made in the past that were soft on the Russian regime and for being apologists for Putin in any way.  Quite a number of them would consider themselves to be part of the socialist left.  I do not mean Deputy Barry but I can identify quite a number of people who would consider themselves to be socialists or part of the socialist left who have appeared on Russia Today, who have been apologists for Putin and who have consistently made statements that are supportive of that regime and that man.  They need to be held to account now.</p></speech>

I applaud what we have done in waiving visa restrictions and allowing Ukrainian people to come here and avail of employment at the earliest opportunity.</p>  <p>  I will raise an issue with the T&aacute;naiste that was raised with me.  It relates to some vacant property, particularly holiday homes, that people might be of a mind to make available to Ukrainian people.  These people are wondering whether it is possible for them to do so without creating tenancy rights or whether they can provide short-term letting arrangements.  Perhaps the Government could take a look at this because we have a difficulty with regard to how we are going to accommodate a significant number of Ukrainian refugees.</p>  <p>  I will go on to talk about the agriculture and food industry, which has been an indigenous champion of this economy for many years.  It is the bulwark of our rural economy and the basis for regional regeneration.  My concerns are building.  I am reflecting concerns I am hearing that our climate policy appears to be muddled with regard to where we are going with agriculture.  It would not be a far stretch to say that potentially there is some confrontation building in public opinion between the agricultural sector and the needs of climate change.</p>  <p>  As we are well aware, we have a commodities crisis at the moment, not least because Russia and Ukraine produce almost 30% of the world's wheat, 8% of the world's grain and 60% of the world's sunflower oil between them.  All of this is going to feed into primary producer prices and the retail supply prices.  As the T&aacute;naiste will know, there is also a significant issue in respect of fertiliser.  Russia is by far the largest manufacturer of fertiliser and sanctions are now driving up a price that has already increased by 300% year to date.  This will have an effect on productivity and on output and will certainly have an effect on pricing.  The farming sector has been raising this issue for some time but little regard has been had to the matter.  The increase in prices for energy in May the Government has committed to and the increase in the price of fossil fuels will also put extreme pressure on this sector.</p>  <p>  I also highlight to the T&aacute;naiste some issues affecting forestry.  Despite the work the Government has done, we are still way behind in processing licences.  Almost 70% of licences that are being processed are licences for Coillte, in other words for the State sector, at the expense of looking after rural and regional farmers who have invested in forestry.</p>  <p>  I will also bring up the issue of wind energy.  We know that a regulatory maritime institution will not be developed for another two years but there is a process ongoing at the moment with regard to an onshore wind development near the south-east coast within 5 km of the shore.  No regard seems to have been given to developing this project offshore, as has been done in Scotland.  As a Deputy from the south east, I will be in the vanguard in objecting to onshore wind in the UNESCO site in County Waterford.  We need to look at developing that facility offshore.</p></speech>

We organised the meeting as a regular round table to talk about Brexit, Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, reform and climate action.  As the Deputy can imagine and as is often the case, events overtake us.  Most of the meeting was about Ukraine, the cost of inputs, the rising cost of fuel and fertiliser, and how that will impact food prices and farm incomes.  This afternoon at 2 o'clock the Taoiseach will chair a special meeting of Ministers.  We will consider three matters.  First is the humanitarian response and how we can assist Ukrainians who come to Ireland and more importantly how can we assist the millions of Ukrainians who will not come to Ireland but will be refugees in other parts of Europe.  Second is sanctions and the political response.  Can we do more to show our support for Ukraine and our opposition to the Russian Federation and Belarus?  Third is how we can deal with the economic impact of another economic shock so soon after the last one.  How will we help households with rising bills?  How can we help farmers with rising input costs?  How can we help the business sector?  There is only so much that Government can do, but there are things that Government can do.  We will consider them this afternoon and I look forward to reporting back to the D&aacute;il next week if I have the opportunity.</p>  <p>  I got a really good note from Minister of State, Senator Hackett, on forestry licensing the other day.  After years of frustration - I know the frustration is by no means gone - there is real evidence of an uptick in the number of licences being granted.  I might send that note on to the Deputy because for the first time in a very long time I had some hope that we were making some sort of progress.</p></speech>

However, as I said, the majority of licences are for felling and are being prioritised for Coillte and not for these small farmers who are trying to get afforestation licences, get roads built and get their own felling done.</p>  <p>  I return to climate policy for a minute.  While I am certainly not against it, we need a reappraisal of it.  As far as I am aware, the Government has not revised the policy on increases to fossil fuel prices in May.  That would be a very retrograde step for inflation.  I believe the maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, will not be developed for two years or longer.  We have still not discussed where we are going with a wind port in this country.  We need to designate wind ports and Rosslare is the obvious one.  There are clear benefits to housing in Dublin by reducing some of the capacity in Dublin Port.  This needs to be seriously considered.</p>  <p>  I know the T&aacute;naiste is aware of issues with the N24 and I understand the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, will take a call in the morning on it.  We need the N24 and N25 roads upgraded to improve connectivity for the south east and to give us some regional competitiveness.  There has been no investment in those two roads in over 20 years.</p></speech>

It is very small, but still significant if everyone does it.  We would like to see farmers using a small part of their land for small plantations, ideally with native broadleaf trees.  She is introducing that and allowing them to avoid the existing licensing system for doing that.</p>  <p>  I believe MARA will be up and running much sooner than in two years' time.  Hopefully, it will be set up in interim form in its new headquarters in Wexford this year and will be operational for real next year.  I agree that we need to invest in Rosslare Europort when it comes to wind energy.  We will have many offshore wind installations off the east coast as well as off the west coast, but initially off the east coast.  We want to ensure that the turbines come from Irish ports and not from English or Welsh ports, not that I have anything against English or Welsh ports, but we would like to use our own ports.  Investment in Rosslare will be crucial in that regard.</p></speech>

I thank it for its work and acknowledge that it did so free of charge as a public service.  I welcome the scrapping of the nonsense of the sliding scale, but there are many issues of concern outside the terms of reference.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the T&aacute;naiste will know about the cost of foundations in many places.  We also need clarity on the criteria for accessing option 1.  As we have seen in Mayo, people are being asked for more and more information all the time.  The goalposts are moving and we need clarity.  Obviously, we also need the legislation to be published so people can get their lives back.</p></speech>

We have improved the scheme already.  I said I would seek independent input into it and would publish a report, and I have done that.  That report has now gone to the expert group chaired by the Paul Ford who is an eminent engineer with vast experience in this area.  He will report back to me and Government next month with recommendations about how we can implement some of the measures.  We will require the co-operation of the Opposition to ensure this legislation passes before the summer.  While we sought a submission from Sinn F&eacute;in on the scheme, we did not receive any information from that party.  We now want to move forward with an improved scheme, which we have done, so that people can get their homes and their lives back together.  That is what we are committed to doing.</p></speech>

This issue has been ongoing for a long time.  It is proposed that the nursing home would be closed for long-stay residents.  Everyone is totally against that.  This is a bedrock and essential in Roscrea.  Everything has changed since the Covid pandemic.  There is a significant requirement to invest in public infrastructure and nursing homes.  Given that a very good proposal has been sent by Age Friendly Roscrea and given that HIQA has signed off on it for another year, I ask the T&aacute;naiste to give the House some information on the future of this, hopefully with some positive news for the people of Roscrea that this nursing home will remain for long-stay residents along with proposals to refurbish and rebuild it.</p></speech>

The decision to dezone these lands went against the professional advice of the planners.  Every Fine Gael councillor voted for this dezoning and they were supported by a number of Fianna F&aacute;il councillors.  This will prevent 100 badly needed social homes from being built.  I do not need to remind the T&aacute;naiste that we have a housing crisis.  More than 9,000 people are living in emergency accommodation and are desperately in need of social housing.  As T&aacute;naiste and leader of Fine Gael, can he explain to the thousands of people who need housing why councillors from his party voted to dezone these lands?</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, councillors act in a quasi-judicial manner when making decisions on their plan.  I will certainly make inquiries.

He called it "an atlas of human suffering and a damning indictment of failed climate leadership.&rdquo;  He warned that "As current events make all too clear, our continued reliance on fossil fuels makes the global economy and energy security vulnerable to geopolitical shocks and crises."  His biggest warning was about any delay.  In his report he asked us to recognise that we have a small window of opportunity to act decisively and quickly to avoid rapid closing of the windows of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future.  How seriously is the Government taking that warning?  Can we have an urgent debate in the House on the latest IPCC report?</p></speech>

The report probably did not get the attention it deserved because of the other world events happening at the moment.  It says two things to us as a country.  It reminds us not only that we need to press ahead and implement our climate action plan but also, even if we do fully implement our plan, that we share an environment with a world of 10 billion people and that many countries will not do what we will do.  We also need to plan for adaption because, as the report indicates, a certain amount of climate change is now irreversible and further climate change is inevitable.  We therefore need to step up our plans in implementing our climate action plan while also preparing for adaption because so much is beyond our control as a small country.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that some progress has been made, but we are still a long way behind, even on the Government's own targets.  I have consistently raised the issue of vacant housing in many urban areas around the country.  Towns such as Dundalk and Drogheda have far too many vacant houses.  These vacant houses have the potential to make a real impact on the housing crisis if only the Government would put in place the necessary funding for local authorities such as Louth County Council to purchase these vacant homes and upgrade them in order that they can be added to the housing stock.  When will the Government bring in the necessary legislation to enable these vacant homes to be purchased and upgraded to a level at which they could be brought back into the housing stock?</p></speech>

The Government is absolutely committed to tackling the scourge that is vacancy and bringing empty properties back into use.  The planning regulations were changed just a couple of weeks ago to broaden further the exemption on commercial properties being converted to residential use.  The Minister of State, Deputy Burke, and I will bring forward, in the context of Town Centre First and the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns and villages fund.  That will provide people with a grant to bring empty homes back into use as long as they live in and own them.  Furthermore, we are bringing forward a co-ordinated compulsory purchase order scheme managed by the Housing Agency on behalf of local authorities such as Louth County Council, which had previously been quite successful in that area - other local authorities, not so much.  We will co-ordinate compulsory purchase orders in respect of more than 2,500 properties.  There is a particular issue in Drogheda on which we are working with the local authority, but we will bring forward our Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe cities fund to have brownfield site development in our cities.</p></speech>

However, the hauliers are encountering difficulties.  I recently had a meeting with the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, to discuss this.  There is a need for the fuel rebate to be increased as in other European countries.  For example, in France it is 19 cent while in Belgium it is 23.5 cent.  In Ireland it is still 7.5 cent.  We need to ensure that something is done about this to ensure there is no disruption to the supply chain.  In addition, there needs to be incentives and direct supports for the hauliers to upgrade to Euro 6 engines.  Again, that requires financial incentives.  Our hauliers in Ireland are at a competitive disadvantage compared with their European counterparts.  We need urgent action on this issue from the Government or it will impact the economy.</p></speech>

The shock to our economy and to energy prices as a result of the invasion of Ukraine was not anticipated but it has happened and we have to deal with it.  The Government is very aware of the impact this will have on households in the form of higher energy bills for motorists, farmers, business people and the haulage sector.  We knew prices would rise over time, as they did, but I do not think anyone anticipated a further shock right after the pandemic in the way it has occurred.  We will have to give that consideration over the coming days.</p></speech>

This has been a really important part of the care for patients.  I wrote to the CEO of St. James's, who confirmed that in the past month the hospital has received confirmation of permanent funding resourcing for the post-acute Covid clinic programme and an OT has not been resourced.  The hospital awaits confirmation of permanent resourcing for the long Covid clinic, which is expected imminently.  The hospital is concerned that an OT is not included in the HSE's draft long Covid model of care, published in June 2021, although that may change in the final version.  Will the T&aacute;naiste ensure that OTs are a part of Covid clinics, particularly the one in St. James's Hospital?</p></speech>

I know the T&aacute;naiste is familiar with this designation, having visited Knock Airport on many occasions.  I note that the draft county development plan and the overall development of the planning scheme is expected to deliver the following gross floor space: more than 95,000 sq. m. for commercial business and enterprise activities; more than 44,000 sq. m. for aviation, economic development and services; and 11,000 sq. m. for hotel accommodation and conference facilities.  I note that the connectivity provided by the presence of the airport significantly broadens north-east Mayo's transport network capability, providing many economic and social benefits.  In essence, it acts as an economic driver for the region and has a major impact on the social and economic infrastructure of the surrounding areas.  What is needed next is seed funding and opportunities for capital investment.  This designation has enormous potential and should not be delayed.</p></speech>

Perhaps we will have a chance to discuss it a little more tomorrow, when I will be in the county.  We have seen the success of the zone around Shannon Airport, and I think something similar could be done around Knock.  I am told that the preparation of the planning scheme for the SDZ is a function of Mayo County Council.  Further to the making of the scheme, the planning authority must grant permission for any development which is consistent with the planning scheme, with no further appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la allowed.  In January of this year the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage received a request from Mayo County Council seeking an endorsement for the inclusion of the SDZ scheme for Knock within the scope of the eligibility for European cohesion funding as part of the European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, operational programme running between now and 2027.  While there is no developed proposal for ERDF funding in respect of the SDZ at present, there is initial scope for a feasibility study to set out a plan for future phased investment, which may include ERDF support.  The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has offered that an official would work with Mayo County Council and the regional assembly to scope this out.  That may form a future application for ERDF funding.</p></speech>

Last week in this House the T&aacute;naiste set out a very positive vision for a clean energy future for Ireland and for Europe, and this is indeed an opportunity for Ireland.  He said clearly that the Government wants to develop a hydrogen economy in this country.  I think that will require an all-of-government response.  Ireland should not be satisfied to be a follower in this exciting new development; we should take the lead.  We should not leave it to the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications or the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, to which we might be inclined to leave it.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are all relevant to this huge task we have.

There is a real opportunity here for Ireland to move within a generation from being an energy importer to being an energy exporter using offshore wind, onshore wind and solar to produce electricity, while also using offshore wind to produce hydrogen, a dispatchable fuel that we can use to replace gas and petrol and diesel in some cases.  That would give us energy security and price stability.  Even if climate change were not happening, the lessons from Ukraine show us how important it is to achieve energy security and price stability.</p> <p>My Department is keen to get involved, particularly in using the IDA to attract investment into hydrogen and offshore wind.  We propose to set up a cross-government task force to deal with offshore wind and hydrogen.  It will be led by the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications but my Department and the IDA will be very involved.  </p></speech>

They are required now.  Fertiliser prices have increased by up to 228% and there have been dramatic energy and feed price increases.  Farmers' input costs across the board have increased.  These are unsustainable costs for farmers who operate in a distorted market where the dominance of retailers and processors means primary producers do not get a fair price at the best of times.</p>  <p>  I welcome the pig sector package announced by Government but it will not be sufficient to meet the needs of that sector.  Every agriculture sector needs financial support immediately.  Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm that the Government will avail of the flexibility provided this week in a meaningful manner?  Will he ensure that happens speedily and that financial supports reach farmers' bank accounts as a matter of urgency?</p></speech>

As I mentioned earlier, I had a chance to meet with the six farming organisations yesterday and had a good discussion on this.  While most sectors are seeing an increase in the prices farmers are getting, it is pretty much wiped out, if not entirely wiped out, by the increase of input costs, particularly when it comes to energy and fertiliser.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, was in Brussels this week discussing with his European partners and the Commission what we could do to provide farmers with additional financial assistance and he will work on that over the coming days.

I know the T&aacute;naiste is aware of it.  The Labour Court decision and related documentation show how determined the workers were and that they were effectively sacked for joining a trade union and being active therein.  Every employer would not mind employees joining a trade union if they never did a thing about it.</p>  <p>  The tips Bill in its current format allows for a service charge to be applied.  This has been shown by the Labour Court recommendation to be unfair.  The T&aacute;naiste has said he will look at this but will he give a commitment that the service charge in its current format will not be in that legislation and that all gratuities intended for workers will go directly to those workers?</p>  <p>  I know the T&aacute;naiste has done this but will he join me in the House in congratulating those workers, wishing them well and encouraging people to join their trade union and be active therein?

I join her in commending and congratulating the workers involved on taking that case.  The outcome from the Labour Court is clear.  We are working on amendments to the Bill.  I engaged with the Attorney General on it yesterday.  The difficulty is that a mandatory service charge is not a gratuity or tip.  It is compulsory.  If you do not pay it, the restaurateur or publican can call the garda&iacute;.  That is the fundamental difference between a mandatory service charge and a tip or gratuity.  We are looking at two options to amend and improve the Bill.  One is to outlaw mandatory service charges altogether; the second is to require that, if there is a mandatory service charge, it is distributed to the workers in the same way as a tip or gratuity would be.  We will have a chance in the committee on Committee Stage to engage on that.</p></speech>

Thankfully, there is good cross-Border policing co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI today.  There is an urgent need for additional Garda resources for the former Ballyconnell Garda district which covers a large rural Border area with a dispersed population.  In forthcoming allocation of Garda resources, I appeal to the Government to recognise the needs of this area and I hope the T&aacute;naiste will support this appeal for more resources.  In the past, we living in that community suffered far too much due to paramilitary thugs, criminals and murderers and we will not go back there.  This criminal element needs to be eradicated quickly.</p></speech>

I join him in utterly and unreservedly condemning the attack on Garda Scott in County Cavan the other day.  The House is united in horror and condemnation of that attack.  An attack on the Defence Forces or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is an attack on all of us because it is an attack on the State.</p>  <p>  In relation to Garda resources, we have more garda&iacute; in Ireland than ever before and the Garda budget is larger than ever before.  That does not mean we do not need to increase it further.  We do.  I hear what the Deputy says on the need for additional resources for his county but that is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I will make sure the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, is made aware it was raised here today.</p></speech>

In 2003 there was a massive landslide associated with that development.  There have been ongoing and significant environmental transgressions ever since, to the extent that since 2019 the European Commission has been fining Ireland &euro;15,000 per day for those transgressions.  We have paid a cumulative fine of &euro;13.2 million.  Recently, An Bord Plean&aacute;la refused what is essentially retrospective consent for this development.  Do we intend to continue paying this fine of &euro;15,000 per day on behalf of the ESB?  Bearing in mind that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has refused consent, is this now an unauthorised development?</p></speech>

I am a big fan of the ESB as a company but it has not covered itself in glory when it comes to this issue.  A decision has to be made by ESB.  It has to take a case to the court or demolish and remove the wind farm.  It is one or the other.  It is a decision for that company but it has to resolve this quickly.</p></speech>

It is the same site she lived in as a child in the St. Mary's asylum for blind girls and women, an institution named in the Ryan report and in the Residential Institutions Redress Act.  As a result of a tactical liquidation by the Sisters of Charity, the institution to which we plan to turn over the national maternity hospital, she is being evicted from the housing, which was essentially leased and funded by Dublin City Council.  A blind, disabled woman is being evicted by the Sisters of Charity.  She does not want to leave but is under major pressure and is a vulnerable woman.  This follows the loss of 200 jobs at the Caritas disability centre on the same site, where the workers only got statutory redundancy at short notice.  The Sisters of Charity have sought to rezone the land and will make &euro;50 million profit out of it.  Could we have an intervention to protect Eleanor?</p></speech>

Questions they ask include whether they in receipt of the housing assistance payment, whether they are employed, whether they are refugees and whether they are professionals.</p> <p>The response to these questions by the landlords could impact on the insurance premiums.  This practice strikes me as extremely discriminatory and has the potential to further distort our housing market and to make it more difficult for many individuals and families to secure much-needed rented accommodation.  Is the T&aacute;naiste aware of this practice, which seems to have spread from the UK?  Will he ask the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to contact the Central Bank of Ireland to investigate it and revert to me?  </p></speech>

It is an extraordinary figure.  An abortion review is happening now, but I cannot get a commitment from the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, that any of those adverse incidents will be analysed in that context. In truth, the 20,000 abortions that have happened so far under this law are, individually, adverse incidents for each of those children whose lives have been taken.  The T&aacute;naiste will be aware of the horrific case in Holles Street hospital where baby Christopher was aborted after his parents were incorrectly told he was terminally ill.  The HSE promised that new guidelines would be drawn up to ensure that this would never happen again.  Once the tragic story fell out of the media headlines, however, those new guidelines never materialised.  Where are they now?</p></speech>

I understand that we have reserves in Cork.  Are we going to do something about this situation?  I got 11 calls from bus drivers yesterday who tendered with the Department of Education to bring children to school.  They are throwing their contracts back because there is no surcharge on them.  Lorry drivers are also parking lorries.  An explosion is about to happen in the next week or two if something is not done by the Government.  I am asking about what is going to be done about this situation, whether it is impacting farmers using green diesel or people who need home heating oil.  I do not want to hear about fuel allowances and everything like that.  I am talking about people who do not qualify for those schemes and who are working every day.  It costs &euro;40 an hour in diesel to run a lorry.  We are talking about food prices and people in this context.

Rachaidh m&eacute; siar air sin anois.</p><p>I very much welcome the Bill.  It is a positive step and I say &quot;Well done&quot; to the Department and the Minister.  It is a good Bill, and while there are difficulties with it, that is part of the process of amendments and review.  This is a special day and we are, I hope, turning a corner.  The Bill will give legal underpinning to excavations that will be carried out forensically, with expertise and in accordance with international standards, for the first time ever.  I hope that, as we shine that spotlight, we will shine it also on the society and the narrative that allowed that to happen.  We are not standing here today as a result of a proactive Department - although I am not finding issue with the Department - or because society has grown up and we realise we really should do these things.  Rather, we are doing this because of Catherine Corless.  It is like &ldquo;in the beginning was Catherine Corless&rdquo;.  In this case, in the beginning was Catherine Corless in 2012.  She has shown perseverance against all odds.  I have read her book.  What stood out for me, among many aspects, was her description of going into the county council building to carry out her research and how, in modern times, she was supervised, with the door locked.  We were still locking doors in modern times and supervising anyone who dared to ask questions.  She wrote an article for a local newspaper.  We know all this because it has been said many times but it is important to reiterate it because without her and her persistence, we would be nowhere.  She published her extraordinary and poignant article, entitled &ldquo;The Home&rdquo;, in the <i>Journal of the Old Tuam Society</i>in 2012, detailing the poor living conditions.</p><p>I am conscious of time and I want to get through quite a lot, so Catherine might forgive me, given what she has done is all on record.  Between 2011 and 2013, at her own expense, she obtained 798 death records for children who had died in Tuam but for whom there were no burial records.  There were no burial records in an institution that was owned and run by the county council and operated by the sisters.  It was a religious institution with no burial records.  There was also help from local media, the <i>Galway City Tribune</i>, when an article by Denise McNamara entitled &ldquo;Campaign to recognise 800 dead Tuam babies&rdquo; was published on 13 February.  It was a good article, but there was a casualness in the way it was presented.  The real figure was 798.  It is awful that we could be so casual about whether the figure was 798 or 800.  Nevertheless, I pay tribute to the <i>Galway City Tribune</i>for its work and also to <i>The Irish Mail on Sunday</i>.</p><p>After that, a commission of inquiry was announced in 2014 and set up in February 2015.</p> <p>Later that year, the commission began field investigations on the site of the memorial garden.  There was a little memorial garden to add - I will not say &quot;insult&quot; - another layer on top of what was hidden underground.  The commission used a non-invasive geophysical study.  Interestingly, this was followed by a series of test excavations in 2016 and 2017 to ground &quot;truth anomalies&quot; that had been identified by remote sensing.  The truth anomalies were not just in the ground, of course.  It is amazing that that term is being used.<br/><br/>On 3 March 2017, the commission of investigation released a press statement detailing that, in the course of the test excavations, significant quantities of juvenile human remains have been located in underground chambers that were associated with a structure potentially related to the historic treatment of sewage waste.  As a result of this discovery, the commission asked the relevant State authorities to take responsibility for the appropriate treatment of the remains.  Clearly, the commission asked the Government to take responsibility.<br/><br/>The special investigation team that was set up subsequently noted that the then Minister, Ms Katherine Zappone, took &quot;a leading role in attempting to deal with the discovery of juvenile human remains in a sewage facility in Tuam.&quot;  I am quoting the technical group's report.  It continued:</p><blockquote>	The government agencies that were consulted in the process of compiling this report facilitated the [expert group] ...  However, no agency, Department or organisation acknowledged a role in coordinating any future work at the Tuam site.  This poses clear problems; while the [expert technical group] acknowledges the lack of precedent for the situation and the site this issue, as a priority, should be resolved as effectively and timely as possible. </blockquote> <p>Of course, that did not happen.  We are now in 2022.  Ms Zappone set up this team.  Parallel with that, the commission of investigation, following its work on the site, published its report, which was eventually published on 15 March as an interim report.  It makes many interesting comments.<br/><br/>Galway County Council had a legal responsibility to keep a record of burials.  It is important to remember that this is the very county council that had its meetings in the mother and baby home.  Members and staff &quot;must have known something about the manner of burial&quot;, which was inappropriate.  This report is dated 15 March and was published in April.  I am being specific because I believe there were seven or eight interim reports, but few of them were published on time.  The second-last one was not published at all.  In the end, I believe it was the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, who was responsible for getting it published along with this report.  Imagine the message that was being sent to Catherine Corless, the survivors and the various groups connected to Tuam, Bessborough and everywhere else.<br/><br/>Ms Zappone did her work and the report was published quickly, listing five options.  When the Minister replies, he might say whether we are choosing the fourth option, the fifth option or a combination. The fifth option was for a full excavation.<br/><br/>I am only giving a bare outline of what has led us to this legislation.  Along with all of these reports, we had Dr. Geoffrey Shannon's report, dated 12 April 2018, on human rights.  We also had the inaugural meeting of the collaborative forum in July 2018 but whose report has never been published.  That is some accountability and transparency.  Only the recommendations have been published, and then only after pressure was applied.  The commission of investigation's report was given to the Government on 30 October 2020.  I am losing track of time; I am unsure as to whether the Minister was in office then.  Significantly and unacceptably, the report was not published.  The first time we heard about its publication was in a leak to a Sunday newspaper.  As part of that leak, an interview with the Taoiseach commented on the contents even though no one had seen it.  There was an investigation into that leak but there has been no outcome.  There was then the webinar with the survivors.  They did not get copies of the 3,000-page report.  For anyone who is listening, I have copies of the report in my office &ndash; I thank the Minister for them &ndash; and I give them out regularly.  This document in my hand is just part of that report.  I will not say that I have read every word but I have read the majority of it and I keep reverting to it.<br/><br/>The general scheme of the Bill was finally published in December 2019.  It was unacceptable.  Coming from a Government that people were trying to trust, it caused outrage and upset once again.  An Oireachtas committee considered the heads.  Covid interfered with the timeliness of that but the committee published a good report, which I have read, with 65 recommendations.  After the publication of the Bill's general scheme, six UN special rapporteurs and two chair-rapporteurs highlighted serious issues.  I mention all of this to outline what has brought us to this point where we have changed the heads of the Bill into legislation that I hope puts survivors at the centre.<br/><br/>Along with all of that serious stuff, we have constant commentary and it is important to mention these comments.  I have mentioned the help provided by newspapers.  I will now mention a very unhelpful comment from Ms Terry Prone in her capacity as public relations officer, PRO, for the nuns.  She was asked to comment on the Tuam discovery.  She wrote:</p><blockquote>	Your letter was sent on to me by the Provincial of the Irish Bon Secours congregation with instructions that I should help you.  I'm not sure how I can.  Let me explain.  When the &quot;O My God &ndash; mass grave in West of Ireland&quot; broke in an English-owned paper (the Mail) it surprised the hell out of everybody, not least the Sisters of Bon Secours in Ireland, none of whom had ever worked in Tuam and most of whom had never heard of it. </blockquote> <p>She went on to say:</p><blockquote>	If you come here, you'll find no mass grave, no evidence that children were ever so buried, and a local police force [this is presumably the Garda] casting their eyes to heaven [interesting that they were to heaven] and saying &quot;Yeah, a few bones were found &ndash; but this was an area where Famine victims were buried.  So? </blockquote> <p>That was the comment from the Bon Secours nuns through Ms Terry Prone.<br/><br/>On the positive side, documentaries from RT&Eacute; and the international media were pushing and supporting people on the ground, as well as this and previous Governments, to do something.  I was only elected in 2016 and Catherine Corless started her work in 2012.  That means we have gone through three Governments.  I have mixed up how many taoisigh we have had in that time and I do not know how many Ministers have sat where the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is sitting now, ostensibly trying to do his best.  In light of the bare outline I have given, the Minister can see how difficult it is on the ground for people who have suffered.<br/><br/>I welcome the legislation and its positive elements but I have a number of concerns.  The Minister has taken on some &ndash; I do not know whether it is most, so he might help me with that &ndash; of the recommendations of the cross-party committee.  I welcome the inclusion of an advisory board.  The Minister spoke about relatives being on it.  He used the plural &quot;relatives&quot; in his speech but it is singular in the legislation, in that there will only be one person from each group.  He might clarify this issue.<br/><br/>There is an obligation to provide documents, which is essential.  It applies to public bodies, but will the Minister clarify whether it applies to nuns and all other relevant bodies?  A large amount of documentation is with the nuns.<br/><br/>I will use a few seconds to say that I have the greatest of respect for nuns.  Some of them have done a great job.  When I talk about the nuns, I also talk about the county council, the politicians, the solicitors and the judges that were all in this system.  In particular, the manager of Galway County Council took an extraordinary role.  Actually, he did not &ndash; he took the role that was given to him under law, and he did it well.  When someone got pregnant for the second time, the county manager decided where her fate lay and so on.  The council then held its meetings.  As such, I am not singling out nuns.</p> <p>Neither am I agreeing with various comments from our former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, who said they did not come in the middle of the night.  What happened here was far more subtle or not so subtle, where a system of coercion to back up the system was used and never analysed by the commission of investigation.  Let us go back to the legislation.  Will the Minister clarify who that applies to and what analysis has been done in that regard?</p> <p> There are a number of escape routes that trouble me deeply in section 8(3).  In determining whether there can be making of an order under section 7(1), the establishment of the office of director of authorised intervention, a number of criteria are set out.  I understand some of them.  Will the Minister clarify what is meant or what he envisages as coming under "public health", for example?  There is also "the need to respect the views of the relatives of persons buried in the land".  I understand it was a matter discussed by the committee but the term "relatives" is not defined anywhere in the legislation.  That particular use of the word "relatives" is not defined.</p> <p> There is also mention of the "archaeological features (if any) of the land", and there must of course be a balancing exercise in this respect, though it should not be an escape route.  The most worrying term, however, is that the process shall consider "the social and economic interests of the State".  This escape route is extremely worrying for me and I would really like the Minister to address that for me.  I hope it will also be addressed when we deal with the amendments.</p> <p> I note the committee and its Chairman welcomed the lifting of restrictions on the coroner.  I can see that too.  However, I am not sure how the person appointed overall and the coroner will work together.  The way I read the legislation, the coroner will be brought in if the person in charge decides there are suspicious circumstances or questions relating to the causes of the circumstances of the death.  Is it only at that point that the coroner comes in?  I am not clear myself on this and perhaps I am misreading it.  When the restrictions are lifted from the coroner, will the person appointed to oversee the scene call in the coroner if necessary?  There is also the question of the appeals system and the adjudicator, as well as the independence of that adjudicator.</p> <p> I will wind up by saying the documents I have in front of me comprise a slight amount of the number of documents I have read.  I cannot imagine how difficult it is for affected people - those who were in mother and baby homes, albeit not industrial schools - to try to come to come to terms with just the bare outline of what I have discussed.  What we need, and what the Minister brings, to a certain extent, is openness and accountability in the system.  With the help of the committee and the various actions from outside actors, there has been a change.</p> <p> It strikes me as ironic that the compensation built into the scheme, and there must be compensation, will perhaps in some cases exceed what survivors might get in due course under the redress scheme.  It is really ironic when we think about it.  This is the cost of child abuse and our failure to act.  I can give an example, going back to the religious orders, which need to make contributions.  There was an inability of different Governments to analyse and give figures.  The original forecast for the redress scheme for those who went to industrial schools, as indicated by the Comptroller and Auditor General, was &euro;250 million but it ended up costing &euro;1.25 billion.  I do not say this to argue that cost is an element but rather the opposite; we end up spending billions of euro because we fail to do it right initially.  We failed to do it right with the redress board for those involved with Magdalen laundries and with Caranua, that terrible name meaning "new friend" when it was really the old enemy.</p> <p> As I am over my time, I will finish on that.  I hope the amendments to the Bill will make the process more accountable and put people at its centre.  I hope it is a turning point. </p></speech>

As the Deputies have said, the legislation is technical and detailed, but when we get back to the essence of what we are doing, it is law that provides for the removal of the remains of infants from a septic tank where they were placed inappropriately.  Words almost fail us sometimes when we speak about the magnitude of the awfulness evident at this site.  I thank Deputies for their detailed consideration of the Bill and acknowledgement of the significant progress made by it.  I thank the Chairman and members of the Oireachtas joint committee for their sustained engagement in helping to bring about these improvements.</p>  <p>  In particular, I thank the former residents and family of infants who died or survivors from Tuam and many of the other institutions who have engaged with me so often for as long as I have been in this role.  It is speaking with them and understanding their experiences and perspectives that has inspired me to make changes in this legislation.  I also thank the team in my Department that has worked so hard to make these very significant changes as well.</p>  <p>  As I said yesterday, on a number of occasions we have taken on board directly the recommendations of the Oireachtas joint committee, and on many other occasions we have taken on board the spirit of recommendations and have made significant changes.  I am cognisant that this is complex legislation and there has been criticism of the difficulty in reading or comprehending it.  While we have put forward a plain English version as well, we are dealing with immensely complex matters, particularly in terms of the DNA identification programme, which requires strong legislative protection because of the privacy rights invoked whenever anything with DNA is done.  We should also note that the level to which we shall intervene at this site is a level not previously provided for in Irish law.  That is why the inserted section stating that the intervention must be to international standards is so important.  I hope that demonstrates we are doing absolutely everything we can to investigate these sites.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about the report and we see the fifth option being taken, that is, the most extensive element of intervention.  I have said that and I know it is a matter discussed by Ms Catherine Corless.  Will the agency just look at the tank?  No, it will be able to look at the entire site in Tuam and undertake truthing.  If there are "anomalies" in other parts of the site, those elements will be excavated as well.  We are not bringing forward the legislation and putting the focus on this just to do half the job.  I want to make the point again that anywhere there are suspected burials on the site will be excavated.</p>  <p>  I am very grateful to Dr. Niamh McCullagh for her engagement with my Department, particularly on the question of forensic investigation.  She had much engagement with my officials on the international standards and how to take the practice of forensic archaeology and express it in legislation.  Her assistance has been highly beneficial and has led to the strengthening of the legislation.</p>  <p>  A significant number of matters were raised in the debate today and yesterday and I will try to address a number of them now.</p> <p>On Committee Stage we will have the opportunity to address more.  Many Deputies raised the 20 m issue and the issue of land access yesterday.  Hopefully I can provide some degree of clarity on this point.  The legislation is trying to bring some element of balance between the absolute importance of carrying out an intervention and the rights of homeowners in certain situations.  The legislation provides for the director to acquire temporary rights of access to land.  It provides for reasonable compensation and a requirement to restore land to its original condition after the intervention has taken place.  Under the general scheme, the provision was that the Government could not make an order in respect of land on which there was one or more residential dwelling and a director could not seek access to land in residential use where the access would encroach more than 2 m beyond the boundary of the land.  That was a significant limitation.  If there was a suspected burial on a site, and if there was residential land on it, the entire site was basically excluded from the ambit of the Bill.  Many people raised concerns about that.  In response to the recommendations, we have significantly limited that.  Now if there is residential land on a site where there is proposed to be an intervention, that intervention can still take place.  What we are saying is that the intervention cannot come nearer than 20 m from the residential site.  That is to ensure that the very intimate area of a residential home is not being excavated.  Particularly on sites where religious land has been sold and there are large residential developments as well as land that can be investigated, the presence of the residential homes does not remove the entire site from the ambit of the legislation.  That is the first point on residential land.</p> <p> Specifically in the case of Tuam, the main site is in public ownership.  We are talking about the memorial garden, the playground and the car park.  That part of the site is all in public ownership.  This residential restriction in terms of the 20 m rule does not apply.  I want to make that very clear.  The 20 m rule will not in any way interfere in Tuam.  As anyone who has been at the Tuam memorial garden knows, it backs immediately onto privately-owned gardens.  This legislation allows for an intervention 2 m into privately-owned land if that is necessary to secure the site.  There is this very large wall in Tuam looming over where we know the tank is.  There may have to be an intervention there to secure the site to make sure the excavation can fully take place.  There is no limitation on intervention in public land.  Where land is residential, there can now be an intervention but not within 20 m of the residential home.  Where the principal burial site is in public land there can be an intervention of up to 2 m in privately owned land around it in order to secure the site.  I hope that gives some clarity.  I see this as a significant improvement.  It was a very legitimate critique that was made of the first Bill and I believe we are implementing and addressing the recommendations coming from the pre-legislative scrutiny, PLS.</p> <p> Deputy Canney noted that this does have an impact on homes and people; in Tuam, they are people who may well have helped to keep that site over the years and ensure that at least the memorial garden was respected.  We will engage with that in terms of making sure there is proper consultation where a site is adjacent to privately owned land.  We recognise that.  I will come back to the advisory board.  It does have a member of the local authority and that can help in terms of ensuring that the views of people in the area who may not be relatives or family members are brought into discussions.</p> <p> On the link between the coroner and the director of the agency, Deputy Cairns asked why we need this legislation.  That has been asked in the past.  The coroner is an independent public office.  Coroners have a general duty to hold an inquest if they are of the opinion that a death or deaths may have occurred in a violent or unnatural manner or happened suddenly and from unknown cause.  The Bill places no restriction on the jurisdiction of the coroner.  The exclusion of the right of the coroner to intervene in certain circumstances - the circumstances were limited but there was an exclusion there in the original draft - has been removed.  I recognise that this has been welcomed.  The Coroners Act 1962 only makes limited provision in respect of the exhumation and removal of a body.  It provides for the Minister for Justice to order an exhumation at the request of the coroner if the coroner is informed by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that a death or deaths may have occurred in a violent or unnatural manner.</p> <p> As we know, the commission's final report on this speaks to issues that were raised yesterday by a number of Deputies in respect of investigations.  The commission's final report was shared with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It considered the report and determined that there was insufficient information available to commence a criminal investigation. However, subsequently, in April of last year, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issued an appeal to anyone with information about crimes at mother and baby institutions to make contact with it in order that such crimes could be investigated where possible.  A number of survivors I have spoken to have engaged with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and those investigations are with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p> Coming back to the point Deputy Connolly was making about the degree of excavation, in 2018 the Government decided that a full forensic-standard excavation, recovery and, if possible, identification of remains across the full available site in Tuam was the most appropriate response.  The Government was at that time advised that there was no legal basis to undertake that degree of work and therefore that legislation - the legislation we are bringing forward now - was required.  This legislation is designed to complement the Coroners Act 1962 by providing a mechanism for guaranteed intervention at the Tuam site.  That is important.  This legislation guarantees that there will be intervention in the Tuam site.  It guarantees that intervention at, I believe, a much higher standard than the Coroners Act provides for at the moment, in this idea that it has to be at international forensic standard.  That is not stated anywhere in existing Irish law.  As the Acting Chair, Deputy Funchion, knows from the concerns raised by family members, they were worried this would not be done in a proper way, that it would just be a removal.  That cannot happen now because of what we have written into this law.</p> <p> The Bill does not place any restriction on the jurisdiction of the coroner and will not remove the obligation on the coroner to hold an inquest where such an inquest is required under the 1962 Act and, importantly, where remains show evidence of violent or unnatural death.  The director overseeing the intervention must immediately inform An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the coroner within whose district the remains were recovered.  There is a clear obligation if the director becomes aware of violent or unnatural death to inform the coroner and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We will talk about the work the director has to do in respect of each set of remains.  In that event, the director has to comply with any directions given to him or her by the coroner or An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p> <p> A new provision is added in section 36 whereby the director is required to prepare and publish a report documenting the circumstances of the discovery of the human remains, the forensic excavation and recovery of those human remains and the outcome of post-recovery analysis including, if possible, information on the circumstances and cause of death.  The director will have to provide an examination of each set of remains that has been recovered from the site and provide information, if it is possible to glean it from those remains, about the cause of death.  That will be a publicly available document which can be provided to the coroner.  Should the coroner decide to hold an investigation, that can be an incredibly valuable document in terms of any work the coroner does up to and including an inquest.  </p> <p> There is nothing in the legislation that restricts the coroner entering the site at any stage.  The director is not prohibited under the legislation from sharing evidence or data that may be requested of the director by the coroner.</p> <p> The membership of the advisory board will include a chairperson, who will be a person who either has been a coroner in this State or has demonstrated expertise in coronial matters.  This person may be from this State or outside it.  He or she must be someone with expertise in this area and who perhaps has been involved in a similar type of excavation and recovery elsewhere.  The board will include two members who have scientific expertise, again to ensure there is forensic and scientific advice being provided at all times.  That was an issue of concern to family members.  The membership will also include someone who is a member of staff of the local authority in which the principal burial site is located, an individual who considers that he or she is a family member of a deceased person believed to be buried at the site and a person who is a former resident of the institution.  If there is no one alive who was formerly resident, there will be two members who are family members of the deceased.  Those two roles are interchangeable but they ensure that there will be two people on the advisory board representing either former residents or family members of those who died in the relevant institution.</p> <p> Consultation with the advisory board is required at intervals but there are a number of key decision points at which the director must consult the advisory board, namely, when making arrangements for the forensic excavation, the conducting of post-recovery analysis of remains, providing updates to relatives, stakeholders and the public, and in decisions relating to the continuation or reviewing of an identification programme.</p> <p> A number of Deputies raised the issue of the substantive reasons for intervention or, potentially, of using memorialisation if it is regarded as more appropriate.  Under the Bill, the Government may make an order where it is satisfied that manifestly inappropriate burials have taken place on lands associated with an institution.  An institution is broadly defined as being a current or former residential facility where a public body has or had a relevant role.  In determining whether burials were manifestly inappropriate, consideration is given to the available evidence, as set out under a number of criteria.  They include whether the remains are uncoffined, if they are buried in a manner that would not have complied with the burial grounds regulations at the applicable time, if they are buried in a way that would not reasonably be considered to provide a dignified internment, or if they are buried collectively and in a manner or location that is repugnant to common decency and would reasonably have been considered so at the time of burial.  The Bill gives the Government the power to intervene in these circumstances.  In making a decision to intervene, it must balance the need for such intervention in a situation where something is manifestly inappropriate with our societal belief in the sanctity of a burial site and the preference to avoid disturbing remains following burial.  That is a difficult and complex issue.  There is a collective agreement on the Tuam site but, as I know from my engagement with survivors of other institutions, there are differing views as to whether there should be an intervention or proper memorialisation.  I recognise that these are difficult points to balance.</p> <p> I will talk briefly about the question of family members who can participate the programme.  I have expanded the provisions in this regard from the initial proposal that only first-order relatives, that is, parents, children, siblings and half-siblings, should be included.  We are now including grandchildren, uncles, aunts, nieces and nephews.  The key reason we have not included cousins is a technical issue to do with the share of DNA.  First-order relatives share 50% of DNA with a person who is interred at the sites and second-order relatives share 25%.  When we get to third-order relatives, however, the common DNA is only 12.5%, which gives a dramatically lesser chance of getting successful matches.  We have engaged with experts as to where we have the best chance of achieving identifications.  In terms of the information campaign, third-order relatives will of course have the opportunity to engage with family members who are higher-order relatives and ask them to participate.  That is important because there are large communities impacted by this.  That is why the information campaign is significant in terms of getting greater engagement as early as possible.  The Bill provides for the possibility of future testing, under ministerial regulations, where there are scientific developments.  There may be a better chance of making identifications in the future because of improvements in technology.  It is important to highlight that.</p> <p> Deputies referred to a number of sites other than Tuam, principally the Bessborough and Sean Ross Abbey homes.  The commission of investigation concluded it is likely that some of the children who died at Bessborough are buried in the grounds but it was unable to find any physical or documentary evidence of such burials.  I have met with the group representing Bessborough survivors on a number of occasions and, in 2021, I made submissions to both An Bord Plean&aacute;la and Cork County Council in respect of a planning application that covered the area identified as the potential burial site as well as land adjacent to it.  In both cases, those planning applications were rejected.  There are differing views among Bessborough survivors, although there is a strong view towards memorialisation.  I will meet with the Cork survivors group in the near future as part of the Government's ongoing work on Bessborough.  I will speak a little more about memorialisation presently.</p> <p> Deputy Martin Browne is not here today but he had questions yesterday about the situation regarding the Sean Ross Abbey home.  The commission's final report included details of a forensic archaeological investigation it commissioned in respect of concerns about how the identified burial site there may have been impacted by drainage works.  The archaeological survey found that the burial grounds had not been impacted by any utilities or drainage work and noted that coffins or evidence of coffins were located with 84% of the remains that were found there.  I am aware of ongoing concerns from survivors, whom I have met, regarding another site outside the main burial site.  I have engaged with them on providing some support in terms of additional work that might be done to gain certainty regarding that adjacent site.  I will meet with the group in the near future to discuss that further.  We continue to engage with relevant groups about relevant sites.</p> <p> There were several queries about final arrangements for identified and unidentified remains.  The Bill provides that a director will make final arrangements for human remains as soon as practicable after a familial link has been established or an identification programme has been concluded.  There was concern during pre-legislative scrutiny that remains might stay with the director for a long period even if they had been identified.  There is now a much clearer obligation on the director to provide remains once they have been matched.  Where a familial match has been made, the director will, at the request of family members, either return the remains to them or make arrangements in line with their wishes.  Where a familial link has not been established or an identification programme is not undertaken, the director will make arrangements having regard to the stated wishes of persons who believe they have family members buried at the site.  That is a key element of the Bill.  Where remains are not identified, the director will make the final decision but it will be done in consultation with the advisory board and with wider family groups.  In the case of Tuam, it is likely that there will be both identified and unidentified remains, which means both of these contexts probably will arise.</p> <p> Regarding memorialisation and the protection of these sites around the country, a working group has been set up between my Department and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which is looking at that issue as well as other issues to do with how local authorities can support survivors.  That is provided for in the action plan.  The group is looking to provide best practice guidelines on ongoing engagement and liaison support for former residents, support groups and local authorities.  I have engaged directly with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to seek additional central guidance on the importance of local authorities providing specific protections for any burial sites that may be linked to former mother and baby home or county home institutions.</p> <p>The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is preparing a circular intended to assist local communities in participating in the local development plan process and encouraging local authorities to incorporate appropriate policies on burial sites into development plans.  It is intended that this circular will be issued in quarter 1 of this year.  That is an important step in allowing local authorities to provide for the protection of sites within their functional areas.</p> <p> Deputy Connolly asked about the ability to get information and the reference to "public body".  In the definition section, the term "information source" refers to a person who is the holder, controller or processor of information.  That is a very wide definition and we believe it covers public institutions but also private ones, such as those remarked upon by the Deputy.  We believe that is covered.</p> <p> On the issue of the adjudicator, an adjudicator is a body set up to review a decision of a director not to allow somebody to participate in the DNA identification process or review a decision of a director that a familial link has not been established by the DNA process.  Under the original legislation, the director appointed the adjudicator.  The adjudicator was appointed by the person he was making the adjudication upon.  That is not appropriate so the adjudicator will now be appointed by me and be separate from the director.  Those are the two key roles the adjudicator will undertake.</p> <p> I thank the Deputies for their engagement on this legislation.  It is incredibly important that we advance this, recognising, as Deputy Connolly outlined in great detail, the long time that relatives and former residents of the Tuam home have waited to see a resolution for the site, to have the remains of children recovered, to have all efforts made to identify them and to return their remains to family members so they can receive a dignified burial.  That is what we are seeking to do in this legislation.  We will continue to work to develop it and I will continue to engage with Deputies on Committee Stage, listening and always seeking to improve the legislation, conscious that survivors are waiting for us to pass it so action may take place.  It is incumbent on us all, after such a long period, to achieve this finally.</p></speech>

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gcomhchoiste as an tuarasc&aacute;il th&aacute;bhachtach.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, on the important report on key issues affecting the Traveller community.  I thank the committee members and its Chair, Senator Eileen Flynn, for their comprehensive report, which raises many key issues and also makes several important recommendations that will involve work across several Departments.  The Minister had good engagement with the committee in November and is aware that it consulted Traveller and Roma groups widely, in addition to Departments and other interested stakeholders.</p><p>I am aware that many committee members have been engaged in work to support the Traveller and Roma communities over many years.  We all agree that Travellers and Roma have long suffered from negative stereotypes and discrimination.  The Government is committed to ensuring full equality of opportunity for Travellers and Roma and removing barriers to their full and equal participation in Irish life.</p><p>As Members will be aware, the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, NTRIS, provides a framework for action on Traveller and Roma issues.It represents a whole-of-government approach and brings Departments and agencies together with representatives of Traveller and Roma communities to focus on key issues in a structured way.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, chairs the NTRIS steering committee, whose next meeting is scheduled for the end of March.  The programme for Government commits to a review of the strategy and the Minister is committed to working with stakeholders to review what has been achieved and develop new approaches, as necessary, with a particular focus on implementation and measurement.  The objectives of all our equality strategies remain largely relevant.  The key challenge is to ensure better delivery.</p><p>The issue of intersectionality also needs to be addressed more coherently.  We know, for instance, that the issues facing Traveller women and girls are different from those facing Traveller men and boys.  In this context, we need to see how the successor strategy to the national strategy for women and girls can work in tandem with NTRlS's successor strategy to focus on particular issues for Traveller women and girls.  The strategy committee's role will be pivotal in developing the consultation process and the content for the successor strategy.  The successor strategy will not represent change for the sake of change.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, will listen carefully to stakeholders to ascertain what they advise.  The advice provided by Traveller and Roma organisations will directly shape the scope and focus of the next strategy.  The recommendations contained in the report of the special Oireachtas committee will also inform the next iteration of NTRIS.  The support of all Departments will be crucial in ensuring the successor strategy will have a more outcomes-focused approach.</p><p>I reiterate the Government's commitment to supporting action to ensure that Travellers and Roma can participate equally and fully in Irish society.  While there have been some improvements, more remains to be done.  Again, on behalf of the Minister, I thank the committee for its report.</p><p>The Chair will know that both of us have worked with the Traveller community in our constituencies for many years.  Based on my having read the summary recommendations of the report, I commend the committee's Chairman, Senator Flynn, and its members on what is a really comprehensive report with a targeted and focused set of actions to be implemented.  In a speech I made following the issuing of the No End in Site report of the Ombudsman for Children's Office, I said that among Traveller families I know in my community and my Traveller friends, it is accepted that little, if anything, will ever change.  Now and then, there is a breakthrough when we celebrate someone going to third level education but these events are rare.  In that regard, it is critical that we address the findings of the report at a whole-of-government level and right across the Houses of the Oireachtas and work with all partner agencies and the Traveller and Roma communities to achieve the transformation.  I feel very strongly about it.</p><p>We see persistent discrimination, including at political level when there is intervention in housing allocations.  We see Traveller families, particularly young Travellers, hiding themselves from view rather than celebrating their heritage and culture.  As Minister of State with responsibility for heritage, I worked with the Heritage Council to develop the post of an intercultural heritage officer whose job would be to work with the Traveller and Roma communities.  We saw some really positive outcomes of that during Heritage Week last year.  I really feel that part of the process will involve focusing on celebrating Traveller culture, heritage and music.  In many ways, the Traveller community saved a lot of Irish traditional music through the oral tradition and language and its really deep traditions.  From this perspective, we need to tackle collectively the discrimination that takes place at every level in society.  The outcomes for young Travellers have not changed all that much in 20 years in this country.  We see this in housing, educational attainment and mental health.</p> <p> Report after report has recommended the way forward in the context of how we try to address this matter.  I feel that very little is changing in a real sense.  The Government is deeply committed to trying to resolve these issues.  People across this House are deeply committed to trying to resolve it with the Traveller community.</p> <p> I welcome the report.  I thank Senator Flynn and the members of the committee for the work that they put into it.  I hope that we can constructively work together to try to address the discrimination and the life outcomes for the Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland.</p></speech>

I thank Deputies for the opportunity and for allowing me to be here on what is a historical day.  I welcome my little girl, Billie, who is in the Gallery.  Just before I came into the Chamber, one of the ushers told me that I should remember that I am not here for nothing and that I am here because I deserve to be here.  I thought that was a lovely comment for him to make when I was coming in.</p>  <p>  I want to start by speaking about the report.  That is more important than me being invited to speak in the Chamber today.  It is about the report.  I thank Deputies for inviting me to address the House today on what I hope will be a life-changing report for many Travellers.  The final report of the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community is the work of many.  Most importantly, however, the report was inspired by contributions from Travellers.  National and local Traveller organisations and activists dedicated ourselves to many battles on the future for the Traveller community to ensure it has more equality of opportunity in Irish society.</p>  <p>  I was elected Chairperson of the joint committee on 19 November 2020.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v was elected vice chairman.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v again for all of his hard work and determination in working with us in the Traveller community over many years.  The committee was built on the important work of the previous committee, chaired by former Senator Colette Kelleher.  The committee made 84 recommendations in four areas, namely: health, including physical and mental health; education, particularly second and third level education; employment; and accommodation.  If the recommendations in this report are implemented, and I believe they must be, the committee and all of us in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad will be part of ensuring a better future for Travellers.  That is something for us to be very proud of.</p>  <p>  Before I speak any further on the report, I would like to formally welcome to the Gallery representatives from the Irish Network Against Racism, the Irish Traveller Movement, AkiDwA, Pavee Point, the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, the Muslim Sisters of &Eacute;ire, the Amal Women's Association, the National Traveller Mental Health Network, Exchange House and the National Traveller Women's Forum.  I believe that civil society organisations play a key role in society.  I thank the organisations represented for their work and for being here today.  I also thank my husband, Liam Whyte, and my friend, Damien Peelo, for being in the Gallery to support me in giving this speech today.</p>  <p>  As I said, the joint committee's report includes 84 recommendations on four critical areas.  The vast majority of the recommendations are not new.  They just have not been implemented.  We are looking for inclusive education and delivered health services, particularly in relation to mental health.  We have all seen that the authorities have not provided appropriate Traveller accommodation.  Oversight structures must be put in place and implemented to ensure that safe and culturally appropriate accommodation is provided for Travellers and families.  We have been asking for these consistently.  As the Minister of State said, over the years there have been many reports that highlighted the challenges that Travellers face in these areas, including the Oireachtas report.  We are still here today discussing the recommendations.  I cannot say enough in this speech how important and key the implementation of recommendations is.  At the time of the launch of the report, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and I said that nothing will change unless the recommendations are implemented.  Most importantly, a lack of action will mean the loss of hope for many Travellers and generations to come.</p>  <p>  I almost hesitate to mention some of the recommendations because they are all very important.  Still, some provide structure for change and will finally bring Travellers the services and support that we deserve as a community.  We must establish a national Traveller accommodation authority to oversee the development and implementation of Traveller accommodation policy.  The current system, whereby local authorities provide accommodation for Travellers, too often has not worked for Travellers.  Time and time again, we see local authorities underspend on their allocated funding for the Traveller community.  Between 2018 and 2019, there was an underspend of more than &euro;72 million in local authorities in funding for Traveller accommodation.  Yet the needs of Travellers regarding accommodation remain as serious as ever.  Who will be held to account for families who are living in overcrowded or unsafe accommodation or who are homeless?  The call for a national Traveller accommodation authority has been made many times over the years.  The call was also made by the Traveller accommodation expert review group in 2019.  The Minister committed to it then.  Now, it is time to see it through.</p>  <p>  What I will say next is the most important part of this whole speech, and it must be listened to and heard in this House.  Young Travellers within the Traveller community are dying by suicide every day.  There must be a stand-alone national Traveller mental health strategy with a ring-fenced budget.  There must be a clear timeline of implementation and delivery for it.  We need a Traveller mental health steering group that is run in partnership with stakeholders and, most importantly, with Travellers.  The recommendation that a national Traveller mental health strategy should be developed and implemented is not new.  The Government promised a national Traveller mental health strategy in the programme for Government.  Only a stand-alone strategy will turn the tide on the Traveller mental health crisis.</p>  <p>  I was delighted and proud last year to see the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill 2018 be passed by the D&aacute;il thanks to my colleague, Deputy Pringle.  I thank the former Senator Colette Kelleher and my Civil Engagement Group colleagues for bringing it through the Seanad.  That Bill is now on Committee Stage.  The Bill must be implemented as soon as possible.  Not only must it be implemented, but it must be representative of the Traveller community.  It must be implemented in our Irish education system as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  The fourth important recommendation of the report is to ensure that we continue to move forward the commitments and the recommendations that the Houses of the Oireachtas made through the committee established to oversee the issues faced by Travellers.  This includes monitoring implementation and recommendations, and delivering a follow-up strategy to the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy, as well as looking at other areas that impact on Travellers' lives.  We cannot just live in hope that things will get better for the Traveller community.  We have to implement the recommendations that are already there.</p>  <p>  When I was thinking about what I would say today, I thought of the great John Hume, who spoke gracefully of the vital importance of people working together for a better future.  I am a strong believer in solidarity and allyship.  I base my activism around it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.334" nospeaker="true" time="14:20:00" ><p>When John Hume accepted the Nobel Peace Prize, he said:</p><p>This is what we want as Travellers.  This is what we all want in Irish society.  We cannot continue to deny opportunities to people within communities and we cannot deny opportunities to the Traveller community because that has been done for generations.  Now it is time for us all to move forward together.  We have to let bygones be bygones and we need to move forward together.  All of us in both Houses must take responsibility for ensuring the recommendations become action.

People who know me on a personal level will be aware that I come from a family of wheeling and dealing, if you like, at markets and so on.  We would always ask, &quot;Would you put your name to it?&quot; if we were about to buy or do something.  My question to every Deputy present in this House is: will they put their names to this report?  Will they put their names to these 84 recommendations, or even just to the four I spoke about today in this House?  The work is not over; it is just beginning.  Let us build on that.  It is as great as all of our dreams allow.  We all have the answers; it is about implementation.  

Travellers play an equal part of Irish society.  This Parliament has been here for 100 years and now it has a member of the Traveller community.  We are moving towards a better Ireland for everybody but it needs to be a more inclusive Ireland.  The money is there.  It is about implementation and changing people's lives.  Let us be the D&aacute;il and Seanad for a better change.  Let us be part of that better change by making sure Travellers have a better future.  We in the Traveller community do not have the power; the Government has it.  For decades, Travellers have been failed as a community.  It can no longer continue.  I hope with all my heart that it will no longer continue.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman of the committee, Senator Flynn, as well as the Vice Chairman, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, and the staff of the committee for the time and effort they put into it.  I also wish to thank the members of the Travelling community in Dublin, Cork and Galway for welcoming us into their communities and homes and being so generous with their time.  I welcome our visitors in the Public Gallery.</p>  <p>  This report contains 84 recommendations across the areas of health, education, housing and employment.  The Acting Chairman is probably happy to know that I do not have time to speak to all those sections, but my colleagues will touch on some of the recommendations later.  There are 18 recommendations relating to housing.  Recommendations 68 to 71, inclusive, highlight the need for a national audit of living conditions and safety concerns on all Traveller-specific sites.  These must be addressed.  On one of my visits, Deputy Joan Collins and I met a man who invited us into his home.  When we went in, the man had to advise us where to stand because the floors were ready to give way.  The windows were rattling.  There was mould and damp all over his home.  The sockets were burnt out.  Would any of the Members present live in those conditions?  The man told us all he wanted was somewhere safe to which he could bring his grandchildren.</p>  <p>  Recommendation 74 suggests that a national Traveller accommodation body should be established to oversee Traveller accommodation policy.  Traveller organisations have been calling for this for years.  The committee heard from many witnesses who spoke about discrimination faced by the Traveller community in trying to access housing.  There is no doubt that is why they are over-represented in the homeless figures.  The State has an appalling history in delivering culturally appropriate accommodation for Travellers.  We have seen council budgets go unspent even though there was an obvious need for accommodation.  Local authorities must do much more to deliver on this.</p>  <p>  In the section on education, recommendations 22 and 23 point to the need for the restoration of Traveller funding in the context of education.  That funding was cut in 2011 and 2012.  The report recommends that targeted resources be made available for Traveller children in mainstream education.  The Minister, Deputy Foley, needs to make sure the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill 2018 is enacted.  We require a national Traveller education strategy, as suggested in recommendation 24 and 32.</p>  <p>  The Government needs to implement this report.  It cannot sit on a shelf, gathering dust like all other reports.  The Government has a duty of care to the Traveller community across all Departments.  I believe this report is an opportunity for it to fulfil that duty.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.337" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1469" speakername="Mark Ward" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300035#LL00400"><p>In 2019, when I was mayor of South Dublin County Council, I launched a report on Traveller mental health by the Clondalkin Travellers development group.  The report found that nearly 80% of Travellers surveyed in south Dublin stated either they or someone in their family had suffered from depression.  This compares with just 8% of the general population.  The report identified the factors impacting negatively on Traveller mental health as loneliness, discrimination, drug addiction, family break-up, children's mental health and financial hardships.  Why do I mention that?  It is 2022 and the findings of the report before the House show that very little has changed since 2019.  I acknowledge the work of the Oireachtas committee in producing the report.  In particular, I thank the Chairman, Senator Flynn, my colleagues Deputies Ellis and Mitchell, and the Vice Chairman, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.</p>  <p>  The report outlines there is a crisis in mental health in the Traveller community.  I note that 90% of Travellers agreed that mental health problems were common in their community, with suicide being the cause of 11% of Traveller deaths.  I will repeat that.  Suicide is the cause of 11% of Traveller deaths.  That is seven times higher than the rate among the general population.  While we can all get lost in statistics, behind each one of those percentages there is a man, woman or child with hopes, dreams and aspirations just like anybody else.  As Senator Flynn stated, we need a national strategy for Traveller mental health and we need to have all the underpinning requirements in that strategy.</p>  <p>  The report outlines the causes and conditions affecting mental health within the Traveller community.  Travellers experience racism and exclusion daily.  Deficient and substandard living conditions such as those referred to by Deputy Mitchell, as well as precarious accommodation and homelessness, have a severe detrimental impact on mental health.  Lower educational outcomes have a damaging impact on employment opportunities, while chronic unemployment then leads to negative consequences on mental health.</p>  <p>  In my previous role, which involved working with people from marginalised communities, I had a lot of engagement with Exchange House.  It delivers mental health supports in a culturally appropriate way to the Traveller community.  One of the recommendations of the report is that increased funding should be provided for the delivery of peer-led Traveller-specific mental health supports through the Traveller primary healthcare team.  I know the work the Traveller primary healthcare team does in my area.  It is one of the unsung groups that were not recognised during Covid.  It was at the forefront, going into the Traveller community to deliver healthcare and advice, including in respect of Covid, and it needs to be recognised for that. </p>  <p>  We also need projects in local areas to provide timely interventions in the context of poor Traveller mental health.</p> <p>Early intervention is key.  We need to have things in place for young Traveller men and women in respect of suicide prevention, as has been mentioned.  I am a bit like Senator Flynn, as I am a wheeler dealer and she has my word that I will be putting my name to this report.  I congratulate her and all of our colleagues again on such a fabulous report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.339" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300036#MM00200"><p>I will start by thanking Senator Flynn and all of the members on the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community for both their hard work and for this very important report.  I would also like to acknowledge the fact the Government gave time to Senator Flynn to speak with us today.  I hope this is not the last time that she speaks on this issue on behalf of the Government.  If she got to speak on its behalf more often, Traveller public policy would be in a much better place.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the hard work of all of the organisations: Traveller, equality and anti-racist groups in the Gallery because if it were not for their work, many of the issues that we are talking about today would not be in the public arena at all.  I hope the Government acknowledges and continues to fund them and to increase their funding.</p>  <p>  As my party&rsquo;s housing spokesperson, I want to clearly say that I put my name to every single one of the 18 recommendations specifically relating to accommodation in the report, and in doing so I put the name of our party.  They are eminently sensible, most of them are not new and they should be implemented as a matter of urgency.</p>  <p>  There is a problem, however, because many years ago the Government commissioned a report on Traveller accommodation.  Professor Michelle Norris undertook the study on behalf of the Housing Agency and it was published in 2017.  That led to the formation of another group, the expert group on Traveller accommodation in 2018, and almost three years ago it made 32 separate recommendations to Government to tackle the very issues that this report, which we are discussing today, identifies.  The overwhelming majority of those recommendations have not been implemented.  There is no point in us sitting here today calling for the implementation of the recommendations of the new report when the outstanding recommendations in its predecessor remain on the shelf.  In fact, some of the most substantive recommendations of that report are not even in the pipeline.  We have to deal with Part 8 planning applications and with section 183 land transfers and ensure that Traveller accommodation programmes have a statutory binding implementation plan.  We need an agency above the local authorities and independent of Government to ensure that where local authorities and Government are in dereliction of their plans, then responsibility for implementation of those plans is transferred to that agency to ensure their full implementation.</p>  <p>  In the few seconds I have left I want to speak briefly about the spending on Traveller accommodation.  I acknowledge that under the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, for two years in a row the Traveller accommodation budget has been spent in full.  That is new, is welcome and deserves credit.  The problem is that the budget is too small and the money that is being spent is not tackling the core issues.  If one looks at the most recent figures of the Department, a tiny number of new units of Traveller-specific accommodation have been delivered while a large number of local authorities are still spending nothing on either upgrading existing facilities or on providing new facilities.  We do not, therefore, just need the legislative policy changes but we need a commitment from Government to dramatically increase the funding for the direct provision of culturally appropriate Traveller accommodation.  If the Government does that, it will have willing partners and supporters on these sides of the benches.</p></speech>

I congratulate Senator Flynn not only on her contribution to the report but on her contribution to the Seanad.</p>  <p>  In no particular order, I was struck by a number of things.  I served as a county councillor on South Dublin County Council along with Deputies Ward and &Oacute; Broin, although I was there before either of them.  As such I was very fortunate to work under one of the most exemplary public servants on this issue and other issues, the late Joe Horan, who was chief executive of that council and transformed it in so many ways.  The reason I think of him was that one of the points raised here was about public bodies doing more in regard to the employment of Travellers.  The late Mr. Horan led the way on that.  It was not just in respect of Travellers but those with disabilities also.  He always did more than was required of him under law as a chief executive in employing percentages of both in the council.  They were visible and worked in County Hall in Tallaght.  There is a beautiful park, Se&aacute;n Keating Garden, adjacent to Rathfarnham Castle commemorating the life of this artist who was quite active in painting on behalf of the State and left an artistic legacy behind him, particularly in places like Ballyroan church and in other areas.  All of the masonry work carried out in Se&aacute;n Keating Garden, which I would invite anybody who is passing Rathfarnham Castle to visit, was carried out by members of the Traveller community who were employed by South Dublin County Council.  South Dublin County Council is unique in that regard.</p>  <p>  There are, to the best of my knowledge, no Travellers employed in the Houses of the Oireachtas but I could be wrong.  One could go far to find Travellers employed in any Government Department.  If Joe Horan could do it in South Dublin County Council, there is no reason every chief executive of every local authority in this country could not do it.  That is a challenge and something I will sign up to.  It is one of the points that has been made.</p>  <p>  On living conditions, there is a particular Traveller accommodation in my constituency which I visited just before the Covid-19 pandemic.  It has one of the best views of Dublin and is on the foothills of the Dublin Mountains.  There are ten homes there but only five of them were occupied at the time that I visited for reasons beyond my understanding.  The people who live in that accommodation are denied that view of Dublin Bay, Dublin city, the Pigeon House and all of the other sites one can see because of the fortress wall built around it.  For the ten or 15 minutes I was there, I must say that I felt quite claustrophobic.  I asked our director of housing in South Dublin County Council, another very good man, would he not consider creating some kind of visual gaps in this wall so that when people walk out of the front door in the morning, they are not just looking at masonry but have a wider view to take in.</p>  <p>  Many people are going to dwell on particular points in the report but I just want to make a point about different local authorities carrying out and fulfilling their responsibilities.  In South Dublin County Council, since I was elected in 1999, all of the councillors - it was a 26 member body then - tended to stick together and support each other when it came to the provision of Traveller accommodation and as a result there was a good and balanced spread of Traveller accommodation in each and every electoral ward in the county.  We tended to spend the budget that was given to us.  That was not and is not the same in adjacent counties.  One of the scandals that was referred to earlier, but obviously it is changing, is of local authorities not spending the allocated amount they given for Traveller accommodation.</p>  <p>  One of the things I would like noted is that a local authority cannot do this by itself but it can assist settled residential communities by providing a framework and structure for both of these communities to meet because they never meet and yet their children meet and play together in school and do all of the things children do in school.  The adult communities, however, never meet and there is a real fear, bias and stereotyping that prevents them from meeting.  It is only through meeting and communicating that those stereotypes and biases will be broken down.</p>  <p>  I remember bringing this to a service we have in south Dublin, South Dublin County Mediation Service, as a particular issue had arisen, and the service was very enthusiastic about playing a particular role and getting involved in this.</p>  <p>  I see Deputy Leddin has arrived and I was speaking as though all of the time was mine.  My apologies to my colleague for that.  There are things I wanted to say around the mental health piece and so on but the point I wish to finish on is the Joe Horan piece.  If we had more chief executives in charge of county councils like the late Joe Horan, Travellers would be in a much better position as would society.</p></speech>

First, I welcome the chairperson of the committee, Senator Flynn, to the House.  She is an activist, a fighter for human rights and a role model not just for the Traveller community but for all society.  I welcome the visitors in the Visitors Gallery.  Senator Flynn spoke very eloquently.  I was watching the proceedings in my office and watched and heard the round of applause.  It was very well deserved.  She has produced a report that gets through to people like me, who are not of her community and who are privileged in our society.  From my reading of the report so far, and I will get through all of it, that is a fundamental success of the report.  I also commend the committee.  I understand it is a very hard-working committee.  Under Senator Flynn's guidance the committee conducted extensive research, visited sites around the country and engaged with stakeholders in the production of the report.</p>  <p>  From my reading of the report, I can see that Travellers have been moved to the edges of our society.  They have been physically separated and socially excluded.  They have been excluded from policy and decision making on issues that affect them.  They have been subject to persistent disadvantage and segregation.  The road to formal recognition was long, and the official recognition as an indigenous ethnic minority in 2017 was long overdue.  The progress to full inclusion and acceptance of Traveller identity and culture in this country is slow.  As Senator Flynn said, there have been numerous reports and studies produced which have highlighted the difficulties and challenges faced by the Traveller community.  Unfortunately, it is clear that these have not succeeded in improving conditions in Travellers' lives.  I believe this report, by making that point, will have an effect because Senator Flynn has captured that fundamental failure in how we have treated Travellers in this society since the foundation of the State.</p>  <p>  I read the executive summary.  I do not have time to go into it now, but it is incredibly compelling.  I encourage everybody to read it.  It is stark.  I could go on about the shorter life expectancy of Travellers, the suicide rates, the low educational attainment and the underspend of local authorities, at &euro;72 million, in the last decade.  This points to a fundamental failure of our society to help the Traveller community to integrate, succeed and flourish.  As I do not have any more time, I will conclude.</p></speech>

You made a very valid point and it is something I will personally take up with the Public Appointments Service.  We might encourage Deputies, Senators and the political parties to look to the Traveller community when they are employing staff.</p><p>I call Deputy Ellis.</p></speech>

It is great that everyone is here.  I also welcome this comprehensive report on the Traveller community.  Senator Flynn, as chairperson of the committee, has done a marvellous job in the committee.  She has been outstanding.  In addition, the members of the committee have been very good across the board.  The commitment to make this report possible has been massive and everybody has had a major input into it.  I thank all those who made submissions to the committee.  We had a very broad range of submissions from across the community, local authorities, Departments and groups and organisations as diverse as sporting organisations, the Prison Service, community activists and medical organisations and, most important, the Traveller organisations and their community.</p>  <p>  The voice of Travellers is rarely heard and rarely given a platform to express Travellers' concerns.  This committee has given members of the Traveller community a great opportunity to have a voice and to have a part in what is being produced.  The number of Traveller organisations that actively engaged with the committee is impressive.  They gave us a great insight into the difficulties that the community faces each day.  They were articulate in explaining their concerns and outlining what needs to be done for their community.</p>  <p>  This report follows other reports from previous years.  There are recommendations and observations in this report that are not necessarily new.  They have appeared in previous reports but were never acted on.  That is a real concern.  Good work has been done previously, but we found in our discussions with Traveller groups that the concerns they expressed in previous years still pertain today.  My hope is that the recommendations in this report will be fully implemented and followed up.</p>  <p>  We witnessed at first hand many of the issues in the different areas.  We visited various sites, such as Carrowbrowne in Galway, Spring Lane in Cork and St. Margaret's and Labre Park in Dublin.  I am more familiar with St. Margaret's and the halting site in St. Joseph's Park in Finglas.  The concerns I have seen in the halting sites in my constituency of Dublin North-West mirror the concerns throughout the country.  On occasions, it was very depressing to see some of the conditions and the problems facing the Traveller community.  We have to admit as a society that discrimination still exists.  It is common for many Traveller families and individuals to encounter discrimination daily.  That is totally unacceptable.</p>  <p>  There are 84 recommendations in this report.  It is up to us as public representatives and members of the Traveller community and of the community to push these recommendations and force the Government to act.  This is a very worthwhile report and I hope we get full support across the board.</p></speech>

I also acknowledge the ferocity in the call in the report to act on the 84 recommendations.  The Social Democrats will absolutely put our name to it.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that I will not be able to talk about all the elements of the report in five minutes.  As somebody who is passionate about education, I am particularly focused on that aspect.  However, I will briefly mention some of the statistics relating to health, mental health, suicide rates and housing inequalities that I believe encapsulate the structural violence that is faced every day by members of the Traveller community.  Life expectancy in the Traveller community is 15.1 years shorter for men and 11.5 years shorter for women than it is among the wider public.  The infant mortality rate for Traveller children is 3.6 times the rate for the general population.  Irish Traveller mothers are by far the most over-represented group who suffer perinatal deaths.  Despite this, there is little specific mention of this in the national maternity strategy and no mention of it in the national maternity strategy implementation plan.</p>  <p>  Some 90% of Travellers agreed that mental health problems were common in their community, and suicide is the cause of 11% of Traveller deaths, which is six times higher than is the case in the general population.  The report of the Ombudsman for Children, "No End in Site", highlighted the deplorable living conditions in one halting site, where there were approximately 140 people using toilets and washing facilities designed for 40 people, leading to stress, tension and, inevitably at times, conflict.  Today, it is even more disheartening, but not surprising, that a statement issued by the Council of Europe's European Commission against Racism and Intolerance states that there has been no major improvement in the living conditions of Travellers over the past three years.  The pandemic has encapsulated and placed a spotlight on many worrying inequalities, and in the intersectionality of that we see the oppression once more of the Traveller community.  It is very clear that this comes down to a form of structural violence, a system if not designed for but certainly apathetic to the plight of people in the Traveller community, and which for generations forced oppression on that community.</p>  <p>  I often speak in this Chamber about participation in, and access to, education.</p> <p>There are those who will never know how easy their journey through the formal education system has been and there are those who face so many barriers to participation that they are essentially pushed out.  Those who are pushed out are made to believe they are the problem and not that the system has failed them.  I often speak about the postcode lottery and how stark the differences are between wealthy areas and low-income areas.  That pales in comparison to the attrition rates for Travellers in education due to a system designed to oppress.  The 2016 census, the most recent census we have, showed that 13% of Travellers attained higher secondary level or more compared to more than 70% in the more general population.  A total of 17.7% of Traveller children have no education in comparison to 1.4% of the general population.</p> <p> In 2016 only 167 Irish Travellers had the opportunity to avail of a third level qualification.  As someone who has availed of access programmes I know in a small way what it is like to be considered a target group because of presupposed disadvantage.  I acknowledge how exceptional these 167 students are and the others who have gone through the journey since 2016.  They should absolutely not be the exception to the rule as is the case.  Everyone should have the chance to succeed and progress in our education system.  We cannot be satisfied with a few succeeding against the odds.  We have to change the very system itself.</p> <p> Given these facts, it always riles me when there is talk about the education system being a meritocracy.  As it stands, it has the main aim of reproducing and reinforcing existing inequalities.  The reality of these statistics demonstrates a culture in the State of low expectations for Traveller students.  Pavee Point has stated that funding for Traveller education supports were cut by 86.6% between 2008 and 2013, compared to a 4.3% cut in overall Government spending.  Much of this reduction was made in the name of mainstreaming without carefully monitoring the situation to ensure the same educational outcomes and interventions, with additional support if and when needed.</p> <p> There is a consistent idea that if we treat everyone the same despite their differences, this somehow represents true equality.  This is absolutely false.  It sets many people up to fail.  There is no inevitability that Traveller life, health, educational and employment outcomes should be so starkly contrasted to those in the wider population.  We can and must act to change this.  As Senator Flynn stated in the foreword of the report, recognising differences while being treated equally is what is being asked.  The 84 recommendations of the report need to be implemented.  Otherwise it will become inevitable by design and by will that the continued repression and structural violence faced by the Traveller community will continue.  The Social Democrats absolutely put our name to the 84 recommendations in the report.</p></speech>

It is particularly timely and fitting that it is discussed in the week we celebrate the fifth anniversary of the declaration of Traveller ethnicity.  It was extremely important, symbolically and otherwise, in the history of the State to officially recognise the contribution Travellers have made to our society.</p>  <p>  The report lays out in stark terms what we all knew before we read it, which is that there is a persistent and systemic problem in how the State treats an ethnic community within the State.  I agree with Deputy Leddin.  It is a report that deserves to be read because it gives a window and insight into the lived experiences of Travelling people in our society.  It is something we should acknowledge and face up to.</p>  <p>  Members will know that before I arrived in Leinster House, I was a primary school teacher.  Members might not know that in the primary school history curriculum for senior class groups there is a strand on continuity and change over time.  It has a suggested unit dealing with nomadism.  When I was putting together a unit of work on it for my sixth class group I could find any amount of material on African peoples who are nomadic and any amount of information on indigenous peoples in Australia who are still nomadic.  Throughout all of the textbooks available to me I could find one paragraph that dealt with the Travelling community in Ireland.  How must it feel as a child from the Travelling community in our classrooms to experience this level of invisibility in our society?  Try as I might, I could not find a good quality resource that I could bring to my sixth class to teach them about an ethnic group that exists in our own country.  In this regard I very much welcome the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill, to which Senator Flynn made reference.  The inclusion of Traveller culture and history in the school curriculum would have a huge positive effect.  Travellers would feel seen in our classrooms.  It would help us to celebrate in a positive way the contribution Travellers have made to our culture.</p>  <p>  I will take a slightly different approach because the Chair and members of the committee are present and they know the report in-depth with a detail that I do not have.  I want to apply the lens of the sustainable development goals to this area and the committee's report.  We wear the nice shiny badge and it looks very well on the lapel.  Often we think the sustainable development goals are something that happen overseas and far away from us.  We might have an idea of the 17 goals but I do not know how often we dig down into the sub-targets beneath the goals.  I propose to do this in the time I have.</p>  <p>  Goal No. 1, which calls for no hunger, sets out a target addressing poverty.  I do not for a moment suggest that every child who turned up in my classroom hungry in the morning came from the Travelling community.  This is absolutely not the case.  Often the backgrounds of the children who turned up hungry would surprise people.  We know there is an issue with poverty rates in our Travelling community.  This needs to be addressed.  I do not think we are meeting this sustainable development goal in our State.</p>  <p>  Goal No. 3 is about good health and well-being.  The report sets this out in the clearest terms, as Deputy Gannon stated.  We know that life expectancy for men in the Travelling community is 15.1 years shorter and for women it is 11 and a half years shorter than for people in the settled community.  We know about the infant mortality rate.  It is 3.6 times higher in the Travelling community then it is in the settled community.  This is completely unacceptable.</p>  <p>  We also know there is a mental health crisis in the Travelling community.  We know that suicide is the cause of 11% of Traveller deaths.  We know where it comes from.  We know Travellers live in a society where racism is ingrained and, worse, is accepted.  This should not be the case.  I can absolutely understand the pressure.  I know it is particularly young men in the Travelling community who take their own lives.  There are also wider health implications.  Mortality rates for cancer, cardiovascular disease and others causes of death are also significantly higher.  I do not believe we have vindicated this goal in the State.</p>  <p>  As for the goal on quality education, Senator Flynn serves on the education committee with me.  The report states Travellers have severely worse education outcomes than the general population with lower retention and completion rates.  We know education is the key to unlocking so much in our society.  It tackles all of the other things.  It tackles mental health issues.  It tackles persistent poverty rates.  It allows people to reach places they may not otherwise reach.</p>  <p>  Goal No. 6 is to ensure clean water and sanitation.  Recently I heard Senator Flynn speak on radio about wearing white socks to the school.  I thought about the temporary halting site on the Green Road, which is about half a mile from where I grew up.  I thought about the level of sanitation available there.  I thought about the difficulty for mothers to send their children to school clean.  When the children do not turn up to the school clean, what do they face?  How does that make them feel when they arrive?  That such a developed country does not meet these standards of sanitation and clean water for a section of our population is an indictment.</p>  <p>  Goal No. 8 is about decent work and economic growth.  With regard to labour market participation, the report found that just over 80% of Travellers in the labour force were unemployed.  A total of 43% of travellers reported discrimination when seeking employment, while only 17% of the public stated they would employ a Traveller.  This very much goes to what the Ceann Comhairle spoke about and the responsibility that rests on all of us.</p>  <p>  Goal No. 10 to be achieved by 2030 is to reduce inequalities by empowering and promoting the social, economic and political inclusion of all, irrespective of age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion, economic or other status.</p> <p>Senator Flynn said that, as she came in here, one of the ushers told her she very much deserved to be here on her own merit.  I have seen how she has contributed on the Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and how, with that lens and lived understanding, she has informed the work of the committee.  We see how the representation of diverse communities adds to these Houses of the Oireachtas.  I commend Senator Flynn on the excellent work she and all members of the committee have undertaken.  As Deputy Leddin said, it is a report that richly deserves to be read and which provides insight into a community that has so far been poorly represented in our democracy.</p></speech>

I am delighted to get a chance to talk about this report on the key issues facing the Traveller community.  I will quickly commend all of those who work in the Blanchardstown Traveller Development Group who have been on the ground working with vulnerable families and individuals, providing food parcels, personal protective equipment and support throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>  <p>  Just before the pandemic, Councillor Breda Hanaphy and I, along with Colette from the Blanchardstown Traveller Development Group, went around and visited the Traveller sites in Dublin 15, the Dublin West area.  I challenge any Minister to visit these sites and see the conditions people are living in.  To say they are appalling would be an understatement.  For a Traveller community, "temporary" means 20 years or more.  I will focus on one site I visited, located at St. Brigid's Lawn, which is ten minutes away from my house.  There is a litany of issues there, including emergency health and safety issues and other long-term issues.  St. Brigid's Lawn is on Porterstown Road in Clonsilla.  It has been 30 years since the residents were moved from a site on Grove Road in Blanchardstown, which is ironically now the site of the head offices of Fingal County Council.  Following long and difficult negotiations, a limited number of issues have been addressed but others have not.  The day units are nothing short of a disgrace.  The overcrowding on this site leaves it a Carrickmines tragedy waiting to happen.  </p>  <p>  These families live in St. Brigid's Lawn, which is covered in the Kellystown local area plan.  In the coming years, 1,000 new houses and apartments are to be built along with schools, community facilities and sports facilities.  I tried to use the local area plan, and Councillor Hanaphy tried to use the county development plan, to ensure that, when Kellystown is being developed, the existing extended family currently living in St. Brigid's Lawn, who are exceptionally well-integrated into the community, would be given the opportunity to continue to rear their families in their home area.  How many extra bays will be allocated to St. Brigid's Lawn?  One.  They are being given a space the size of a couple of car-parking spaces in a development of more than 1,000 units.  </p>  <p>  I would also like to address the issue of educational attainment in the Traveller community.  Over my years working in the school completion programme and Youthreach, I have seen the desire of so many from the Traveller community to stay in education but the hurdles they face are absolutely immense.  One of the cruellest cuts made during the austerity, which still gets to me, was the complete removal of every single visiting teacher for Travellers.  The whole scheme was completely abandoned.  Along with other measures such as the 37% cut to the school completion programme, of which I was part, this had an absolutely devastating impact on Travellers' involvement in education.  It again showed how quickly the Travelling community is kicked aside.</p>  <p>  I endorse the call for a national Traveller mental health strategy.  The figures for suicide among the Travelling community are absolutely beyond comprehension.  Some 56% of Travellers reported poor physical and mental health as opposed to 24% of the rest of the population.  Some 67% of men and 59% of women reported that their mental health was not good for one or more days in the past 30 days.  It is clear that this report comes at a very important time but it is just another in a litany of reports.  The most important word we need to hear with regard to this report is "implementation" 84 times.</p></speech>

I thank the Senator very much for the report.  It was very interesting to work with her.  Well done to her.  I was very interested in what Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh was saying about the curriculum in the schools.  The report is a really useful tool.  It is a rich collection of statistics all in the one place.  They jump at you because the statistics on all of these areas, employment, housing, health and education, really speak for themselves and explain, without requiring you to wonder about it, that there is absolutely systemic discrimination against Travellers in all aspects of our lives.  What Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh said about trying to find a reference to nomadic people in our curriculum speaks volumes.  Our curriculum is designed by people who work in the Department of Education, which is run by whoever is in this House at a given time.  If the Deputy found it difficult to find such a reference, there is obviously a systemic problem.  It does not just fall from the sky that there is no regard for the nomadic history of the Travellers in Ireland, nor does it fall from the sky that there is a high rate of suicide among Traveller men, that there is low educational attainment in that community or that 27% of Travellers leave school before the age of 13, which is a shocking statistic in this day and age.  It might not have been 40 or 50 years ago, but it is now.  There is a reason for those things.  They have a systemic history and there is a systemic reason for them.</p>  <p>  I experienced this as the chairperson of the Traveller accommodation programme in Dublin City Council.  I chaired that group for four or five years.  It was like bashing your head against a brick wall because you could get the co-operation of council officials verbally and in their body language - they would say "Yes" to this or to that and that they would do the other - but nothing was ever achieved because, on every level on which you tried to move forward, you were blocked from making the progress you needed to make.  We visited Labre Park in Ballyfermot as part of the committee's work.  That has actually gone backwards in terms of the promises that were made.  The residents were promised regeneration more than 20 years ago.  There was a promise that 40-odd houses would be regenerated.  It is now down to approximately 15 in 2022.  The residents are hopeful that they might get 15.  The consequence of this is that the council ends up saying that Travellers actually prefer settled accommodation and do not really want Traveller-specific accommodation.  Travellers are forced to choose or accept settled accommodation because the authorities are not delivering on the promise of Traveller-specific accommodation.  It is integration almost by oppression.  It is completely the wrong approach and it will not work.  It will contribute to poor mental health, bad outcomes and a lack of confidence and self-sustainability.  </p>  <p>  In every aspect of the work we do in giving political leadership, we need to be very conscious of that.  Never again should we see a political leaflet used to gather support or votes in any kind of election by undermining the Traveller community in the local area.  That should never happen again but it has happened.  There should be laws in places for cases where it does happen.  The report is really important but, as the previous Deputy said, acting on it is even more important because, if we do not do that, all we are doing is perpetuating the systemic racism that exists in our society that prohibits and inhibits change from the very roots.  </p>  <p>  It is also very important that we recognise on a historical level the role the Traveller community has played in enriching our culture, our music, our diversity and our language.  To set that aside and say it does not matter is to be soulless and to disregard what we, as a population, are made of.  The Traveller community and its culture is a great part of that.  There needs to be an aspect to this that looks into how to preserve and promote that culture and how to give more than just lip service to that culture by saying things like Travellers are wonderful actors, singers, dancers or whatever.  Fundamentally, if we do not change the conditions under which Travellers live and really take seriously the problems in all four categories highlighted in this report, we will be failing yet again.  I sincerely hope we do not do that.</p></speech>

Tuesday was the anniversary of the day we recognised Traveller ethnicity.  This has been a long struggle by the Travelling community to have their unique ethnic status recognised by the State.  We did so about five years ago.  While it was an important symbolic decision to make, very little has changed as a result of that.  We now need more than just symbolism and words.  To quote Senator Flynn, we need to put our name on it as Deputies and Ministers.</p>  <p>  The recommendations in the report cut across many Departments.  I will be writing to the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to include oversight of these recommendations.  How are we going to do this?  How are we going to put our name to it?  How are we going to keep an eye on it to ensure this work is being done?  This cuts across many committees.  I am sure other Deputies will be doing the same thing.  This affects the committees on housing, children, justice and education.  We need to make time in our workflow as the months go on to ensure we are putting our name to it.  The last thing we need to do is to allow the report to gather dust.</p>  <p>  I looked through some of the report's recommendations, thinking back through the work we did.  As Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith said, we went to Labre Park which is in my and her constituency.  Among those in Labre Park, the sense of betrayal and of being let down by Dublin City Council and the powers that be was palpable.  Some good community work was being done and there were some great people with very clear and articulate voices in the community.  However, their simple demands for a space that was not infested with rats were not being met by Dublin City Council.</p>  <p>  Senator Flynn referred to a &euro;72 million budget for housing that had not been spent.  If local authorities are not spending the budget, we need to take the responsibility away from them and ensure we are delivering.  If local authorities and councillors are not delivering on Traveller accommodation, we need to find ways to do that.  One of the recommendations is a national Traveller accommodation authority to take that power to push these things through and to ensure that whoever is in charge of the Traveller accommodation committee - whoever has replaced Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith on Dublin City Council - is not running into the same roadblocks and banging their head off the same wall.  It is all well and good for us to talk about it, but behind that as we all know, large numbers of Travellers are struggling without decent accommodation.</p>  <p>  Other Deputies have spoken about the knock-on consequences on health and mental health.  We need to find where those blocks are and get them out of the way.  If the blocks are our local authorities, then we need to get them out of the way and we need to take powers from them if that is what it takes.  It is only by recognising inequality that we can begin to address at.  Establishing a joint committee was definitely a good first step, but it is now up to the rest of us to keep pushing, to keep asking and to put our names to it.</p></speech>

I take the opportunity to congratulate Dr. Sindy Joyce who is taking up her role as lecturer at the University of Limerick.  They will be very lucky to have this outstanding academic put her particular and informed focus on Traveller, racial and ethnic studies.  No more than in any part of our community where women take their place and use their voice, we can make the future better for everyone.</p>  <p>  The report contains 84 recommendations, 18 of them relating to accommodation.  I would like to speak from my experience as a councillor on Kildare County Council local Traveller accommodation consultative committee, LTACC.  During my term on that committee, it was an all-women group of left-wing councillors who worked really well with the Travellers in our municipal districts.  We worked hard to spend our allocation on a particular site we were working on but we could not.  There was illness in the family, but in my experience the lack of urgency was the real illness that was deep at the heart of the official council level.  Given my experience, I wholeheartedly recommend recommendation 74 that a national Traveller accommodation authority be established to oversee Traveller accommodation policy and have an input into the Traveller accommodation programme in each local authority.  I would also like to see sanctions on local authorities that do not spend their allocation.  We need accountability.</p>  <p>  The D&aacute;il recognised Traveller ethnicity and we must acknowledge the nomadic aspect of their culture.  In terms of seasonal Travelling and meeting, it is beyond me how each county cannot designate an excellent facility where Travellers can come with the normal comforts of showers, electricity, bin collections, recycling etc.  If we are willing to do this for settled people, I do not see why we cannot do it for Travellers.  This was something I also put to the LTACC in Kildare County Council and he looked at me as if I had two heads.  I am ready to put my name to this report and we need to act on it.  Local authorities need to do their bit.  In my experience it is not the elected councillors who stop this but the officials at local authority level and they have to be held accountable for that.</p></speech>

I assure her that she is more than welcome and entitled to be in this House.  This is an incredibly important document and, as the committee Chair has said, we cannot let this become just another report.  We must put an end to the policies and practice that have failed the Traveller community.  That is why it is important to highlight the findings of this report and its 84 recommendations.  Among the many issues the Traveller community contends with are the scourges of discrimination, racism and exclusion.  The report outlines worse health outcomes than in the settled community, the mental health crisis being experienced, the lower education retention and completion rates and accommodation shortfalls.</p>  <p>  Regarding health, the committee heard that concerns over racism and discrimination underpin Travellers' lack of engagement with health services with 53% of Travellers fearing unfair treatment from healthcare providers.  That is why I support the committee's call for the national Traveller health plan to be published urgently and for an independent implementation body to be established to drive its delivery.  The Travelling community is also experiencing a mental health crisis.  A suicide rate of 11% was recorded in 2010 which is seven times higher than in the settled community.  Given the lack of engagement over fear of unfair treatment by healthcare providers, it is only right that the committee is calling for a ring-fenced health budget for the Traveller community within the HSE and for the appointment of a Department lead on Traveller health and mental health to monitor the progress, actions and initiatives across Departments.</p>  <p>  The report states: "The health status of Travellers is impacted by a range of social determinants, most severely by overcrowded and substandard living conditions."  It also outlines instances where the State and local authorities have failed to implement the measures to assist the Traveller community in this regard.  While I do not have time to go into it right now-----</p></speech>

I thank the committee for its report.  When we talk about the issues affecting the Traveller community, many people are shocked to learn of the stark realities facing it.  It is good to see the volume of statistics presented so clearly in this report.  I will refer to some of them.  Suicide is the cause of 11% of deaths in the Travelling community, which is an incredible figure.  According to information supplied to the committee by the Department of Health, the mortality rate for respiratory diseases is 7.5 times higher among male Travellers than it is in the general population and it is 5.4 times higher among female Travellers.</p> <p>This report also shows significant differentials in mortality from cancer, cardiovascular disease and health issues in general.  The Irish College of General Practitioners reports that, per 1,000 live births, the infant mortality rate in the general population is 3.9, whereas among Travellers it is 14.1, which is absolutely shocking and a terrible indictment of what is happening in this society.</p> <p> When it comes to mental health, is it any wonder the situation is so dire?  The State has in recent years undertaken a concerted effort to stop Travellers from travelling.  In 1963 we had the Commission on Itinerancy, which recommended assimilation of Travellers into the settled community.  In 1983 we had the Report of the Travelling People Review Body, which reported on the integration of Travellers into mainstream society but without properly recognising, supporting or promoting their cultural identity.  Then we had the housing Act of 1992 and the Roads Acts in the following years.  Those Acts allowed local authorities to remove Travellers from their camps at the roadside.  These are just some of the examples of the way in which the State has systematically tried to stop Travellers from travelling and to force them into housing.  This was a direct and concerted attack on Traveller culture.  Internationally, human rights abuses against minorities typically follow the same trend.  A minority is discriminated against and told they must become more like us if they are to be welcomed and included in society.  We in Aont&uacute; oppose this narrative wholeheartedly.  Travellers should be made to feel welcome and included in our country, society and democracy, and there should be no preconditions whatsoever to that inclusivity.  For years this State, through its laws and practices, has suggested that Travellers can be included in society only if they abandon their culture, and it is time we recognised that this is absolutely wrong.</p> <p> I have heard some fantastic speeches today, but speeches mean nothing unless there are changes in society.  I point especially to local authorities.  All the political parties represented here have influence over what is happening on local authorities throughout the country.  In recent years, I have done a lot of work looking at the funds that are spent on Traveller accommodation in each local authority around the country.  It is amazing that, at a time of housing crisis, many local authorities, year after year, have returned that funding to central government in Dublin.  I cannot understand how in a housing crisis there can be local authorities continuously returning funds to Dublin.  That has changed recently, and I had hoped that change would be positive.  The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has taken over that role in the Department, and the system is such that there is a central pot of money provided by the Government and local authorities can extract that money for Traveller accommodation.  However, now it is impossible, through freedom of information request or parliamentary question, to find out which local authorities are sending that money back and not drawing it down.  There is a problem with the culture on certain county and city councils where councillors do not want to engage on the topic of Traveller accommodation because they see it as divisive.  That shows cowardice on the part of some politicians who clearly want to keep their seats and feel there is an electoral cost to providing money to Traveller families for homes.  In Galway, we saw tensions build so much that some people set fire to a house that had been designated for a Traveller family.  After that incident, some of the politicians who were involved in stirring up that hatred went scrambling from that campaign pretty quickly.  It takes hatred to strike a match in that regard.  What happened was utterly shameful.  I commend Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who stood up very strongly against that hatred and stood with the Delaney family.</p> <p> I do not have long left to speak but I wish to remember a friend of mine, Michael McDonagh, who died recently.  Michael was a tireless advocate of Travellers' rights.  He was a founder and manager of Meath Travellers Workshop, and the contribution he made to society was huge, from helping Travellers engage with education to helping families who were struggling with life.  He was an absolute gentleman and will be sorely missed in Navan and the wider Meath area.  Our thoughts and prayers are with Nell and his children.  I know that Michael would have agreed with the key point that we need to improve the life experiences of Travellers but that we should do so in a way that does not mean they have to abandon their culture.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.361" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="15:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300041#RR00300"><p>I am pleased to be here to discuss the report of the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community.  I welcome Senator Flynn to the House.  We look forward to seeing her here more often, I hope.  I also wish to take a moment to acknowledge, as others have, Ronnie Fay, co-director of Pavee Point, who recently passed away.  On this day last month, so many gathered to say goodbye to her.  Ronnie was a tireless advocate for the Traveller community.  Knowing her and engaging with her since I became Fine Gael spokesperson for equality was a privilege.  It was a privilege to work with her and to have the benefit of her education and the depth of her knowledge and to learn from her.  I am sorry she is not here today to see this very important report discussed in the Chamber.</p>  <p>  The Traveller community has been all too isolated and neglected a part of our community in our society, often purposely pushed and bullied into the sidelines in ways that cannot be tolerated.  The Traveller community has faced discrimination, racism and an inequality of opportunity that I and so many others have taken for granted entirely.  The figures in this important report speak for themselves.  Other speakers have cited them but I wish to do so also.  The figures show much shorter life expectancies among Travellers, with 11% of Traveller deaths attributed to suicide and very important and serious concerns about health services and bullying in education settings.  The latter is one of the things I find most difficult.  I demand yet again that the Department of Education come forward with a serious and integrated national Traveller education strategy that seeks to address those issues, but I will come back to that.  The figures show cuts to Traveller-specific education supports and difficulties obtaining ongoing employment outside of the community outlined in the report, with one in three Traveller households living in accommodation with no sewerage facilities and a further one in five living with no piped water source.  They are stark figures.  Water, a basic need, is just not there for one in five Traveller households.</p>  <p>  We have spoken a lot about ensuring that our elected representatives are just that: representative of the people across our diverse shared communities in Ireland.  However, we simply have not delivered for all the diverse communities in Ireland.  I hope that the work ongoing in the Government, particularly this report, might give impetus and momentum to that work and help to deliver change.  There have been some positive changes.  In the two months leading up to Christmas, we heard from the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, who confirmed there was a full spend by local authorities of over &euro;21 million for Traveller accommodation in 2021.  That budget has increased in 2022.  There is the requirement on local authorities to spend that money, and there are penalties for failing to do so.  This report has been a particularly poor end-of-year report for local authorities, where year after year there has been that underspend.  As other Deputies have said, that money goes back to the central allocation.  However, I wish to mention briefly D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, which has worked hard to buck that trend of underspending.  That is fine to note, but that needs to be persistent and needs to be the basic standard and by no means the exception.</p>  <p>  A few days before this report was published, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, announced ring-fenced funding to support Travellers and the Roma community in higher education, a 50% increase on last year's funding, now totalling &euro;450,000.  I go back to my point about the Department of Education and the need to bring forward the national Traveller education strategy.  It has been in development for many years.  I know it is at the top of Pavee Point's list of priorities.  We have seen reports on children in the Traveller community in schools and how difficult it has been for them.  There is bullying and isolation.  We know there are teachers and principals who go out of their way to make children feel included, to make sure they have the services and supports they need, to try to identify, to stop and to have a zero-tolerance approach to racism and racist language in schools.  That is not, however, the universal experience of children in the Traveller community in schools, which is simply not good enough.</p>  <p>  There has been positive movement but we need to do more, as I said.  This is not just about funding and supports; it is about the way we do things.  It is about education in schools, educating people more broadly about racism and acknowledging that, unfortunately, it still very much exists in modern Ireland.  It is about a level of understanding and respect, which we have been lacking, to live side by side and in an integrated way with consideration and respect for all people in their communities, their identities, the rich traditions that come from the different communities and how they can only contribute to one another and add to the vibrant culture that is Ireland.</p> <p> I again acknowledge Senator Flynn and thank her for the work she has put into the special committee and the report.  As I walked back into Leinster House after lunch today, I met her partner and daughter.  The latter is too young to understand the impact of the work the Senator is doing, what it means and the legacy she is creating with that work and in being here.  I note the Senator's representative function for Traveller women, the Traveller community more broadly and women more broadly and what it says about inclusivity and respect for each other.  I am delighted to see her in the House.  I did not know that was going to happen and it is important that it has and that her daughter will see it in time.  I thank the Senator for her work on this and I hope it gives impetus to the Government to deliver in the way that is needed.</p></speech>

It is great to see her here and I hope it will not be the last time she is here.  I thank her and the committee for the important and timely report.  It includes 84 recommendations, all of which are important.  There are many facts in the report as well, as has been mentioned by many speakers.  I will not go back over them but they are important and it is good to have them on the record.  Unfortunately, they are facts that no country, government or parliament should be proud of in relation to a large part of its community and how that community has been treated.</p>  <p>  We have an obligation to make sure today is not repeated.  I do not want to come here in five years' time and have another report.  This week is the fifth anniversary of the declaration of Traveller ethnicity.  We should be coming here today to launch a report on the progress and what has been done to achieve the rights of Travellers across the country.  I hope in five years' time or less we will have a report like that.  It would be a tribute to the work Senator Flynn has done in the committee and to everybody in this House if that happened.  Sadly, I fear it will not but we will work to make sure it is.  The onus is on the Government to put in place policies and make sure funding is provided.  I know everybody on this side of the House will support that and ensure it happens.  However, the Government has to be willing to do it and have the balls to do it.  That needs to happen over the next couple of years.  Hopefully, it will and when we come here next time, we will talk about progress rather than restating recommendations that have been said before.  That will be vital.</p></speech>

She said she came from a background of wheeling and dealing and she used those skills to great effect today when she went way beyond her time.  Learning from that and building on those skills, maybe I will have the same success.  She is the first Traveller ever elected to the Houses of the Oireachtas, which is significant, the first to address the D&aacute;il, which is extremely significant, and her partner and child are here.  We usually say behind every good man is a very good woman, but it is clear that there is a very good man behind the Senator, keeping her going and giving her the confidence and determination to persist, because that is what is needed.  I welcome the distinguished visitors in the Gallery.  It is great to see it after Covid, and for many reasons.</p><p>The report makes 84 recommendations in four areas.  It is important to say the committee pays tribute and &quot;was struck by the resilience of the Traveller community in the face of decades of deprivation, poverty and discrimination&quot; and other things besides.  Then it gives the recommendations and statistics.</p><p>To put it in context, as Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n did to some extent, in 1963, we had a Commission on Itinerancy.  All of the facts were the same.  Nothing has changed except the language.  That commission identified itinerants, as they were called, as the problem.  it appealed to charity and religious organisations to deal with and remove the problem and the cases of hostility and antipathy by strict enforcement of the law to restore public confidence.  It wanted to invoke the influence of local clergy and local religious, charitable and welfare organisations to deal with the problem.  We continue to other the problem and when we other differences rather than cherishing them, it is at a great cost to our democracy.  That is what we are asked here in three languages, namely, English, Irish and Cant:</p> <blockquote> 	Difr&iacute;ochta&iacute; a aithint le linn caitheamh linn go cothrom.  Is &eacute; cothrom na f&eacute;inne amh&aacute;in at&aacute; uainn.<br /><br />Recognising difference while being treated equally.  All we want is fairness. </blockquote>  <p>If we look from 1963 to now, which is almost 60 years, we are faced with the same range of problems.  We have to ask ourselves as public representatives what is going on.  We deplore what is happening in local authority but most of us were in local authorities.  I echo what Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith said.  I spent five years on a Traveller accommodation committee.  It was the worst experience of my life.  I did not go back on it.  I did my best during those five years but it was extremely difficult to cope with the duplicitous language and the failure to act.  Traveller representatives on the committee were not free to speak because they were utterly dependent on the local authority.  I would never go back to that position.</p><p>We have failed to comply with our legal obligations.  We talk about sanctions but we have done all of this already.  All the city and county managers have powers to act.  We should not be in a position where accommodation is not being rolled out.  </p><p>I am not sure how much more time I can wheedle but as long as I can go on, I will.  The four areas were health, education, housing and economy.  There were contributions from Galway from the Galway Traveller Movement and Bounce Back Recycling.  It is apparent that there are positive solutions to all of this.  Let us stop dealing with something as a problem.  Let us cherish the differences and go forward.</p><p>I agree with all of the recommendations but one that sticks out, besides the accommodation, is the one in relation to mainstreaming this in our education system.  That could be easily done.  To echo the words of my colleague, I wish we were here to celebrate the implementation of that declaration.  I have exhausted the Ceann Comhairle's patience.  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Ceann Comhairle.</p></speech>

I welcome Senator Flynn and thank her for being here and for chairing the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community, which was established in September 2020 to complete the work initiated by the previous joint committee, in which Collete Kelleher played a major role.  We looked at four areas: physical health, mental health and suicide rates, in respect of which there are 21 recommendations; school completion rates and educational attainment, particularly at second and third level, compared with the settled community, which includes 23 recommendations; labour market participation, having regard to the unemployment rate of 80% among Travellers, containing 22 recommendations; and access to housing and accommodation, including Traveller-specific accommodation, in the context of the significantly higher homelessness rate among Travellers compared with the settled population, which included 18 recommendations.</p>  <p>  Over the years there have been numerous reports which sit on shelves gathering dust on various areas, particularly the Traveller community.  We want to see this report implemented.  That will be the test of this debate.  Any public representative - including local councillors, to whom we should bring this - by agreeing to this is behoved to implement it in a positive way and to at all times support the Traveller community through the recommendations of the report.  That would mean all of us playing a positive role around the Traveller community and not undermining said recommendations.</p> <p>This is the first time we have seen Cant, the language of the Traveller community, used in a report.  That is important, and a milestone from that point of view.<br/><br/>I mentioned that there were four areas.  Some of these recommendations could have been implemented by now.  I refer, for example, to the recommendations on health.  Recommendation 6 states, &quot;The National Traveller Health Action Plan should be published as a matter of urgency and an independent implementation body, with ring-fenced budgets to drive delivery and implementation, should be established&quot;.  Has that been done? Is it in train?  I ask the Minister of State to respond on this point.<br/><br/>Recommendation 22, on education, is a call to: &quot;Restore the dedicated funding to Traveller Education cut in the 2011, 2012 period in full and ring fence it to provide supplementary educational support for members of the Traveller Community where they would benefit from same.&quot;  Has that been done?  It is very simple.  This report was published five months ago.  Has that measure been put in place or set in train?  Perhaps the Minister of State could comment on this as well.<br/><br/>Recommendation 47 relates to employment and states: </p><blockquote>	There should be formal positive action measures for recruiting Travellers to the public sector.  These programmes need to be led, and funded, from central government.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER, should be the lead department as it fits within [its] remit. </blockquote> <p>Has that been done?  It is something that is simple and straightforward and that we could implement quickly.  Will the Minister of State also comment on this point?<br/><br/>Recommendation 74, on housing, states, &quot;A National Traveller Accommodation Authority should be established to oversee the development and implementation of Traveller accommodation policy&quot;.  Has that been done?  Is it in train?  Can a report be brought to us on this aspect?  Equally, recommendation 81, also on housing, states: &quot;Cena should be funded to advise social housing landlords on the design, location and management of Traveller-specific accommodation projects.&quot;  Cena is a housing body that can play a leading role in respect of Traveller housing accommodation.<br/><br/>Those of us on the committee visited several sites in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  When I visited the site at Spring Lane with my colleagues, it was appalling to see people having to live in the conditions they were in.  On the other hand, when we walked into those people's homes, we were welcomed and the pride in and running of those homes was brilliant.  That is not being patronising, recognising the conditions they were living in.  It behoves this Government and this D&aacute;il to ensure that the areas and the homes where members of the Traveller community are living are up to standard.  I mention the National Traveller Women's Forum, which sent an email concerning this debate.  I thank the organisation for doing that.<br/><br/>President Higgins was at National University of Ireland Galway to mark Traveller Ethnicity Day on Tuesday.  A report on the occasion stated: &quot;On a day when the long and sometimes difficult journey of travellers was being honoured, he said it was vital that society would never be slow to point to what has yet to be achieved.&quot;  I will conclude on this point.  I ask the D&aacute;il to implement these recommendations.We should perhaps get a report on the progress of the implementation of all these recommendations.  We could invite the relevant Ministers in, maybe every eight months, to update us on how they stand.</p></speech>

In the spirit of where we find ourselves, running ahead of time and with flexibility, Deputy McAuliffe is here and wishes to contribute.  I think we should hear from him for a minute or two.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.370" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1568" speakername="Paul McAuliffe" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300043#TT00300"><p>Perhaps I was too timid.  I had four minutes at the end of Deputy Carroll MacNeill's contribution and I should have spoken up then.  I promise that only two and half minutes were unused, so I do not think I will be wasting the House's time.</p>  <p>  As a member of this committee, I welcome the publication of this report.  I commend Senator Flynn on the work she has done.  Her election as our Chair sent an important message.  It was also an important decision for the committee because of the way that she chaired our meetings.  I take this opportunity to thank her for that.  I also acknowledge Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, who is passionate about this issue, and I know other Members will agree with me on this point.</p>  <p>  The findings in the report are stark.  The lack of progress on the key issues affecting the Traveller community suggests there is merit in the idea that there should be a permanent Oireachtas committee on this matter that could oversee the Government's work more regularly.  In the absence of such a committee, the responsibility falls on right across the board.  It falls on the members of the Government, on the Ministers, on the Chairs of each of the committees, on each of us as members of the Houses and on the chief executives and members of the local authorities.  I refer in particular to the recommendation that Part 8 powers be removed from local authority members.  There is a clear warning here.  Members of local authorities moan about powers being removed from them.  In that context, here is a warning to them to take brave decisions on Traveller accommodation in their communities and then powers will not be removed.  It is important that we take action in this regard, such as examining the provision of traveller accommodation.  It is welcome that the allocation in this area was fully spent last year.  That had to do with structural changes as well, which have enabled local authorities to access funding year-round.  Small adjustments like that can deliver real change.</p>  <p>  The mental health issue is probably the one that strikes me the most.  Suicide rates among males in the Traveller community are six times higher than among their counterparts in the general population.  This is not specifically referenced in material in front of me, but I refer to the level of addiction as a result of mental health issues, and we know that those issues are connected in many ways.  I have spoken to the Minister of State with special responsibility in this area, Deputy Peter Burke, to tell him that it is important that we implement every one of the recommendations regarding mental health.</p>  <p>  We talk about Ireland being a republic and about treating all the children of the nation equally, in the broadest sense of the word.  There is no more blatant and brazen form of discrimination in this country than that to which the people in the Traveller community are subjected.  It is discussed in open conversation, with no embarrassment.  It is utterly unacceptable and, inevitably, it impacts every part of policy delivery.</p></speech>

Before I call Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, and then the Minister of State to respond, I also want to make some remarks.  I apologise to Senator Flynn for not being here when the debate started a little earlier than was scheduled.  I also thank her, and former Senator Colette Kelleher before her, for the outstanding work they have done.  The statistics published in this report cast a shadow of shame on our State and on our society.  There is no escaping that reality.</p><p>I have had discussions on this with Senator Flynn, and we have agreed that we will have an implementation group established in Leinster House.  The Clerk of the D&aacute;il has already engaged with the Secretaries General of relevant Departments to ensure that we can have ongoing engagement to monitor the implementation of the 84 recommendations which have been brought before us.  In addition, we have agreed, and I have given my personal undertaking, that we will re-establish and continue the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis until the work of the special committees currently being established to examine surrogacy and autism have completed their work.  After that, we will formally re-establish the Joint Committee on Key Issues affecting the Traveller Community as an ongoing standing committee of these Houses.</p><p>Having commenced this work in the Thirty-second D&aacute;il and seen it reach this level of progress in the Thirty-third D&aacute;il, I hope that the Thirty-fourth D&aacute;il will continue to have such a committee so that we can move these recommendations forward and not have a report gathering dust on a shelf, but rather have regular assessments of its implementation.  The idea proposed by Deputy Joan Collins, namely, that we should come in here regularly, perhaps twice a year, and debate the implementation of the recommendations of the report, is a very good one.</p></speech>

I am aware that only for his initiative, none of this would have ever happened.</p> <p>I also thank Senator Eileen Flynn for the work she did as Chair.  She brought invaluable knowledge to this subject with her contribution and expertise that many of us who have not lived that experience lack.  It was a great privilege to be Vice Chair of this committee, which worked across parties in a very cohesive and agreed fashion.</p> <p> I say to all my friends in the Traveller community that reports do not get things done and they are only the first steps in laying out what needs to be done.  There is much that must be done.  As part of the work of this committee, we visited Labre Park, St. Margaret's Park and four sites in Galway.  I was familiar with the sites in Galway but I was not familiar with the other sites.  I can speak to the public realm or exteriors of the properties and but I cannot talk about conditions inside those properties.  On the exteriors, the nearest comparison I can make is to Soweto in South Africa, and we think we live in a First World country.</p> <p> It is fair to say, as has been highlighted, that the traditional approach of a Government to this is that it is a problem to be solved.  I have always seen Travellers as a community to be cherished and we must give real equality to that community.  A comprehensive survey was done on attitudes on pluralism and diversity in Ireland.  That professional work was published by Dr. Miche&aacute;l Mac Gr&eacute;il, a sociologist in Maynooth, in 2011 as part of a long series where he could tell us the attitude towards every group in Irish society.  It is interesting that he dedicates the book as follows: "This book is dedicated to the emancipation of the Travelling people, Ireland's indigenous ethnic minority".  One of the most striking statistics was as follows.  With the Traveller people, the results are good and bad.  On one hand, a considerable minority, 18.2%, would refuse citizenship to Travellers.  On the other hand, tolerance towards Travellers is indicated by an increasing number of people who would welcome a Traveller into their family.</p> <p> Let us consider the first figure, which at 18% means that nearly one in five people we meet in the street believes Travellers should not have citizenship.  Half of those feel they should be deported.  Those are scientific data and reading the totality of the book and our attitude towards various nationalities around the world, one sees that the group we respect least are an indigenous group.</p> <p> The other point that is absolutely extraordinary concerns demographics.  In the population as a whole, approximately 27% are in the group of people aged one to 19 but in Travellers that is 52%.  How are there so many young people in the Traveller communities?  It is because there are so few older people when compared with the rest of society.  If we consider people aged between 60 and 79, the figure for society in general is 12.6% but in the Traveller community it is 3.7%.  That is approximately a quarter of the percentage for society as a whole.  If we consider people aged over 80, the figure for society in general is 2.7% but it is 0.3% for the Traveller community, or a tenth, give or take, of the percentage for society in general.</p> <p> Do I believe those figures are true?  Do I believe these attitudes are still valid in our society?  Yes, I do.  Some time ago a house was purchased by Galway City Council for Travellers who had been living in the county area for over 20 years.  Mysteriously, in the middle of the night it was burned down.  When the council went to rebuild the house, there were all sorts objections lodged in the planning process.  That tells us something about the prevailing attitudes.</p> <p> There is much work to be done and we cannot afford to be sitting on it.  As the Chairperson indicated in her foreword, over the years there have been numerous reports and studies produced that have highlighted the extreme difficulties and challenges faced by the Traveller community.  Unfortunately, it is clear they have not succeeded in improving conditions in Traveller lives.  When we wrote the report, it was not for debating but for action.</p> <p> I commend the Ceann Comhairle on his comments and I look forward to having a standing committee.  We must be on this every week because new matters will arise that we have not covered in this report.  Otherwise we will not see change.  I have been 30 years in politics and I have worked on this matter but do I see much change?  Do I still see people in my constituency in totally unacceptable accommodation?  The answer is "yes".  Do I see people who cannot get replacement caravans because the city council has stated it can only afford its share of four of them, despite 20 or 25 of them in absolutely disgraceful conditions?  As I have often asked, would you sleep in a freezing caravan that is damp every night of the week just because somebody in this very wealthy State has said the council can only afford four of them this year?</p> <p> We have much work to do.  The Oireachtas has work to do.  It is time we did it and dealt with the way society has treated Travellers.  From experience, I know it is time for us not only to have a lead Minister with clout with responsibility for Traveller matters but that Minister should have a dedicated fund, similar to what is being given to the islands, for example.  If somebody in another Department is not doing the required job, that Minister should be able to step up with a fund, intervene and make it happen.  The time for prevarication and delay is over.  It is now a time for action.  I hope this report will result not in more debate but in action to improve lives.  That is the kind of action I have not yet seen in my time in politics.</p></speech>

Of course she deserves to be here and it is her voice that is effecting change as a Senator, a member of the Traveller community, as an advocate and the expert Chair of the special Oireachtas committee.  I compliment the members of the committee here in the D&aacute;il, as well as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v as Vice Chairperson.  I have no doubt Senator Flynn is inspiring other members of the Traveller community to become public representatives, and the more public representatives there are here in the Oireachtas speaking on behalf of the Traveller community, the better.  That is how change will be effected in a real way.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the comments of the Ceann Comhairle about welcoming more of the Traveller community to the Oireachtas here in employment.  I note he said he would take that up.  To the families of Ms Ronnie Fay and Mr. Michael McDonagh, I also send condolences.  I note the work done by them.  I also welcome our visitors to the Gallery and acknowledge their professional advocacy.  I hope they will take some comfort from all the words said here today.  As Senator Flynn has said, those words must be matched with actions and there must be implementation of the recommendations.  As Senator Flynn has also said, we must move forward together in order to achieve this.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt we are all in agreement that Travellers and Roma continue to suffer from negative stereotypes and discrimination.  It is clear from the report that although there has been some improvement, much more needs to be done to ensure full equality of opportunity for Travellers and Roma and remove barriers to their full and equal participation in Irish life.</p>  <p>  The Department of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has an important funding role and it provides funding to support a range of activities linked to the national Traveller, Roma and inclusion strategy, and to provide core funding to a number of Traveller and Roma organisations.  Under that strategy his Department has secured a budget of &euro;5.659 million for 2022 and an additional &euro;880,000 in dormant account funding has also been secured.</p> <p>I also note the importance placed on education, the impact it has on a person's life to achieve their potential and on their ability to secure employment.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to develop a Traveller education strategy.  This will include early years, primary, secondary and third level education.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman will engage with the Ministers, Deputies Foley and Harris, in progressing this commitment.</p> <p> I believe as well that the issue of cultural identity is extremely important.  There is a need for broader cultural awareness of Traveller identity and increased visibility of Traveller culture and heritage.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has worked to advance projects that increase the visibility of Traveller culture and heritage.  A project is also being progressed with the National Museum of Ireland to develop an online portal to the Traveller culture collections.  I am aware that work is under way by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment arising from an audit of the curriculum in respect of Traveller culture and history with a view to developing opportunities for teaching about that history and culture and developing resources for use in schools.</p> <p> On behalf of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, I thank the committee for its report and reiterate the Government's commitment to continuing its work on ensuring full equality of opportunity for Travellers and Roma and removing the barriers to their full and equal participation in Irish life.  For any individual questions that came up today, I will pass them on to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman.</p></speech>

Let us hope that today will be remembered as an historic day in the life of the Traveller community in Ireland.  It is also an historic day in the life of this Chamber because it is the first time in my recollection that a Member of the Upper House came all the way down to this Chamber to present a report to us.  Senator Flynn is making history in more than one way.  It behoves us all also to thank Leo Bollins, the clerk to the committee, for the sterling work he did on its behalf.</p>  <p>  That concludes our statements on the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Key Issues Affecting the Traveller Community.

It is an important public consultation.  Next week is International Women's Day.  Today, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Gender Equality began its work with public hearings to advance the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly.</p>  <p>  Today I want to take the opportunity to remember the most extreme end of inequality for women, that is their deaths at the hands of men, femicide that persists in our society and that we felt so keenly in January with the loss of Ashling Murphy.  At that stage, on 19 January, I began to put on the record of the D&aacute;il the names of the women who had lost their lives over the past 27 years.  Today I will read into the record the names of the 17 women who lost their lives in the month of February going back over the 27 years and the 15 women who lost their lives in the month of March going back over the 27 years.</p>  <p>  In the month of February, those women were Fiona Sinnott, Catherine Hegarty, Rachel Sandeman, Nancy Nolan, Mary Whelan, Cliona Magner, Natasha Gray, Lindita Kukaj, Siobhan Kearney, Melanie McCarthy McNamara, Sarah Regan, Olivia Dunlea O'Brien, Deirdre Keenan, Sonia Blount, Joanne Ball, Mary O'Keeffe, Sharon Bennett.  I also want to mention Marie Greene and Ciara Breen who went missing on the same day 14 years apart and who have never been found.</p>  <p>  In the month of March over the last 27 years 15 women who lost their lives in this way.  They also deserve to have their names recognised in the D&aacute;il as part of our work to try to end this practice of violence against women.  They were Mary Molumby, Sandra Tobin, Mary Callinan, Sylvia Shiels, Layla Brennan, Liu Qing, Joan Power, Rosie Collinson, Celia Bailey, Katarzyna Barowiak, Noreen Kelly Eadon, Deirdre McCarthy, Mary Dargan, Nicola Collins, Cathy Ward.</p>  <p>  All of these women were voiceless in the violence that occurred against them.  They were voiceless in their deaths.  They were voiceless in the manner of the reporting of their deaths and how their stories were handled by media afterwards.  They were voiceless in the legacy that was left behind them in what had happened to their families.  All of this happened without any of their consent and all of it happened to them.  I want to continue to take the opportunity to give them the dignity of their names read into the Official Report even if we can do nothing to give them their voices back.  </p>  <p>  The work of the third strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is so important.  It is so welcome that it is now at the stage of being open to public consultation.  I have seen criticism that this consultation delays the strategy but it is so important.  If we cannot have the input of society into this strategy prior to its finalisation, it is not going to be as effective as it has the opportunity to be.  We saw across Ireland the hundreds of thousands of people who expressed a view on violence against women, who came out and stood in solidarity with the family of Ashling Murphy.</p> <p>We need to continue that work and not forget it.  At the time, it was a big issue here in the D&aacute;il and a big event on media that was given a lot of coverage.  As we said then, it is about not letting that focus go, not dropping the issue and continuing to raise and follow it up consistently to ensure Ashling's death is not another death of a woman that is on the cover pages for a week only for interest to fall away afterwards.  Will the Minister of State, on behalf of the Government, provide an update on this matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.386" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="16:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300046#WW00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I know it is something that is close to her heart and on which she has been advocating for a significant period.  It is quite poignant to hear the names of the women who died in February and March over the past 27 years.  It is good that their names have been put on the D&aacute;il record, which is some sort of acknowledgement.  As the Deputy correctly said, they have been made voiceless in myriad different ways.  I agree with her that following Ashling Murphy's death in particular, we must keep the momentum going and keep raising this matter in the House.  I very much welcome that the subject has been raised as a Topical Issue matter.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice would like to assure the Deputy that she is committed to tackling domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in all its forms and to ensure people, particularly women and vulnerable persons, feel and are safe in our communities.  As the Deputy will know, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, along with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integrity and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, commissioned an independent audit of how responsibility for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is segmented across Government.  Separately, Tusla has conducted a review of accommodation services for victims of such violence.  Both of these audits were carried out with a view to determining what efficiencies and improvements need to be introduced in how we manage domestic, sexual and gender-based violence responses and services.  On foot of the audits and following extensive consultation with the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integrity and Youth, it has been agreed that the Department of Justice will now have responsibility for service provision in the area of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence while also continuing to lead on policy in this area.</p>  <p>  Work is under way on how this will be structured and I understand further details will be announced in the coming weeks.  As part of this, the establishment of a new statutory agency to address domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is under consideration.  In tandem, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, has been working on the new national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, in partnership with those who work on the front lines.  Their voices will be critical to its success and will help to ensure the new strategy is targeted, comprehensive, effective and, most importantly, victim-centred.  It will be the most ambitious plan to date in this area and will be structured around the four pillars or goals of the Istanbul Convention, namely, prevention, prosecution, protection and co-ordinated policies.  It will set an overall goal of zero tolerance in our society for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may have seen, the week before last, that the Minister briefed those working in the sector on the progress of the strategy and shared the draft document with them.  She also launched a wider public consultation on the new strategy on 17 February.  That public consultation is in the form of an online survey that asks people's views on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and what they would like to see in the new strategy.  For example, it asks what people think the emphasis of the strategy should be, how we can improve supports for victims, how we can better educate our young people and how we can change attitudes across society.  It also asks, among many other questions, whether our laws are strong enough to provide justice for victims.  The consultation is available through the Department of Justice website and there already have been more than a thousand submissions.  I am sure the Deputy will join me in encouraging everyone to engage and make their views known on this important topic before the consultation ends next Thursday.  It is a short enough consultation and we encourage everybody, male or female, to give us their views.</p>  <p>  The finalised strategy is expected to be brought to Government this spring.  When published, it will be accompanied by a detailed action plan setting out how specific actions under these aims will be achieved, who is responsible for them and the timeframe for delivery.</p></speech>

I note that some of the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on gender equality are already being met by the steps being taken towards the delivery of a strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  That is very important.</p>  <p>  What lies behind my reading out of the women's names is an effort to identify the circumstances of each of them, who they were, where they were and what happened to them on the day they died.  We have been putting that information on Instagram to tell their stories and try to keep the momentum going on this issue.  For my staff and the people who work around me, it is a deeply distressing issue to be dealing with every day.  We do not regret beginning this work but it is important to acknowledge that it takes an emotion toll even on us, as far removed as we are.  We are trying to keep telling the stories of the women and families.  I named 32 women, each of whom had a family who are now without her and have been for up to 27 years.</p>  <p>  At the end of January, a walk took place with the family of Urantsetseg Tserendorj from where she worked in the International Financial Services Centre to her home in Dublin 1, just off Talbot Street.  When I went on that walk on a rainy January night, what was so striking was just how short it is.  It is a short and ordinary route and the attack took place in the late evening.  I still cannot get over how short and ordinary a route it is.  To lose one's life in such a normal course of events is absolutely appalling.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this issue, which I will continue to do throughout the year in an effort to maintain the momentum of remembering these women, recognising that the Minister for Justice and her Department are doing the work from a policy perspective.  Much of this is about changing attitudes and we cannot do that if we allow this issue to slip off the front pages and into the shadows until something else happens.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.388" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="16:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300046#WW00400"><p>Again, I commend the Deputy on her work in this area.  I have seen her output on social media, including Instagram, and how effective it can be.  She is right about the effect on people, even if we are just reading about it.  Even the fact that so many women have lost their lives takes an emotional toll.  The Deputy's work is good because it keeps their memory alive and gives credence to the momentum we are trying to maintain.  Regarding the walk she mentioned, fear of harassment and violence should never be normalised.  For those of us who have spoken about being victims in whatever way that transpired, it takes an emotional toll as well.  Those stories are really important because this can happen to anybody, whether on a long or short walk, in the daytime or at night.  The sort of gratuitous violence that can occur in Irish society is really regrettable and should not happen.</p>  <p>  One of the ways to raise awareness and change attitudes, as the Deputy spoke about, is for us, as women, to talk about the issue here in the D&aacute;il Chamber and also to get men involved in talking about it.  The work done by the Government is obviously also important.  The Ministers, Deputies McEntee and O'Gorman, are at pains to tell us about the work they are doing and that work is significant.  They already have substantially increased the budget for 2022 for supports for dealing with domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and measures to confront and deal with the types of issues that are happening at a societal level.  There is also significant investment being made by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na more generally and through other mechanisms as well.  The consultation on the strategy concludes next Thursday and people need to make their views known.  This is a real opportunity to get it right and transform society in order that women who want to go about their normal daily business can fail safe in the same way that men do.  Obviously, men also can suffer from violence, but it is predominantly women who experience this particular type of violence.  That is what this strategy endeavours to achieve and we hope it will be a success in ensuring we have a shared goal of a zero-tolerance approach to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.</p></speech>

I doubt that this is even margin-of-error funding given that the scheme is to cost &euro;54 million.  It seems that the Department of Rural and Community Development should put a scheme to the Minister.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.391" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="16:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300047#XX00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I am taking this topic on behalf of the Minister for Community and Rural Development, Deputy Humphreys.</p>  <p>  The sustainability of the communities on our offshore islands is a core objective of the Government, as set out in its rural development policy.  The policy acknowledges the importance for island communities of access to reliable, safe and affordable connectivity services to and from the mainland.  Contracts for these services are procured by the Department of Rural and Community Development on the open market through the procurement process.  This ensures that all providers are treated equally and that the selection process is fair and transparent to all.</p>  <p>  The fare reduction scheme recently announced by the Department of Transport will see an average reduction of 20% on transport services managed by the National Transport Authority, NTA, on its behalf.  The scheme covers all bus and train services on all NTA networks.  It is important to note, however, that all other subsidised transport services managed by the Department of Transport, such as the public service obligation, PSO, air services to Donegal and Kerry, are not covered by the scheme.  I understand the Deputy has received a communication in this regard.  Similarly, the subsidised transport services to the offshore islands, which services are managed by my Department, do not qualify for the scheme.  Unlike the services managed by the NTA, offshore islands have a mix of subsidised and non-subsidised transport services.  The introduction of a fare reduction scheme for subsidised services would put private operators at a disadvantage.  They would be entitled to seek legal redress if a subsidised service were to get a competitive advantage, such as subsidised fares, on a designated route.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, many subsidised operators provide extra sailings beyond what is subsidised, and those extra sailings would not be entitled to the reduction.  A fare reduction scheme that applied to subsidised sailings only would create fare inconsistencies for both service operators and users.  All the contracted air, ferry and cargo services managed by the Department are procured according to an open and fair procedure.  Providing a fare reduction scheme for chosen suppliers would undermine those procedures and be inherently unfair.  As any fare reduction scheme for the subsidised service to the islands would have to be implemented in a manner that would be fair to all providers, the Department has no plans to proceed with a scheme at this time.  However, I note what the Deputy has said and will put his comments to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.  I acknowledge what the Deputy has said about equality for islanders and will also relay that sentiment to the Minister.</p></speech>

Tenders are sought for services to the islands.  According to the tender arrangements, only the islander fare is dictated by the Department.  Tourists and non-islanders visiting an island pay at the commercial rate.  All I seek is that the 20% apply to the islander fare, which is fixed as part of the contract.  Since it would be foolish for an islander to pay a non-subsidised fare to an island, because it would probably be much higher, most of the Minister of State's answer is totally misinformed regarding how the system works.  That the Department is more misinformed regarding how the system works than I am is hard to understand.</p>  <p>  What I am asking for today is quite simple: do not touch the tourist fares to the islands or those of people like myself, who would pay at the commercial rate, which is much higher than the islander rate, and reduce the specific islander rate, which rate alone is specified in the PSO island contracts.  I presume that if I take a private bus or hire one on the mainland and it is not running one of the NTA bus services, the NTA will not say there is unfair competition if the fare on the NTA bus route is 20% cheaper.  Plenty of buses in this country are not subsidised or subject to a PSO and, therefore, the Chinese wall put up here today is totally false.  From what I have said to the Minister of State, I hope I have demolished the logic of her argument and that somebody will revert to me with a much more rational argument as to why what is very simple can be done and equality may prevail.</p></speech>

I hear what he is saying about equality for islanders and note his comments on the reduction and the PSO contract.  I will pass them on to her.  I understand that what the Deputy is suggesting would create fare inconsistencies for the subsidised operators as not all sailings are subsidised.  As the Deputy can appreciate, that is the information I have to hand.  I understand there is a 20% reduction for NTA fares and understand the Deputy's argument about inequalities in that regard.  Again, I will mention the matter to the Minister, whom I am sure will revert to the Deputy in due course.</p></speech>

I was told by the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine that his Department was working as part of a cross-departmental group evaluating the use of peat in the commercial horticultural sector.  At that point, the problems were evident.  The scandalous situation whereby huge quantities of Irish peat had been exported was to be replaced by an equally scandalous situation whereby peat would be imported.  In September 2020, I was informed by the current Minister, Deputy McConalogue, that following the report of the cross-departmental group, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, had set up a working group to consider the impacts on the sector.  Then, over the following ten months, while a sector with a farm gate value of almost &euro;500 million and supporting nearly 18,000 jobs held its breath, I submitted countless questions to Ministers, including the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Environment, Climate and Communications, and Housing, Local Government and Heritage, seeking basic information that farmers were crying out for.  I asked whether just transition funds would be made available to offset increased costs.  I asked if any Minister was taking action to ensure a regulatory framework that would allow for peat harvesting would be put in place.  I also asked if the report of the working group would be published, when it would be published and why it was delayed.  I must say that trying to get any information from the Ministers was like trying to get blood out of a stone.  In fact, most of the information I got came from media reports.  At that time, the question I was most commonly but quietly asked was where the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine was in all of this.</p>  <p>  I have to ask that question again now.  I think the Minister is in the other House right now.  Over the past month, Sinn F&eacute;in has sought D&aacute;il debates on this issue each and every week and each request has been refused by Government.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine sought a joint hearing with three Ministers that have responsibility in this area, namely, the Ministers for the Environment, Climate and Communications, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Noonan.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister of State indicated they would attend only if the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications was present.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications refused to attend, so no hearing has taken place.  None of the Ministers who have a role in resolving this issue are here for this Topical Issue debate, and there are enough of them.  They include the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Ministers of State at his Department, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Ministers of State at his Department, and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Ministers of State at his Department.  None of them could make themselves available for this debate.  That is very telling, as has been the Government response to the independent report that it commissioned.  The Government has actually set aside some of the report's most significant findings and recommendations, including the finding that there are currently no viable alternatives to the continued use of peat moss in the horticultural and mushroom sectors, and that emergency legislation was required before the end of last year to deliver a regulatory framework that would allow for some harvesting of peat moss in areas where there is no alternative.  The working paper produced has done very little to instil confidence that progress is being made.  The plain fact is that the current regulatory framework is unworkable, as found by the independent report.</p>  <p>  It is important to state that we all recognise that environmental law must be adhered to.  What is being sought is a framework in which that law works.  In other EU member states, peat can be harvested for horticultural purposes in line with EU laws.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications has told me that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is now responsible for this issue.  I want to know whether the Government, having essentially sat out this crisis for the past two years, is ready to take action.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.410" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1472" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300048#YY00800"><p>I thank Deputy Carthy for raising this important matter, which I am happy to take on behalf of the Minister, Deputy McConalogue.  As the Deputy is aware, extraction of peat for the Irish professional horticultural industry in recent years has been challenging from both a legal and regulatory perspective.  A series of High Court judgments, beginning in the early 2010s, which dealt with peat extraction and lack of compliance across the extraction sector, has generated supply challenges, both in respect of volume and price, for the horticulture sector which continues to rely on peat as a raw growing material.</p>  <p>  I want to highlight the importance of the horticultural sector and its significant contribution to the economy, with a farm gate value of almost &euro;469 million in 2020.  The horticultural sector is the fourth largest sector in agriculture in terms of output value.  An estimated 17,600 people are employed in the sector in both primary level and value added downstream.  Approximately 60% of the value of Irish horticulture is dependent on peat as a growth medium, with the mushroom, amenity and soft fruit sectors being most reliant.</p>  <p>  The working paper to address challenges related to peat supply in the horticulture sector was put in place by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, in conjunction with the Departments of the Environment, Climate and Communications and Housing, Local Government and Heritage, following the publication of the final report of the working group on the use of peat moss in the horticultural industry.  The paper sets out a series of joint actions which have been put in place to alleviate the difficulties being faced by horticultural growers who are dependent on peat as a growing medium.  The actions include a range of targeted measures which reflect the multifaceted nature of the problem and the subsequent need for short-, medium- and long-term solutions.  These actions were developed to address the short-term issue of peat supply, the medium-term issue of future access to peat and the longer term issue of replacement with alternatives.  The ultimate ambition is to support the horticulture industry, the people employed and the many families that depend on this important sector.</p>  <p>  As we know, peat is a finite resource and there is an acknowledgement of the need to transition to more sustainable growing media.  Most amenity horticulture growers are now using reduced peat levels in growing substrate, where the peat is blended with material such as bark fibre at levels of between 10% and 30%.  I welcome the general agreement across the horticulture industry that the use of peat should be phased out by 2030, or 2035 at the latest, providing alternative materials where available.  However, there is also a recognition that a very limited amount of peat may be required for a period in certain sectors, in particular, professional horticulture, until alternatives are available, affordable and sustainable and meet quality, environmental and productivity requirements for the horticulture sector.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has continued to highlight the importance of transitional peat supply and to assist in considering solutions to this issue.  In doing so, the working paper and associated actions put in place, led by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, will support Irish horticultural growers who are dependent on peat until viable alternatives are found.  The Deputy mentioned the implementation of the working paper.  Progress has been made on the implementation of the actions in the working paper to address challenges related to horticultural peat supply.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will let the Ceann Comhairle know that.  I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.  She has a very important role in her own right.  However, there is no way that we can describe this as a debate.  Regardless of what I ask in my follow-up contribution, the Minister of State will read a prepared statement.  That is not a debate and it is not an acceptable way for Departments to behave, particularly when we are dealing with an issue that could genuinely put entire businesses out of work. </p>  <p>  As I mentioned, this issue crosses three Departments.  For more than two years, they have essentially been dodging responsibility among themselves over what has become a real and existential crisis in the mushroom sector, as I am very aware.  We had a bizarre situation where Government Senators from Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael produced legislation in the Seanad and then had to remove it because they could not get the support of their Government colleagues.  The inaction and indifference of Government has meant the mushroom sector, those who work in it and the communities that depend on it are facing an existential threat due to the shortage of horticultural peat.  The problem has not been resolved and shows no signs of being resolved, despite what the Minister has said.</p>  <p>  The sector needs peat.  The Government set up a working group.  It commissioned a report, granted an extension to the report, considered the report and then proceeded to ignore large portions of it.</p> <p>If action is not taken, we will see the further importation of huge shipments of peat from the far side of Europe - it is bizarre, frankly - where we have no environmental oversight whatsoever, rather than the limited extraction of peat the sector is seeking in order to allow those in the sector to continue in business until alternatives to peat are found.  The language is right but the actions need to be there.  I know it is not the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, but, frankly, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, needs to step up to the mark and be willing to engage in debate on this issue.</p></speech>

I hear the Deputy's frustration regarding the lack of information.  Perhaps I should say the alleged lack of information because obviously I am not up to speed with the minutiae of this issue.  I do know, however, the key importance of the professional horticulture industry to Irish jobs, the economy and our food safety and security.  I reassure the Deputy the Government is working as a priority to assist the horticultural industry in resolving the issues in respect of peat harvesting and managing the difficult but necessary transition away from the widespread use of peat for horticultural purposes in the coming years.</p>  <p>  I have taken a note of the Deputy's remarks in respect of emergency legislation to provide a regulatory framework, as well as the fact that he mentioned the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan.  I will speak to them and let them know the Deputy has raised this issue.  It is clear that any realistic solution needs to find a workable interim arrangement to allow the Irish horticultural industry to operate while alternatives to the widespread use of peat are identified and put in place.  I am aware there are no simple solutions to something like this but I reassure the Deputy that the Government is committed to exploring every opportunity to alleviate the difficulties for growers, their businesses and their families during this period of transition away from the use of peat.  I will certainly bring his comments to the three Ministers and it is to be hoped they will revert back to the Deputy on the issue.</p></speech>

When we put down these questions, we expect the Minister to be here.  I wish to put on record that the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, seems to be operating not only at arm's length from the D&aacute;il, but maybe at bridge length from it at this stage.  The Minister of State will deliver a standard reply she got from the Department or whatever.  I do not think it is good enough on an issue as important as the new national maternity hospital.</p>  <p>  There have been three Private Members' motions proposing that the national maternity hospital should be publicly owned, run and controlled.  The motions were accepted by the Government.  That is an important point.  The Taoiseach has come out and said it should be publicly owned.  The decision was made in 2013 to relocate the maternity hospital from Holles Street to co-locate on the Elm Park site at St. Vincent's Hospital.  That was the KPMG report, which was accepted by the then Minister for Health, James Reilly.  This led to dispute with St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, SVHG, which rejected co-location and demanded full ownership of the new national maternity hospital.</p>  <p>  SVHG is a private company owned by the Religious Sisters of Charity.  It is a section 38 body fully funded by the State.  The Religious Sisters of Charity have now set up a new private company, St. Vincent's Holdings, into which they have said they will transfer their shares in St. Vincent's Healthcare Group, though that has not yet happened, obviously.  It has been reported recently that the Minister and the Department have had meaningful negotiations and arrived at some sort of proposition that would be imminently brought to Cabinet.  I am seriously concerned about this because it is a fact that not one hospital in the whole world that is run privately by a religious order allows reproductive rights procedures to be carried out.</p>  <p>  Professor Shane Higgins, the master of the National Maternity Hospital, featured on a radio programme to discuss the letter he and his colleagues wrote to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health on 23 February this year.  In the letter, they sought to give assurances on the provision of certain procedures at the planned new maternity hospital and to dismiss what they described as misleading and ill-informed commentary from certain Deputies and other people that is derailing the project.  I reject and refute that comment.  There are significant concerns in respect of the actual procedures that will be provided in this hospital.  It is a 299-year lease, which is a massive extension from the 99-year lease to the hospital.  It will cost more than &euro;1 billion of public money to build and more than &euro;70 million of public money to run.  We want to make sure that every woman and man who needs reproductive procedures in the new national maternity hospital has access to them without being referred elsewhere. </p></speech>

He too was not disposed today to take this Topical Issue matter but I am happy to take it on his behalf.</p>  <p>  I know the Deputy, like many other Members, has a strong interest in the ownership and governance arrangements of the new national maternity hospital and I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the issue.  The Government is committed to the development of the new national maternity hospital, as set out in the programme for Government, as the Deputy is aware.  The proposed corporate and clinical governance arrangements for the new national maternity hospital are set out in the Mulvey agreement.  This was finalised following extensive mediation between the National Maternity Hospital and the St. Vincent's Healthcare Group and has been published for a considerable time.</p>  <p>  The Mulvey agreement provides for the establishment of a new company to run the new hospital under a service level agreement with the HSE, as happens in the current National Maternity Hospital.  This new company will have clinical and operational, as well as financial and budgetary, independence in the provision of health services in the new national maternity hospital.  A draft legal framework has been developed based on this agreement and aims to copper-fasten these arrangements.  This legal framework will address the State's core objectives, which are: first, to ensure all clinically appropriate services that are legally permissible are provided for women who need them in the new national maternity hospital; second, to prevent any undue influence, religious or otherwise, in the operation of the new hospital; and third, to protect the State's investment in terms of capital, revenue and service provision at the new hospital for the public good.</p>  <p>  There are certain key points which are important to reiterate to the House.  First, I recognise that concerns continue to circulate regarding the potential involvement of the Religious Sisters of Charity in the new national maternity hospital.  Indeed, the Deputy has raised those concerns here today.  However, the Minister for Health has been clear and informs me the order will not play any role in the governance or operation of our new national maternity hospital.  In fact, the Religious Sisters of Charity have resigned from the board of SVHG and their shareholding is to be transferred to a new charitable entity, St. Vincent's Holdings.  The constitution of St Vincent's Holdings has been published and anyone who has seen that document will know it makes no reference whatsoever to canon law.  The Department of Health has previously been advised in writing by SVHG that canon law will not impact on St Vincent's Holdings.  In addition, it has been stated previously that the Government will not be asked to approve any legal arrangements unless they ensure that all legally permissible services will be provided in the new hospital, as well as appropriately protecting the State's investment.</p>  <p>  We know the buildings at Holles Street are no longer fit for purpose.  It is essential that we move forward and build the new national maternity hospital and provide the necessary infrastructure to facilitate the delivery of a safe and high-quality maternity service for women and infants.  We will do that with all the necessary safeguards and assurances in place.  There is a process ongoing to finalise the legal arrangements.</p> <p>The Minister for Health will not be making any further comment on this matter until the process of engagement and deliberation regarding the legal arrangements has concluded.</p></speech>

First of all, the Religious Sisters of Charity have physically gone from SVHG but their canon law has not.  They have got permission from the Vatican and the Irish Catholic Bishops Conference to go ahead with this deal.  Under canon law, St. Vincent's Hospital is the property of the Catholic Church.  I did not hear anything in the Minister of State&rsquo;s response to say it will not continue to use canon law while it gets the national maternity hospital.  That is my very significant concern and that of many Deputies and many people outside of this Chamber.  It must be made very clear that canon law has absolutely no input into this national maternity hospital.</p>  <p>  I looked at the ownership structure.  There will be St. Vincent's Holdings.  Under that there will be the SVHG, and under that there will be St. Vincent's public, St. Vincent's Holdings private, St. Michael's and the national maternity hospital.  The St. Vincent's Holdings board, the SVHG board, the SVHG group CEO, the group clinical director, the clinical directors and all of the practices and consultants, etc., will be under that clinical governance structure.  It is quite clear that the clinical governance here is the canon law governance of Mary Aikenhead, under which the hospital is run.  The Minister should be more open to meeting Members of the D&aacute;il to let us know what is going on.  In this deal, seemingly they just agreed with what they could do under law, but did not extend it to future legislation that could be brought in.  It is too dodgy.</p></speech>

I set out my understanding in my original contribution to this House.  In fact, I said that canon law plays no part in the new maternity hospital.  I have said that on a number of occasions here, including my initial contribution, and I will say it again to the Deputy.  The House can be assured that maternity and reproductive healthcare at the new hospital will not be compromised.  The Minister for Health is adamant about what will happen.  He will not bring any proposal to the Government unless it provides assurances around all legally permissible services being provided in the new hospital and ensuring the State&rsquo;s significant investment in the new hospital is appropriately protected.  I hope that will give the Deputy some comfort.  The Government is committed to this key project in the way I have set out.  The Deputy mentioned clinical governance and it is not canon law and we are quite clear on that.</p>  <p>  I emphasise that the Government is fully committed to promoting and improving women&rsquo;s health outcomes more generally.  That commitment is reflected in budget 2022, which includes a spend of &euro;31 million for new development funding specifically to support women&rsquo;s health.  The relocation of the national maternity hospital is a very significant part of the Government&rsquo;s objectives in that regard.  We remain committed to providing the highest quality infrastructure and environment to facilitate the delivery of a modern, safe and quality maternity service for women and infants over many years to come.  I note that the Deputy has mentioned that it is a 299-year lease.  It is important that there is no canon law involved in it and there will not be, which is my understanding of this.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.421" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="16:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300050#AAA00600"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann shall take note of the Report of the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands entitled &quot;Response to the Report of the Commission on Pensions&quot;, copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 3rd February, 2022. </blockquote>  <p>I am a full-time athlete, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I am looking forward to participating in the world indoor games because I have definitely qualified after coming up and down those stairs.</p><p>I thank the Ceann Comhairle and the Business Committee for the opportunity to debate the report of the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands entitled: Response to the Report of the Commission on Pensions.  I thank the members of the committee for their work on this report and for their attendance here this evening.  In particular, I thank our researcher and policy officer, Mr. Jack Savage, who carried out a great amount of policy work on the report that has been produced by the committee.</p><p>The committee&rsquo;s report was published in response to the report of the Commission on Pensions and on foot of a request from the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys.  The provision of the State pension is one of the most important aspects of the social protection system, rewarding those who have contributed to the State through employment, through work in the home or as a family carer.As such, the committee was pleased to be able to provide its views and contribute to this timely and sensitive debate.</p><p>The Commission on Pensions published its final report in October 2021.  The commission was tasked with providing the Government with a range of options to ensure the sustainability of the State pension into the future.  The committee was informed that the ratio of workers to those in receipt of the State pension will decline significantly into the future.  Currently that ratio is 4.5 workers for every one pensioner.  This is expected to decrease to 2.3 workers to every pensioner by 2050.  The commission put forward four options or packages in its final report and recommended package 4.  </p><p>The committee considered each package during the course of its deliberations before deciding in favour of the implementation of package 3.  Packages 3 and 4 contain an increase in PRSI for employees, employers and the self-employed as well as an annual Exchequer contribution to the Social Insurance Fund, SIF.  The committee is not in agreement with the specific increases in employee PRSI contained in this package but believes this represents the fairest way to maintain the PRSI base and tackle the forecasted deficit in the SIF.</p><p>The major difference between package 3 and package 4, as put forward by the commission, is the increase in the pension age contained in package 4.  While this increase is at a much slower rate than previously announced, the committee rejected this increase on a number of grounds.  It is the opinion of the committee that the State pension is a fair expectation following 40 years of work.  The committee is unconvinced that the increase in the State pension age would have the desired effect of closing the deficit.  The committee heard of different figures of estimated savings that were provided by different bodies for this potential increase in the retirement age.</p><p>The committee also discussed alternative payments that are provided to individuals who are forced to retire at the age of 65 due to compulsory retirement clauses in their work contracts.  The committee is of the opinion that increasing the qualifying age for the State pension, while simultaneously providing alternative payments to those forced to retire, undermines the argument that increasing the qualifying age for the State pension will improve the fiscal position of the SIF.  The SIF pays the majority of social protection payments.  Therefore, while the money would not be listed as pension expenditure, it would still be paid through the same fund.</p> <p>While the committee is aware that other social protection payment rates are primarily lower than the State pension, the impact of the age increase will be minimal unless the issues I outlined are rectified.</p> <p> On the issue of compulsory retirement, the committee has recommended that legislation is developed to remove compulsory retirement clauses from contracts.  This is a fundamental recommendation in our report.  Furthermore, we are recommending that this legislation must be retrospective and apply to current contracts as well as new ones.  It is vital that this aspect is implemented to fulfil the series of recommendations we have made because this is a cornerstone of the recommendations.  The committee believes that those over the age of 65 years who wish to remain in employment should have no legal barrier to doing so.  The committee heard evidence of the negative physical and mental health impacts that forced retirement can have on people.  The committee's recommendations focus on providing those aged over 65 years with a choice, either to continue working or to retire.  Each individual has different circumstances and the choice is paramount in this debate.</p> <p> Similarly, the committee discussed the issue of flexibility and noted that the commission suggested that some people would continue to access their State pension at the age of 65 years if they had 45 years of PRSI contributions.  The committee welcomes the suggestion of this level of flexibility and recommends that this should be the case once somebody reaches 40 years of contributions, not 45 years.  The committee is of the opinion that this is particularly important for those engaged in manual labour and physical work.</p> <p> The committee made several recommendations regarding PRSI in its report.  The PRSI receipts primarily fund the Social Insurance Fund and that is why changes made to PRSI are important to future provision of the State pension.  First, the committee has rejected any attempt to move those over the age of 65 years who remain in employment to class K PRSI.  This is because class K offers no benefits and does not count towards an employee's PRSI contributions.  The committee is of the opinion that all contributions paid by employees should be part of their contribution record.</p> <p> The committee has accepted the changes to the class S PRSI that are laid out in package 3.  This is for various reasons.  Class S PRSI was introduced in 1998 for self-employed workers and is currently 4%, or &euro;500 per year, whichever is the greatest.  However, self-employed workers do not have an employer contribution to their record.  When class S PRSI was introduced, self-employed workers were only entitled to a very limited number of benefits through the SIF.  However, changes in recent years have ensured that self-employed workers are now entitled to 93% of the benefits provided through the SIF.  As such, the committee is of the opinion that attempts must be made to equalise the contributions made on behalf of self-employed and employees.  However, the committee recommends that any changes to class S PRSI be gradual and well-communicated so self-employed workers are given enough notice and can ensure that they are not taken by surprise.  Significant changes to PRSI should not take place over short periods of time.</p> <p> The committee also discussed changes to class A PRSI.  The commission put forward suggested changes to both the employee and employer contribution rates.  While the committee agrees with this in principle, the exact rates should be considered further.  The committee is of the opinion that Ireland already levies a significant amount of tax on workers and that the PRSI class A contributory rate of between 6% and 7% by 2050 could be unfair.  The committee noted in its report that Ireland has a low rate of employer's PRSI contribution when compared with its European counterparts.  The committee recommended that increases to PRSI contributions are investigated further to make sure that they are increased in the fairest way possible.</p> <p> The committee is also of the opinion that the terms of reference provided to the Commission on Pensions were relatively narrow and, as such, prevented it from developing new measures to combat the explicit deficit in the SIF and instead focus on changes to mechanisms currently in place.  Before I continue, I wish to make it known that the committee is very thankful for the work carried out by the commission and greatly respects and acknowledges the level of work it carried out in a relatively short period of time.  However, the committee decided to look beyond the scope of the commission and has discussed two possibilities that would counteract the deficit in the SIF that is expected into the future.  First, the committee discussed the need for new taxes on wealth to be examined.  This has not happened yet and while the committee is uncertain on the format whereby this could be developed, new ways to create revenue should not be taken off the table.  Second, the committee discussed the issue of auto enrolment.  While it has not made a specific recommendation on this issue, it is something that the committee is eager to explore further, to see what type of impact it would have on pension provision.</p> <p> The committee also considered gender dimensions that currently exist in the pensions system and which must be considered with regard to any changes to pension provision.  The committee was informed that women tend to receive pension payments that are, on average, 33% less than the amount received by men.  There are several social, historical and cultural reasons for this.  The commission notes in its report that women tend to spend approximately two and a half times more time on unpaid domestic and care work than men.  In a submission to the committee by the National Women's Council of Ireland the legacy issues of the marriage bar were also highlighted.  It is estimated that 57,000 women do not qualify for the full State pension due to the impacts of the marriage bar.  The commission acknowledges in its report that the marriage bar required women to resign from their jobs once they were married and disqualified married women from applying for jobs.  The committee stresses the importance of acknowledging the societal structures that have previously prevented women from participating in the workforce, which would have impacted their ability to acquire PRSI contributions.</p> <p> The committee acknowledges that under the total contributions approach a homemaker's credit of 20 years is provided for those who worked in the home.  However, the homemaker's credit scheme does not adequately address the inequalities in the pension system, as it was expanded on the previous scheme that excluded women who left the workforce pre-1994.  The provision of the homemaker's scheme is important as it acknowledges the importance of work carried out in the home, which is primarily performed by women.  These issues must be considered if we are to treat the work of all citizens equally.</p> <p> The committee also considered the barriers faced by family carers when accessing the State pension.  Family Carers Ireland informed the committee that one in eight people currently provide care, and that is set to increase to one in five by 2030.  The majority of care is provided by women and the commission states in the report that six in ten family carers are women.  While the family carers can avail of the homemaker's scheme, this does not adequately provide for those who care for periods of more than 20 years.  The homemaker's scheme is also not available to those who provide lifelong care in homes, as it requires recipients to have ten years of credited contributions.  The committee is of the opinion that this situation must be rectified and welcomes the commission acknowledging this in its report.  The committee is of the opinion that it is necessary for the State to meet the contribution requirements for family carers to ensure that they qualify for the State pension.  This is in recognition of the significant work carried out by family carers.  Family Carers Ireland informed the committee that it accepts the recommendations regarding family carers made by the commission, and the committee supports it in asking that these recommendations be implemented in full.</p> <p> The other cohort of people which was not specifically referenced in our report on pensions but which we had referenced in our previous report in our pre-budget submission to the Minister for Social Protection is foster care parents, where they do not accrue a PRSI record as a result of the foster care payment.</p> <p>We are saying the provision being extended to family carers should also apply to foster care parents in the vital work they do in our society.  I thank all Members for their attendance at this important debate.  I look forward to hearing their contributions.</p></speech>

I note Deputy Naughten's work as Chair and the work of other members.  My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, sends her apologies.  She cannot be here this evening as she is attending a number of events in Sligo throughout today and tomorrow to which she committed some time ago.</p><p>The pensions commission was established in November 2020 to examine the sustainability of the State pension system and the Social Insurance Fund in fulfilment of a programme for Government commitment.  The commission was an independent body of knowledgeable and experienced academics, pension experts, members of civil society and representatives of workers and employers.  The commission's report was published in October last year.  It contains almost 250 pages of analysis, consideration and recommendations.  It is a comprehensive report that takes account of an assessment of various analyses of population, labour force and expenditure projections, an examination of international approaches and responses to an extensive consultation process.</p><p>The commission's analyses point to the fact significant demographic changes are under way in Ireland.  While Ireland enjoys a more favourable demographic position than many of our European peers, all EU member states, including Ireland, face many fiscal challenges with ageing and its associated risks.  Thankfully people in Ireland are living longer and are healthier than previous generations.  This is great news.  However, it would be a strategic risk not to plan and provide for this change, not least in terms of income adequacy for older people.</p><p>Ireland's population is projected to increase from approximately 5 million in 2020 to approximately 6 million by 2050.Projections also point to younger age cohorts declining in relative terms by 2051 while older age cohorts will continue to grow in absolute and relative terms.  Accordingly, Ireland's population is ageing.  There will be a much larger proportion of older people relative to younger age cohorts.  This will result in a less favourable old age dependency ratio.  The number of working age people paying tax and PRSI to support State pension payments will reduce significantly.  Today we have 4.5 people working for every one pensioner.  By 2050 this ratio will drop to approximately two people working per pensioner.</p><p>Demographic projections are based on assumptions that may change over time.  However, the results from a range of sources, including the CSO, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, EUROSTAT and the Department of Finance, based on different sets of scenarios and assumptions, show only marginal differences.  The overall trend is that Irish people are living well beyond the current State pension age of 66.  The duration of State pension payments has been increasing steadily over time.  It is projected it will continue to increase further.  These demographic changes drive the projected significant increases in State pension-related expenditure.  In 2010, pension programme spending made up approximately 28% of the Department of Social Protection's social welfare expenditure.  This proportion has steadily increased.  This year, we will spend more than &euro;9.1 billion on the State pension system.  This represents 39.1% of the total social protection spend.</p><p>According to the Department of Finance's assessment, spending is projected to increase substantially over the coming years and decades given the changes occurring in Irish society.  Expenditure related to State pensions is projected to significantly increase over time, more than doubling from 3.8% of GNI* in 2019 to 7.9% in 2050 and increasing further to 9.2% of GNI* by 2070.  The most recent actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund published in 2017 indicates that on a no-policy-change basis the Social Insurance Fund will have an annual deficit of &euro;2.3 billion by 2030.  This will increase to reach &euro;13.4 billion annually by 2050.  By 2045 annual expenditure on the State pension contributory alone is projected to exceed the social insurance fund or PRSI income.  These are big numbers and they are only annual deficits.  The actuarial review further estimated these annual deficits will compound over the intervening years, leaving the Social Insurance Fund in a cumulative deficit position of &euro;335 billion by 2070.</p><p>The pensions commission has made it clear after very careful and detailed analysis that the State pension system is not sustainable without considerable reform and has set out a wide range of recommendations in this regard.  Its recommendations for making the system fairer include linking the employment contractual retirement age to the State pension age; enhanced pension provision for long-term carers who are caring for more than 20 years; options for the introduction of early and deferred access to the State pension, including the option for a person to continue to pay PRSI contributions past the State pension age to improve their social insurance record for State pension contributory purposes; and the introduction of benchmarking or indexation of State pension payment rates.</p><p>Its recommendations to mitigate cost pressures include full transition to a total contributions approach model and phasing out the yearly average approach and increases to the State pension age, commencing much later and increasing on a more gradual basis than previously legislated for.  Its recommendations to raise funding include PRSI contribution rate increases for classes A and S; broader application of PRSI on earnings irrespective of age; and an annual Exchequer contribution to the Social Insurance Fund.</p><p>In the interests of older people and future generations of older people, the Government intends to consider the comprehensive and far-reaching recommendations in the Pension Commission's report very carefully and holistically.  Therefore, the Government agreed the commission's report and recommendations would be referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands and the Commission on Taxation and Welfare for their views.  I note the Oireachtas joint committee published its 19 page report on 2 February.  I thank the committee for providing its views and its work in considering the Pension Commission's report.  It is clear from the committee's response that it agrees the State pension is an important element of Ireland's social protection measures.  I note the committee set out some very differing views to the commission's findings, including not recommending any increase in the State pension age.</p><p>The committee's report seems to support some of the more politically palatable measures from the pensions commission, including pensions for carers and ending mandatory retirement ages, while not really engaging with the very difficult questions of how to fund pensions and how to ensure the system remains sustainable over the coming decades so young people today will have a State pension to look forward to.  While the committee calls at a high level for changes in PRSI contribution rates and taxes on wealth it does not provide detail on what these actually mean, on whom they should be imposed and at what rates and what they will yield.  Unfortunately, the committee does not show how these or other measures function to make the system sustainable.</p><p>The report of the pensions commission and recommendations are not an<i>&agrave; la carte</i>menu.  We cannot just implement the nice measures and ignore the less palatable ones.  The workers and young people of today will not thank us if we shirk our responsibility to lead and to put the State pension system on a sustainable footing for future generations.  There needs to be a package of measures to deal holistically with the systemic challenges facing the State pension.  We cannot just cherry-pick some of the more positive parts of the Pension Commission's report for implementation and then decide to park all of the hard decisions.</p><p>The social insurance system is more than pensions alone.  It would be remiss of the Government to make decisions relating to the social insurance system based on a report from the pensions commission without taking into account the views of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare, which has a broader remit.  The Commission on Taxation and Welfare submitted its views on the Pension Commission's PRSI-related recommendations to the Minister for Social Protection earlier this week.  The commission advised the increasing cost of the State pension is only one of a number of areas where ageing will likely lead to greater levels of public expenditure.  Sustaining public services and social protection supports at the levels that Irish society expects, in combination with other demands, strongly suggests there will be a requirement to raise additional revenues through the tax system over the medium and longer term.</p> <p>It is important, therefore, to see the PRSI system as part of the broader tax system.</p> <p> The views of the joint committee, along with those of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare, will be considered carefully as part of the Government's deliberations over the coming weeks.  All of the issues will be discussed in detail through the Cabinet committee structure.  Following that, the Minister of Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, will bring a recommended response to, and implementation plan for, the Commission on Pensions recommendations to the Government by the end of March.  There are, and will continue to be, different views on the balance to be struck between cost-saving measures and revenue-raising measures.  I accept the Government will have difficult choices to make, but we need to face up to the fact that reform of the State pensions system is necessary, although it is also complex.  There are no easy answers and no answers that cannot be challenged.  Equally, there are no answers that would find universal support.  However, the State pension is extremely effective in ensuring our pensioners do not experience poverty.  This Government is committed to ensuring this remains the case for current pensioners, those nearing State pension age and today's young workers, including those who are only starting out on their careers.</p></speech>

I welcome this debate.  I welcome those who are in the Gallery, particularly the president of SIPTU, P&aacute;draig Peyton, and Ethel Buckley.  I especially welcome Mr. Peyton as he comes towards the end of his term of office.  He is the one individual who has placed this issue front and centre on the political agenda.  He is a Mayo man who is exiled in Sligo.  He will finish his term of office at the end of this month.</p>  <p>  I have had to shorten my contribution so I will focus on just a few matters.  I commend the Chairman and the committee on this report.  The Minister of State has referred to sustainability, but there are other ways to attack and manage the sustainability issue rather than completely focusing on changing the age.  As the Minister of State has said, the broader tax system also includes the tax reliefs being offered on private pensions, which are worth some &euro;2.5 billion per annum.  A rebalancing of those reliefs could help when examining the broader tax system.</p>  <p>  It was very clear during the general election campaign that the notion of raising the age was unpalatable not just to politicians but to the public generally.  People who have worked incredibly hard and contributed greatly to the life of the State had an expectation of a pension at the age of 65 for many, now 66.  In that context, the broader tax system and broader funding beyond the Department of Social Protection budget needs to be looked at.  There are other areas involved in this.</p>  <p>  I have noticed that while the age issue gets a lot of coverage, the issue of mandatory retirement is the one that gets most people angry and aggrieved.  We need to change our approach to that and give people an option.  There are many who wish to continue working and they should be allowed to do that.  Yes, our age profile is changing and some people want to continue to work, but there are others who do not.  We need to be proactive in reviewing that.</p>  <p>  I particularly welcome the focus the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands put on the marriage bar.  I believe this went on our entry to the European Union, which was in the year I was born.  It is extraordinary it was allowed to continue.  Its legacy is that 57,000 women, our mothers and grandmothers, were prevented from earning a wage and fulfilling their career potential.  Given it is such a small number of people, 57,000, who are not qualifying for a full State pension not because of anything they themselves did, that issue needs to be actively looked at and dealt with once and for all.</p>  <p>  There is still a large cohort of people who were impacted negatively by the 2012 changes with regard to home care.  The home care package has not dealt with all of them.  They are very aggrieved.  Many of them only find out they had been penalised when they come to retirement age.</p>  <p>  That brings me to another issue, the issue of knowledge about pensions.  There are many people - in fact, most of us - who do not engage with this issue until they are coming close to pension age.  The State needs to be a lot more proactive in informing people of their pension benefits.  We can send out any range of taxation documentation annually.  People should get an annual pension statement so they will know early on what their pension will be when they come to retirement so that they can engage with it at that stage.</p>  <p>  I welcome the focus the committee put on the issue of family carers and other carers.  In the context of what family carers save the health budget and, more importantly, the non-financial contribution they make, it is only the decent thing to do to give them pension rights.  It is actually an investment in our health system as well as being the decent thing to do.  That needs to be looked at as well.</p>  <p>  I have mentioned the whole area of information for those who are paying contributions.  A great many people do not know what they are entitled to in terms of PRSI benefits.  We need to shine a far brighter light on that system and to make it far more accessible and transparent so that people know what they are getting for paying in.  PRSI is quite a substantial portion of peoples' income and people must be given much clearer access.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.427" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1575" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="17:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300053#DDD00300"><p>As somebody who was party to the writing of this report and who, along with my colleagues, put a lot of effort into it, I have to say the attitude of the establishment here in trying to rubbish us is absolutely horrendous.  The Commission on Pensions did an honest job within its terms of reference, but the terms of reference were written in an attempt to get a particular result.  I hope to outline why I disagree with the result.  At the very end of my few minutes, I will come to why I believe the terms of reference were too narrow.</p>  <p>  The first point I wish to raise is that I know many people, including teachers who are burnt out, care workers who have developed health issues from heavy work, people in the building trade and many other workers, who do not believe they will be in a fit physical or mental state to continue working beyond the age of 66 and who wish to retire.  I have no problem with allowing those who wish to continue working - and I am one of them - to do so, but to say to people at the age of 66 that, although we know they cannot work and that they spent 40 years working, they cannot retire is incorrect.</p>  <p>  When you read the report in detail, you will see that there are two choices.  I am going to compare them.  One choice, package 4, calls for 10% Exchequer funding either way.  That is even-stevens.  There is no difference there.  Another choice, package 3, says there should be no increase in the pension age while package 4 says it should be increased to 68 incrementally over time.  Where do the differences in how the money is raised arise?  To make up for giving people the pension at 66, package 3 specifies that, between now and 2030, the self-employed contribution is to be increased from 4% to 10%, but package 4 specifies the exact same thing, so there is no difference there.  Package 3 then specifies that, between 2030 and 2040, the self-employed contribution is to be increased by 2.8%, while package 4 specifies an increase of 2.4%, a difference of 0.4%.  Package 3 specifies a further increase of 0.9% on top of that by 2050, while package 4 specifies 0.1%.  Even at that rate, which would be 13.7%, the self-employed contribution would still be much better value, on an actuarial basis, than the employers' and employees' contributions put together.  I have no difficulty in saying that the people on package 3 would be much better off getting the pension at 67 in light of the quite small differences I have outlined.</p>  <p>  The other significant difference lies in the increase in employers' and employees' contributions.  Package 3 specifies that this should increase by 0.2% by 2030 while package 4, the one which sets the pension age at 68, specifies no increase.</p> <p>Then by 2040 it is 1.55% in package 3 and 1.35% in package 4.  It then goes up by 0.9% versus 0.1% again in the last ten years up to 2050.  We have two choices: to increase the PRSI contributions and give the pension at age 67 or find alternative sums.  This is where I really run into trouble.</p> <p> There has been no mention of auto-enrolment here.  I keep tabling parliamentary questions and for some reason the Department of Social Protection does not want to give us the data.  Basically auto-enrolment is coming in the next year or two, according to the Government.  With auto-enrolment, the employer, the employee and the State will put money in to give the employee a pension maybe 40 years hence.  The State appears to be saying that we can find all this money to put money in for 20, 30 or 40 years hence, whenever the person reaches the pension age, and that we have so much money that we can put it in now but we cannot pay the person the State pension at 66.</p> <p> As someone who wants to give everybody the basic pension before starting to top up their pension, to me the bottom line is to give everybody the basic pension at 66 and then top up with whatever is left.  What the Government is trying to do by subterfuge by avoiding auto-enrolment is to do it backwards.  It says we are going to start to put the money in and commit to auto-enrolment first, and we are determined to increase the pension age because it suits the Government.  It suits the system because it suits the private pension industry.</p></speech>

The Minister of State will know that during the most recent general election, the people sent a very clear message to Government on pension age.  While many of us might run a mile on hearing the word &quot;pension&quot;, the pension age clearly matters to the public and particularly to workers.  The pressure in the general election forced the Government into a significant U-turn.  If the Government had its way, we would today have a pension age of 67.  We would have people who spent almost every day on their feet or engaged in heavy manual labour unable to receive their State pension until the age of 67 either because they were forced out of their job due to their employment contract and onto a jobseeker's payment or because they could not remain on beyond that age.</p><p>There is an issue here.  Despite the recent name change, people are being forced to retire at 65 and have to go on effectively jobseeker's payment.  Earlier the Minister of State mentioned the importance of income adequacy in our social protection system and for our State pension.  Once those workers move on to what is a jobseeker's payment, they lose more than &euro;3,200 a year on what should be their State pension.</p><p>The commission's report also refers to poverty-proofing.  As those 65-year-olds move on to a jobseeker's payment of &euro;208 a week, they are on a payment that is well below the poverty line.  Following the general election, the Government set up the commission which was seen at the time as avenue to make the hard decision for the Government.  The commission has now done its work on which I commend it.  However, it has left the Government with a decision.  The Government must engage with those people who will be impacted by the decision it will make on pension age, including the trade unions.  We pointed out at the time that the make-up of the pensions commission did not include a representative for older people or a representative for women.  That was a mistake which is why that engagement now is important.</p><p>The commission made two important points in its report.  While I appreciate the commission indicated a preference, it proposed four packages for the Government to consider, two of which do not include a State pension age increase whatsoever.  The commission also recognised that some workers need to be able to access a State pension at 65, something we have said repeatedly and consistently.</p><p>Many of the proposed changes to the State pension have been about savings and also this imaginary pensions timebomb.  However, nobody who appeared before the committee during its deliberations, including representatives of the ESRI, could tell us what savings would be made by increasing the State pension age.  The ESRI representatives told us that because, as they put it, a <i>de facto</i>pension is being paid at 65, it is impossible to say what savings are being made.  The Government should stop peddling the argument about savings unless it actually has the figures in the first instance, which up to now it has not.</p><p>I welcome the commitment in the programme for Government for a solution for family carers.  In many cases they are working extremely hard 24-7 for a basic social welfare payment and not much else.  In many cases, they are denied a State pension on retirement or they are left on a reduced State pension.  It is not good enough and they deserve better.  I hope that matter will be resolved.</p><p>We have considerable work to do on pensions.  We need to ensure that the total contributions approach works for carers and for the self-employed before it is fully rolled out.  Auto-enrolment is an important add-on for workers.  In many cases they depend on the State pension alone, which is not as generous as the Government likes to make out.  It is it is important that we get auto-enrolment right.  We need to ensure we are careful about who manages it in particular.  We introduced legislation on the abolition of mandatory retirement in the previous D&aacute;il that was passed unanimously but has not been progressed.  The Government needs to stop talking about it and actually make it happen.</p></speech>

In 2020, politicians from all parties got a very clear message from the voters.  Workers rejected the Government policy of the incremental increases in the pension age.  The voters forced a fairly substantial U-turn by the Government parties and the Labour Party.  Workers also want the option to continue to work on the same terms and conditions of employment.  In short, workers want choice and I agree with them.  Not alone was this clear at the last general election, a recent poll conducted by RED C for the<i>Business Post</i>shows that the opinion of the electorate has not changed.  We need to understand that workers are up for the conversation about funding.  They are not stupid and know how finances work.  Workers know that pensions are not free.  They do not appreciate being patronised.  They understand they must pay for their pension and they want to be part of that conversation.  We have one of the lowest rates of employer PRSI in the developed world.  I would be interested to hear if the Government believes that this should not change and that the only change should be for workers who will be required to work while retirement gets further away from them.</p><p>Sinn F&eacute;in believes that after a lifetime of work at the age of 65, a worker should be able to retire on the full pension rate of pay.  That right was abolished by the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government in 2013.  We want that position reversed and replaced with a choice to access the pension rate of pay at 65 or continue to work on the same terms and conditions of employment.</p><p>Not many of us in this House will ever truly understand what a lifetime of backbreaking work does to a person's body, but we can certainly show empathy and try to understand that many workers are simply not able to continue after the age of 65.  I am pleased that this has been recognised in the committee's report.  Recommendation 10 provides for the right to access the pension rate of pay in limited circumstances at the age of 65.  This is a very welcome development and I would be interested in the Minister of State's response.  Being able to access the pension rate means they can realistically consider stopping work.  For those who are waiting on tables, laying blocks, stocking shelves, cleaning or doing any other physically demanding work, that extra year would make an enormous difference.</p><p>The committee further recommends that legislation be developed to ban the use of mandatory retirement clauses in contracts and this should be backdated to include current contracts.  This is essential and the good news is that Sinn F&eacute;in has legislation ready to go.  We introduced it in the previous D&aacute;il and we have sought leave to introduce it in the next few weeks.</p><p>When debating pensions and accessing the State pension, we often get bogged down in how we will fund it.  This bypasses what we want to fund.</p> <p>The abolition of mandatory retirement clauses is an essential part of the funding discussion, which means we have to take account of the impact this could have.  If we give workers the choice to retire at 65, many will opt to work on because they want to do so and some because they have to do so.  Those who can do so should be facilitated.  We have to factor their contribution into any discussion we have on funding.</p> <p> Likewise, the Government needs to move beyond saying it believes in a total contributions approach and actually publish what it is talking about.  We need to future-proof pension provision, take account of the impact of the total contributions approach and be mindful of a recommendation of the Commission on Pensions to the effect that it supports measures which encourage economic growth and competitiveness.  The Government has been shown up for having a complete lack of imagination in this regard and has overestimated the impact that raising the pension age ever upwards will have on long-term pension provision.  We need to focus on the potential that the creation of a high-growth, high-wage economy could have for long-term financing of pensions.  We can and should look at the collective impact of decent wages, high-value, high-growth jobs, the abolition of mandatory retirement and the total contributions approach.  That is what should frame our discussions.</p> <p> If she were here, I would encourage the Minister - perhaps the junior Minister, Deputy Madigan, will pass this on to her - to take on board the work of SIPTU economist Michael Taft.  He has done great work on the potential in making a substantial contribution to funding pensions and future-proofing pension provision by investing in indigenous industry and ensuring that the recommendation of the pensions commission on encouraging economic growth as a mechanism for funding is put into practice.  I wish to put on the record my thanks to the members of the Stop67 campaign, who have worked hard to undo the damage done by the Fine Gael-Labour Government, in particular the Labour Minister of the day, who forced workers onto the dole at the age of 65.  I am glad that decision was reversed.  We were told at the time the decision was taken that there was no other option but, what do you know, another option was found.  I thank the secretariat and the members of the committee, in particular my colleagues, na Teachta&iacute; Claire Kerrane and Paul Donnelly and Senator Gavan.</p></speech>

Since the recession in 2008, there has been a constant clamour from economists and employers to tackle the rising cost of State pensions.  We heard it from the Minister of State tonight that "this must be done", "it is a hard decision", "we have to look after the young", etc.  The chief argument the Government and the economists make is that people are living longer and that, in the future, the ratio between the number of workers in the labour force and the number of retired workers will grow and become unsustainable.  Words such as "burden" and "dependency" are used to convey that message.  Workers living longer are a time bomb that must be defused, and the only solution is to defer pension payments from age 65 to age 68, and possibly later if needs be.  The Minister of State has dismissed the committee's report, and I share Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's anger about that.</p>  <p>  Why do I say this is a false narrative?  First, the calculation of the ratio between those of working age and those over 65 is arbitrary and misleading.  We are told there are approximately 4.5 people of working age to every pensioner and that this figure is set to decrease to 3.5 by 2030 and to 2.3 by 2051.  This would mean very little even if it were correct.  It does not tell us how productive those who are still working are, how dependent those over 65 will be or if demographic trends are certain.  That people are living longer now should be a cause for great celebration.  Not only are people living longer, but those with extra years are healthier and more active than past generations have been.  While they may be getting a modest State pension, many are still active and productive and providing essential labour to the benefit of wider society.  In that sense they are not dependent.  The ratio used does not tell us how many of those under 65 can and do work, nor does it calculate how many of those over 65 will continue to work or would choose to do so if they were allowed.  The statistic is equally misleading at the other end of the equation.  A modern, technology-driven economy means that workers stay in education longer than we did decades ago before joining the workforce.  At the same time, many women are being forced out of the workforce because of childcare costs.  Many of those over 65 continue to play vital roles in our society, even if they have formally left the workforce.  Most of them will be in good health, not depending on health services or other services in the same proportion as people of their age in previous decades.  For example, it is only because of retired workers, whether grandparents or other close family members, providing unpaid childcare that many families, many thousands of people, can continue to work.</p>  <p>  Second, it is presented as a given and an insurmountable fact that the expected cost of this time bomb can be avoided only by raising the pension age.  That is not the case.  The commission calculated, for example, that the Social Insurance Fund deficit, the fund into which PRSI taxes go and which pays out benefits such as the State pension, could reach &euro;13 billion in 2050 if no changes are implemented.  The savings predicted from increasing the pension age to 68 are calculated at &euro;3.8 billion for 2050.  In fact, none of these are certain figures, and research shows that when the pension age was increased to 66 in 2014, it had little impact on the number of people who retired at the age of 65.  The impact of forcing thousands to work longer will have unintended consequences and will not be cost-free.  Childminders and volunteers in many vital sectors will have been kept at work, and that will have a knock-on effect on our society.  What the economists and the Government do not publicise is the fact that raising the tax paid by employers could address any deficit.  If the PRSI paid by employers were raised by just 4% or 5%, that would add another &euro;3 billion or &euro;4 billion to the fund, as highlighted in the committee report.  That is more than the savings from raising the retirement age is predicted to yield.  Workers will pay into the Social Insurance Fund throughout their entire working life.  Since the last recession, they have also paid additional taxes such as USC, with little or no tangible benefits, while employers in Ireland continue to pay the lowest PRSI rates in Europe.  The first step in addressing this issue is to raise that rate and to make sure that the Social Insurance Fund does not face a deficit.  The Government, of course, will faint at the notion of raising taxes on employers, but then it has no problem taking the "hard decision" to slash workers' benefits or to raise the retirement age.</p>  <p>  Third, the fact that the ratio may increase does not in itself constitute a crisis.  By every measure available, worker productivity has increased enormously over recent decades.  The gap between workers' productivity and their pay has also widened.  In the US, for example, since the 1970s, workers' productivity has increased by a staggering 61% compared with wages, which have increased by only 17%.  The difference is pocketed as profits and helps explain the widening inequality across many countries.  Irish workers are the same: massive leaps in productivity over decades have gone side by side with a decreasing share of the overall wealth in society.  In 1970 the share of national income for employed and self-employed people was 89% of the economy, but by 2012 that had declined to 60%.  The point here is that three workers in 2030 will be as productive as five workers were in 1970 and, logically, there is no need to fear that ratio or the ability of society to support a population living longer if wealth and resources are distributed equitably and social supports are funded through taxes on wealth and profits.</p>  <p>  As unions and workers fight against these proposed changes, the wider arguments have come under scrutiny and have been exposed.  Behind the attempts to raise the pension age is a philosophy that never, ever looks to raise taxes on employers or to tax the vast wealth that workers generate as profits during their working lives.  Instead, that philosophy seeks to reduce the rights and supports that workers have fought for over generations.  The real agenda behind the myth of a pensions time bomb is the continuation of an ongoing war on all workers' rights and entitlements.  We should not fall for this and we should defend the right to retire and bring the retirement age back to 65 as a cornerstone of a decent society.</p>  <p>  None of what the Minister of State said is about fairness or equity; it is part of an ongoing war on pensions and retired workers.  PRSI on employers is a hard decision, but the Government seems happy to tax retired workers on modest pensions or to force people to work another two years.  The best of luck to members of the Government parties when they go before the electorate in 2025 on a platform of raising the retirement age to 68.</p></speech>

I did not realise it was a case of first-up, best-dressed.  I thought the usual way we apply party slots would be operative.  In any case, I thank Deputy Smith.  It is much appreciated.  I agree with many of the perspectives the Deputy presented and those of others here.  From a workers' perspective and a broader fiscal perspective, there is no clear rationale for the kind of rises in the pension age that are planned.  This is not 2012.  The fiscal situation is different, as it is in Northern Ireland.  I hope Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues will reflect on that and change the position in the North they voted for in 2012.</p>  <p>  Our position in the Labour Party could not be clearer and has not changed since the general election of 2020.  I have been writing since well before 2020 about the need to take a step back and reflect on this in the context of the fiscal and demographic situation.  Compared to European norms, we are going faster and further in this country in terms of planned increases to the pension age than countries we like to compare ourselves to across the European Union.  </p>  <p>  I congratulate comrades and colleagues from SIPTU who have campaigned incredibly hard and well on the basis that we should STOP67.  That term entered the narrative in the 2020 election.  It shows the power of trade unions and organised labour and the importance of trade unions in the political and economic debate in this country.  We should never lose sight of that.  I congratulate them on the campaign they fought.  This is a great success.  It should be a turning point in relation to the Government's agenda on the pensions area.</p>  <p>  I congratulate Deputy Naughten on a significant, rational, legible and important report in terms of influencing public debate in an informed way about the reality of pensions and demographics.</p></speech>

I assure each Deputy who has contributed that I will bring their comments to the attention of the Minister.  A number of issues have been raised and I will take them all back to her.</p>  <p>  The State pension is the bedrock of the pension system in Ireland and is extremely effective in ensuring our pensioners do not experience poverty.  The CSO data for 2020 indicates that the 65-years-and-over age group had the lowest poverty rates of all age groups.  This was across three poverty measurements: at risk of poverty, deprivation rate and consistent poverty.  The consistent poverty rate for those aged 65 and over is 0.9%, compared to 8% for those aged 17 years and younger.  Nevertheless, I take into account everything said here.  I also welcome those in the Gallery and their leadership on this issue.</p>  <p> The public policy and social issues in funding a sustainable and adequate State pension system are complex and can often be confusing.  Therefore, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that our system successfully provides a broad series of supports for older people beyond the State pension.  These include other primary payments such as the non-contributory State pension and the widow's, widower's and surviving civil partner's pension.  We also have targeted allowances such as the fuel allowance, the over-80 allowance, the living alone allowance and the living on a specified island allowance.  Finally, we have service supports such as free travel.</p>  <p>  In light of the ESRI research mentioned and the commitment to ensuring the carbon tax is progressive, the Government committed to a significant increase in a targeted package of social protection supports in budget 2022.  These supports were selected to counteract the impact of the increased carbon tax on low income households.  The measures included increases to the living alone and fuel allowances.  There was a &euro;3 increase to the living alone allowance, from &euro;19 to &euro;22 per week, from January of this year.  This budget measure means recipients will receive an additional &euro;156 per annum.  The estimated cost of the living alone allowance increase in 2022 is &euro;36 million and it is estimated that there will be 230,000 recipients of the payment this year. The budget provided for an increase of &euro;5 in the weekly rate of fuel allowance, bringing the rate to &euro;33 with effect from budget night.  This benefited 398,000 households immediately with an estimated full-year cost in 2022 of just under &euro;55.8 million. </p>  <p>  The Government and the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, are acutely aware of the increase in consumer prices in recent months, especially the increase in fuel and other energy prices.  To help mitigate the effect of these rising costs, the Government announced additional expenditure measures totalling &euro;0.5 billion, which will make a positive impact on the incomes of all households in our country.  As part of these measures, a targeted payment of &euro;125 will be paid to all households in receipt of the fuel allowance payment, at an estimated cost of &euro;49 million.  Customers who have a weekly fuel allowance payment due the week commencing Monday, 14 March are scheduled to receive an additional &euro;125 to their weekly fuel payment.  Fuel allowance recipients who are paid a lump sum in January 2022 to cover the 2022 fuel season are also scheduled to receive an additional payment of &euro;125 in the week commencing 14 March.</p>  <p>  For those unable to work past 65 years of age, there is a range of supports available, including the benefit payment for 65-year-olds, which is a payment for people aged over 65 who are required to or choose to retire, without a requirement to sign-on, engage in activation measures or be available for and genuinely seeking work.  This payment was designed to bridge the gap for people who retire from employment or self-employment at 65 but do not qualify for the State pension until they reach the age of 66.</p>  <p>  The fundamental objective of the Government's policy approach to the State pension system is to ensure that it remains adequate and sustainable into the future.  We all want to maintain a fair balance between those who contribute to the system and those who draw from it.  The need to protect current and future pensioners while protecting the most vulnerable pensioners will remain at the forefront of any reforms in the area.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Naughten and the members of the Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands for their work and for providing views on the pension commission's recommendations.  The views of the joint committee will be considered as part of Government deliberations in the coming weeks.  Following that, the Government will bring forward a recommended response to the pension commission's recommendations by the end of March.  I will bring it to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-03-03a.438" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="17:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022030300056#GGG00400"><p>It has been positive to see the joint Oireachtas committee report on pensions has created debate around the retirement age and broader issues related to pensions and the funding of them into the future.  A key issue for the committee in overcoming our pension challenge over the next 50 years is the introduction of legislation banning mandatory retirement in employment contracts to apply to new contracts and, retrospectively, to current work contracts.  It would give people the option to go beyond their present retirement age, if they so wish.  It is the view of the committee members that it would be wrong to force people to retire at 65 and have them wait until 68 to access their pension.  While some preliminary figures were available to the committee on the potential costings of providing a social welfare payment to people between their 65th birthday and accessing the State pension at 68, these could not be robustly extrapolated into costs for the State for such replacement supports.</p>  <p>  The bigger issue is if we remove the requirement to retire at 65, many workers will continue to remain in employment.</p> <p>This is not just because of the changing nature of work, especially here in Ireland, where we are moving from more manual employment to technological and even remote-based work, which allows people to continue to work longer, but also because some of the financial realities of living in Ireland today mean that people will have to work longer to be financially secure in their retirement.  According to the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, the average borrower age is now 40, with an average loan term of 22 years.  The Central Bank of Ireland has highlighted in a report on household lending that almost 50% of new first-time buyer loans in the first half of 2018 had a loan term of between 30 and 34 years.  These facts mean that people have little time left after clearing their mortgages to build up personal savings before they retire.</p> <p> Furthermore, many more people are starting their first full-time jobs well into their 20s, which will leave them short on receiving a full contributory State pension by their 65th birthday.  The committee considered a technical paper produced by the Commission on Pensions.  It pointed out that "While increasing the State pension age has the greatest impact on reducing [pension] expenditure, a substantial increase in the employment rate of older workers, of 10 percentage points by 2070, would [...] reduce future expenditure".  The paper points out the small difference between increasing the pension age to 68 compared with increasing the employment rate of older workers by 10 percentage points over the next 50 years.  In fact, this small difference has already been addressed by the higher participation rates we have seen due to remote working during Covid-19.  Surely if as much effort was put into removing the barriers to facilitating older people working longer as has been put into pushing up the retirement age, it would be within our capacity to increase the number of older people working by an average of 0.2 percentage points a year over the next 50 years.</p> <p> An argument has been made that if we were to allow people to work beyond their 65th birthday, the result would be to close off promotion opportunities for younger staff in organisations.  The Civil Service has overcome this challenge for senior positions by filling such posts on a seven-year basis, thus allowing new thinking and younger people to compete for such roles.  There is no reason the private sector could not take a leaf out of the public sector book for a change.  </p> <p> The Social Insurance Fund was in surplus to the tune of some &euro;4 billion at the end of 2019.  It has gone into deficit, as we know, in the last couple of years due to payments for the Covid-19 pandemic.  The Commission on Pensions, in its recommendations, stated that the pension element of the Social Insurance Fund should be put into a separate fund.  These funds should be invested just like private pension funds.  We already made this policy decision when we established the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF.  Do any of the Members remember that?  It was generated from the sale of Telecom &Eacute;ireann and that money was invested in the financial markets through the NPRF until it was cashed in to bail out our banks.  We should put the excess corporation tax receipts into this new fund to kick-start it and put Ireland on a trajectory of a sustainable roadmap for the future of our State pension.</p> <p> The point the committee has made is that we have looked not just at the tightly constrained remit the Commission on Pensions was given, but also at broader issues in this area, including increasing workforce participation rates.  We are saying now that workforce participation rates will not increase to any great extent over the next 50 years.  In two years, we have managed to increase workplace participation rates by 3.1% as a result of the impact of Covid-19.  We did so by introducing flexible working arrangements that have facilitated more women to participate in the workforce.  Equally, people from rural communities have been facilitated to obtain higher paying jobs in urban areas because they can now work remotely.  We have seen a phenomenal shift in two years.</p> <p> The Minister of State was across the table from me when I was arguing for the benefits of promoting remote working.  Sadly, that argument fell on deaf ears at the time.  We had to have a pandemic to see the difference remote working can make and is making.  In two years, remote working has changed the baseline on which all the projections put forward by the Commission on Pensions were based.  As I have argued today, using the current baseline and supporting older people to work beyond their 65th birthday would bring in the same amount of money as increasing the pension age to 68.  Surely it makes far more sense to support older people and give them the dignity of being able to continue to work, rather than forcing them into retirement at 65 to go and draw a social welfare payment.  It is wrong to tell people who have worked hard all their lives that at the end of that time, they must go and draw a social welfare payment for three years until they get their pensions.  There are other options.  We can support and encourage those people to continue to work.  Let us, for once and for all, get rid of this archaic law that prescribes that people must retire when they reach 65.</p> <p> I will be told that this cannot be done because legislation cannot be applied retrospectively.  Over the last decade, we have seen that this can be done.  People's pensions were reduced to deal with the financial situation we experienced.  We have seen examples where things were done in the last two years that we had been told were constitutionally impossible.  If the willingness is there to do it, we can bring forward this legislation.  This single measure will do more to address the pension deficit we will have in the next 50 years than tinkering with any retirement age.</p></speech>
