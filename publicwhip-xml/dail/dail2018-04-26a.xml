The Minister knows the CAP represents up to 75% of average farm incomes and it is absolutely crucial that the budget be maintained.  There is a tremendous onus on the Minister to do everything within his capacity at a European level to ensure the budget is protected.  I look forward to hearing what steps he is taking to achieve that objective.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-26a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600003#A00700"><p>The future of the CAP is of enormous importance for the agriculture sector in Ireland and across Europe.  The CAP has evolved considerably and very effectively in recent years in response to changing market, consumer and environmental demands.  It also plays a central role in delivering the smart, sustainable and inclusive growth sought under the Europe 2020 strategy.  It is important that the CAP continues to evolve in a way that supports the achievement of European priorities, particularly in the context of securing a strong CAP budget for the post-2020 period.  This can only be achieved by reinforcing the relevance and effectiveness of the policy in helping to achieve broader societal goals.  This is something that I strongly believe in and will continue to actively pursue at Council level as the debate on the future CAP and its budget intensifies over the coming months.</p>  <p>  There will be budgetary challenges arising not only from the UK decision to exit the European Union but also from the need to address other EU policy challenges such as those relating to migration, security and growth.  In that regard, the CAP should not be seen as a policy of the past, and it is already addressing some of these new challenges.  The Taoiseach, in his address to the European Parliament in January 2018, already indicated that Ireland is open to contributing more to the EU budget but only if the money is spent on policies that contribute to the advancement of the European ideal.  More clarity will be provided next Wednesday, 2 May, when the European Commission publishes its multi-annual financial framework, MFF, proposals.</p>  <p>  Key to delivering as strong a CAP budget as possible is ensuring that we form alliances with like-minded member states where it is possible.  In that context, I regularly meet my European ministerial colleagues at the Council of European Agriculture Ministers and separately in more formal bilateral meetings.  In that regard, on 16 April, I met the Austrian Agriculture Minister while on 25 April I met the Dutch Agriculture Minister.  This will be followed by meetings with the French, Germany and Danish Ministers on 2 May and 3 May.  These meetings give me the opportunity to discuss future CAP policy and funding.  Ultimately, the approval of the MFF is a matter for the European Council and it will be ratified by the European Parliament.</p></speech>

The next number of weeks will be crucial politically in how the Minister addresses this matter.</p>  <p>  There may be up to 20 member states that at this stage have indicated a willingness to increase the budget to ensure there is no cut in the CAP or other programmes.  With Brexit and the resulting &euro;3 billion hole, there is immediate pressure on the budget, even before we consider the pressure from other budget lines with requests for increased funding.  Will the Minister outline those countries that are at this stage resisting an increase to the budget?  It is absolutely crucial we build alliances with like-minded countries but there is a tremendous onus on the Minister to ensure he engages with those countries that are not yet favourable to increasing the budget so as to impress upon them the importance of them contributing more to Irish agriculture, especially in light of the impact of Brexit on the agriculture sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-26a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600003#A00900"><p>To the best of my knowledge, the outliers, if I might use that term in the context of those resisting a commitment to increasing the budget contribution, include the Dutch, the Danes, the Austrians and, if I am not mistaken, the Swedes.  As the Taoiseach stated, we are committed to contributing more to the EU budget.  The Deputy's figures relating to the consequences of the UK departure are slightly conservative, as this could be in excess of &euro;4 billion.  As I stated, yesterday I had a meeting with the Dutch Minister and I have had bilateral meetings with the Danish and Austrian Ministers.  I engage on a rolling basis in bilateral meetings with all Ministers across Europe, and I will continue to do so.  Officials in my Department also meet their counterparts.</p>  <p>  This is of enormous financial importance.  The point is very often lost that we are net contributors to the EU budget; we pay more than we receive.  However, in the agriculture area, the pattern in skewed in the other direction and we get more from the CAP than we contribute to that budget.  It is very important and we are working effectively and diligently to try to ensure an adequately funded CAP.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-26a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600003#A01000"><p>The backdrop to this is of exceptional concern.  The European Commission previously indicated a range of options that could mean cuts of anything from zero to 30% in the CAP budget.</p><p>In recent days, Commissioner Oettinger outlined a potential cut of 6% in the CAP budget.  It is crucial that the percentage of the budget ring-fenced for CAP remains so dedicated.  The overall budget must be maintained and there must be no slippage in terms of the percentage of the European budget which goes towards agriculture.</p> <p> Documents relating to the next programme from the European Commission regarding the framework for CAP were leaked recently.  A &euro;60,000 maximum for single farm payments is outlined in these documents.  Will the Minister back that cap given that he has failed to achieve the commitment in the programme for Government to reduce the maximum cap to &euro;100,000?  The onus is on him to ensure that he uses his offices to achieve the &euro;60,000 cap.</p> <p> As regards the option for co-financing of Pillar 1 payments, our objective must be to ensure it comes from the central European budget.  However, in a worst-case scenario where that does not happen, is the Minister open to co-financing Pillar 1 payments at State level to ensure that there will be no decrease in farmers' payments?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-26a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600004#B00200"><p>On the latter point, I ask the Deputy to reflect on the fact that we are absolutely resisting the co-financing of Pillar 1 payments because that would skew the performance of the Internal Market and the commonality of the agricultural policy.  We must resist co-financing at every opportunity because it could mean that rich member states could put their hands in their pockets and supplement their farmers to the disadvantage of other member states.  One of our core objectives is to remain the commonality of CAP.</p>  <p>  On capping, we exhausted all opportunities in the context of the programme for Government commitment, which it was not possible to achieve within the current CAP.  There is resistance across Europe to reducing the cap below &euro;150,000.  We are supportive of a reduced cap and we welcome the content in the-----</p></speech>

However, that is not the end of it and these matters will develop in the coming months.  We have categorically stated that we are prepared to increase our contribution.  We have also stated that we acknowledge that Europe faces new challenges in terms of security, etc., but that such new challenges require new money rather than raiding the budget of an existing and successful policy.</p></speech>

Specifically, in the context of the basic payments under Pillar 1, the traditional method of referring to 2000 or 2001 to decide the amount of payment farmers will receive is almost 20 years old.  Most farmers understand that it does not work anymore and a new system must be put in place.  Is the Government prepared to consider the possibility of a flat-rate payment per hectare, some of which would be front-loaded to ensure that smallholders get the best payment possible in order to secure family farms?</p></reply>

It is critically important that the CAP of the future serves all citizens of the European Union.  It must support family farms and underpin the production of food to the highest standards of quality and safety.  It will also be required to contribute to environmental sustainability and the development of rural areas.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure that I have heard the views of Irish citizens on the future of CAP, in January of this year, I launched a public consultation process which included a series of public meetings as well as an opportunity to make written submissions.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the various potential options for the future distribution of CAP payments, including consideration of a flat-rate payment system.  In that regard, officials from my Department are currently assessing all possibilities around the effective targeting of direct payments in the context of CAP post 2020.</p>  <p>  We are all interested stakeholders when it comes to our future food supply and the protection of our environment.  With that in mind, my officials and I will continue to engage with the European Commission and other member states regarding the future CAP framework.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-26a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600004#B00800"><p>It is welcome that the Minister is considering the distribution of CAP payments and what options are available in that regard.  We have had this discussion many times in the House and at committee.  The current situation whereby entitlements are bought, sold, leased and used as commodities of a sort is inappropriate.  We must have a flat-rate payment across the board in order that a farmer knows what payment he or she will receive for every hectare of his or her farm and those with smaller holdings would understand that this would be front-loaded such that the first 10 ha or 15 ha would attract a higher payment, with a lower payment thereafter.  That would ensure that very large-scale farms would not get the benefit of a huge basic farm payment and smaller-scale farms would be able to ensure their sustainability.  That is the issue.  Many farmers on small holdings cannot survive.  It is very difficult for them.</p>  <p>  An interesting issue raised this morning was that of hobby and genuine farmers and what constitutes a genuine farmer.  A farmer who is utilising all his or her land is a genuine farmer.  Such farmers may not be able to make a living from that and may require off-farm income but they are still genuine farmers.</p></speech>

We will have greater discretion.  There is an appealing simplicity to the argument advanced by Deputy Kenny but there are concerns that such a system could skew payments in favour of large landholders who may currently have lower payments, to the disadvantage of smallholders.  We must be careful in this area.  If a farmer has a couple of thousand hectares in the plains of Meath, Kildare or elsewhere, which, I acknowledge, is not the case being advanced by Deputy Martin Kenny-----</p></speech>

The flat-rate payment would relatively benefit a smallholder in the west of Ireland.  We must ensure greater equity.  I have heard the argument advanced that the entitlement agreed almost 20 years ago should no longer be relevant but we must bear in mind that in all iterations of CAP since then, we have continued to move away from that.  Under the current CAP, through convergence we will have moved over &euro;105 million in the period up to 2020 from those with high average payments to those with low average payments.  The question is whether we should throw out that system entirely or accelerate the journey towards convergence and bringing the lower payments up and the higher payments down.  A lot of modelling must be done on that to ensure that we make the right decision.  I am committed to ensuring that we protect the farmers for whom Deputy Martin Kenny is articulating a case for but we must be conscious that model could have unintended consequences.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-26a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600004#B01200"><p>I am trying not only to protect the farmers whose case I am putting forward but also to enhance their position.  Many farmers on smaller holdings have not gotten a fair crack of the whip.  Going back to 2001 or 2002, farmers in the west of Ireland who had a few suckling cows discovered that their farms were not intensive enough to be able to receive the entitlements they deserved, whereas farmers with better land in other parts of the country who were farming more intensively received larger entitlements.  That is the imbalance in all of this.  At the centre of CAP is the question as to whether it exists to support production or the family farm.  That is the decision we must make.  I advocate that it should be both but that the family farm must be the primary concern because consumers want their produce to come from family farms, not industrial farms.  Most people across Europe understand that.  We do not have industrial farms in Ireland and we should not go in that direction because it would not put us in a good place in terms of marketing our produce.  In that context, it is very important that Pillar 1 be used to support the basic income of the family farmer.  The vast majority of family farmers in my area and parts of Donegal, Leitrim and Sligo probably receive between &euro;4,000 and &euro;5,000 on the basic farm payment.  That must be increased by at least 50% in order to ensure those farms are sustainable into the future.  There is an opportunity in these CAP negotiations to do that.</p></speech>

I agree with many of the views he has expressed.  The question proposes a flat-rate system in lieu of the current entitlements regime, which dates back almost 20 years.  However, one must bear in mind that a flat-rate system may further disadvantage many such smallholders.  There may be-----</p></speech>

I welcome this exchange because these are the dilemmas we need to address.  I think everybody approaches these with good intentions.  We need to protect the family farm.  We also need to ensure that we protect active farmers.  We need to protect the edifice that is the Irish agrifood industry.  Production is important.  Trying to find a balance between all those competing objectives is a challenge in the context of ensuring that we have an adequate budget.  We need to scope out all of the issues in the context of the submissions we received and that is under way in my Department.</p></speech>

Food Wise 2025 identifies competitiveness as a key theme and includes a recommendation that stakeholders work to "Improve access to finance for agriculture, forestry and seafood producers and Agri-food companies".</p>  <p>  I launched a new Brexit loan scheme on 28 March in co-operation with the Ministers for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and Finance, which will provide up to &euro;300 million of affordable, flexible working capital to businesses that are currently affected by Brexit or that will be in the future.  The scheme will be available to SMEs and mid-cap businesses.  My Department&rsquo;s funding model ensures that at least 40% of the fund will be available to food businesses, particularly in light of their unique exposure to the UK market.  The finance will be easier to access, more competitively priced, at a proposed interest rate of 4% and at more favourable terms than current offerings.  This will give Brexit-affected businesses time and space to adapt and grow into the future.  The scheme will remain open until 31 March 2020.</p>  <p>  I announced in budget 2018 that my Department is considering the development of potential Brexit response loan schemes for farmers and fishermen and for longer-term capital financing for food businesses.  These schemes are developed and delivered in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, and take time to develop and operationalise.  Consideration and discussions are ongoing in this regard and I will announce further details as they become available.</p>  <p>  While continuing to explore additional funding mechanisms, I also liaise with the main banks on issues relating to the agrifood sector, all of which have specialised products available and have expressed a commitment to servicing the future financing needs of the sector.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about a &euro;25 million low-cost loan scheme.  The &euro;25 million is the cost to the Exchequer of the scheme.  This money will come from my Department's Estimate.  I anticipate that the loan fund will be multiples of that, as was the case in the initial venture we had here and the &euro;150 million low-cost loan scheme.  It is my intention that the criteria relating to the scheme will be published in 2018.</p></speech>

The month of May is approaching and the Minister has still given no commitment as to when the money from this scheme will become available.  There is a serious cashflow crisis in all sectors.  The horticulture sector suffered extreme difficulties with frost, wind and extreme rain during the winter months.  Tillage farmers suffered hugely and we have debated providing assistance to them a number of times in the past six to 12 months.  It is the same with the dairy and dry suckler sectors.  There is huge pressure for working capital.  Farmers are extremely anxious to know when the money will be made available.  The Minister's reply was extremely vague.  On the previous occasion, this was given over 100% to the main banks.  Some of those who needed funding most did not receive it.  There has to be Government intervention this time in order to ensure that those who are strapped for cash and under extreme pressure for credit are able to avail of these low-cost loans.  The Minister referred to an interest rate of 4% for businesses.  On the previous occasion, the rate was 2.95% and this should be maintained for farmers.</p>  <p>  We are receiving numerous requests that fodder scheme announced by the Minister be extended in view of the fact that poor weather conditions and poor growth continue to obtain.  I ask him to consider extending the date for the fodder scheme.</p></speech>

My Department is engaged in consultations with the SBCI on that matter.  The previous scheme was, as the Deputy said, a working capital scheme.  An interest rate of 2.95% applied on that occasion, but the trade-off between the interest is in the volume of the fund that one can leverage.  There was more demand in respect of previous funds than there was funding available.  The outturn in respect of the previous fund was &euro;150 million and there were 4,246 approved borrowers.  The average loan was &euro;34,000 and the average loan period was 41 months.  If we opt for a lower interest rate, we will have a smaller fund.  This scheme was oversubscribed.  The question is what is most advantageous and whether it is a working capital or a capital investment fund to assist on-farm investment in primary production or the fishing industry.  These issues are being teased through.  We have had the initial &euro;150 million.  We have &euro;300 million now for SMEs.  I am trying to get this done as quickly as possible.  It is not simply a case of having &euro;25 million and therefore having a scheme.  It takes much engagement with the European Investment Bank, the SBCI, the pillar banks here and the Department of Finance.  There are many moving parts.  I am trying to get it as quickly as possible but it will likely be the back end of the year.</p></speech>

When that was announced, I said that the money available would not be enough to meet demand.  I was ridiculed when I said it.  Unfortunately, my finger was on the pulse and the amount of subscribers for that scheme greatly exceeded the money available.  The Minister talked about whether this is for working capital or long-term capital investment.  The reality is that all sectors are under pressure for working capital.  Merchant credit is also a major issue.  Co-operatives and private businesses are carrying much of that credit at the moment but they will not be able to carry it in the medium to long term.  In the aftermath of the extreme weather conditions over the past six to eight months, the real pressure is for working capital.  The Minister must recognise that.  This scheme needs to be skewed in that way for people who are under immediate pressure to clear their bills.  On the past couple of occasions we had the opportunity to discuss these issues, we referred to the mental pressure on farmers and farm families.  Farmers being able to clear their bills would be a major achievement in relieving that pressure.  If farmers get access to working capital, they would be able to achieve that objective.</p></speech>

I appreciate that this has to be paid back.  The dilemma we face is the competing demands for capital investment as opposed to working capital.  We are trying to work through that in the Department.  This is a space that the State should not be in but it reflects that we do not have, relative to our competitors, competitive financial products available to Irish farmers at a cost comparable with other member states in the European Union.  We are trying to address a gap in the market by developing a new product that meets that.</p></speech>

One of my priorities as Minister is to improve access to finance for the agrifood sector.  I announced in budget 2018 that my Department is considering the development of potential Brexit response loan schemes for the primary sector, to include farmers and fishermen.  The schemes are developed and delivered in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, and take time to develop and operationalise.  Consideration and discussions are ongoing in that regard and I will announce further details on this as they become available.  While continuing to explore additional funding mechanisms, I also liaise with the main banks on issues relating to the agrifood sector, all of whom have specialised products available and have expressed a commitment to servicing the future financing needs of the sector.</p>  <p>  I understand that the specific ACRE and Cultivate loan packages recently launched by a number of credit unions in Munster are entirely commercial activities by the credit unions concerned and the Government has no role in the matter.</p>  <p>  My Department's &euro;240 million European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, Operational Programme for the seafood sector is providing a range of support measures to the inshore fisheries sector.  A dedicated fund of &euro;6 million is available to inshore fishermen to invest in adding value to their catch, for stock conservation measures such as v-notching, to support the work of the inshore fisheries forums and a range of other measures set out in the inshore fisheries conservation scheme, administered by BIM.  Grants of up to 80% are available for those purposes.  Separately, grants of up to 70% are available to inshore fishermen under the sustainable fisheries scheme for investment on board in selective gear, in quality, hygiene, energy efficiency and value adding equipment.  Grants of 30% are available under that scheme for engine replacement.  Under the new fishermen scheme, grants of 25% are available to young inshore fishermen to purchase their first fishing boat.  BIM also makes available to fishermen a broad range of advisory services on matters such as business planning and environmental management.  I believe that this wide range of supports under the EMFF programme clearly demonstrates my commitment to assisting the inshore sector to develop and prosper.</p></speech>

Inshore fishermen have had one of the longest and worst winters in living memory.  I have spoken to quite a few fishermen in west Cork and that is the feedback I have got.  They are facing substantial losses as the lobster and crab season is very slow to take off due to the low water temperature.  Fishermen lost tens of thousands of euro worth of pots and materials and now face the prospect of having to take out personal loans.  They need help at this time.  Could the Minister work with the banks to help those hard-working people?</p></speech>

It is a signal that there is a degree of competition emerging to the main pillar banks.  That is very welcome.  Many credit unions are active in sub-branch networks in coastal areas and that is very important.</p>  <p>  The scheme I am developing, to which I referred in response to Deputy Cahill, is one that will be available to the fisheries sector as well.  Through that, the competition that is emerging in financial services in terms of the credit union movement, which I welcome, and the funding that is available in the EMFF programme by means of grant aid assistance means there is a range of financial products and supports available to the inshore sector.  I meet regularly with the National Inshore Fisheries Forum where we have an opportunity to discuss the issues.</p></speech>

I spoke to one fisherman who is trying to take out a personal loan of &euro;10,000 to do up his punt and to replace the pots he has lost.  The loan puts himself and his family under incredible pressure.  I would appreciate if the Minister would speed up the development of the scheme to which he refers because it is hugely important to inshore fishermen.  They are hard-working people.  The Minister knows as well as I do the number of hours they put in and the dangers associated with their job.  They have to ensure their punts are top quality to cope with the rough water they face and the long hours they spend at sea.  There was a terrible storm in October which cost many of them tens of thousands of euro and they are now trying to replace what they have lost.  The fishermen cannot go back out on the water because the water temperature is very low so their catch is at an all-time low.  They are in severe difficulty at this time and I would appreciate if the Minister would work very quickly to provide a scheme to try to help them.</p></speech>

It is not an easy scheme to design.  The issue that must be worked out is whether it is for working capital or for capital investment.  I am engaged with all the actors, including the pillar banks, arising from their experience of the previous loan fund, which I accept was not targeted at the fisheries sector.  This one will be, and we can benefit from their experience and where they see the market shortfall.  I am talking to the SBCI about the interest rate relative to the size of the fund.  Such issues require a lot of consideration before we bring a product to market but we will do so as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

The group has already met twice and I expect will report back later this year with a detailed report and recommendations to drive the growth of the sector.</p>  <p>  The terms of reference of the group are: to review the implementation of the 2013 to 2015 action plan; to assess the case for a targeted reopening of the organic farming scheme; and to draft a new strategic plan for the development of the organic sector up to 2025.</p>  <p>  The new strategic plan will feed into the new rural development plan and Food Wise 2025.  A public consultation process has been initiated by my Department and the deadline for receipt of submissions is 31 May of this year.  Further details can be found on my Department's website.</p>  <p>  This is an opportunity for all interested parties to contribute to the development of the new strategic plan for the sector.  This strategy will incorporate sectoral and cross-sectoral recommendations, market developments, training and education, public awareness and wider EU policy.  It is critical that stakeholders make their views known before the finalisation of this strategy, which aims to build on progress made, and provide clear direction for further development of the organic sector for the next seven years.</p>  <p>  The current organic farming scheme under the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 has proven to be extremely successful, attracting more new applicants than any previous scheme, and encouraging a significant number of Irish farmers to convert to organic farming systems.  This is a co-funded scheme, supported jointly through the rural development programme by the EU and the Irish Exchequer.  At this point in time, the budget allocated to the new scheme in Ireland&rsquo;s rural development programme has been fully committed and all targets set for the scheme within the RDP have already been achieved.  Any possible reopening of the scheme could only be considered in the context of the available budget in the overall rural development programme.</p>  <p>  With regard to the extent of organic production in Ireland, there are currently 2,127 organic operators, of whom more than 1,700 are farmers.  The latest figures indicate that there are now some 72,000 ha under organic production, which is an increase of nearly 50% on the position at the start of the programme in 2014.</p></reply>

It is difficult to make a contribution to the consultation when one does not know the Minister's views.  The Minister of State outlined that 1.7% of land in this country is in organic production at the moment.  The average in the European Union is 7%.  Does he think we should have that level of ambition and that we should grow to meet the European average?  We could go further.  Should we aim to be like the Italians, Spanish, French or Germans who have up to 20% of their land in organic production?  Where are we going?  What is the scale of ambition that the Minister seeks to reach?  That is what must come first rather than referring to the caveat that it must be within the budget of the rural development fund.</p><p>Obviously, it has to be within the budget but it is the Government that sets the ambition.  If they are to come back with a consultation against an empty space where there is no clear vision for what the Government wants to do, given that there is significant demand as the Minister of State himself would admit, a significantly growing market and significant benefits in a variety of ways, what is the scale of his ambition for organic farming in Ireland?</p></speech>

We have doubled it.  The target at that time was 5%, set by the Deputy's former colleague and my predecessor, then Minister of State, Mr. Trevor Sargent.  The scheme, when it was reopened, took in everybody who applied.  It was the highest intake ever.  It was unprecedented.  Everybody who was in the scheme had their plan rolled right to 2020.  That is why there are 1,700 farmers in it.  We more than doubled the budget, from &euro;4.5 million to &euro;10 million.  The reason that the public consultation period is so short is to try to ensure we receive proposals at an appropriate time this year from the group.</p>  <p>  I also acknowledge the work of its predecessor, the organic focus group, which set targets, all of which were achieved.  We are growing in the right direction.  The purpose of the strategy is to set out some of the answers to the questions the Deputy has raised.</p></speech>

If the Minister of State opened an unencumbered scheme tomorrow, as he stated, he would see ten times that number applying.</p>  <p>  There are real questions as to how we would do it to develop horticulture and tillage, as well as beef and sheep, which have been particularly popular up to this point.  In any consultation process, however, we must know what is the scale of ambition.  Where does the Minister of State want to go?  I accept it doubled from &euro;4 million to &euro;10 million but to be honest, we are spending that amount of money marketing, on a single trade mission trip over to Japan or whatever, that we are an Origin Green country.  We should be spending ten times that in making this switch because it is one of the main solutions that will help Irish agriculture get out of the crisis it is in at present.  It helps us on water quality, carbon emissions and on price to family farms.  There is a myriad of different benefits.  In my mind, &euro;10 million is not the scale of support we should be giving.  I am keen to hear the Minister of State's vision as to where we should go, rather than it merely being a blank space into which we are consulting.</p></speech>

There are areas the Deputy has identified.  We could open up a scheme without having it clearly defined.  There are impediments in the current structure that are restricting expansion in the sector.  The Deputy mentioned tillage and cereals.  One of the main inhibiting factors is that 32% of all lamb produced organically ends up sold organically because the cost of buying imported supplementary feed is such that it does not render it economically worthwhile to pursue organic sales beyond the grass-fed lambs.  That is the sort of area we need to look at when we are looking at scoping out a new scheme.  We could open a scheme without consideration to any of those matters and it would not be effective.  We need to ensure, if the scheme is reopened, that it is targeted in a way that makes it effective.</p></speech>

Total agrifood exports amounted to &euro;13.6 billion in 2017, according to the Central Statistics Office trade statistics, an increase of 74% since 2009.</p><p>In 2017, meat exports totalled almost &euro;3.8 billion, including beef exports of &euro;2.4 billion in 2017, a 6% increase on 2016; and pigmeat exports of &euro;790 million in 2017, an 8% increase on 2016.  Poultry exports were &euro;275 million and sheepmeat exports reached &euro;310 million last year.</p><p>My officials continue to work towards opening and enhancing access to as many markets as possible.  This is a key part of our response to the challenges and uncertainty posed by Brexit and in line with the market development theme of the Food Wise 2025 strategy.  A wide range of staff members across my Department are involved in market access work, which is co-ordinated by an internal high-level market access committee chaired by assistant secretary.  In April 2017, I announced a seven-point plan towards increasing market access and I am satisfied that good progress is being made on this plan.  At my Department's request, Bord Bia has undertaken a major data-based market profiling exercise for potential third-country markets for Irish exports.  The initial results were launched at the Food Wise conference last December and this will help inform the Department's market access work.  A website portal with information on market access and certification conditions across meat and other products is currently being finalised and expected to be launched in the coming weeks.  An intensified programme of trade missions to promote Irish food and drink on European Union and third-country markets is under way.  Since last year, trade missions have taken place: to USA and Mexico in June 2017, Japan and South Korea in November  2017, USA and Canada in February 2018 and Turkey in March 2018.  During my St. Patrick's Day visit to London, I undertook a series of important meetings with the UK retail sector.  The next mission, to China and Hong Kong, will take place in mid-2018.  Meat market access has been a major feature of these trade missions, including an application for pigmeat access in Mexico.  In addition, an application for sheepmeat access to Japan which is under way, as well as slow but steady progress regarding beef access in South Korea.</p><p><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></p><p>The recent opening of the Chinese market for Irish beef and the Saudi Arabian market for Irish sheepmeat are just some examples of the success that have been achieved.  In both cases some technical work remains to be completed before trade can commence.  Working to open major markets for Irish beef and other meats is a process that can often take a number of years, as opposed to weeks or months, with the timeframe being determined by the importing country.  It involves a wide range of detailed work taking place across a range of levels including political, diplomatic, technical and official levels.</p></speech>

It has taken quite a period to get to that stage.  There have been a number of inspections etc. and there seems to be a time lag in that regard.  Can the Minister give an indication of what processes are required to move along a bit faster?  Can he indicate when the first beef will be exported to China, how much will be involved and what are the targets for this year, next year and subsequently?  Also, which cuts are involved?  Apart from the Chinese market, in what other markets does the Minister envisage there might be opportunities in the future?</p></speech>

It involves a lot of political engagement, a lot of technical engagement in my Department and a lot of diplomatic effort.  I acknowledge the enormous assistance that we were given in that context by the Chinese ambassador in Dublin.  My Department has officials in the embassy in Beijing who are continuously engaged with the Chinese authorities in terms of the effort.</p>  <p>  There is an extensive level of engagement with the authorities of any individual country in terms of the requirements of that market.  We have to meet the requirements of every individual market we are working to access, whether for beef in Korea, beef in China or beef in America or any other product.</p>  <p>  We are confident as an industry that our product meets the highest international standards and we are conscious that we export our reputation with every item of food that we send abroad.  Nonetheless, we still must meet their requirements and their technical specifications and that is the reason for a lot of engagement with various agencies, such as AQSIQ and CNCA, which are the two agencies in China.  There has been some change in respect of those agencies in recent times but it is an extensive ongoing engagement that fortunately has borne fruit now.  Hopefully, the industry will follow shortly in terms of export details.  There are some minor detail on our side to be resolved but I expect product to move in the second half of this year.</p></speech>

How much does he expect this year?  Is there any indication in that regard?  That is the Chinese market.</p><p>In what other markets does the Minister see possibilities in the future?  Is the Japanese market a possibility?</p><p>What type of beef cuts would be a priority in these markets?</p></speech>

If one can get a better price there, there is an opportunity to raise the overall price for the carcass, which has to be good for the primary producer.</p>  <p>  I am reluctant to put a volume on the amount of beef that could move to this market.</p><p>China has quickly become the second biggest market for Irish dairy exports and also for pork exports.  Could it become the same for beef?  Who knows.  It is important now that the industry, with the assistance of An Bord Bia, works collectively with all of us to try to ensure we secure an important foothold there.  The industry has been very active in anticipation of that.  I hope the volume will increase.  In respect of other markets, we have access already in Japan and we are looking to see if we can get the 30 month restriction lifted.  We have ongoing engagement with Korea, including very recently.  It is a significant market we are not in currently.  We would like to get access.  We are engaged continuously in efforts to increase market access, and it is informed now by Bord Bia's work in respect of prioritisation.</p></speech>

This followed an increase of 3.6% in 2016.  The value of goods output for the sector increased by 13.6% to &euro;8.016 million.  Teagasc's national farm survey for 2016 showed that average family farm income was &euro;23,848, which is made up of an average of &euro;46,561 for fulltime farmers and &euro;11,086 for part-time farmers.  It should also be noted that there are significant differences in family farm income depending on the system of farming and the size of the farm. </p>  <p>  Teagasc's detailed national farm survey for 2017 will be published next month.  Teagasc estimated last December that average farm income for 2017 could reach almost &euro;32,000, which would represent an average increase of 30% over 2016.  Aggregate and average farm income is not calculated at county level, so it is not possible to give details of farm income for County Kildare.  The Food Wise 2025 strategy includes actions to support farmers in improving the competitiveness and profitability of their enterprises.  This includes actions aimed at helping farmers to manage the impact of price volatility; improving productivity and adapting new technology; and incentivising land mobility and farm restructuring.  These supports will make Irish farm enterprises more competitive and sustainable and maximise their contribution to regional and local rural economies.</p>  <p>  There are a number of competitiveness recommendations and actions being progressed through the Food Wise 2025 high level implementation committee, HLIC.  I chair the committee, which is made up of high level representatives from all the relevant Departments and State agencies.  It reviews progress on the detailed actions on a quarterly basis.  Stakeholders regularly present to the committee on priorities for particular sectors or themes and competitiveness will be a theme for the June meeting.  I will also be publishing Steps to Success 2018, the third progress report of Food Wise 2025, in July and this will include a report on progress on the various competitiveness actions.</p></speech>

Our response has been measured and appropriate in the context of an ongoing developing situation.  We will continue to observe and respond accordingly if it is considered that it is required to extend the fodder scheme.  The Deputies will be aware that all the indicators of grass growth in the past week have been significantly ahead.  That is ultimately the solution to the fodder crisis.  However, as I said, it is something we keep under review.</p>  <p>  I take Deputy Durkan's point concerning how we protect farm incomes.  What is obvious is that 2017 farm incomes will be exceptionally high.  However, taken in the round, what is also abundantly clear is that there is exceptional volatility in farm incomes.  In the context of the question tabled by Deputy McConalogue on CAP, one of the things we need to look at is how we address volatility in the context of the policy instruments available to us through the CAP.  The industry is doing a lot, particularly on the dairy side, on fixed price and fixed margin contracts etc.  That is important.  However, are there other things we can do?  It is no use singing off the rooftops because 2017 dairy farm incomes were high when we all see now that the price of milk, allied with increased costs associated with the weather, is going to show this is a very challenged sector at the moment.  It is likewise with livestock, although prices may be strong at the moment.  We must address volatility and not take a particular snapshot at a moment in time that can be skewed one way or another.</p></speech>

This record allocation together with the fund raising efforts of the animal welfare charities will greatly assist their work in the course of 2018.  While some recipients are focused on only one species others do not restrict their welfare mission.  Therefore, it is not possible to set out a species by species break down of this support.</p><p>My Department provides funding for the development of education and training programmes for horse owners, including new structures to provide shelter for the urban horse population with the aim of reducing the number of straying animals and encouraging young people in the care and welfare of horses.  Funding of over &euro;172,000 was allocated last year and this funding continues to be available into 2018.  More recently my Department has awarded a tender to operate an education program with a focus on welfare for sulky drivers and trotter horse owners.  This will take place in a number of locations around the country. </p><p>My Department also underpins animal welfare by ensuring and operating a robust legislative base for animal welfare.  I refer in particular to the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013.  The penalties under the Act are as high as can be permitted under our legal system.  Upon summary conviction a person is liable to a fine of up to &euro;5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both, or for conviction on indictment a fine not exceeding &euro;250,000 or imprisonment not exceeding five years, or to both. </p><p>Enforcement has been enhanced by a provision in the Act that allows some investigative powers to be granted to persons outside my Department, including the Irish Society for the Prevention to Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA, and the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, DSPCA.  This arrangement is working well and has led to a significant number of successful prosecutions. <br/><br/>Other measures undertaken by my Department to support animal welfare include the continued operations of the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council, a multi-stakeholder group that meets on a regional basis and includes representatives of farmers, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, veterinarians and welfare groups.  This has been very successful in its regional forum in acting as an early warning system.  Where natural and weather events have led to problems in certain locations my Department has acted quickly and effectively to bring emergency supplies to particular premises where feed has been an issue.<br/><br/>I should add that my Department operates a confidential animal welfare helpline through which members of the public can report incidents of animal cruelty and neglect for investigation: call save 0761 064408 or 01 6072379.  All calls received are followed up as appropriate. <br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>Traceability and identification are important aspects of animal ownership that underpin the welfare of animals.  Good progress has been made in recent years in dog microchipping.  Adherence to the equine identification rules is evidenced by the significant number of passports that continue to be issued by the passport issuing organisations.</p></speech>

To what extent has it been possible to identify breaches in animal welfare and how were they detected in the course of the past 12 months?  What animals were most often found to be at risk of breaches in animal welfare, including equines, both horses and donkeys, and to what extent has it been possible to intervene positively at that stage?</p></speech>

To date, 47 cases have been prosecuted, and 27 are currently ongoing.  I consider that resorting to the courts is in many cases a reflection of failure.  What is unseen and happens regularly with these authorised officers and Department officials is they engage directly with cases where there is alleged abuse and try to work with owners to ensure these issues are addressed rather than having to resort to the courts.  However, there are incidents where it is required, in the public interest an in the interests of animal welfare, to proceed with prosecutions.  I am pleased to say that the courts have taken a very appropriate response in terms of the cases presented and there have been successful contributions which should act as a deterrent in other cases.</p></speech>

Would it be possible to identify well in advance areas of potential abuse with a view to ensuring, for instance, that equines do not wander out onto public roads and thoroughfares as a result of which they may travel quite a long distance, as happened in one particular case in the very recent past?</p></speech>

Where horses stray onto public grounds and are abandoned or maltreated, it is, in the first instance, the function of the local authority, under the Control of Horses Act, to move in those circumstances.  I appreciate there have been a number of high profile incidents, which have been subject of particular comment on social media, and which has been used as a reference point to point to the fact that nothing is being done, but that is not the case.  I would like to see more activity from local authorities where the issue of horses, which have been either abandoned or abused, straying onto public grounds arises.  Local authorities have powers under that legislation to act.  My Department takes all appropriate action under the 2013 legislation where abuse issues occur in private ownership.</p></speech>

The programme delivers a wide range of supports for aquaculture, fisheries and seafood processing through a suite of 17 schemes.  I have made in excess of  &euro;50 million available to the seafood sector in 2018 through a range of EMFF schemes.  In doing so, I secured a very significant commitment from the Exchequer to this programme.  This means that anything I can do to assist the seafood sector must be through the EMFF programme.</p>  <p>  The EMFF Regulation 508/2014 provides for a special compensation scheme for fishermen experiencing significant economic losses arising from severe storms, etc.  Article 35 foresees the establishment by fishermen of a Mutual Fund for Adverse Climatic Events and Environmental Incidents.  This fund would act as a form of mutual insurance for otherwise uninsurable losses by paying compensation to affiliated fishermen for losses that exceed 30% of the fisherman's annual turnover arising from severe storms and other adverse climatic events, for losses arising from environmental incidents and for the costs of rescue at sea for fishermen or fishing vessels.</p>  <p>  The fund must be established and managed by fishermen and be funded through the subscriptions of affiliated fishermen.  The compensation would only be available to fishermen affiliated to the fund.  Support to the fund from the EMFF programme would be in the form of a contribution to the costs of compensation paid out by the fund.  Depending on the type of vessels or fishermen experiencing losses, EMFF assistance may be as high as 80%.</p>  <p>  To date, no fishing representatives have proposed to me that they wish to take on responsibility for the establishment of a mutual fund.  I cannot lawfully establish the fund on behalf of the sector.  When appropriate representatives of the sector are in a position to establish the fund, my Department and Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, stand ready to assist and advise fishermen and their representatives in any way possible.  However, the EMFF does not permit a financial contribution towards the costs of establishment or management of the fund.  In order for such a fund to be viable, it is likely to be necessary for the fishing sector to strongly support the initiative through widespread affiliation.</p></speech>

That has caused a set back with respect to their working hours, profits and to the sustainability of many of those fishermen and their families.  The programme for Government commits to the developing the blue economy as a priority.  As a result of the long winter and the damage caused by Storm Ophelia, there has been a set back in the development of the blue economy.  Small boats suffered especially and my county of Wexford was very badly hit.  It would have taken many small boats 14 days of consistently getting out to get those pots back in time ahead of that storm without overloading those boats.  That is assuming the weather held well, but at that time fishermen were only getting out three or perhaps four days a week.  They would have needed almost a month's notice to get out and bring their pots back in.  In those circumstances is there anything specific the Minister can do for those fishermen who lost their lobster pots and the crab fishermen and shrimp fishermen who suffered losses to their equipment and a serious financial set-back?</p></speech>

I also thank my colleague, Deputy Browne, for giving me a minute of his time.  I, too, want to highlight the devastating effect Storm Ophelia had on our fishermen.  There has been much talk of its effect on other sectors, and rightly so, but fishermen were very badly affected, especially with regard to lobster and crab pots.  It is important to point out that, as a result of this, there will be a shortage at Christmas of shellfish for restaurants, etc.  Perhaps that is something we should keep in mind and plan for.  I would also like to know the Minister's plans for compensating the fishermen of west Cork, all the way from Courtmacsharry to Castletownbere, who have been very badly affected due to the loss of pots.</p></speech>

The Government is committed to the blue economy.  It is interesting to note that the growth in the blue economy is faster than the growth in the mainstream economy.  I had the privilege yesterday to attend a global seafood fare in Brussels and met representative of the fishing industry, 23 different companies from all around the coast stretching from Malin Head to Mizen Head and all points in between.  They are capitalising on that growth.  I appreciate the sector the Deputies mentioned is critical with respect to the raw material it is bringing to the market.  We stand ready and waiting, but this is an issue that the sector needs to activate.  There is a provision under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, to establish a mutual fund.  We have recently very successfully established the Regional Inshore Fisheries Forums and the national umbrella body, the National Inshore Fisheries Forum, as well as the long established producer organisations, POs, such as the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation and the Irish South &amp;amp; West Fish Producers Organisation, with which the Members will be familiar.</p><p>They need to come together to establish the mutual fund.  We will then be in a position to respond to losses.  I acknowledge that there have been losses to the sector, but this is the vehicle that needs to be activated.</p></speech>

My specific point was on the fishermen who suffered badly in the past season and are still suffering because of losses.  They are experiencing cashflow difficulties in their attempts to keep themselves going.  Theirs is a high-risk job.  They are out there collecting the raw material for our blue economy.  While I am glad that that economy is growing, fishermen, their families and their communities across the country, in particular along the southern and south-eastern coasts, have suffered badly.  Is any retrospective help available for small operators whose equipment has suffered significant damage?</p></speech>

While it is still in its infancy, the National Inshore Fisheries Forum, NIFF, is co-ordinating on needs and is being well used by fishermen.  We will shortly be putting out to public consultation a number of policy matters that are relevant to the livelihoods of those involved in the NIFF.</p>  <p>  However, the solution to the issue in question rests with the EMFF.  This is the first time that we have had a substantial European fund backed by Exchequer funding.  Provision has been made, but I urge those affected to become active in their regional forums before triggering it.  The EMFF may not currently deliver on historical losses, but let us put it in place and ensure that the sector is protected in future.  I appreciate that the kinds of loss the Deputy has mentioned, while not significant in an overall financial context, are significant for the smaller players.  The EMFF is the vehicle, though.  Unfortunately, it has not been activated yet, but we now have the forum and the funds within the EMFF to deal with the situation.  I encourage those fishermen to get active in their regional forums, which are the vehicles through which redress will occur in future.</p></speech>

The latter applies to all animals, whether kept for commercial, domestic, sport, show or other purposes, and contains robust measures against their ill-treatment.  It provides that a person having an animal in his or her possession or control must safeguard and not threaten the health and welfare of that animal.  The Act also provides for increased levels of penalties.</p>  <p>  The position regarding the export of dogs, including greyhounds, is as follows.  The majority of dogs that are moved from Ireland go to the UK and trade within the EU of dogs, including greyhounds, is governed by EU law.  Dogs moved to another EU country from Ireland must be accompanied by an EU pet passport, be microchipped and have a valid rabies vaccination.  The premises exporting dogs must be registered with my Department in advance of the export.  Before travel, dogs must undergo a clinical examination by an authorised veterinarian, who must verify that the animals show no obvious signs of disease and are fit to be transported.  Dogs must also have a health certificate issued by a Department veterinarian.  These procedures, including vaccination, ensure that only healthy dogs over the age of 15 weeks are allowed to be exported.  Exporters must comply with EU law on the protection of animals during transport, while the transport of animals by air is governed by the International Air Transport Association, IATA.  In this context, I am aware that a number of airlines do not transport commercial consignments of greyhounds.</p>  <p>  Bord na gCon, which is responsible for the governance, regulation and development of the greyhound industry, has stated that it does not support the export of greyhounds to destinations that do not conform with the standards in the Animal Health and Welfare Act, the Welfare of Greyhounds Act or its own code of practice and standards.  This is a view that I fully endorse.</p>  <p>  My Department has a close working relationship with animal welfare charities on all aspects of animal welfare.  Officials of the Department have met the welfare members of the International Greyhound Forum, which includes the Dogs Trust, the ISPCA and Bord na gCon, to consider issues surrounding the export of greyhounds.</p>  <p>  I am aware that Deputy Broughan introduced a Private Members' Bill to amend the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 last year.</p></speech>

In broad terms, the Bill seeks to address deficiencies in the existing legislation and the governance of Bord na gCon.  It will strengthen regulatory controls in the industry, modernise sanctions and improve integrity with a view to building a reputation for exceptional regulation in the sector.  It is hoped that a memorandum will go to the Government in the coming weeks, which will request approval to publish the updated general scheme and submit it to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for drafting.</p></speech>

He and his predecessors have told me that dogs have been exported to Argentina, Pakistan and China.  I am always given the mantra that 80% of racing dogs in the UK are Irish, but they end up going from there to other countries.  The problem is that countries with low standards of animal welfare are becoming homes for what are almost our national symbol, namely, our wonderful greyhounds.  Last month, I asked the Minister of State about how one of our famous dogs, Droopys Patrice, had ended up in China.  He told me that no greyhounds were exported directly to China, but that dog was found there.</p>  <p>  Primary legislation needs to be strong on this matter.  If the Minister of State wants, he can insert my Bill straight into his draft Bill or simply adopt mine as a Government Bill and bring it through the Houses.  Either way, we need a white list so that we can ensure our dogs do not end up in places like the Canidrome in Macau.</p></speech>

This includes horses and ponies used in road racing.  Horse owners or keepers who allow harm to come to the animals in their care will have committed an offence under this Act.  The relevant road traffic legislation is also applicable to all road users.</p>  <p>  The issue of regulating sulky racing has been examined by my Department and the issues are complex and not always clear cut, particularly as a variety of horse drawn vehicles are legitimately and safely used on Irish roads.  The approach being taken by my Department is to raise awareness of the importance of good horse welfare amongst sulky participants and the owners and keepers of trotting horses.  </p>  <p>  My Department has recently awarded a tender to operate an education programme that has been designed specifically for sulky drivers and trotter horse owners in a number of locations around the country.  This course will encourage participants to move away from road racing practices and move to racing on tracks and to engage with the regulated sport of harness racing on tracks, as operated by the Irish Harness Racing Association. The course provider has a clear understanding of the cultural sensitivities surrounding participation in road racing.  Meeting these goals will be underpinned by the relevant experience of both the course provider and the team of veterinary surgeons and veterinary nurses that will deliver the course.  The course will be offered to persons involved in trotting and sulky racing on the road.  The first course will commence in the Dublin region in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

Horse ownership, whether in the rural or urban environment, is a very positive thing.  The Minister visited the Clondalkin Equine Club last year and saw for himself the positivity connected with owning horses in an urban environment.  The majority of horse owners are responsible but there have been some examples of reckless behaviour by individuals who have taken part in sulky racing on main roads.  Such behaviour is reckless but the answer is not to ban sulky racing.  Some commentators have suggested that sulky racing be banned but that will not work.  It will simply drive the practice underground.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact that a study of sulky racing is being undertaken.  A few friends of mine attended an event at a sulky track in Portmarnock recently.  That track, which is not widely known about, is very good and very positive for those who use it.</p></speech>

The urban horse is as much a part of the story of the Irish horse and cannot be forgotten or written out.  That said, there is an issue around welfare that is disproportionately evident in that area.  While we have effective legislation in the form of the 2013 Animal Health and Welfare Act, there are complex issues here around the control of horses, for which local authorities have primary responsibility, as well as road traffic issues.  The unregulated nature of sulky racing on public roads poses dangers for horses, their owners and the public at large.  This is a complex area but the aforementioned education initiative is to be welcomed.  We need both the carrot and the stick in this area.  We have the legislative toolbox necessary but we need to ensure all actors involved in the implementation of that legislation live up to their respective responsibilities.</p></speech>

Sometimes urban horse ownership has very negative connotations but it is actually a very positive thing, particularly for young people in working class communities.  Travellers also have been unfairly criticised in the context of horse ownership.</p>  <p>  Once a year in Crossmaglen a regulated sulky racing event takes place.  It is regulated by the police and the local authority in the North.  Perhaps something similar could be organised in the South at some point in the future.  We should regulate sulky racing rather than banning it and forcing it underground.  Regulation will improve safety for the horses and their owners.</p></speech>

We endeavour to work with the national umbrella body for harness racing as well and while I take the point the Deputy makes about Crossmaglen, there are organised and regulated sulky events held in the Republic of Ireland also.  It should not be forgotten that people have opportunities to be part of structured and organised events rather than the unregulated events which bring sulky racing into disrepute and compromise animal welfare.  Horse ownership, which we all celebrate, comes with a responsibility for welfare.  That is at the heart of the question and at the heart of public concern.  It is also why we have the aforementioned education initiative.  Individual horse ownership comes with responsibilities.</p></speech>

The Agriculture Appeals Act 2001, along with the agriculture appeals regulations 2002, as amended, set down the functions of the director and the appeals officers, the decisions that may be appealed and the procedures to be followed in respect of appeals.</p>  <p>  A total of 638 appeals were received in 2017 compared with 598 in 2016, an increase of 6.7%.  In 2018, the number of agriculture appeals received at the end of quarter one was 106. This is lower than the number received in quarter one of 2017 and quarter one of 2016.  The current appeals legislation provides for reviews of the decisions of appeals officers.  In 2015 a total of 21 requests for reviews of appeals officer decisions were received by the office.  In 2016, 45 such requests were submitted and in 2017 a further 41 requests for reviews were submitted.  Requests for reviews are generally dealt with in order of receipt.  A total of 18 reviews of appeals officer decisions were completed in 2017. </p>  <p>  The Agriculture Appeals Office was restructured in 2017 and two additional staff were assigned to the office.  The administrative function of the office has been split in two and a new full time support unit has been established to deal with the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board, ALAB and a full time higher executive officer was assigned to manage agriculture appeals.  The legislation states that only the director may revise the decision of an appeals officer if it is determined that there is an error in fact or in law.  The Act provides that a deputy director may be appointed to cover the director in his or her absence.  My Department is exploring options to appoint a deputy director of appeals.  </p>  <p>  The report of the review of the Agriculture Appeals Act, 2001 and the operation of the Agriculture Appeals Office was received by my Department in December 2017 and was published in February 2018 for stakeholder consultation.  The recommendations contained in the report of the review committee are currently under consideration by my Department, particularly with regard to legislative changes that may be required to give effect to them.  My Department avails of the workforce planning process to continually assess its business needs and I am confident the workforce planning process will ensure that sufficient resources continue to be available to the Agriculture Appeals Office, even with changing demands.</p></speech>

Vicky is a young woman, only 43, a wife and a mother of two children, aged 12 and 7.  She was given the all-clear health wise following a cervical screening in 2011.  However, in an internal audit carried out by CervicalCheck in 2014, Vicky's 2011 smear test was found to have had abnormalities.  No-one informed Vicky, her family or her doctor about that audit or that result for another three years.  I know the T&aacute;naiste would agree that it is beyond words that Vicky had to face the prospect of terminal cancer, or the fact that information was knowingly withheld from her and her doctors which makes it completely inexplicable and frankly absolutely unacceptable.</p>  <p>  However, the 2014 audit has also found incorrect results in up to 14 other women's tests.  Yet it was only in 2016 that medical consultants were advised to deal with these women and tell them their results.  Court documents suggest that CervicalCheck issued a circular in 2016 saying that the service would like the women's notes to be reviewed, and for the result to be "recorded".  The circular also said "as a general rule of thumb the outcome should be communicated to the woman with a focus on the context of confronting the overall clinical scenario."</p>  <p>  CervicalCheck then explained that the women may not have been aware of the actual audit.  The approach has been cruel and bizarre in the extreme.  It was also reported that doctors were asked to use their own judgment on whether to inform women about these misdiagnoses.  This is absolutely unbelievable, particularly when Vicky and the 14 others were given the all-clear result years before.</p>  <p>  How is this acceptable, medically, ethically or legally?  Was the HSE aware in 2014 that the audit had taken place and was it made aware of the results in 2014?  This programme is hugely important to our country, but given that it is paid for by the State, the company that undertakes and rolls out this programme must have obligations to the HSE concerning the way it informs people.  Is a protocol in place between the HSE and CervicalCheck about audits and the sharing of information?  If not, why not?  How many audits have taken place since 2014 and how many other women are in the position faced by Vicky today?  Finally, can the T&aacute;naiste outline what will change as a result of what we know now, as a consequence of the bravery and the courage of Vicky Phelan? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-26a.150" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600012#K00400"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  I think anybody who has listened to this story or read about it will come to the conclusion that this was a shameful series of events, particularly where information flow is concerned.  The tragedy and challenges that Ms Vicky Phelan and her family are facing now have been made all the more difficult because of the failings in passing information on.  For that, as T&aacute;naiste I want to apologise to her and to her family.</p>  <p>  It might be helpful for me to put on the record what is going to change as a result and how that has come about.  In 2014, at the time when Vicky Phelan was diagnosed, CervicalCheck initiated clinical reviews for all notified cases of cervical cancer arising from screening.  At that time, the information was used to inform improvements in the system and was not communicated to clinicians or to patients.  This changed in late 2016, and subsequently current and historical outcomes of the audit process were made available to clinicians for communication to their patients on request.  Ms Phelan rightly contends that she should have been made aware of the outcome of the audit process which related to her in 2014, and we agree with that.  It has now been decided that patients will be advised as part of the process in the future.  That will not be optional.  It will be automatic.  A process is also under way to identify any other women affected in the same way as Ms Phelan to ensure that they are informed as is necessary.</p>  <p>  Each year, approximately 250,000 women have a cervical cancer screening, or smear test as most of us would know it, through CervicalCheck.  CervicalCheck has found over 50,000 pre-cancerous changes in women, leading to appropriate early treatment, which of course is what this is all about.  It is important to say that while this case is tragic and should not have happened in the way that it did, we cannot allow it to undermine confidence and faith in CervicalCheck as a whole.  This is a screening programme.  There is no such thing as a perfect screening programme.  Mistakes can be made and mistakes were made in this case.  However, it is true to say that cervical cancer screening aims to reduce the instance of mortality in cervical cancer.  Instances of cervical cancer in Ireland have fallen by about 7% annually and continue to fall and CervicalCheck is playing a big part in that.  However, that is no consolation to the Phelan family today.</p>  <p>  What I want to say is that it is regrettable that Ms Phelan needed to take court action to establish the truth.  It is certainly regrettable that decisions were not made before now to require patients to have automatic access to information that relates to them.  That applies particularly in the cases of women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer, where audits automatically take place if they have previously been through a screening programme to establish whether any mistakes were made.  Hopefully that answers some of the Deputy's questions.</p></speech>

We need to restore this confidence.  Anyone who listened to "Morning Ireland" this morning will not have had confidence in the information that was processed and presented.  Will the T&aacute;naiste confirm that the other 14 women identified in 2014 have been informed of their specific circumstances and that communication is open with them?  Will he outline what will be done to ensure CervicalCheck realises the seriousness of this matter and what steps the organisation will take to rebuild public trust in this vital screening programme?  Will the Minister for Health make himself available in the House next week to answer questions on this matter?  Deputies and Senators may learn of concerns over the weekend that will need to be addressed next week as part of the process of beginning to rebuild trust in this vital screening programme?  The Oireachtas must also outline its responsibility to Vicky Phelan and her family.</p></speech>

The clinical director of CervicalCheck has spoken on radio in the past hour and provided much more clarity on the issues.  I thank both individuals for their efforts to bring clarity.  I am sure the Minister will be happy to deal with questions as they arise.  He has already met the directors of the HSE and National Cancer Control Programme to discuss these issues and try to ensure we maintain confidence in a system that is vital to Irish women in terms of reducing the incidence of cervical cancer.</p>  <p>  In terms of lessons learned, I assure Deputy Calleary that this matter is being taken extremely seriously by everybody concerned.  For this reason, quick decisions have been taken today, not only to review but also to change the approach in terms of automatic entitlement to access information relating to patients, as opposed to relying on the judgment of a clinician or doctor to pass on that information.  </p></speech>

Anyone who watched or listened to her making a statement outside the Four Courts yesterday could not help but be moved by her heartbreaking words.  Mr. Justice Cross described Ms Phelan as one of the most impressive witnesses he had ever encountered.  She is a remarkably brave and courageous woman and I extend solidarity and support to her and her family at this extremely difficult time.</p>  <p>  The details of Ms Phelan's case are shocking.  To provide a timeline, on 24 May 2011, Ms Phelan had a smear test.  She was given the all clear on 17 June 2011.  On 9 June 2014, her next smear was found to be symptomatic and this triggered her inclusion in the review taking place at the time, which found, on 31 October 2015, that a serious error had been made.  On 21 July 2016, Ms Phelan's doctor was informed of this but it was not until 27 September 2017 that Ms Phelan was informed.  It is my understanding that the period between 21 July 2016 and 27 September 2017 is filled with correspondence between her doctor, Dr. Kevin Hickey, and Professor Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly.  I understand there was a dispute as to who had the responsibility to inform Ms Phelan.  It seems that in all these cases the last person to know is the woman affected.  According to Ms Phelan's solicitor, Mr. Cian O'Carroll, if her cervical cancer had been detected in 2011, Ms Phelan could have undergone treatment and stood a 90% chance of being cured.  She now has terminal cancer.</p>  <p>  Other women listening to Ms Phelan's story will be worried, confused and frightened.  Documents from Ms Phelan's case indicate that up to 14 other women diagnosed with cervical cancer had previously been told their smear tests were normal.  Anyone seeking reassurance will not have found it this morning if they listened to an interview with Dr. Jerome Coffey.  In response to straightforward questions, Dr. Coffey obfuscated and avoided answering.  He was not able to state how many women had been affected by misdiagnosis or whether all of them had been informed.  He could not even indicate whether doctors were obliged to inform patients who had been misdiagnosed.  While I did not hear the interview with Professor Flannelly, I was informed of it and significant questions remain outstanding.  How many patients were misdiagnosed and have they been informed of their misdiagnosis?</p>  <p>  I understand there is a contractual obligation to inform women within four weeks if a problem is identified with a smear test.  If a problem is found in a subsequent review, why does a similar contractual obligation not apply?  Given the contractual obligation to inform women of problems identified in a smear test, why are women not told as soon as possible of problems identified with a smear test in a subsequent review?</p></speech>

Many of us listened to Vicky Phelan who is an incredibly courageous woman.  In the midst of all the challenges she is facing, she focused on the hope that something good may come from this.  I hope that is the case and we have an obligation to ensure it is the case.  The key issue is the information flow.  Once the State has a piece of information that is relevant to a woman in these circumstances, she should be entitled to have this information immediately.  It should not move between offices, physicians or anyone else without the patient having automatic access to it.  The decision taken this morning was to change the approach and not before time.</p>  <p>  It is important that we use accurate language in this discussion.  This is not about misdiagnosis.  A smear test is not a diagnosis but a screening mechanism that can spot early signs of change which need to be followed up in terms of potential cancer treatment.  This is different from a full diagnosis.  In this case, we had what was effectively a false negative from the screening programme.  Such false negatives occur because there is no perfect screening programme in place anywhere in the world.  The view of those involved in CervicalCheck is that the systems in place here are as good as those in place anywhere in the world and better than most.  In that regard, CervicalCheck is open to peer review, independent assessment and so on.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately in this case, there was a false negative.  When Vicky Phelan was subsequently diagnosed with cervical cancer, the audit and checking system, which operates in all such cases to ascertain whether somebody who has a diagnosis of cancer previously had a smear test, found that the result of the smear test was incorrect.  Ms Phelan's solicitor has raised the question as to whether the story would have been different in terms of treatment options and so on if this had been known earlier. </p>  <p>  The key issue, as Ms Phelan correctly noted, is access to information.  We will change this immediately to ensure that anybody who is in a similar position in the future will not have to access information through the courts, which is how Ms Phelan had to do it. </p></speech>

I have already said that it is disgraceful that she was the last to know, as was the delay before she was informed.  It appears that there was almost a battle between the doctors and CervicalCheck as to who had the obligation to tell her.  That is wrong.  It is disgraceful.  However, there is more to this than knowledge.  Professor John Shepherd is one of the medical experts called in this case.  He said he was struck by the obviousness of the abnormalities found on the slide which was reviewed.  They should have been spotted speedily.  These US laboratories have been used for ten years or so and concerns were first expressed about them by organisations such as the Well Woman Centre in or around 2007.  Of course, there will be mistakes.  It is not possible to have a programme in which there are no mistakes.  Nevertheless, it is worth asking whether we are going engage in a review the rate of misses from these laboratories.  Such a review is vital to restore public confidence.  This is a very important programme and we all want it to be funded properly in order that as many people as possible might be screened.  However, we need to know that the quality of checking in those laboratories is up to scratch and that there are not more things being missed in them than are missed anywhere else.</p></speech>

However, I want also to reassure people, particularly those outside the House, that CervicalCheck rates very well in comparison with similar screening systems in other parts of the world.  There is no perfect system and human errors will occur in screening programmes, particularly with 250,000 people a year having smear tests.  That seems to have been what happened here, but I do not know for sure.  I know, however, that this screening system is open to independent assessment, if that is what people are seeking, in order to show that it rates well by international standards.  All of us have the responsibility, however, to reassure women that this is a good screening programme which is saving lives, albeit we need to assess it constantly to ensure that improvements which can be made are made.  As to information flow within the health system, that is a correction we are making this morning.  Nevertheless, it is essential to reinforce the importance of smear tests and CervicalCheck in general in light of the number of lives it saves and the reduction by 7% per annum in the number of women diagnosed with cervical cancer on foot of the programme.  Having said that, questions must be answered.  If necessary, an independent assessment should be part of the follow-up process.</p></speech>

As I could be perceived to have a conflict of interest in this matter, I note for the record that I am the proprietor of a small post office in a rural area.  In addition, I wish to place on record my appreciation and gratitude to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, who has been diligent in his work on our post offices, and others.  However, I wish to highlight what is actually happening.  In the county I represent, we do not have many post offices.  Of those we do, 26 have received letters informing them of an offer to close their doors.  This has happened on foot of inaction on the part of this and previous Governments, which have failed to support our post office network despite a commitment to do so in their programmes for Government.  The value of An Post's contract in respect of social welfare payments has decreased from &euro;60 million to &euro;51 million and continues to decline.</p>  <p>  Some of the post offices which have been offered compensation packages to close may accept them because the postmasters feel they have no choice.  The communities served by these post offices include among their members community activists and leaders.  Post offices in east Kerry, mid-Kerry, north Kerry, south Kerry and west Kerry, along with post offices throughout the rest of Ireland, have been notified of the offer to close but the communities involved do not yet know about it.  Post offices which have not been told that they can close have been offered a contract, signing which would be akin to signing one's own death warrant.  I have studied the contract.  One would want to be a barrister to read it given the extent of what it involves.  Ultimately, it means that people will have to work for far less remuneration while their prospects for the future diminish over the next three years.  I have always used the following figure since I entered the House.  Unless serious action is taken by Government, 700 post offices could close.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work of Deputy Dooley, who met even yesterday with representatives from An Post.  His timing is very good.  He has been diligent about his work as Opposition spokesman and very vocal on the issue.  However, there has been a very serious result.  Neither the package to close nor the contract is any good.  The Government will have to take on board the problems we have if we are to have any hope of saving the majority of the network.</p></speech>

He has repeatedly confirmed the Government's commitment to ensuring that the infrastructure remains intact.  We have seen a commitment to explore the potential to channel more Government business through the network, including motor tax, and the Minister's Department is engaged with other Departments in this regard.  The Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, will announce shortly a pilot "digital assist" initiative which will use the local post office network as a digital gateway for Government business.  The Government has committed to State funding of &euro;30 million for a project with An Post.  The funds have been provided by way of a long-term loan advanced from the Exchequer to be used to support the renewal of the post office network and the continued fulfilment of a five-day per week mails delivery service.  In turn, this will secure the future of mail and post offices services for local communities nationally in both urban and rural areas.  In addition, An Post proposes to invest a further &euro;50 million in the network in the next few years.</p>  <p>  There is a partnership between the State and An Post to ensure that the company has a viable future.  An Post's commitment is that there will be no compulsory closures while there will be some consolidation to ensure post offices are well located.  The transfer of business to neighbouring offices will ensure the continued viability of smaller offices in meeting the needs of communities.  An Post will open up to 20 new offices in communities of 500 people or more which currently lack post offices.</p><p>A post office will be guaranteed for every community of over 500 people and within 15 km of 95% of the population or, in an urban area, within 3 km.  I hope what we have now is an agreement between the postmasters and management in An Post on a future development plan for the company.  This is very much supported by the Government, both financially and from a policy perspective.  It will ensure post offices will remain a feature across rural Ireland, as well as in urban environments.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste claimed there are no compulsory closures.  He is 100% correct.  However, over the past two days, 390 letters went to post offices around the country, out of which 26 went to post offices in County Kerry.  If 26 small factories were being offered a closure package in County Kerry, there would be outrage.  Even if half or ten of those post offices took up the offer, it would be an awful loss to those communities.  It will tear the heart and the soul out of our communities in which we want to keep people living.  The same has happened in Donegal, Limerick, Clare and all over the country.</p>  <p>  Quite simply, the Government is not acting quickly enough to save the post office network.  We cannot blame a postmaster for availing of these packages if their footfall is going down because not enough customers are going into their post office.  If they see no way out of it, they will accept it and they will close.  Once a post office is gone, it is gone forever.  It is in the programme for Government.  Will the T&aacute;naiste do more and do it quickly to save as many post offices as we can and not allow them to close?</p></speech>

We must use An Post's entire infrastructure to the fullest possible extent, recognising it has a role in rural community infrastructure, which the Deputy knows only too well about because of his own involvement.  The Government is very aware of this role.  The Deputy and I have spoken in government formation talks about the importance of the post office network.  That is understood in the Government, particularly among rural Deputies.  It is led by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten, who has worked with An Post to ensure a viable plan is in place and one with which the postmasters can agree.</p></speech>

For the past three months since February, young people experiencing mental health difficulties have been admitted to the paediatric ward in South Tipperary General Hospital.  Today, there are three young people on the ward.  There have been as many as five and their lengths of stay have been as long as eight weeks.  The reason for this, as we all know, is that there are simply not enough inpatient beds for young people with mental health difficulties.</p>  <p>  Admissions to the paediatric ward in South Tipperary General Hospital are totally inappropriate.  Nursing staff do their best.  They are kind, compassionate and caring but they are not trained to provide mental health care.  Parents, usually mothers, must stay on the ward overnight to give support to their children.  Of course, there are knock-on effects in delayed admissions for other patients.  Every day, young people with mental health difficulties do not receive the age-appropriate timely services and supports they need.  This causes psychological and social damage to these young people.  It has a detrimental effect, not just on themselves, but also on their parents, their siblings, their schools and their communities.  Of course, it reinforces the whole stigma regarding those with mental health difficulties.  Children and their parents face immense challenges to get an adequate, or indeed any, service.  Due to this, many children carry those difficulties into their adult lives.</p>  <p>  We all know what needs to be done.  We have had report after report.  The problem is we have had no action on those reports or their recommendations.  I remind the T&aacute;naiste that to tackle this significant issue, we need additional inpatient beds for children and young people with mental health difficulties and 24-7 crisis intervention teams providing rapid assessment for those children and young people.  We need a comprehensive primary care counselling service and a fully staffed existing child and adolescent mental health teams.  We also need to resource and support, including financially, community and voluntary organisations working in these areas.  We need a designated leader - a tsar-type arrangement - whose sole duty and responsibility will be to drive the implementation of these measures to ensure our young people get the services they deserve and need urgently.  It should be like how cancer care services developed recently.</p>  <p>  When will we see these measures being implemented by the Government?</p></speech>

He is aware of some of the cases to which the Deputy referred and he has spoken to some of the parents involved.</p>  <p>  Staffing and necessary skills shortages need to be addressed in the context of extra beds.  Up to &euro;55 million of additional funding has been committed for next year to develop new services, which will involve ten new beds in the Central Mental Hospital and 20 new child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, beds coming to the new children's hospital.  There is a recognition that there is a deficit.  We are providing significant resources to address that.</p>  <p>  On the broader mental health service issues, funding this year is almost &euro;1 billion at &euro;910 million.  That is an increase of &euro;200 million since 2012.  In excess of 2,000 new posts have been approved since 2012, of which over 1,300, 66%, have been recruited with recruitment ongoing for the remainder.  The appointment of 114 assistant psychologists and 20 staff grade psychologists for primary care child psychology services is ongoing.  A series of actions are happening which are linked to reports which have been done.  This represents incremental improvement all the time.</p>  <p>  However, I am aware there are certain pressure points in different parts of the country.  This is a particularly sensitive area in child and adolescent mental health services.  We have seen significant increases in funding and funding commitments with the staff and beds that need to go with that.  The challenge is ongoing.  I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, to come back to the Deputy with a more detailed answer on services in Tipperary.</p></speech>

These issues must be dealt with urgently.  The T&aacute;naiste referred to recruitment.  There are currently 500 psychiatric nurse vacancies in this country.  The position would be much worse were it not for the tremendous work done by community and voluntary organisations across the country.  There are many such organisations in my own area, including the River Suir Suicide Patrol, Taxi Watch and C-SAW, the community suicide awareness workers.  These all operate on a voluntary, unpaid basis and do tremendous work.  There is huge frustration among these organisations, which feel alone in dealing with issues that should be properly dealt with by the public mental health service.  These organisations need to be acknowledged, supported and resourced, along with financial support.</p>  <p>  We are failing to provide for our young people.  We need to do so urgently, it must become a Government priority.  We cannot, should not, and hopefully, will not kick the can further down the road in this.  They need to be implemented urgently-----</p></speech>

It is a programme of action that is already under way.  The construction of a national forensic mental health complex at Portrane is progressing well and should be completed by 2020.  There are other improvements such as in counselling services, including new Jigsaw sites in Cork, Dublin and Limerick, to bring a total of 13 sites nationally, and there is continued development of the community mental health teams and improved 24-7 response and liaison services are improving the contact within communities.  An eating disorder care programme was launched in January 2018, which is patient-centred in care and recovery.  In line with the provisions of A Vision for Change, the HSE has prioritised mental health needs for those under 18 years.  We are focusing on reducing CAMHS waiting lists and improving mental health teams.  There are currently 69 CAMHS teams nationally.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, is working with the HSE and officials to establish a national telephone and text line for mental health services, and the list goes on.  There are a lot of things happening in this area but there is a lot more to be done, and we recognise that.</p></speech>

Marie has worked in the Members' Restaurant for the past 40 years.  On my behalf and of the Members, I wish Marie a very happy, healthy, joyful and long retirement.  Marie started working in the House in 1978, following in the footsteps of her mother, Peggy Redmond, who many of us fondly remember.  Peggy ran nuts' corner in the restaurant, and it was more difficult to secure a permanent seat in nuts' corner than it was to secure a seat in this House.  I was an apprentice there for some time and eventually, after a long apprenticeship, I secured a seat there.  I hope that Marie enjoys her party tonight and will have quality time in the future with her husband Paddy, three children and five grandchildren.

When one considers both of their service, she and her mother have given 62 years to this House.  As far as I am concerned, she is far too young to be retiring from here, and we would like to have her around for much longer.  I thank her on behalf of all the Deputies and Senators who got to know her so well.  She got to know our awkwardness, our eating habits and so on.  Sometimes a menu was not necessary, because she would already know what one was going to order.  She is a lovely person and I wish her well.  I hope she will get much more time with her family and I am glad for her that she will not have to put up with us any longer.  Her work here has been valued.  She will be missed.  There is enormous warmth towards Marie, which was evident in the build up to her leaving with so many people having taken the time to drop in and thank her for her decades of service here.</p>  <p>  I wish her good luck and thank her for her many years of support and charm.

Marie was not as lucky, and she only had to deal with Fine Gael, so she must be well used to awkwardness.  She brought great fun and professionalism to the role and took a great interest in all of us.  She was not afraid to give us a clip on the back of the head if it was needed, and kind of took on the role of the Dublin mammy for many of the younger Members.  I am thrilled that Marie enjoys the health to enjoy the travels around the country and abroad that she will undertake with some of the people sitting with her in the Gallery.  I am especially thrilled she will have time with Paddy, Gillian, Tony and Nicola, Caitlin, TJ, Alex, Evan and especially with Cara.  I know she will have a lot of fun with all of them but I hope that she does not forget us.  I hope Marie comes in every so often to keep us on our toes, and give us the words we need and the clips that we always need.  We will always remember Marie, and we remember her mum especially today.  It is amazing service from one family to this House, maybe there will be more after Marie.  I hope Marie enjoys herself and we also thank all her colleagues who are with her in the Gallery for putting up with us and Marie on our behalf over the last 30 years.</p></speech>

As others have said, it is extraordinary service on Marie's part and also her family.  I hope she has many happy years retirement with her family, her husband Paddy and her children and grandchildren.  Marie's neighbour, Deputy Denise Mitchell wishes her all the best.

She has looked after Labour Party tables for many years.  There used to be Labour Party tables, plural.</p><p>Those who are around as long as I am will remember that Marie's late mum, Peg, and Peg's close associate Isabelle, overlapped Marie's sterling service here.  </p><p> Marie knows more State secrets and Members' foibles than anybody in these buildings apart, perhaps, from Darren, who may have a slight edge in that regard.  She is always the definition of courtesy.  She made the dining room a welcoming oasis for all of us.  She made it a place where, on the good days, we could relax and, on the bad days, we could put things behind us with her consoling voice and good smile.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has mentioned nuts' corner.  I better explain that.  It used to be a table at the edge of the Labour Party tables to which, after the great schism within their party, a number of Fianna F&aacute;il dissidents moved.  That was a cause of great angst for many years until Pat Magner became Chairman of the Joint Services Committee and abolished it.  For a while, the dissidents tried to sit there but they eventually moved back to the Fianna F&aacute;il side.</p> <p> In saying farewell to Marie we are saying farewell to a friend and a confidant.  Politicians in this place are judged by many - the media, our constituents and our colleagues - but I have always believed that the truest judgments of the worth and calibre of Members are made by the staff of these Houses.  They often give the most vigorous and accurate judgments.  Marie saw us in all our guises and all our moods.  We will miss her greatly.  I hope she will not be a stranger and will drop back to check on how Yvonne, Thelma, Willie, Christine and all the rest are doing.  I hope she enjoys the four holidays that I know she has planned.  From listening to Marie in the past day or two, I know that Caitlin might be here.  I get a feeling from listening to Marie that Caitlin might be back - not as somebody working in the restaurant but as Taoiseach.</p></speech>

Marie gave us a f&aacute;ilte speisialta inside in the restaurant.  I knew nothing about the nutty table but I now know what is wrong with the Labour Party.  I knew nothing about that table.  That was before my time.  Marie's smile, gregarious warmth and the way she was always helpful made everybody feel so welcome at all times.  It was great to compare notes on her grandchildren and my own.  I hope that she will be able to come back with her grandchildren occasionally.  I know how much she loves her family, her husband Paddy, her children and, most especially, her grandchildren.  She adores them.  Any of us who are privileged to have grandchildren adore them greatly.  They give us great joy.  I hope Marie will enjoy them now and will enjoy her time with her family and everything else.  She should not mind Deputy Howlin about the number of holidays she is taking.  She should take it one day at a time.  Go n-&eacute;ir&iacute; go geal l&eacute;i.</p></speech>

There was standing room only, which reflects the interest and involvement many Members have in and with the passport service.  The Ceann Comhairle is also very familiar with that.  At this time of year we take on a lot of extra temporary staff to deal with the increased demand through the summer months.  We had particular challenges and problems during the very bad weather and these resulted in the targets we had been setting for turnaround times being temporarily undermined.  We are now back on track in terms of the target turnaround times for both postal and online services.  We intend to continue to try to improve those turnaround times.</p></speech>

I take this opportunity to commend Rachel Barry and the women who asked to be identified as Amy and Sarah on their bravery.  I have raised the issue of resources in the area of child protection before.  However, no shortage of resources could ever excuse this level of failure or these children being left in danger when there was full knowledge of the risk that existed.  The victims have said that they do not have any confidence in the review mechanism to which the Taoiseach referred yesterday.  They do not believe that it will lead to a satisfactory outcome.  They have called for a fully independent investigation.  The Taoiseach has a responsibility to see that this happens.  These women have written to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, requesting the establishment of a commission of investigation similar to that relating to the Grace case.  I urge the Taoiseach to respond positively to this request and to engage with the victims in order to ensure that such a commission is established.</p></speech>

Her fantastic speech at the People of the Year Awards last week was also welcome.  She received a standing ovation in respect of the progress of the legislation.  I want to ask the T&aacute;naiste a specific question about the report I am holding, which was commissioned by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, and published in January 2017 and which relates to cannabis for medical use.  This report was published 15 months ago and absolutely nothing has been done in the interim.  People are way ahead of this Government in respect of medical cannabis legislation.  The recommendation from the HPRA is that an access programme should be set up.  The Bill we put forward is in limbo.  Will the T&aacute;naiste comment on this matter please?</p></speech>

She and her daughter, Ava, now have not only the treatment they were looking for but also the financial support of the State to ensure that medication will continue to be provided for Ava.  I understand that medication is working very well.  That is a successful outcome to what has been a difficult case.  The Minister has always said that he has an open mind in terms of the medical use of cannabis.  How that might best be introduced has not been finalised.  It is currently possible for the Minister to provide an import licence for drugs as part of a course of treatment supported by the advice of a consultant doctor.</p><p>This is, of course, how we got the Vera Twomey case finalised in the end.

At the same time, a mere &euro;10 million per year is spent on psychological and counselling care services.  This is a huge imbalance.  The second interim report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care indicates mental health options get &euro;917 million per annum, or a mere 6.3% of the overall budget this year.

With regard to spending in the area of mental health, as the T&aacute;naiste pointed out earlier in his contribution, the budget is &euro;910 million.  It has increased by &euro;200 million since 2012.  It is not the need for resources or for financial support from the Government that is holding back the delivery of services.  An issue I have addressed here on numerous occasions is recruitment, and the T&aacute;naiste referred to the fact that 2,000 positions have been approved and funded but the people with the necessary skill set are not out there.  There is a worldwide shortage of consultant psychiatrists, which is delaying the delivery of these services.  We need to look more at earlier interventions.  We need to look to schools, and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and I are working in this area to build services in schools and build more proactive services at primary care level and not at the acute level.</p></speech>

I want to bring up the case of a little boy, Noah Myers.  He is seven years old and lives with his family in Mitchelstown in County Cork.  He suffers from a condition known as Escobar syndrome, a rare congenital disorder that affects his joints.  He also has scoliosis and respiratory problems.  There are probably only 100 confirmed cases of this in the world.  Last June Noah's family applied for a new wheelchair, only to be told by the HSE that no funding was available.  Eleven months on and nothing has happened to rectify this problem.  Noah needs the wheelchair and he needs it now.  His mother said it is not a luxury item but an urgent request.  Recently we ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  This is an absolutely atrocious situation for a seven year old child.</p></speech>

It is &euro;1,200 a month.  I want to ask about the housing assistance payment cap.  The housing assistance payment in Kerry is capped at &euro;575.  Other counties have a much higher cap.  In light of the increase in the cost of houses per month, which is &euro;1,200 to &euro;2,000 per month in Killarney and other big towns such as Kenmare and Dingle, will the Government do something about raising the housing assistance payment cap in Kerry?</p></speech>

There is enough room with the housing assistance payment in certain cases, as there is a 20% allowance to go above the cap if needs be.  It was not raised with me, but I am happy to discuss it with the Deputy and with the local authority.  If there is evidence, we will look at it.  We keep these levels under consideration throughout the country.  In most cases, the 20% space allowed for is not used.</p></speech>

It was meant to be reviewed after seven years.  This has led to inshore fishermen not being able to fish for salmon and is leading to huge losses for local rural communities.  It has now been proven that inshore fishermen were not to blame for the loss of salmon stocks as stocks are still dropping.  This is due in a large way to rivers not being looked after.  Spawning pools are overgrown by trees.  It is even suggested that cutting forestries near rivers leads to nutrients going into the water, which has led to a loss of stocks.  All in all, proper research needs to be done immediately.  While this research is ongoing to find the real facts as to who is to blame for the loss of salmon stocks I ask the Minister to lift immediately the ban on inshore fishermen using salmon drift nets.</p></speech>

I do not think it is credible to say that drift net fishing for salmon did not have an impact on salmon stocks.

I understand D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council has written to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine who funds Horse Racing Ireland to a very large amount, and to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government with regard to this.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-26a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1267" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600022#Y00200"><p>I acknowledge the presence of Deputy Cowen and note that he has moved position.  I wish him and Deputies O'Reilly and Michael McGrath well.  As the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is on business so cannot be here today.</p>  <p>  I welcome this opportunity to address Members of the D&aacute;il on public private partnerships, PPPs, and their role in delivering public capital infrastructure in Ireland.  Since the late 1990s, significant infrastructure projects have been delivered on behalf of the State using the PPP approach, including the pilot schools bundle of 2002, the National Maritime College in 2004, the Cork School of Music in 2007, the Criminal Courts complex, the National Conference Centre in 2010, further schools bundles and, of course, a number of major motorway projects from 2005 onwards.</p>  <p>  In July 2012, in response to the fiscal crisis, the then Government announced plans for a new &euro;1.4 billion PPP programme of investment in public infrastructure as part of a wider &euro;2.25 billion stimulus plan.  This comprised eight new PPP projects across the health, justice, transport and education sectors.  This new phase of stimulus PPPs was followed up in 2014 with a second phase, valued at &euro;300 million, to deliver social housing, and a third phase in 2015, to deliver projects to a value of &euro;500 million across the higher education, health and justice sectors.  It is clear, therefore, that PPPs have played a very significant role in facilitating the delivery of important infrastructure projects across a range of sectors.  They were particularly useful in recent years, when the Exchequer was seriously constrained in terms of its ability to fund infrastructure directly.  PPPs, and their use of private finance on an off-balance-sheet basis, enabled important projects to proceed during this period, which would not otherwise have been deliverable on the basis of Exchequer funding alone.  However, now that we have emerged from the economic and fiscal crisis and the recovery is well under way, the Government has decided to prioritise and significantly increase direct Exchequer investment in capital and infrastructure.  Under the national development plan, NDP, Exchequer-funded capital investment is set to increase to 3.8% of national income, as measured by GNI*, in 2021, and 4% by 2024, with sustained investment averaging 4% on an annual basis over the period 2022 to 2027.  This is a very significant level of planned capital investment, which will see Ireland move to among the highest levels of investment in the European Union.</p>  <p>  Against that background, it is appropriate to review the role that PPPs should play in delivering public capital infrastructure into the future.  With that in mind, an interdepartmental group was established in 2017, comprising Departments and agencies with experience of using PPP to deliver capital infrastructure, to review that experience and to report to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, with recommendations on the future role of PPPs in the context of the new ten-year NDP being developed at that time.  The detailed report of that PPP review is currently with the Minister, and he will publish the report once he has brought it to Government for noting.  However, the key findings and recommendations of the review have already been published in the NDP.</p>  <p>  In summary, the review noted that PPPs have been very useful in the past in facilitating the delivery of important infrastructure projects, particularly, as I have already indicated, when the Exchequer was seriously constrained in terms of its ability to fund infrastructure directly.  However, given the NDP plans to significantly increase public capital investment to among the highest levels in the EU, the report concludes that there is no longer the same requirement to use PPPs for the delivery of additional projects to compensate for a sub-optimal level of Exchequer investment in infrastructure, as was the case in recent years.  Seeking to procure additional projects by PPP, which would further expand the investment programme outlined in the national development plan, would put even greater pressure on the capacity of the construction sector to respond to the increased demand.  Following such an approach could contribute to inflationary pressures and potentially undermine value for money for the increased investment.  The PPP review therefore recommends that PPPs should continue to feature as a procurement option available to the Government for appropriately structured projects which demonstrate value for money over a traditional procurement option and which meet the robust and rigorous tests for project appraisal that apply to all public investment projects under the public spending code.  However, this should be as part of the national development plan, rather than in addition to what is planned under the national development plan.  Accordingly, in delivering the national development plan, all large-scale projects will be assessed as required under the public spending code in terms of the most appropriate delivery mechanism, that is, traditional or PPP, with value for money being the key consideration when assessing the procurement options.  In this way, decisions on pursuing further PPPs will be taken on a case-by-case basis, based on the merits of using PPP in the case of each individual project.</p>  <p>  The review recommends that projects which have the potential to cover some of their cost by generating revenue, for example from user charges, should, in particular, be considered in terms of their suitability for procurement as PPPs, based on a concession model.  This approach to future PPP policy is also fully consistent with the recommendations of the recent IMF public investment management assessment, PIMA, of Ireland, which was also undertaken in 2017.</p>  <p>  Having established that PPPs can potentially play a valuable role in the delivery of public infrastructure, the review also examined the budgetary control mechanism used to ensure that PPPs are used in a sustainable manner which is affordable in the long term.  The purpose of the budgetary control mechanism is to avoid a situation in which excessive use of PPPs could lead to the precommitment of unsustainable levels of Exchequer capital resources to fund the future unitary payment costs over an extended period of time.</p>  <p>  On the basis of the recent reviews, it has been decided to discontinue the policy introduced in 2015, of limiting future PPP-related expenditure to 10% of the aggregate Exchequer capital allocation.  Instead, there will be a return to the budgetary control arrangement which applied prior to the financial crisis, whereby the capital cost of a PPP project is notionally charged to the relevant Department&rsquo;s approved Exchequer capital allocation over the construction period as if it was being delivered with Exchequer funding.  This approach, which was recommended by both the IMF PIMA report and the PPP review, will ensure that the use of PPPs is assessed on a level playing field with traditional procurement, with value for money being the key deciding factor in selecting the procurement option for each project.  This arrangement will apply to all new PPPs but it will not affect PPPs which have already been announced and which are in planning or procurement, that is, those projects being pursued under phases 2 and 3 announced in budget 2015 and budget 2016, respectively.</p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will oversee the implementation of this mechanism and will monitor the build-up of future PPP unitary payment liabilities, details of which will be published on an annual basis as part of the budget documentation, as also recommended by the recent reviews.  It is recognised that as our PPP programme continues to be pursued, the experiences and learning gained on each project must be assessed and shared between the relevant Departments and agencies.  Post-project reviews, which are to be undertaken for all PPPs and which will now be published, will facilitate greater transparency on the costs and benefits of PPPs, while the institutional learning will continue to be facilitated, in particular, through the bimonthly meetings of the interdepartmental PPP steering group, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  A number of other changes in the reporting arrangements for PPPs have also been recommended and will be implemented with a view to increasing transparency on PPPs in order that there can be a better informed debate about their use.  Details of these will be announced when the report of the PPP review is published.</p>  <p>  Finally, in recognition of the scale, complexity and long-term nature of typical PPPs, the review also recommended that consideration be given to the possible development of a new, alternative PPP model, to complement the existing PPP model.</p><p>Finally, in recognition of the scale, complexity and long-term nature of typical PPPs, the review also recommended that consideration be given to the possible development of a new, alternative PPP model to complement the existing PPP model.  Such a new option could comprise a less complex and shorter-term alternative PPP-type contractual arrangement that could still offer some of the advantages of PPP but for smaller scale projects, maybe at a value of between &euro;20 million and &euro;50 million, and over a shorter time period - for instance, ten years.  Such an alternative option could also facilitate greater competitive tension in the procurement process, as it would open up the PPP market to smaller, domestic contractors, which tend to be too small in scale to bid alone for typical PPP projects, where the market tends to be heavily reliant on the participation of the larger international players.  That issue has been raised in the House previously.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, intends to have this option explored by the Department in conjunction with the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA.</p> <p> Having set out the Government&rsquo;s position on PPPs and how we see them being used into the future, I am interested, as is the Department, in hearing what the other Deputies may have to say on the subject, and in particular any proposals that could further improve our approach to using PPP as a value-for-money procurement option into the future.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, that review has not been published; I would have hoped it would have been in advance of this debate, if not earlier.  I implore the Minister of State to use his good offices to ensure it is published as soon as possible so we can scrutinise its recommendations in order to ensure we get the best value for money for the State.</p>  <p>  Public private partnership is the only off-balance sheet mechanism open to Government that can comply with EU fiscal rules.  It is an option that can cater for the delivery of additional infrastructure and services that might not otherwise be possible.  Where the project is appropriate and is structured properly, PPPs can provide a useful alternative to direct Government investment.  At a time when direct Exchequer borrowing is highly constrained, they provide a viable alternative.  It was interesting to hear the Minister of State say again that the restriction placed on their use by the Government in 2015 has been lifted in the context of the national development plan.  We welcome this.  We did not believe it was the prudent thing to do at the time.  It cut off a vital alternative when our fiscal space was very tight.  As a result, it could be argued, we lost out on vital funding from the European Investment Bank and the Junker plan.  Fianna F&aacute;il believes that public private partnerships can and do play a leading role in providing major capital projects.  We recognise that issues have been highlighted recently in Ireland and the UK, particularly the UK.  We recognise that they do not necessarily give free money.  However, we cannot ignore them.  We must commit to using them when the project is appropriate and the structure is correct.</p>  <p>  As for how it would be framed and best interests served, we would establish a national infrastructural commission that would work with the National Development Finance Agency and the central PPP unit in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure that the right projects are identified and the correct structures put in place for each project.  Many parties to the left will continue to be opposed to public private partnerships purely on ideological grounds.  While issues have been exposed, these parties continue to ignore the fact that public private partnerships have worked, are working and can play a constructive role into the future.  Large parts of our road network, connecting all parts of the country, have been provided by public private partnerships, in addition to major projects in our health and education sectors.  Parties on the left which oppose this mechanism simply wish to add to a national debt that is already large and to incur the cost associated with major construction projects.</p>  <p>  The Parliamentary Budget Office produced a paper on PPPs recently.  Under "definition and purposes of PPPs", it states that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government was unable to identify any new off-balance sheet model capable of being classified as off-balance sheet under EUROSTAT rules.  It is vitally important that we are made aware of what those models or proposals were in order for them to be adjudicated by parties other than those in government.  We believe this mechanism should be made available to the sector to address the huge crisis we have at present.  The likes of the credit unions and public-private equity funds are prepared to invest over and above the amount put forward by the State.  They can get over the EU rules and can contract developers to build on private lands and lease back to local authorities for 80 years if need be.  A return on that investment would be welcome for investors.</p>  <p>  Today's short debate is hardly appropriate to discuss the issue adequately.  I ask the Minister of State again to bring to the House or to my party the details of what models were investigated by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government in respect of this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-26a.351" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600023#Z00400"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on PPPs.  Like my colleague, Deputy Cowen, it is my view that PPPs have a role to play.  Obviously, there needs to be a detailed and forensic financial assessment of the most viable procurement option.  What option gives the best value for money?  In my view, direct capital expenditure is the preferable option in the vast majority of cases.  It is more straightforward, less complex and can be more easily assessed from a financial perspective.  However, there are projects where private sector expertise is invaluable.  PPPs afford an opportunity for risk sharing, which is important.  From an accounting and budgetary point of view, PPPs can potentially afford greater scope for investment in the economy, which is something we want to see.</p>  <p>  Nobody can say that PPPs are in some way magic money.  There are real and significant financial commitments involved which have to be thoroughly assessed.  I commend the Parliamentary Budget Office for the paper it has produced.  It is of very high quality and gives an excellent overview of the position concerning PPPs in the country.  Some of the first major PPPs that took place were in my own constituency in Cork, such as the National Maritime College and the Cork School of Music.  They are two projects that our leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, was very much involved in promoting.  They are excellent projects that have stood the test of time.</p>  <p>  Learning from the experience of the Carillion collapse, there is a need when a PPP is embarked upon to consider contingency planning.  Since there is private sector involvement, the reality of life is that things go wrong.  Companies go bust and get put into receivership.  Banks move against them.  There is a need for a very clear contingency plan in respect of that scenario whenever we are entering into a PPP commitment.  The relationship can break down between the public and private entities if something goes wrong on the private sector side.  </p>  <p>  One of the reasons PPPs have a role is the manner in which direct Exchequer capital expenditure is booked in a budgetary context.  We are supporters of the fiscal rules and the fiscal compact.  Overall, having those rules is a positive development.  There is an issue around how capital expenditure is accounted for in respect of the smoothing effect.</p><p>If &euro;100 million is spent on capital expenditure one quarter of that amount is booked in year one and another quarter in year two, <i>et cetera</i>, until year four.  By comparison, in the private sector capital investments are made.  For example, capital allowances on plant and machinery are claimed over an eight year period at 12.5% per annum.  Investment in buildings can be claimed over a period of 25 years.  It is true to say that capital expenditure is booked over a very short-term in respect of the use of fiscal space under the rules.  I believe the Government should be raising this issue with the European Commission, because capital investment is, by its nature, a long-term investment in the future of our country and the future of our economy.  The dividend and return for the State will be achieved over a much longer period of time than the four years mentioned.  That is an issue that should be dealt with.<br/><br/>I welcome the fact that the 10% rule is being removed and replaced with, in essence, a new methodology whereby public private partnerships, PPPs, will be accounted for quite similarly to direct capital expenditure in the way it is booked against the capital allocation of each individual Department.<br/><br/>I ask the Minister of State to take on board the recommendations of the Parliamentary Budget Office that the Estimates of PPP expenditure would be made available on the PPP website in the context of the multi-annual capital allocations for the period 2018 to 2021, and that a breakdown of major PPP projects in the water sector, along with costs, be included on that website as well.  That would be an important step forward.</p></speech>

Many experts state that comprehensive post-project reviews cannot be carried out for a number of years.  In some cases they cannot be carried out until 20 or 25 years have passed.  That obviously poses a challenge when deciding whether PPPs offer the State better value for money than other options, such as public procurement.</p>  <p>  I have never come across any evidence, and none has ever been presented to me, to show that PPPs offer better value for money.  That evidence does not exist.  The Committee of Public Accounts have been looking at the issue, and a number of weeks ago the Department of Education and Skills and Transport Infrastructure Ireland were before that committee to discuss a number of PPP projects.  We sought some information on post-project reviews, and at that stage no information was made available.  I am sure the Minister is aware of that.  We could not analyse the post-project reviews; the Minister told us that to publish those reviews could compromise commercial sensitivity.  One analysis exists that PPPs offer us great value for money, but no evidence is being offered to support that.  However, since that meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts we have been inundated with information about PPPs.  We now have paperwork coming out of our ears about post-project reviews.  Why could we not get that information before?  We have it now.</p>  <p>  In looking at the costs we need to focus on a number of areas.  Deputy Michael McGrath touched on one of the areas when he mentioned companies that go into receivership.  The State incurs indirect costs when that happens.  The Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has stated that any costs associated with a company going into liquidation can be recouped, but there is no evidence to back up that claim.  We do not carry out any review of the indirect costs to the State when a company goes into liquidation.  For example, if there was a PPP bungle in the education sector and a company goes into liquidation, with the result that the completion of a project is delayed, there is obviously an indirect cost to the State.  Such an incident occurred in the case of a company that was named earlier, Carillion.  If classrooms are in prefabs or if buildings are being leased to provide classrooms and there is a delay in completing the project, that will involve an indirect cost to the State.  Those indirect costs are not compiled by the Department.  We do not know what are the indirect costs to this State.  How can it be said on one hand that we get value for money and on the other that we do not have all the information on the costs involved?</p>  <p>  Legal costs are another issue when it comes to PPPs.  A huge amount of money is spent on legal costs.  There is growing evidence that PPPs are more likely to end up in court because of the tendering process in place.  Only this morning we received information on a number of projects where one of the tendering parties took a court case, as was its right.  The level of legal costs associated with PPPs is significantly higher than would be the case if we took the normal route.  Those issues need to be factored into this debate.  No evidence has been presented.  In fact, the Committee on Public Accounts made a decision this morning that it would set aside two or three days to look at PPPs and settle, once and for all, the question of whether we actually are getting value for money.  No evidence has been presented that PPPs offer us greater value for money.  There are many gaps in information.  Anyone standing up in this Chamber to say that PPPs offer us better value for money is very naive.</p></speech>

The school he was a caretaker of was moving to a new premises which was being built under a PPP.  The staff providing non-classroom based services - I would call them the support staff, but the company that was taking over called them ancillary staff - were supposed to transfer over to the new company or take redundancy.  I have a fundamental difficulty with PPPs because there was no problem at all with the work of the support staff.  In fact, there were queues of people lining up to tell us how brilliant they were at the work they did.  The problem was with their terms and conditions, which were by no means gold-plated, fantastic conditions, but they were significantly better than what the new company was prepared to offer.</p>  <p>  After I was elected I spoke briefly to one of the employees on the phone who had phoned to wish me well.  He asked me, if I ever got the chance, to tell people in this House what PPPs are doing to ordinary people.  I decided I would take that opportunity today.  He was effectively forced out of his job when there was absolutely nothing wrong with how he worked.  The school was very happy with him.  The difficulty is that models such as PPPs are not compatible with decent terms and conditions for workers very often.  Ideology comes into play a little bit.  I do not believe there is anything wrong with having an ideological view; I make no apologies for it.</p><p>Private companies are responsible to their shareholders.  Their job, role and function is to make a profit and to maximise that profit - to sweat their assets, be they people or buildings - whereas the job of the State is the provision of essential services, so the two are often not compatible.  In the case of the caretaker working away, his terms and conditions, modest as they were, were simply not compatible with the race to the bottom that was being encouraged by the State and driven by the PPP company.  I gave him a promise that if I ever got the opportunity, I would tell people about the impact.</p> <p> There is less ideology in that and more practical experience.  My experience of dealing with the outsourced companies is that they were hostile to trade unions and to decent terms and conditions for their workers.  Their sole focus was on keeping their costs low and their profits high.  This is the direction in which the State is driving workers' terms and conditions.  The Government is doing the driving and, of course, the people in the passenger seat with the map would be its very best friends in Fianna F&aacute;il, cheerleading for private companies and the private sector ahead of decent terms and conditions for public servants.  As I said, the man I was representing was a public servant on very modest terms and conditions, but that could not be facilitated when the PPP came into being.</p> <p> We have a difficulty with PPPs.  As my colleague said, there is no evidence to suggest that they represent better value for money and we know they can very often be responsible for firing the starting pistol in the race to the bottom.</p></speech>

Any logical examination of PPPs would suggest they have to be more expensive in terms of delivering services and infrastructure than the traditional method of the State doing it directly, as it has done in the past and used to do exclusively.</p><p>The issue of outsourcing, in one shape or form, the delivery of public services and public infrastructure is a feature of the past 30 years.  The neoliberal economic orthodoxy really started with Margaret Thatcher and it has been a disaster.  To take housing as an example, Margaret Thatcher's belief that one should do away with directly provided social housing and privatise the housing market is the reason we have a housing crisis.  At the most basic level, that is a fact.</p><p>When we say the State should provide public housing, the Government always comes back and says that the public sector does not have the capacity to do it any more.  There is a very good reason the public sector does not have the capacity to do it any more and it is helpfully pointed out by the Parliamentary Budget Office's assessment of PPPs, a very good document for which I commend the office.  It points out that, among other things, what it does is embed the capacity and expertise to deliver infrastructure and services in the private sector.  Over time, this guarantees that the State loses the capacity because the skills are run down as it is outsourcing them to the private sector.  In fact, the document points out that the danger is that the private sector will then end up in a monopolistic position over those capacities and will then have a gun to the head of the State.  If the State wants anything, it no longer has the capacity to deliver it so the private sector's big players, like Carillion, literally have a gun to the head of the State in terms of their ability or inability to deliver key services and infrastructure.  When we are talking about big infrastructure projects, it is not small or medium enterprises or construction firms which are involved, but big players.</p><p>Of course, because these private sector players are profit-driven, they are, as we saw with Carillion, subject to the vagaries of the market.  Essentially, greed caused the collapse of Carillion, with massive salaries for its executives and massive over-borrowing that it was completely unable to sustain.  It was a little like the way the banks operate when, driven by profit and the greed of top executives, the thing goes over the cliff and the public is left to pick up the bill.  We see this with the impact of the Carillion collapse on the five school projects which have been affected, namely, those at Col&aacute;iste R&aacute;ith&iacute;n, St. Philomena&rsquo;s, Eureka secondary school, Tyndall college and the Carlow Institute of Further Education, and which are left not knowing when they are going to get their schools or colleges.</p><p>The subcontractors working for the contractors employed by Carillion have been left high and dry.  I received a letter yesterday from one of the subcontractors.  It states:</p><blockquote>I am a subcontractor left unpaid due to the collapse of Sammon [the company contracted by Carillion].  We had a meeting with our local TD, Helen McEntee, last night about our plight.  She did not seem to realise that among the eight men that were there last night, there was &euro;1 million of debt.  We were told the Minister for Education can't help and the examiner will pay a pittance.  The anxiety and despair among these men was unreal.  Nobody wants to know.  If you could get the opportunity to bring this to the attention of someone who would further the cause, I would appreciate the airing.</blockquote><p>These are ordinary working people, who, by the way, are not in my constituency but in the constituency of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy McEntee, and they have been hung out to dry, along with the parents and the children who need those schools, because of these PPPs.  I was talking to the mother of a child due to go to Col&aacute;iste R&aacute;ith&iacute;n next week and she told me that they have no idea what is happening.  As a result of the fact that Sammon is out of the picture, the project has gone to tender and they do not know when that tender process will be completed.  Clearly, those school students, who desperately need this and who have been looking to get out of totally unsuitable school premises at Col&aacute;iste R&aacute;ith&iacute;n, do not know if they will get out of them this year.  The school has employed teachers but does not have the space for those teachers to do their work and deliver the curriculum.  That is just one example.  There is also the example of the Bernard McNamara-Dublin City Council PPP that banjaxed the planned delivery of new social housing and social housing regeneration in Dominick Street, St. Michael's Estate and so on.  That means more people who are counting the cost.</p><p>It was obvious this would be the case and, as I said, it is not particularly ideological.  Why?  It is because these private firms need to make profits.  The State, when it delivers public infrastructure or public services, just needs the thing to wash its own face but these guys have to make a profit and that inevitably inflates the cost.  As Deputy Michael McGrath mentioned, there are also tax reliefs, so we are paying on the double in many cases because these same private firms making big profits from public infrastructure projects also get these very significant tax reliefs.  In addition, the cost of their finance is more expensive than the cost of finance for the State.  Inevitably, there is also a pressure for PPPs to have user charges for services and infrastructure that previously would not have had them, so it creates a pressure to move to user charges, as against the older model of public services being provided on the basis of need and paid for in a progressive way through central taxation.  The Comptroller and Auditor General points out there are very likely to be significantly increased legal costs, as the lawyers have to get their cut, as well as transaction and process costs because of the complicated process involved in PPPs.  This is a labyrinthine process about which we know - and are able to know - little because of commercial sensitivity, which means we cannot properly examine the contracts that are given out in respect of these PPPs.</p><p>Deputy O'Reilly made a point about the efficiencies and cost savings that are supposed to be delivered, although there is no evidence for them, a point I will come onto in a minute.  How do firms deliver these so-called efficiencies and cost savings?  There is really only a couple of ways they can do it.  One is to drive down the costs of production by attacking the wages and conditions of the workers they employ, and the evidence that they do that is legion.  The other approach is to cut corners, the cost of which we only discover later.  The State then has to pick up the bill somewhere further down the line. </p> <p> I find it quite startling to examine the figures provided by the Parliamentary Budget Office, PBO, on the estimated cost of the payments of these PPPs.  The estimated cost of the annual unitary payments made by the State up to 2027 in respect of the five pilot schools that are now delayed because of the Carillion collapse is &euro;290 million.  For five schools, that works out at a cost of &euro;58 million per school.  Now, I do not know the exact breakdown of what it costs to build a school-----</p></speech>

A cost of &euro;58 million to build a school, rather than have the State do it directly, sounds like a hell of a lot to me.  Furthermore, we are now discovering that because the traffic going through the Limerick tunnel is not as heavy as was originally envisioned, the State will have to fork out &euro;200 million to make up the shortfall.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, the other side will fire back by asking how we are supposed to meet the upfront capital costs to do it if we carry out these projects ourselves.  They will contend that PPPs allow us to leverage money from the private sector and so on.  This is where the madness of the application of the fiscal rules to capital expenditure comes in.  That is something that even some of the Government's people have acknowledged.  It is madness for the fiscal rules to treat vital capital infrastructure spending in the same way as current spending where our debt is concerned.  Infrastructure spending or capital investment spending actually creates an asset for the State, and in many cases creates revenue streams that will more than cover the costs of projects over the long term.  That should not be treated in the same way as current expenditure.</p></speech>

It was announced at a time when the use of PPP contracts was on the wane worldwide.  That same year, the UK Treasury was in the process of reviewing its PPP system because as the Treasury review put it, there was &quot;widespread concern that the public sector has not been getting value for money and taxpayers have not been getting a fair deal now and over the longer-term&quot;.  There was an apparent lack of analysis of the history of PPPs in Ireland at the time.  The only extensive review had been carried by the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2004.  That body had complained that a lack of transparency and limited access to essential documents, coupled with the short timeframe allowed for the report, had hindered the possibility of making a properly informed decision about the value of PPPs.</p><p>Prior to the Fine Gael-Labour stimulus plan, there was a substantial record of abandoned and delayed projects between 2009 and 2012, some 24 cases in all.  In 2012, the Comptroller and Auditor General showed that the cost already incurred on cancelled projects amounted to &euro;229.2 million, showing that PPPs have huge liability issues attached to them.  The Comptroller and Auditor General also recommended that the Government publish its evaluations of the value for money expected to be achieved through PPPs, but strangely this never happened.  All we get is outlandish figures for job creation that are never verified after the fact.  One has to wonder if there was a solid rationale for the effectiveness of a PPP-dominated stimulus package at all.</p><p>In-depth studies that get to the crux of the issue have been conducted elsewhere.  An extensive review of the use of PPPs and private finance initiatives, PFIs, in Northern Ireland over the course of ten years published by the Centre for International Public Health Policy in the University of Edinburgh found that:</p><blockquote>Private finance creates a public debt.  The public bodies involved in PPPs have to pay annual payments to the private sector over a long period, often 30 years.</blockquote><p>The review also concluded:</p><blockquote>The &ldquo;additionality&rdquo; of private finance is illusory &ndash; an accounting anomaly which distorts financing decisions.  Similarly, the notion that PPP can help to rebalance the economy is a misconception.  This is a policy that will channel work to large, overseas companies at the expense of domestic providers, curtailing private sector growth...  The evidence demonstrates that finance costs are higher for the private sector, and this, combined with an excessive rate of return on capital, has led to very high costs for the public authorities involved in contracts.</blockquote><p>Aside from the liability issues, the lack of transparency, the lack of incentive to provide value for money and the recent disaster of the collapse of Carillion, there is a serious question about the role of the State in appointing these firms.  As I mentioned in the D&aacute;il in January, the past ten years saw Carillion's profits continuously decline while its debt level skyrocketed.  According to a British parliamentary paper published in January, it ran up debts and sold assets worth &pound;217 million to continue paying dividends to shareholders between 2012 and 2016.  How in God's name Fine Gael and Labour thought that this firm was fit for purpose to build a range of schools in Ireland is beyond me.</p><p>The group paid out dividends of &pound;376 million over the five-year period, but it generated just &pound;159 million of net cash from operations.  Apparently we paid no attention to this.  On top of all that, from late 2015 onwards, it became the subject of a financial bet by hedge funds to the effect that it would collapse.  Around a quarter of all its shares have been lent to speculators since that time, which begs the obvious question.  If everybody in the market knew Carillion was in trouble, why did the Government go on handing the firm lucrative contracts?</p><p>Public private partnerships are non-existent in 13 of the 28 EU member states.  Some of these countries have the highest levels of public capital spending, and yet Ireland has the fourth highest level of engagement with PPPs and the fifth lowest public capital spend.  That is a figure that has to be looked at.  It is mad.  The notion that PPPs are necessary or that we would spend less on capital investment without them is pure fabrication.  Although we know that there is no proof that PPPs provide value for money, the whole notion of value for money is the wrong way to think about these services, since the cheapest option is very seldom the best one, as my experience in the construction industry brought home to me.</p><p>Last January, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, told the House during a Topical Issue debate: &quot;A key advantage of the public private partnership model is that the construction and funding risk is transferred to the private partner.&quot;  He should tell that to the subcontractors.  I am sure someone from the Minister of State's constituency is contacting him about this.  Despite the legislation that was brought in a few years ago, the subcontractors are unprotected.  A subcontractor by the name of Philip O'Grady in Wexford is owed more than &euro;80,000 by Sammon.  Sammon has gone under because it was working for Carillion.  It has now gone into examinership.  The Revenue Commissioners expects payment from Mr. O'Grady at the moment.  Where is he supposed to get the money if Sammon does not pay him?  The banks will not give it to him.  If the State had a direct role in the construction work, he would get paid.</p><p>In the same debate in January the Minister for Education and Skills said &quot;we have six buildings close to completion and in State ownership, for which no payments have been made, other than for off-site works&quot;.  If the State has not paid this absolute fabrication of a business called Carillion, is money available to pay the subcontractors?  It would be very interesting to know that.  Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned Mr. Niall Reynolds in Meath.  He contacted me this morning as well.  It is a sad story.  He says that people in his position seem to be nobody's business and are left to wait for a pittance from the examiner after all their hard and honest work.</p><p>The Construction Contracts Act 2013 must be revisited.  I will tell the House something we do an awful lot in this country.</p><p>We legislate but we do not follow up on it.  We have rules and regulations which are not implemented, imposed or monitored.  Section 19 of the Criminal Justice Act 2011 provides that a person who becomes aware of corruption is obliged to inform An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, the National Asset Management Agency does not do so because it could not care less about the Act.  According to the law, companies are obliged to report wrongdoing to the Garda.  At the same time, it is grand if they do not do so because at most they will receive a slap on the wrist.  NAMA has not even been given a slap on the wrist. </p> <p>  The same applies in the case of the Construction Contracts Act 2013.  This legislation was intended to protect subcontractors but does not do so because it is not enforced.  To take the example of a subcontractor whose contract states he must be paid within 60 days of doing work, if the contractor has not paid after 100 days and the subcontractor says he needs the money because his company is small, the contractor may say he will pay within a month because he is also stuck.  What is the subcontractor supposed to do in that scenario?  Should he refuse to do any further work until he is paid?  If his company was strong enough, he probably would refuse to do further work but most subcontractors are not in that position.  This means they will keep working, which sometimes results in them digging a deeper hole, as was the case with most of the subcontractors who worked for Sammon.</p> <p> The number of subcontractors complaining about the fallout from Carillion is horrific.  Joe Gabbett, a steel fabricator from Wexford town, is owed &euro;180,000 by Sammon for steelwork he did in a number of the company's buildings.  Sammon was working for Carillion.  What will happen If Mr. Gabbett does not certify the steelwork he did?  The law provides that no one will be able to move into a school unless the work is certified.  This is creating serious problems.  At the end of January, when Deputy Clare Daly and I spoke on a Topical Issue debate on this matter, the impression given was that the issue would be sorted out within weeks.  I stated at the time that there was not a prayer that it would be solved in a few weeks because these problems are extremely complicated.  In fairness to Mr. Gabbett, he stated his company will survive because it is strong.  However, he also described the lack of protection for subcontractors as bordering on criminal and said the Construction Contracts Act was not worth toilet paper because it was not being implemented.</p> <p> Subcontractors are being hung out to dry.  I walk along Molesworth Street on my way to the Italian quarter twice a day.  I am repeatedly stopped by subcontractors who are working on new offices on the street being built with investment money from US companies and vulture funds.  They ask me to do something to protect subcontractors and ensure small Irish companies are treated fairly.  Subcontractors have been left out on limb because of the closure of Carillion and the subsequent collapse of Sammon.  Subcontractors are not normally paid in such circumstances.  The Government must examine this issue because it is a major problem for small businesses employing Irish people.  </p></speech>

I read the Minister of State's speech, as I was not present when he contributed.  It states that we have been experimenting with public private partnerships for a long time, certainly longer than I had thought.  I was an advocate for public private partnerships at one time.  However, the jury is out on them.  We also have many design, build and operate contracts, including in County Tipperary, for water infrastructure, sewage treatment plants and many other public services.  I have questions about that approach.  Yesterday, at a committee meeting with Uisce &Eacute;ireann, I raised a major contamination of a water source in the River Anner at Mullinahone, County Tipperary, the birthplace of Charles J. Kickham.  The scheme was built under a design, build and operate contract.  I received reports that the company operating the scheme handed it back, having maintained the plant in pristine condition for the duration of the contract, and the contamination was not spotted on time.  This resulted in significant costs, upset and upheaval for consumers and is a matter of concern.  Who is monitoring the scheme for flaws?  Irish Water and Tipperary County Council deserve praise for their diligence and hard work in trying to get the scheme back into operation.  The Health Service Executive was also involved.</p>  <p>  Public private partnerships operate to deliver projects.  I note &euro;1.2 billion was spent on these partnerships during the crisis that followed the crash.  There were many fancy sod turning ceremonies, engagements and brochures associated with them and I supported this approach, because I believed public private partnerships offered a way to fast-track the delivery of some badly-needed projects.  People had waited for years for some projects.  The Burncourt and Fethard water scheme, for example, was 50 years in gestation before it was officially opened last year by the Minister of State, Deputy English.  People were drinking bad water for a long time.  Once the project was completed and the scheme opened, we thought everything had been rectified.</p>  <p>  Deputy Wallace referred to a number of issues associated with public private partnerships.  We have a problem with a bundle of schools at the moment.  Not a week passes that I am not contacted by people from different counties who have been caught out by these partnerships.  The subcontractor is the last man to be paid.  Subcontractors must buy materials, run vans, pay for insurance, obtain health and safety statements and ensure all employees have safe passes.  They are badly stung when a contractor collapses.  Deputy Wallace mentioned Carillion which, as far as I am concerned, was recklessly trading.  God knows we have too many agencies but someone in one of the agencies or elsewhere in government must be monitoring the billions that are being invested in public private partnerships.</p>  <p>  How are these private companies trading and what are their financial returns?  Deputy Wallace cited the financial returns of some of them and they were extraordinary.  Somebody must keep an eye on these projects because when one of them is not delivered, the consequences are felt by the ordinary subcontractor, whether a self-employed individual or a small company with five or six employees.  These companies are the backbone of the country because no project can be delivered without them.</p>  <p>  The closure of a large company has knock-on effects.  The collapse of Carillion resulted in the closure of Sammon, which delayed the school projects and left behind a mess.  The smaller guys, those who do the second and first fixes and finish the tarmac, electrical and plumbing work, are caught time and again when this happens. </p>  <p>  In 2008, I attended a meeting at a hotel in Dublin called after a company, whose name I cannot recall, went bust.  There were 600 subcontractors involved and 500 of them attended the meeting.  We fought hard on this issue, raising it in the House every second day to try to get the Government to enact the Construction Contracts Bill.  The legislation was eventually passed but, as Deputy Wallace correctly pointed out, while it is fine to pass legislation, the issue is implementing it.  We do not examine the impact of legislation either.  It is not rural-proofed and in this case it was not proofed on behalf of subcontractors to find out what would be the knock-on effects if a project were to go belly up.  Such cases have resulted in suicides and caused severe distress for the wives and families of subcontractors, who come under financial pressure from the banks which show no mercy.  The people who feel the pressure are subcontractors in local communities employing local staff who they do not want to leave unpaid.  However, one cannot get blood from a stone and if the subcontractor is not paid, he cannot pay anyone else.  Who is monitoring this?</p><p>Deputy Wallace referred also to the record of these companies when it comes to paying within 60 days.  It can be 120 or 130 days.  One does the work in good faith and in the hope of getting paid and one's hand is in the dog's mouth.  That dog can bite and he can bark and he can bite worse than he barks.  One is caught then and in a cycle of trying to keep employees on the books and paying suppliers for materials while the big companies hold one to ransom.</p> <p> I saw the evaluation of public private partnerships by the Government.  Who carries out that evaluation?  We need people with expertise and people who have been affected within these review groups.  We need people from industry to have an input.  While the CIF will be involved, it does not represent the small self-employed person in any shape or form.  It is interested in big business.  Who is looking after this and how are the people on the ground who have been hurt the most being represented?  They are providing three to six jobs in villages or rural areas and the equipment and vans to do the work.  They need an NCT and certificates and they have to deal with more and more regulation.  It is not funny.  We must examine this seriously, including the situation with Sammon and the school projects.  Behind those school projects and the delay in their delivery is the anguish and trauma of subcontractors, their wives and families.  They have to put food on the table.  They have to pay their employees and their taxes, in regard to which they get no mercy from Revenue.  They are subject to savage penalties and interest from Revenue if they are late because they cannot get paid.  They have to pay their VAT every month.  Many of them pay their PRSI every week but there is no compassion, understanding or empathy.  The big companies can get away with whatever they like.  They collapse, go into receivership and one sees them back operating within a short period.</p> <p> We have to question public private partnerships in relation to tolling and other lucrative contracts where deals have been done.  They are very flimsy and not good for the taxpayer.  Who is in charge here?  No one is and these contracts roll along.  None of the public servants advising the Ministers has ever worked in this industry.  They do not understand it or have any empathy in respect of it.  That is the problem.  The CIF is too close to Government and pally with the big lads.  No one is looking after the daoine beag, the little people, who are the enablers and providers who get up early in the morning, to use the phrase of certain Deputies, and stay out working late at night.  We must give those people some semblance of respect and revisit the Construction Contracts Act which is clearly not working.  There should be a review date after 12 months at least in respect of all legislation we pass here to determine how it is bedding down and whether it is having the desired impact or a negative one.  We do not do so however.  We may take years to pass a Bill, as with the construction contracts legislation, but once it is implemented, we forget about it.  It was not even commenced for a long time, albeit it is now.  How is it bedding down?</p> <p> NERA is walking into businesses around the country to check the entitlements of staff, which is fine.  However, we need a new body or to change NERA into a support unit to assist small, self-employed operators.  They are very busy people and they do not have the expertise to deal with all this paperwork and regulations.  They are able to do their jobs very well and they employ people and create an economy in their local areas, but they are often not into the legislative aspects of it or the engagement with health and safety and the plethora of other regulations.  They need to be helped but above all they need protection from these large conglomerates which have public private partnership contracts.  The work is passed down through sizable companies like Sammon but when the salmon is caught in the river, pardon the pun, numerous small business and tradespeople are impacted.  It is just not good enough.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-26a.364" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1329" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600028#EE00200"><p>This issue is very important and the Minister of State's speech identified and recognised a number of the points made by Opposition Members.  As the economic situation has improved, the Government has prioritised significantly increased direct Exchequer investment in capital infrastructure.  That will grow to 4% of our national income by 2027.  This is a huge reliance on State capital, not on public private partnerships.  It is money from the taxpayer to carry out the projects which are so urgently and badly needed.  In the 2040 capital investment plan, the Government has identified the projects which it will support and which will be built.  I am Chairman of the transport committee which dealt yesterday with the metro project.  This project will involve expenditure of over &euro;3 billion to provide a modern, efficient metro system in the city of Dublin.  The Government is also expanding the DART and is providing over &euro;2 billion to bring the service to places like Drogheda, which I welcome.  That commitment is mentioned in the national planning framework.</p>  <p>  The Government is doing the right thing and relying more on our own money to do the jobs which must be done to provide critical infrastructure.  While it acknowledges the need for public private partnerships, it limits them to not more than any project included in the national development plan.  Public private partnerships will assist the State rather than, as Opposition Members said, constituting uncontrollable companies which exploit users.  I agree in particular with Deputy Mattie McGrath on tolls and the way tolling operates.  There is a toll in my constituency on the M1.  In the last year or so, over 1,000 drivers were overcharged by the toll operator which never bothered to tell anybody about it.  When I discovered after public complaints what was doing on there, the fine imposed under the Transport Infrastructure Ireland arrangement was &euro;3,800 in total notwithstanding that thousands were overcharged.  The money was also refunded.  As the Minister of State said in his speech, what is important is to have much greater accountability and transparency for the public private partnerships that are actually in place.  I am concerned about the impact this toll has had in my constituency and on the people who live there.  They are concerned that they are being exploited and that the toll operator is not accountable.</p>  <p>  When the M1 was built, Julianstown and north Drogheda were bypassed.  However, the traffic flows in the village of Julianstown stood at 25 vehicles per day in 2004 before the toll came in.  In 2018, that figure is now approaching 20,000 vehicles per day.  What is needed is a bypass of that village for the huge volume of traffic which continues to be generated not only because more people are living in the area, but also because of the use of the alternative route by people who feel the toll is too great an imposition on an everyday basis.  Our constituency needs a bypass around Julianstown and a proper and decent Platin Road interchange.  The road from the Platin interchange into Drogheda is appalling and fit only for 19th century horse and cart traffic.  It is not fit for the modern city Drogheda is becoming.  How do we deal with these issues and address the impact of capital infrastructure like the tolled road on our area?  Julianstown is choc-a-bloc with traffic 24/7 and we have an unacceptable infrastructure distributor road around the town.</p>  <p>  We also have another problem on the northern side of the town where a new distributor road is being built not by public private partnership but on the basis of developer contributions, which is almost the same thing, in regard to the 5,000 houses which will be built there.  As the houses are built, the contribution will be provided by the developer to the local authority to provide the northern cross route.  That is not good enough because it will take five to ten years while the town of Drogheda is choked by HGVs, heavy traffic and a port which is seeking to expand.  Local communities are up in arms about HGVs going through their town.  We need a new bridge on the eastern side of the town and that is in our Drogheda Port plan.  We also need a new distributor road back to the motorway.  The issue is whether these things are going to be provided through public private partnership or taxpayer spending.</p><p>I want to ensure it happens.  The designation by the Government of Drogheda as an area for significant regional investment in both jobs and housing, as well as for population growth, needs a proper plan.  That is why we should look at a PPP, public private partnership, if necessary, to provide this infrastructure but in a way in which the taxpayer and the community can control the policies.  That is what is not happening with PPPs now.</p> <p> Significant capital infrastructure investment is needed in our rail network.  We welcome the fact that the DART is coming to Drogheda, with thousands more passenger spaces coming in and out of the town.  However, we need a new railway station on the north of the town and in the village of Dunleer.  Both of these proposals are predicated upon the development of housing.  It is only when the houses are built that the capital will be provided for that rail network infrastructure.  We need an interim or short-term PPP to provide that infrastructure.  That is what the Minister of State spoke about when he referred to a ten-year maximum period within which PPPs will operate.  The M1 toll operation PPP was designed to operate for 20 years.  Accordingly, taxpayers feel they are not getting any benefit and are being ripped off by the toll operators.  A shorter period in future projects, as proposed in the Minister of State's speech, would make much sense.</p> <p> There is a structural deficit in north County Louth.  The proposed Narrow Water bridge, a North-South project, would be advantageous to both counties Down and Louth, as well as to tourism in the area.  When it was first proposed, the price came in at &euro;19 million.  However, later the prices came in between &euro;25 million and &euro;27 million.  This made it impossible under project analysis to proceed with.  Private enterprises were looking for significant amounts of money which were disproportionate to the actual costs.</p> <p> As Government funding increases, the economy gets better and as more people are working, more funds will be available.  The core of the Government's plan is that our capital projects will be increasingly funded not by PPPs but by the taxpayer.  That would make much more sense and is what Members on the far side of the House were advocating.  However, it must be remembered when times were bad and the economy collapsed, we were spending &euro;18 billion more than we actually had.  That is why we were held in hock, not just by the banks and the international financial community, but by paying for PPPs because we had no other way of funding infrastructure projects.  I welcome the fact all of that is changing.</p> <p> Accountability is important, as is the reduction in the duration of PPPs.  More transparency and accountability, as well as a better deal for the taxpayer with more oversight of all of these projects, is necessary.  It is absolutely unacceptable that, when over 1,000 motorists were ripped off by the M1 tolls outside Drogheda, I only got back one sheet of paper through freedom of information requests.  The only record that exists is actually my original complaint about it.  No explanation has been given and we do not know what happened.  That is not good enough.  It symbolises what is wrong and what has happened in the past.  I welcome the administrative commitment to change that.  We all have to ensure we get proper value for money, the Government infrastructure we need, as well as the capital plan dealt with.  Our towns and cities are growing and we have to ensure the infrastructure is in place to meet future demands.</p></speech>

As we have been saying for some time on this side of the Chamber, a significant portion of those are not real social houses at all.  Up to 30% of that 50,000 will be delivered through PPPs or various forms of leasing from the private sector, the most recent of which is a kind of PPP on steroids.  The problem is that, just as the rest of the world is actually walking away from the use of PPPs in the delivery of social and affordable housing, we have, for the first time in the history of this State, a Government embracing it with gusto.</p>  <p>  It is not my opinion that these do not represent value for money or a good way to deliver social and affordable housing.  Much more eminent and mainstream organisations than Sinn F&eacute;in or other Opposition parties are on public record as saying this is a bad way to proceed.  The European Court of Auditors published a detailed report in March this year, specifying right across the European Union the failure of PPPs to deliver quality infrastructure and value for money.  The European Services Strategy Unit has done a detailed paper, particularly focusing on PPP failures in housing provision.  We have had the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee, no bastion of radical political action, arguing strongly against the use of PPPs in regeneration and social housing projects.  Even our own Comptroller and Auditor General has highlighted problems with PPPs.  I urge the Minister of State to consider some of these points, notwithstanding the superficial presentation he made at the start, because he ignores the real concerns many of these organisations and some of us on the Opposition Benches have.</p>  <p>  The first thing that has to happen with a PPP for social and affordable housing is this mysterious exercise called the public sector benchmark.  It involves a small group of civil servants going into a room to calculate what it would cost the public sector to do a particular project over a set period, ranging from how to finance, build, maintain and manage the tenancy of a social house over 25 years.  That is then locked away in secret.  There is no scrutiny from politicians in local or central government or in Parliament.  Tenders are then requested.  If the private sector comes in at or below that public sector benchmark, then it has an opportunity to secure the contract.  At no stage is there any proper public scrutiny of how those figures were established.  With respect to the PPPs for social housing, we do not see what the public service benchmark exercise is until after the tenders are awarded.  There is no transparency, no accountability or no mechanism to ensure the interests of the taxpayer, let alone tenants in social housing, are adequately protected.</p>  <p>  That raises real questions about value for money.  The idea that PPPs represent better value for money than standard State investment or borrowing simply does not add up.  In addition to the standard costs to build a house, to maintain it and to manage the tenant, one also has to factor in the profit premium for the PPP consortium over 25 years of the arrangement, plus one has to factor in an additional cushion of risk in case things change.  We know for example that the maintenance of buildings of any kind, particularly public housing, is expensive with changes in technology, price of materials, labour etc.  One just does not have a profit margin but an additional cushion of risk which the taxpayer ends up paying for.  Even on the most basic analysis, assuming nothing goes wrong, we already know they are going to be 7% to 10% to 15% more expensive over the lifetime of the project than if the State were to do the exact same job itself.</p>  <p>  The second issue is the contracts.  This is not just a simple tendering contract one would have with a builder to provide social housing.  These are incredibly complex contractual arrangements.  It takes an enormous amount of time for public officials in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and the local authorities to negotiate these.  They are filled with all sorts of additional risks.  The most recent study of PPPs in Britain for social housing and regeneration has shown that additional costs will be incurred when the PPP consortium identifies additional costs halfway through the project after five, ten or 15 years, and then threatens to withdraw from the project if additional funds are not provided.  In some cases, the local authorities said they were not providing them.  Accordingly, the PPP consortium withdrew and the Treasury had to pick up the tab.  In other cases, the local authorities paid the extra money.  This idea that the PPPs work because they transfer risk on to consortia simply is not borne out by the history of the projects.</p>  <p>  There is also the issue of timescales.  When he was Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Coveney, announced 1,500 PPP social houses were to be delivered in three tranches of 500.</p><p>What we are hearing today from officials in local authorities in the five areas where these houses are to be delivered is that not only is it taking longer to negotiate these contracts but that the private sector may not actually be interested because the deal is not strong enough in terms of profitability.  This has led the Government to find new ways to offer incentives to the private sector, something I will return to later.  Not only is it more expensive, and has greater risks, but it takes significantly longer.  On the basis of this first tranche, it may be adding an additional 12 months onto the three years it already takes to deliver a social housing project in this State.</p> <p> As someone who wants to see social housing being delivered and who has voted for planning permissions for local authorities that unfortunately will be funded by public private partnerships, if the Government does not listen to the advice from this side of the House, it simply makes no sense.  That is not an ideological argument, it is based on evidence provided by a range of eminent bodies.</p> <p> I mentioned that the first tranche of public private partnership is experiencing some difficulties.  I have heard that private sector investors do not think there is a sufficient level of profit, notwithstanding the additional cost to taxpayers, so what has the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government done?  It has gone back to the drawing board and asked investors, in particular real estate investment trusts and other so-called tax efficient vehicles, such as Irish collective asset management vehicles, ICAVs, to go away and design a new scheme.  It came back with a wonderful entity called the enhanced leasing scheme.  Not only will it have the disadvantage of the public private partnership, additional premiums and risks, but there will be a greater level of payment to the consortium over the 25 years.  Unlike PPPs, which are bad enough, at the end of that 25 years, the State will not even own the asset.  It will pay over the odds for social housing for 25 years and at the end of that period, the so-called tax efficient vehicles, the REITs or the ICAVs can sell it on and, because of the way they are structured regarding tax, they will pay no capital gains tax and will not even have to pay dividend withholding tax to many of their investors.</p> <p> In some ways, the debate around public private partnerships and social housing has moved on to this much worse funding mechanism, the enhanced leasing scheme.  However, the most sensible way to do this, the way it was done in the 1950s and the 1970s when the State built more houses than at any time in its history, is to fund local authorities directly, either through Exchequer revenue or through low interest borrowing by the State or the Housing Finance Agency, to build the units directly.  It is crucial to ensure there is sufficient revenue, some of which can come from affordable rental or cost rental to the social housing stock alongside traditional differential rent, to ensure that there is proper maintenance.</p> <p> We are at a time when mainstream and now even right-wing economists are telling us that public private partnerships do not work.  Colm McCarthy, who many on this side of the House would have long regarded as a bogeyman of right-wing economics, has argued publicly that they do not represent value for taxpayers money, that the State does not get to control the asset to the same extent as if there was direct State, central or local government involvement.  They produce poor quality housing stock with poor systems of management in a way that is bad for tenants, communities and taxpayers.  I do not hold much hope that he will do so.  However, I urge the Minister of State not to listen to myself, Deputies Boyd Barrett and O'Reilly or others who spoke, but to read the European Court of Auditors report from April 2018.  Read the reports from the House of Commons or the Comptroller and Auditor General, particularly with respect to housing, which is the area I know more than others, and try to understand that this is a bad way to fund 30% of housing output from now until 2021.  Abandon those plans and start to allow local authorities and approved housing bodies access to the funding they need because otherwise we will return in five, six or 12 months when projects have collapsed, as they are doing in the school sector, or in ten or 15 years when we are dealing with poorly run social housing estates, managed by the private construction sector, or worse again in 25 years when the State has paid above the odds for these units and they have been sold on into the private sector and tenants have to be rehoused in real public housing, as we have warned.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-26a.368" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1248" speakername="John McGuinness" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600030#GG00200"><p>I join the previous speaker in his view in public private partnerships and link it with the failure rate and cost of projects already delivered.  I will focus on the SME sector.  A considerable number of these public private partnerships exclude the SME sector in this country and as a result, the bigger players in the market are awarded contracts because smaller businesses cannot meet the criteria set out in the procurement process.  For example, a company might be required to have a turnover of &euro;8 million or &euro;10 million over several years.  Those in the construction business from 2007 onwards would not have had that kind of turnover unless they were quite a large company.  The market is limited and the State is not getting value for money.  Where there is value for money, one finds that the larger contractor gives a price but is screwing the subcontractors.  We have seen so many of these larger firms go broke and it is the smaller businesses that pick up the slack and carry the debt, so that several of them have gone out of business.  They cannot afford the type of hits they have endured from losses of revenue because they are not covered in these contracts.</p>  <p>  Similarly, in the construction of roads, contracts are awarded which are generally subcontracted to smaller companies or there may be a number of subcontractors involved in the scheme itself.  Should the main contractor go broke, the small business invariably suffers.  There must be some rules within the procurement process that protects SMEs.  The contract might stipulate payment regulations, such as how and when they should paid, and there should be a hold in the Department or the local authority on the payment sums being made to the main contractor, so that there would have to be proof of payment to the SMEs, and proof of efficient payment, which might limit the amount of money that could be lost should the main contractor go broke.  </p>  <p>  Until Government changes that, we will continue to see SMEs under threat from bigger contractors which make their profits on the backs of the SME sector.  That is what is happening.  The State is not getting a good price, and it is certainly not getting a good social dividend for SMEs, it is getting a risk-based price, and the risk is being carried by the small businesses that become involved with the contractor.</p>  <p>  The Government should not turn a blind eye to what has happened recently in terms of future contracts.  It should change the contract and its emphasis.  I ask that it examines the value for money element of PPPs.  The Comptroller and Auditor General wrote a report some time ago which was discussed by previous Committees of Public Accounts.  It seems that the figures bear out that the management of these PPPs, up to their end, can cost up to 43% extra in the actual cost of the project.  I would like to see house construction return to the local authorities, for example.  How was it that when our country had little or nothing in the 1950s and 1960s that we built huge housing schemes?  Over the years, the people living there formed strongly based, sustainable communities, where neighbours looked out for one another.  That is what happened.  One does not have that now.  I ask that the Government examines procurement through local authorities at a local level, delivering the number of houses that are required by each local authority area.  There are 3,500 people on the list in Kilkenny.  I do not anticipate that will fall much given Government policy on housing construction because the houses are not being built.  Looking around the country, it seems that the councils do not want to build houses; they have no interest in doing so.  They certainly have no interest in carrying out repairs.  They continue to bring in guidelines and so on for tenants.</p><p>These guidelines dictate to the tenants that once they get the house, everything else is their responsibility and that, as a landlord, the council is going to stand back and do nothing for them.  It will collect the rent and do nothing.  That seems to be the position of county councils on this issue.  I ask the Minister of State to look the possibility of changing the procurement and funding model so that, as I have said, we can have a sustainable plan and strategy in place to ensure the delivery of housing schemes and their sustainability after they are constructed without a cost to the State.</p> <p> To return to PPPs and recent events, I tabled questions to the Minister regarding the subcontractors who were caught out in respect of the schools being constructed, particularly the one in Carlow, although there are many more around.  There are suppliers to those schools who have, for example, already supplied furniture.  The schools are ready to open.  They will be using the furniture manufactured or purchased by these small businesses.  The latter may not have been paid sums of as much as &euro;250,000.  How can the Government stand by and watch that happen?  How can it watch a small business being threatened with the possible loss of jobs?  How can it stand back and say that it is not really its responsibility and that these businesses should go away and try to deal with the original contractor knowing full well that they will not be paid?  Something has to be done.</p> <p> Next week in Kilkenny or Carlow there will be a meeting of all the subcontractors involved with one of these contracts.  They will tell the Minister of State, if he listens, that while they are caught on this contract, there is a high risk of getting caught on similar contracts.  They will say that they will not be paid and that they are turning to the Government for support.  Will the Minister of State address that matter in his response?  Will he address the possibility of the Government introducing something retrospective to ensure that these businesses are paid something or to ensure that the new contractor brought in to complete the job will look at the existing contracts and ensure they are paid?  Otherwise, the Minister of State risks the possibility of an action being taken to prevent the takeover or use of schools that are completed and furnished because subcontractors are waiting to be paid.  The students or pupils in these schools may be sitting on seats and working on desks which have not been paid for.  That is simply wrong.  We have seen too much of it in this country and we have seen too little from Government in the context of the protections required to protect small businesses and the jobs they create in the sort of communities that the Minister of State and I represent.  It is a simple thing to do.  It is a contractual matter.</p> <p> After that, the Minister of State must look at the procurement process and go back to the old way of doing things, which is to do them directly.  For example, in the case of those contracts that involve management after handover, no one can change a light bulb.  The manager must be called out to do it.  No one can do anything within the school unless the management company is engaged.  The Minister of State should look at all of the costs attached to that.  He should also look at the schools built in the traditional way.  The community input into those schools saved the State the cost of management.</p> <p> We are moving towards a situation in which the Government and the politicians in this House will be proved wrong in respect of obtaining value for money.  This is because we have stuck our heads in the sand and ignored not only the results to date in this country but also those in other European countries where this PPP system has failed.  It has failed the public sector and the small and medium enterprise sector and the figures have proved that it will result in a huge cost to the State in the end.  Procurement is important.  Getting value for money is important.  However, sustaining jobs and looking at the figures are also important.  If the Minister of State looks at the figures, he will have to accept that there is a need for radical change in this area.</p></speech>

If he does not, he may share with Deputy Joan Collins.  We will get there in the end.  I am very glad to have the opportunity to speak on this subject because there are huge ideological issues underpinning this debate.  There is a certain irony to the situation.  We hear an enormous amount about, for example, the role of foreign direct investment in the economy and about all the jobs that are so dependent on it.  That mantra continues on and on.  The reality is, however, that the public sector and the jobs sustained by public service are actually the backbone of this economy, as they are also the backbone of every other economy.  When we look at PPPs, we have to see them in that context.  What this is really about, as far as I am concerned, is extending the influence of capital into the public sphere by allowing private companies like Capita or Seetec to rebrand themselves as providers of public goods.  What we are talking about here is public goods which belong to the State and which should remain in the hands of the State to be managed by State structures and not be outsourced to unaccountable private companies.  That is the backdrop to this issue.</p>  <p>  The advantages which it is claimed derive from the use of PPPs include a supposed ability to use the expertise of private companies.  Let us look at that claim for a moment because there is no good reason why we cannot pay for expertise if it is out there and if it is needed.  It does not have to come at the cost of giving away long-term control or ownership of our infrastructure.  I find it a little bit ironic to hear the representatives of Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party crying och&oacute;n about the tragedy of PPPs when they were in Governments which stood over and accelerated the use of PPPs in our society.</p>  <p>  It is a far cry from the days when we paid for expertise.  People have talked a lot about the 1950s and 1960s.  Let us talk about the 1930s, when electricity was brought to Ireland.  When the ESB embarked on a process of rural electrification in the 1930s it hired expertise from the German engineering company Siemens.  It did not give ownership of the ESB to the Germans.  It retained Irish ownership and paid for the expertise from Germany.  It was such an ambitious project that editorials in newspapers at the time were saying that the scale of electrification was going to result in people being fried in their beds because so much power was going to be generated.  Those who sponsored the project had vision, however.  It was run by the State, owned by the State and the State kept that expertise and used it for the benefit of the public good.  We would have to say that those days are long gone, not just under this Government but also under the previous ones.</p>  <p>  The supposed reason given for using PPPs is that the private partner shares some of the risk.  What a load of absolute and utter rubbish.  It is just not true.  Ultimately, we all know that when private concerns are involved in public infrastructure projects, such projects are too important to fail so the State invariably ends up stepping in to complete the project and pay off any debts that have been accrued along the way.  The case of Carillion is a very obvious example.  The real reason the Government is now looking at PPPs is that debacle.  This was a huge private company that had been handed massive public contracts in the areas of health, education, construction and even school dinners.  Using private companies such as this to finance public infrastructure projects off balance sheet is incredibly risky.  It is not risky for the private companies; they do not face the risk.  The risk is for the State because the projects may be off balance sheet but, as the briefing from the Parliamentary Budget Office emphasised, the liabilities still exist.  Invariably it is the State that ends up stepping in and carrying that risk.</p>  <p>  We have seen the knock-on effects of that in the case of Carillion and the impact on the Irish construction firm the Sammon Group, which has entered examinership as a direct result.  Sammon had been subcontracted by Carillion to build six education facilities under a PPP deal with the State and now, of course, we have to have another tendering process in order to finish some of those projects.</p><p>While Sammon, as a private company, will of course attempt to rescue its business, the public projects to which it has committed are far down its list of priorities.  This should not surprise us because as soon as Carillion began to struggle, its board began to change its own rules, not in order that the public could get this important public job to which we had signed up, but to protect the executive bonuses in that company.  The chief executive officer, CEO, received a &pound;1.5 million golden handshake on top of his &pound;600,000 salary, despite the debacle the company stood over.  We need to be aware of this when we commit &euro;9.6 billion of taxpayers' money to public expenditure on PPPs.  There are many PPPs, many of which are just privatisation by another name.  We need to see transparency on all the categories in terms of value for money for the State, as well as efficiency in the delivery of services.</p> <p> Broadband is a particular example in this regard.  As we have plenty of time now, I am sure Deputy Broughan will not mind being moved to the next speaking slot, seeing as we are all on the one side and in the one camp.  I will finish out this point.  Broadband is incredibly important.  When we talk about rural Ireland, it is ironic to think that rural Ireland actually contains huge chunks of north County Dublin within a very short radius of our national airport, yet these areas are deemed to be rural from the point of view of the provision of our national broadband services.  I refer to areas such as Ballyboughal, Oldtown and so on.  Let us consider the present scheme and the recent announcement that the European Investment Bank will invest &euro;500 million in the roll-out of Irish broadband.  When I sought to ask questions about this and asked the Minister the terms of this funding, a reasonable question in the context of public money being spent, the Minister refused to answer and we are still none the wiser in that regard.</p> <p> A huge part of this is that these are public services and public infrastructural projects.  It is an absolute fact that if one hands them over to the private sector, the private companies do not do it for the good of their health but to make money.  Handing over ownership is a lunatic proposition, as far as I am concerned, but when it is done, there absolutely must be transparency in its administration, in order that the public gets that for which it paid and to which it is entitled.  The same discrepancies apply throughout the system and there is a knock-on impact on the broader area of procurement and how our rules are not transparent and are ignored.</p> <p> Only this week I was contacted by a firm that is on the OPW's list as a supplier in respect of the provision of services.  The firm did not supply and was not chosen to install windows in the new Garda office in Wexford.  It maintains it was bypassed on the list and that the types of windows and the quality of the work put in by those who got the contract to install them are not up to spec, not up to standard and it is not being administered properly.  The firm contends that the use of the type of glass that is being used in detention areas there poses a very high risk of breakage due to the low strength of the glass.  The firm cannot get answers even though it is on the procurement panel.  This might be a small example but it is an important one to this Irish firm, which is on the list.  There is a knock-on effect as well.  We see it in so many areas.  We had a company that excelled in the provision of educational books fold because the contract was set up at a level at which no Irish firm could compete and the English market came over and took up our supply of educational books.  Procurement and the delivery of public goods are public services for the Irish people.  They should be held, as far as I am concerned, in State ownership and by the public, whereby we employ expertise for cost but do not hand over ownership.  Carillion and other examples have shown what an absolute disaster that can be.</p></speech>

From what I have seen of them, they are a capital grab on State ownership and resources and are used to create huge profits for their CEOs.  Many of them do not deliver to the standard to which they should deliver and they are normally for short-term gain.  Many examples have been given already, such as Carillion and other companies that have used PPPs.  This increasingly became policy in the 1980s, after Thatcher.  Then there was the Thatcherite-Reaganite type of light-touch regulation, public private partnerships and the sell-off of utilities and services in State ownership to private companies.  What we have seen in most instances in which the State has had to move in if these projects fail - most of them do - is that the taxpayer has had to pay more, tax breaks are given, etc.</p>  <p>  I wish to make a particular point about housing.  I know other points have been made about this and the fact that 30% of social housing under the Government's Rebuilding Ireland plan to 2021 is to be funded by public private partnerships.  This is a real sell-out for the people of this country.  We are in the biggest housing crisis we have seen in decades, with 3,500 children homeless, 100,000 people on the housing waiting list and people who cannot access mortgages because of low wages, yet the Government is still looking to public private partnerships to deliver.</p>  <p>  I wish to put on the record of the D&aacute;il a real alternative that makes so much sense it is unbelievable.  The Government cannot see the wood for the trees.  This morning I attended a briefing by representatives of the St. Michael's Estate family resource centre and other community activists, who put forward a programme for their estate which I will outline here because the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, will be the person who will make a decision whether this capital expenditure for next year of &euro;55 million to build these public houses on public lands will be provided.  The main point they made was that people are looking to the Government to use our public resources wisely and for public good, not private gain.  This was also acknowledged by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government following the publication in April 2018 of the report entitled, "Review of Delivery Costs and Viability for Affordable Residential Developments".  It is estimated that local authorities have 1,200 ha of land with the potential for 38,000 homes.  This land is already serviced and zoned as residential land yet is not being allocated to public housing.  The State is the single biggest land hoarder in Ireland, according to many property analysts.  In addition, it appears that land sold by the State agency NAMA to various vulture funds could have accommodated 50,000 homes, yet fewer than 4,000 are completed or under construction on lands formerly owned by NAMA.  A large proportion of the sites lie vacant - for example, 98% in Cork, 87% in Dublin and 87% in Meath.</p>  <p>  There is a better way to use publicly owned land.  It is to build public housing on public land.  These activists are putting forward a plan for a cost-rental model, which they call the fair rents home model, whereby 300 units would be built in St. Michael's Estate for &euro;55 million.  The idea is that the rent would pay for the cost in the long term.  They say annual rent collected for 150 social differential rental units would be &euro;457,000 a year, and annual rent collected for 150 fair rent homes - cost-rental units - would be &euro;1.62 million.  Annual rent collected for the whole scheme would be &euro;2 million per year.  The return to the State per annum would be 3.71%.  This makes sense because we are talking about people who are over the cap for social housing.  These would be professionals, possibly teachers.  There was a young girl at the briefing this morning who said she works in a particular multinational, cannot afford to get a mortgage but earns too much to be eligible for social housing.  This would be a game changer if it were rolled out right across the country on all public lands, which it should be.  It should be seriously looked at in the context of what landlords are now charging for rent and the cost of housing in the longer term.  This is an ideological line that the Government finds difficult to cross.</p><p>As for Fianna F&aacute;il and the Labour Party procuring these public private partnerships, I remind Members it was Martin Cullen in 2003, after the St. Michael's task force on regeneration was set up, who rejected the plan put forward and instructed the council to pursue a public private partnership deal for the site.  We are still waiting for those houses to be built.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-26a.377" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1361" speakername="Tommy Broughan" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600033#KK00200"><p>The UK started its private finance initiative, PFI, programme in 1990 and the total estimated value of its public private partnerships is approximately &pound;32 billion, whereas in Ireland so far it is &euro;2.3 billion.  Over the existence of previous Governments and the current Government, we have been used to school bundles and other proposals on housing and critical infrastructure.  The reason the Government turned in that direction is precisely because of the blanket bank guarantee, the crash and the decision to totally eviscerate capital spending in this country for a decade.  This was a deplorable decision and nobody involved in it really should be in the House.</p><p>If we look at the British record there has been severe criticism of the operation of public private partnerships.  It has also had the experience of Carillion.  One of its most distinguished economists, Martin Wolf, who writes in the <i>Financial Times,</i>stated:</p><blockquote>A PFI contract creates a long-term contractual liability, just as government borrowing does. ... Accounting procedures that treat these two ways of financing services differently are fraudulent. ... [A] PFI must not be used simply to shift a liability off the balance sheet.  That is a swindle and, as such, quite disgraceful.</blockquote><p>He is right; basically it is a swindle.  We have seen a range of economists bringing very critical study to bear on the operation of public private partnerships in this country.  People such as Colm McCarthy have called the whole idea of entertaining a public private partnership without doing a cost-benefit or cost-assessment analysis before proceeding with any major project as, frankly, totally crazy, because one does not know what the discount rate would be.</p><p>In 2013, through the excellent Nevin Economic Research Institute, headed by Dr. Tom Healy, and the Economic and Social Research Institute, Dr. Eoin Reeves produced a paper entitled, &quot;Public-Private Partnerships in Ireland: A Review of the Experience&quot;.  This highlighted grave deficiencies in public private partnerships, particularly around the awarding of contracts, governance issues and proper value for money analysis.  A former Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts has spoken in this debate on public private partnerships.  In 2011, a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General made some devastating conclusions on public private partnership expenditure.  He called it a sunk cost that has delivered no effective benefit and pointed out the ongoing impact on the national debt.  As the Minister of State knows, our national debt at &euro;206 billion is still significant.</p><p>There was actually a ten-year review of public private partnerships in Northern Ireland entitled, &quot;The use of Private Finance Initiative (PFI) Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) in Northern Ireland&quot;, which found that the bottom line on public finance is it does create an ongoing public debt.  It stated the additionality of public finance is illusory and finance costs are higher for the private sector.  The whole rationale in this regard, as advanced by reasonable credible economists across the board including people such as Mariana Mazzucato at the University of London, who always stresses the entrepreneurial nature of the State, is that the State, because of its interest costs and its expertise - if it mobilises it - is the best organisation to provide public infrastructure.</p><p>I am a member of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  Recently, our excellent Parliamentary Budget Office, under director Annette Connolly, published a review of public private partnerships.  One would hope there would be higher quality output, in the knowledge that the private providers would be obliged to maintain it for 20 years into the future but, at the end of the day, all it offers is moving the cost of critical infrastructure off balance sheets.</p><p>We had a long discussion about the Carillion collapse.  I want to mention the treatment of workers.  A number of the Deputies in the House, including my colleagues in Independents 4 Change, became aware of the phenomenon of phony employment or phony SMEs in the building industry, whereby people were forced mar dhea to work for themselves when in actual fact in every respect they were employees.  They were not permitted social insurance or pension rights and they were treated very badly.  That battle is ongoing.  As my colleagues have concluded, the public private partnership model is badly flawed.  It is something to which we should not resort now that, hopefully, with positive tax revenues coming down the line, we have the significant possibility of spending in the future.  We should do it through the State and the House, and provide the infrastructure our people deserve and desperately need in health and education.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-26a.378" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600033#KK00300"><p>With regard to public private partnerships, over recent months I have asked a number of detailed questions in respect of each Department, particularly the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, to identify what Departments have public private partnerships, their value and what they are for.  The answers are very interesting.  What is even more interesting is that in recent times the two major providers of public private partnerships in certain areas, such as education, have been the two big UK and global public private partnership companies, Carillion and Capita, one of which has now gone into a very difficult and costly liquidation, and we read this week that for the past couple of months the second company, Capita, has been enduring increasing financial difficulties.  It would be fair to say that at present the jury is out as to whether Capita will now go the way of Carillion.</p>  <p>  The collapse of both public private partnership providers and companies has led to the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in the UK and Ireland.  In particular in Ireland, we have the loss of a range of jobs.  Some very good and reliable contractors who were subcontractors on public private partnerships face receivership before the courts with a lot of difficult efforts being made to save companies that have a long and quite good construction record.  The collapse of Carillion and the subsequent difficulties with Capita - some companies are affected by the fact that both of these companies are in difficulty - have come like a bolt out of the blue for such companies.</p>  <p>  What is more, and we know this with regard to the schools bundle, the Minister for Education and Skills was quite blas&eacute; in answering me on this when he suggested, when the collapse of Carillion first happened and then with the difficulties with Capita, that all would be well quite quickly.  The commentary over and over again was there would be no difficulty and no loss to the Irish Exchequer and that the NTMA was not on the hook for any of the losses.  In fact, although many of these projects are practically completed and the schools are expected to be in possession of the new buildings, we are still not clear as to when exactly completion will happen.  Obviously, we then have the complications of the running and maintenance contracts for up to 25 years after completion.  It is not clear who will actually take them over.</p>  <p>  The theory behind public private partners is very simple.  For large-scale projects, particularly roads and airports, additional funding can be obtained.  The funding can be kept off the State's balance sheet in terms of total borrowing.  Perhaps efficiencies can be gained, in terms of the type of people involved in the public private partnership, and the project will be managed for 25 years and then handed back to the State.</p><p>That is the theory.  When this model of financial development was being developed from the 1990s onwards, to be honest, it seemed like the answer to the prayers of a hard-pressed Minister for Finance, whereby without enhancing the national debt, one could get a large amount of available capital and build some significant and substantial projects.  However, it has not worked out like that.  The theory that the PPP was going to result in a significant part of a capital project being transferred from a risk point of view in whole or in part to the private sector, thereby lowering the State's risk profile on its debt, has turned out to be a chimera for a simple reason.  If one builds a hospital like the one in Limerick, and this has happened all over the UK, via a PPP and the PPP developer and the PPP company running the hospital thereafter collapse like Carillion or get into difficulty like Capita, what Minister would say he or she will wash his or her hands of it and that the hospital should close?  As that would not be possible, the notion that we are transferring risk in a competent way from the public to the private sector is simply not true.  Similarly, if we build a public road or railroad and the PPP collapses, one cannot close the road.  One must continue with the road but must get somebody else to take on the completion of the project and the running and maintenance of the road.  Again, if one builds a primary or secondary school as part of a bundle, can anybody show me an example anywhere in the world where an existing school under the management of a PPP that collapsed was subsequently closed down by either local or national government?  I do not believe there are such examples because the kind of projects about which we are talking pertain to public goods which, once built, are for the public in any particular country or region and we are not going to be able to close those public goods that the public has provided for.  There is a conceptual flaw with regard to PPPs.  </p> <p> The second point about PPPs is that they save money in some cases by very sharp practices relating to how they reduce costs.  They can reduce costs by eliminating pension liabilities from their wages bill or a conscious use of subcontractors who, while registered for tax, are self-employed, in particular for PRSI purposes.  The consequences are that what would normally be the employer's contribution to the employees' long-term social retirement pension from the public welfare system of the welfare state is done away with.  We have about 30 years experience of PPPs and we know that they promise a lot if they are perfectly executed but in many historical examples, they have not been perfectly executed and have come back to the door of the State to be taken over by the State and have become much more expensive.  In addition, there are a lot of financial, technical and legal costs associated with PPPs that can be extremely high.  Consequently, while the rate of interest we see on a PPP appears to be very low, it is nowhere near as low as the rate of interest at which the State is able to borrow.</p> <p> The reason the IMF came in to Ireland was because our banks could no longer borrow.  If that situation continued, the banks would have closed down.  In the aftermath of the collapse and the disastrous bank guarantee, PPPs were probably one of the few mechanisms still available to Ireland to allow it to borrow money and, critically, not increase the national debt but have it off balance sheet.  Thankfully, those days are over.  They have been over for about five years because the State can now borrow at significantly cheaper rates.  While I can understand that for many officials, the PPP has a tidiness about it that appears to answer pages of tick-box questions that are asked about projects, those answers are very often illusory.  We know this very specifically and not just in the case of the UK, which has had such examples for probably ten to 15 years with regard to, for example, NHS trusts in different parts of England which have become completely embroiled in debt brought on by a PPP regime they simply cannot finance with payback.  </p> <p> Will the Minister agree to a serious independent evaluation of PPPs around the world, in particular the many examples of those that have failed, so that if he is looking at these again, he has these failures very clear in his mind?  I hope the Minister of State will stand up to say that he will carry out the evaluation because it is necessary.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-26a.380" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1267" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600034#LL00200"><p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  I specifically thank those who are consistent in their views and who were always opposed and are still opposed to PPPs.  Of course, we have the converts along the road who, once upon a time, were in favour of them but now just 12 months later, are totally against them.  This is why some of the arguments in here completely lack credibility.  It is incredible to criticise PPPs less than three years after leaving a Government in which one's party advocated and facilitated the construction of the New Ross bypass, the N11, courthouses, the DIT campus at Grangegorman and the Gort to Limerick road, which all had to be done through PPPs.  Several Deputies mentioned their opposition to PPPs but none of them said the Gort to Galway motorway should not have been built.  None of them said that the DIT campus at Grangegorman should not have happened.  None of them said that the bundle of courthouses that were built should not have happened.  They cannot have their cake and eat it at a time when the country was basically bankrupt and had been left with the legacy of a massive wallop.  Everything about PPPs is not bad, which is why the Minister for Finance has said that as part of the review which is under way and which will be brought to the House when the Government has had a chance to review it, that all views will be taken into consideration.  However, parties must be somewhat less disingenuous in the first instance because what the voters are seeing on the part of some people - it is manifesting and being reflected in research - is a complete lack of credibility.  A party that was in government two years ago advocating that the N11 road to Wexford be built through a PPP or that the DIT campus at Grangegorman should go ahead by way of a PPP through the Department of Education and Skills cannot now state it is against PPPs.  That is completely incredible and I do not believe anybody actually takes that seriously.  That is a dangerous road for parties to go down because they are ceding part of an electorate that supports the concept of doing capital work when we do not have money to those who have always said they have never supported private investment in capital work.</p><p>I welcome that many Deputies spoke about the 10% change and that some Deputies are now talking about fiscal responsibility.  Every morning on "Morning Ireland" we hear Opposition Deputies saying they want so many hundred million euro extra for education or for some other area.  The Taoiseach is right in saying that the people who are advocating for specific elements of expenditure above and beyond what is committed to in the budget should say which projects in the previous budget or in the capital plan they would not do.</p> <p> Nobody has referred to the content of the capital plan, with the exception of my colleague, Deputy O'Dowd.  Apart from loose references to PPPs not one person referred to the upcoming national development plan.  That cuts to the chase.  The people who need many of these infrastructural projects to be built are seeing the Government's commitment to spend &euro;116 billion.  However, certain Opposition parties, including some which were in government up to recently, are claiming that there is some magic way that things could have been done differently in the past - or even currently - in the absence of PPPs.  That is absolutely not the case.  The Government is committed to a review.  Having coming out of recession, we have undertaken that route.</p> <p> On existing PPP commitments, the Higher Education Authority has 11 projects for institutes of technology.  Are certain people here seriously suggesting that they should not go ahead?  Some &euro;150 million is set aside for building community nursing homes.  Are they saying those should not go ahead?  There are Department of Justice and Equality PPP projects for Garda stations and courthouses.  If that is what some people believe, let them outline the ones that should not go ahead.  They cannot have their cake and eat it.  They cannot have fiscal rules laid out by the European Union that everybody now claims to be a convert to and at the same time say they are against everything in the funding models that worked in the past.  I do not suggest for one minute that there are not complexities.</p> <p> Deputy McGuinness was the only person who made reference to procurement from the point of view of the Office of Government Procurement.  I have made this offer previously and I make it again that I would welcome the opportunity for anybody, who has specific issues relating to procurement or who wants to advocate for particular elements of it - the Acting Chairman has done so - to come forward and make a suggestion which can be done by way of the procurement leadership group.</p> <p> I sum up where I started off.  We were in a very difficult space in 2011 and 2012.  Luckily we are now out of it and we have a major capital programme under way.  In advocating for that capital programme we need to reflect on why we used PPPs in the past.  It completely lacks credibility to suggest we could just erase the past and say all of sudden PPPs are bad while at the same time some of these projects are absolutely necessary.  The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, will bring to the House the review I mentioned in my opening remarks, for which some of the Deputies were present, as soon as the Government has had a chance to review it.</p> <p> I thank the Deputies for all their comments.  The officials in my Department have made note of everything and we will try where practicable to get back to people individually.</p></speech>

I acknowledge our guests in the Visitors Gallery.  They include representatives from a number of development NGOs and the umbrella organisation, D&oacute;chas.  They are all very welcome.  They are consistent visitors to the House and our committee.  </p><p>This report is the culmination of several months of constructive engagement and debate within the committee on the Irish Aid programme.  During those months the committee met a wide range of stakeholders, including the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, and senior officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; representatives from the NGO sector; members of academia; the ambassadors of Ethiopia and Kenya in Ireland; and Mr. David Donoghue, Ireland&rsquo;s former permanent representative to the United Nations in New York and co-facilitator of the process to negotiate the Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>Members of the committee also visited Malawi and Mozambique to see at first hand the implementation of the Irish Aid programme and to meet partners and stakeholders at government, civil society, community and individual level.</p><p>In addition to the seven public sessions we held on this subject, the committee received over 30 written submissions from stakeholders.  The level of interest in and engagement on this important topic was greatly appreciated and I acknowledge and thank all those who engaged so constructively.  It is clear such interest reflects the importance so many stakeholders place on ensuring Ireland has the strongest and most effective aid programme possible.</p><p>It has been several years since Ireland&rsquo;s official development assistance, ODA, programme was last discussed and debated in this Chamber and this debate is timely.  It is important to emphasise at the outset of this debate that the committee strongly supports the Irish Aid programme.  Throughout our meetings we heard an overwhelmingly positive assessment of the Irish Aid programme and the delivery of overseas assistance by our NGOs.  The high quality of the programme and its strong focus on poverty reduction was emphasised time and again.  Ireland has a good story to tell.</p><p>Huge advances have been made as a result of ODA, including Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme, as well as through the development assistance programmes of the European Union, to which Ireland contributes.  We must send out the clear message that aid works.</p><p>As a result of aid over than 1 billion people have been lifted out of extreme poverty; the under-five child mortality rate has almost halved; devastating diseases such as smallpox and tuberculosis have been controlled; there has been huge progress in fighting HIV and AIDS, and malaria; and 2.6 billion people have gained access to improved water sources.  Education subsidies, social cash transfers and schemes addressing water provision and quality have all had far-reaching positive impacts on the lives of people most in need.</p><p>We in Ireland can and should take considerable pride in the role our aid programme has played in contributing to these long-term results.  I had the opportunity to gain a greater understanding of the effectiveness of the aid programme during the committee&rsquo;s visit to Malawi and northern Mozambique last November.  The visit highlighted the life-changing impact Irish taxpayers&rsquo; money is having on some of the poorest people in the world.  It demonstrated to me that results are being achieved through the implementation of a broad range of programmes, working hand in hand in a spirit of partnership with local communities and authorities.  The visit also highlighted to me the extent of need that continues to exist and the obligation we all have at national, European and international level to respond to that need.</p><p>The scale of need that exists today is more significant than ever with 140 million people in need of humanitarian assistance; 65 million people - over ten times the population of this country - displaced by war and conflict; over 3 million children under five dying each year due to preventable and treatable diseases; over 260 million children not receiving an education; and rapid population growth with the population on the African continent expected to double to 2.5 billion people by 2050.</p><p>In Syria alone, the latest figures by UNHCR show there are over 13 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, over 6 million internally displaced from their homes and now 5.6 million refugees forced to flee, 2.6 million of whom are children.  A quarter of all Syrians are refugees.  The official death toll is unknown but is estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands.  These shocking figures are an important reminder of the current context in which Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme must be effectively implemented.  Behind each figure are countless individuals in need of assistance.</p><p>I understand the T&aacute;naiste is planning to produce a new White Paper on the Irish Aid programme in the coming months.  The committee welcomes that commitment and we trust that the views raised in our report and during today&rsquo;s debate will be carefully considered and taken into account.</p><p>As a Member of this House, along with my committee colleagues and other Members present, who all represent constituencies with a great many needs, I do not shy away from acknowledging the competing demands on taxpayers&rsquo; money.  Our domestic challenges must be addressed urgently.  However, we cannot and must not neglect our moral responsibility to play our part, as a developed nation, in addressing the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable people and communities around the world.</p><p>The committee fully supports continued increases in the aid budget to meet that need in a targeted, effective way, maintaining the high standards and quality in the aid programme Ireland has been internationally recognised for.  Doing so is not just the right thing to do, it is also in our national interest.</p> <p> We are living in a deeply interconnected world.  Playing our part in lifting people out of extreme poverty and deprivation, addressing the root causes of conflict and instability, will lead to greater peace and security for all.  The challenge for the Government now is to identify how to protect and build upon the high quality of the aid programme, at a time when global challenges are intensifying in areas such as climate change, rising inequalities and population growth, growing migration flows throughout the world, politically isolationist trends in the west, and not least humanitarian crises.</p> <p> This report contains 22 recommendations, and I will focus on three areas.  The first is the sustainable development goals and the need for a more coherent approach to development assistance.  The second is the need to build greater awareness of official development assistance among the public.  The third is the need to demonstrate a concerted move towards realising Ireland&rsquo;s long-standing commitment of spending 0.7% of gross national income on official development assistance.</p> <p> Ireland can take considerable pride in the sustainable development goals, brokered in 2015 by our former permanent representative to the United Nations, David Donoghue.  The 17 goals each have specific targets to be achieved by 2030.  The goals are a universal call to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure all people enjoy peace and prosperity.  They apply to all countries throughout the world.  We are proud that those goals were brokered by Ireland but now we must focus on implementation and ensure that we continue to be at the forefront at both national and international levels.  This must be a whole-of-Government endeavour.</p> <p> As I have just outlined, development assistance has yielded many significant results, but aid alone is not enough.  That much is clear when we look at the current global crises I have already referred to.  Ireland&rsquo;s policies across a wide range of areas can potentially have an effect on developing countries and can consequently make our aid less impactful.  This is an issue in the area of trade, environment and climate, agriculture, education, immigration and tax policy, among others.  The sustainable development goals recognise this need for coherence across all policies.</p> <p> Earlier this week our President made a historic address to the United Nations General Assembly focusing on peace-building.  In his speech he reminded UN member states of the necessity of a coherent approach if we are to accomplish the goals set out in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development.  Coherence is essential if we are to achieve meaningful impact.  The OECD also noted in 2014 that Ireland needed to address such issues and develop a more coherent approach to development across Government.  Regrettably, that has not happened.</p> <p> In this report the committee calls on the Government to develop a clear cross-Government plan of action on international development policy as well as to establish a cross-departmental body to ensure better co-ordination and coherence.  This could be a subgroup of the existing cross-departmental co-ordination mechanisms on the sustainable development goals.  I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s views on this matter.  This afternoon, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, is launching Ireland&rsquo;s national implementation plan for the sustainable development goals, and I look forward to reading the plan.  The committee will continue to closely scrutinise the progress being made in achieving the sustainable development goals, particularly through the work of Irish Aid.  The new White Paper will be an opportunity to ensure that the Irish Aid programme is clearly framed in the context of the sustainable development goals.</p> <p> A strong case for the importance of strengthening our aid programme also needs to be made to the Irish public.  This report contains important recommendations on scaling up resources and commitments to the education and youth sectors, supporting the essential work they carry out in providing development education.  It is so important that the taxpayers of the future have awareness, understanding and ownership of the Irish Aid programme.  The Government must also communicate better the results of the Irish Aid programme to all citizens more generally.  I cannot emphasise enough how important it is that taxpayers are aware of how their money is being spent and, moreover, why it is being spent in the way that it is being spent.  This is not just the Government&rsquo;s aid programme; it belongs to the Irish people and their understanding of it is vital.</p> <p> On reaching our now very long-standing commitment to achieving ODA expenditure of 0.7% of gross national income, the committee is unanimously of the view that in order for Ireland to continue to deliver and strengthen a quality aid programme, we must reach that target.  The committee calls for a multi-annual plan to increase the aid budget on an incremental, phased basis and proposes that the Government submits such a clear, multi-annual plan to the Committee on Budgetary Oversight for consideration.</p> <p> The  Minister has spoken many times since taking on his current role of his commitment to working towards the 0.7% target.  As we debate this matter today, and as Members of this House engage with him on this hugely important subject, I ask him to clearly outline his vision.  The aid programme has strong political support.  The Minister has the support of those of all parties and none represented on the committee, and I have no doubt many more Members of this House support the Irish Aid programme and the need to move steadily towards 0.7%.</p> <p> The aid programme also has strong public support.  The Irish people are known for their empathy and generosity.  I was heartened by the results of a poll last year which showed that 80% of those surveyed believe we should increase our support for efforts to eradicate poverty.  Now what remains is for the Government to take forward the commitments it has made and ensure they are delivered.  In the words of Seamus Heaney, "Anyone with gumption and a sharp mind will take the measure of two things: what&rsquo;s said and what&rsquo;s done."  This House will take the measure of what is said and what is done in regard to the Irish Aid programme and moving towards that important 0.7% target.</p> <p> I would be grateful if the Minister would address two specific matters.  What is the timeframe for the publication of the new White Paper?  Second, will he give a clear commitment to developing a pathway to 0.7%?

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-26a.385" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600036#NN00200"><p>I thank the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and Defence for undertaking this timely review of Ireland&rsquo;s development co-operation.  I am pleased that Oireachtas Members have borne witness to the great work which the Irish Aid programme does in tackling poverty and in responding to humanitarian crises and natural disasters.  As a people, we can be proud of the work which is done in challenging places to improve the lives of those less fortunate than us, and which helps build a more just and peaceful world, which is needed now more than ever.</p>  <p>  Ours is an interconnected world.  Global climate events, such as the hurricanes in the Caribbean or drought in east Africa, and our own recent stark weather episodes, tell us that we need to act in common with others to address the challenges of our generation.  The Ebola crisis of 2014-2015 was a reminder of the need for functioning public health systems in our neighbouring continent.  Ireland was able to respond, quickly and effectively, and make a significant contribution to stemming the flow of the disease.  That was important for the people of Sierra Leone and the other affected countries.  It was also important for the people of Ireland.  A safer, more peaceful, sustainable and equal world is in Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental interest as a small country with an open economy in an ever more challenging and uncertain world.</p>  <p>  The sense of sharing the planet informed the negotiation of the sustainable development goals, SDGs, also known as Agenda 2030.  Adopted by the United Nations in 2015, following a process in which Ireland played a significant role in helping broker agreement, the SDGs set an ambitious set of targets.  All countries, including Ireland, are expected to respond to the challenge domestically, but also in our foreign policy.</p>  <p>  The joint committee has rightly situated its review of the Irish Aid programme in the context of the sustainable development goals.  These 17 goals set a framework for the work of Irish Aid for the coming decade and beyond.  This ambition speaks to our whole-of-Government approach to international development, which draws on the roles and strengths of all Government Departments.</p>  <p>  The world has changed over the past decade and a new approach and fresh thinking are needed for the way forward.  That is why I announced in October last year that the Government will produce a new White Paper on international development this year.  This paper will build on our existing development co-operation programme and further strengthen its alignment to the SDGs.  The White Paper will also inform an ambitious pathway towards making greater but sustainable progress on the UN target of providing 0.7% of GNI to official development assistance.  It will take time but I am absolutely committed to outlining a way to get there.</p>  <p>  Reaching the 0.7% target will involve significant increases to the ODA budget and requires careful planning and consultation with other Departments and stakeholders.</p><p>The joint committee report underscored that a firm commitment to achieving this target is critical to the future of overseas development.  I appeal to the Deputy and to others in this House to support me politically in our efforts to do that.  Without all-party support or close to it, this will be a difficult political target to achieve.  It is going to involve a multi-annual commitment that will involve multiple Governments.</p> <p> I am acutely aware of pressures and challenges at home in Ireland and that competition for budgetary resources is real.  However, we must not forget that Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme is not just good policy because we know aid works, but is also a reflection of our values, our belief in our common humanity and solidarity, and our understanding that wealth and opportunity are not spread equally across the world.  We in Ireland have benefited from assistance and investment in the past, and we too have a responsibility to give poor and marginalised people in other countries a better future.  Furthermore, an effective development co-operation programme is an important foreign policy tool in its own right, informing our wider diplomacy and helping Ireland influence others to adopt policy positions which reflect the values we represent and objectives we hold dear.  It must be accompanied too by political dialogue between Europe and Africa that is fit for purpose, reflecting the huge shared challenges we face together in areas like migration, climate change and the eradication of poverty, as well as food and water security, regional conflict and so much else.</p> <p> In its review conclusions, the joint committee highlighted the positive reputation of the Irish Aid programme.  Its high quality was a recurring theme in discussions with stakeholders.  I am delighted that some committee members had an opportunity to visit two of the countries in Africa in which we work, where they were able to witness first-hand the results of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme.  These visits fed into the review&rsquo;s endorsement of that positive reputation and its view, which I share, that our continued focus should be on quality, untied aid which addresses the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable people and communities, wherever they may be.  Despite tremendous progress in reducing poverty around the world in recent decades, with over 100,000 people a day moving from extreme poverty, there remains a need for effective development co-operation and for modernisation in terms of our approach.  Too many still live in poverty.  Countries such as Ethiopia, which I visited a number of months ago, have to create as many new jobs each year as there are people at work in Ireland; such is the demographic movement to which Ethiopia must respond in terms of the number of young people coming into the workforce.</p> <p> Part of the strength of Ireland&rsquo;s programme is that it is deeply rooted in our own experiences and values.  Hunger and undernutrition have long been a major priority for Irish development co-operation and Ireland has gained international recognition for its work in this area.  On a visit to Kenya in November I saw how, by sharing Ireland&rsquo;s experience of good seed technology, good science and good farming, local potato crop yields have the potential to increase dramatically.</p> <p> Much of Ireland&rsquo;s own success can be attributed to our well-educated workforce, and we have traditionally played a strong, respected role in education in many parts of Africa.  In Uganda, Irish Aid has focused on the poverty-stricken Karamoja district, and has provided bursaries for 1,000 secondary school students and 40 university students from the poorest families, to enable them to continue their education.  In Sierra Leone, Ireland has advocated for the rights of pregnant girls who were excluded from attending school, and supported them to continue their education.  With our support, social protection has expanded to cover nearly 450,000 households in Mozambique, a country whose vast rural population still feels the effects and devastation of war, and provided social benefit to 150,000 senior citizens in Uganda.  Tiny amounts of money - mere cents monthly - mean that children can stay in school, or older people have some dignity.</p> <p> The joint committee in its review report takes note of the escalation in conflict-driven humanitarian crises.  Ireland has responded worldwide through our humanitarian work, peacekeeping and disarmament, as well as sharing lessons from our own peace process.  We are reminded daily of the tremendous suffering in Syria, and in response Ireland has provided over &euro;93 million since 2012 to alleviate suffering in Syria, primarily focusing on supporting refugees.  However, other crises continue, equally appalling in terms of human suffering but often forgotten.  I refer to places like Sudan, Yemen, DRC and the Central African Republic.  Ireland&rsquo;s support is vital here too.  We stand fully behind the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s vision to place conflict prevention and sustaining peace at the heart of the UN&rsquo;s mandate.  The motivation and rationale is sound.  It is easier and more effective, if not always as visible, to prevent rather than react to crises.  Where intervention is necessary, political advocacy in working to resolve conflicts should prevail in the first instance.</p> <p> Responding to catastrophes is complex and requires us to work in partnership with organisations that have a presence on the ground.  Funding is channelled through multinational actors such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and the UN central emergency response fund.  This allows Ireland to pool its response with others for maximum impact.  Ireland also works with NGOs, both Irish and international.  We are very proud of their record and reputation too.  Civil society organisations play an important role in development.  Ireland is home to many excellent organisations whose experiences enrich our analysis and with which we partner in a number of countries and contexts.  Our missionaries also play their part in this and we value and applaud their contribution over many decades.</p> <p> As the joint committee has recognised, it is important too that we inform the Irish public about the programme.  After all, it is their money that we are spending.  As part of the process to develop a new White Paper on international development we will shortly be launching a public consultation process on the White Paper, involving both public meetings and online opportunities to input, and we look forward to a high level of public engagement.</p> <p> The review report of the joint committee highlights the global challenges we face.  As we look to set the priorities for our future development funding so that it is ready for the 2020s, this report helps set the scene for the next generation of policy priorities.</p> <p> After hearing the speech of the Chairman of the committee, I am glad to say that I think we share a lot of similar values and priorities in this area and I look forward to working with the committee and with others in this House in the context of getting that consultation process right and hopefully also in the context of getting the budgetary commitments we are going to need to start moving our aid contribution in the right direction.</p></speech>

I commend Noel Murphy and MaryLee Wall in the secretariat, who worked so hard to put this report together.  I recognise the attendance of many of our NGOs and development agencies, which do a fantastic job.</p>  <p>  I have a couple of questions which the T&aacute;naiste is not going to be able to answer now as we are restricted time-wise.  I agree with our Chairman, who has outlined that the report looked for a roadmap.  I have said it time and time again, as has the T&aacute;naiste.  I am glad to hear in his response today about a commitment to reaching 0.7%.  That is not going to be easy and will require some political bravery.  The T&aacute;naiste has got to publish a timeline so that we know we are not saying 0.7% by 2030 any more.  Let us look at those figures.  We have been shown that roadmap before.  Let us have the discussion openly and put it up to all political parties and groupings to sign up to it.  The Chairman outlined this in great detail in his speech today.  The T&aacute;naiste will find a willingness there.  I know the public is ahead of us on this.  Back in 2008 we had reached a height of 0.59% and we are now down at about 0.3%.  The work that has been done with the money that the Irish people are giving through Irish Aid and our NGOs is magnificent and we know it.  Let us publish a dateline.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste referred to the White Paper and mentioned that it will be published and that he will have a public consultation on it.  I said this to the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, when the committee launched the report.</p><p>We should not reinvent the wheel, but rather work on the basis of the report of the committee, which should feed into the recommendations of the White Paper.  When will the White Paper be published?  Are we going to wait until the White Paper consultation concludes before we publish a timeline for reaching point seven?  I believe we could do that sooner.  We should have an open discussion on the issue.</p></speech>

For anyone with any kind of heart or soul, the footage was harrowing to watch.  The Taoiseach put it well when he said that there are many levels of crime, but that a crime inflicted on children is possibly the worst form of crime possible.</p>  <p>  I want to compliment "RT&Eacute; Investigates" on the work done to highlight this story.  The story broke in April 2016 when the perpetrator of the abuse was still saying he was innocent.  The women in question decided to come forward and release their names.  They have done that in an extremely brave fashion.  I have to acknowledge the graphic detail in which they explained exactly what happened to them while in foster care.  Keith Burke was sentenced to a seven and a half year prison sentence with a year suspended.  However, this story is about Rachel, Amy and Sarah.  Rachel is her real name, but Amy and Sarah are pseudonyms.  Amy went into foster care when she was a baby.  Rachel arrived on the scene when she was approximately seven years of age and made the disclosure aged 11.  The two girls developed a friendship.  Rachel told the story of how she was repeatedly abused to her mum and once that happened, there was an investigation and a file was sent to the DPP.  It is hard to believe that the accused was not prosecuted once that file was sent to the DPP, even though it was found that the assessment of rape was credible.  Amy continued to stay in that house.  It was also discovered that Sarah had been in the house previously and another boy continued to live there.</p>  <p>  We hear stories about the most vulnerable children and those who need assistance or whose families need assistance but we did not provide them with support.  We allowed them to continue to live in that house.  It was not until 2011 that Amy found the courage to speak out.  In the area of mental health, it is said always said that it only takes one person to speak out.  Amy found the courage to speak to her teacher.  She was 14 years of age and she had been subjected to abuse from 2003.  At that stage, she was only three years of age.  When she went to her teacher she was 14 years of age.</p>  <p>  Where were the checks and balances and the governance?  In 2007, when the file went to the DPP, the decision was made to leave those children in that house.  Amy did not have the courage to speak up at that stage.  She was only a child and did not have the wherewithal to communicate what was happening to her.  Her mind could not make sense of it.</p>  <p>  As a grown adult myself and having watched that programme, it is really hard to articulate the horrific test of endurance these children were subjected to.  Why was an apology only issued by the HSE on Tuesday night?  That is the most horrific aspect of all this.  Why were those other two children left in that house?  What is Tusla now doing about it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-26a.395" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600038#PP00700"><p>I want to offer the apologies of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, who is with President Higgins on official business in the United States this week and could not be in the House.  I did not get to see the programme Deputy Rabbitte mentioned in real time, but I watched part of it later and read the horrific story in graphic detail in various newspapers.  I share the sentiments of the Taoiseach that crimes against children are particularly heinous, and sexual crimes against vulnerable children deserve a special level of disgust.  I believe those sentiments are shared by the House and by everyone who knows the facts of this story.  As the Deputy may appreciate, I am not in a position to respond as directly and fully as the Minister to some of her questions, but I will relate the issues raised both to the Minister's officials and to the Minister herself upon her return.</p><p>The Government and its agencies are determined that the handling of this case and other serious cases will help inform future policy, safeguards and protections for children.  When an allegation of abuse is made, action is taken to protect any child or children who may be at risk.  In terms of this particular case, abuse was first revealed in 2007.  The HSE found the allegations to be credible and took actions to protect the children at that time.  An assessment was carried out and no new placements were made with the family after the disclosure.  Following the allegations the son of the foster family left the home and a safety plan was agreed with the family.</p><p>  There were two children in long-term foster placements, one of who was there from a very early age, as Deputy Rabbitte outlined.  They did not disclose any abuse at that time.  In 2011, one of the children disclosed abuse that occurred before 2007, and a decision was made to remove the children then.  There was no disclosure of abuse happening after 2007, which was after a safety plan was agreed with the parents and the abuser was no longer living with the family.  A Garda investigation took place in 2007, but there was no prosecution on the direction of the DPP on that occasion.  Later, in 2011, there was an investigation which lead to the prosecution of the abuser.  This resulted in a conviction in 2017 and the sentencing of the abuser this month.</p><p>  In April 2016 the case was referred to the expert national review panel, NRP, and that review is nearing completion.  The review is expected to look at the professional decision making in 2007.  The NRP panel is appointed independently.  It reviews deaths and serious incidents affecting children in care or who are known to child protection services.  The NRP was set up in response to the recommendations of the Ryan commission.  Tusla plays no role in carrying out the NRP reviews.  We await the outcome of the review and the opportunity to consider all of the findings and recommendations.</p><p>  It is important to acknowledge that foster carers undergo a rigorous assessment process.  Approval takes several months of intense work.  All general foster carers are fully vetted, assessed and approved before a child is placed with them.  Most foster care placements will have a link social worker and the child will have his or her own social worker who he or she can confide in.  Across Ireland thousands of people open their homes and lives to children in need and provide love and care.  We must not lose sight of that in the midst of this terrible case.  HIQA inspections have shown that there are areas of foster care services that must be improved.  Tusla has responded positively with actions and ongoing national reforms addressing the key issues.</p><p>The Minister, Deputy Zappone, received correspondence yesterday from the solicitor of one of the women who as a child was sexually abused in that foster home.  The correspondence related to an inquiry, and will be actively considered by the Minister, Deputy Zappone, when she returns from the United States as a way to get to the facts of this case and to learn lessons to ensure that it will not happen again, and also to discover whether there was any negligence involved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-26a.396" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1231" speakername="Anne Rabbitte" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600039#QQ00100"><p>It is right to say we have some very good foster care families in this country.  We need every one of them and we need more because they do Trojan work.  It is unfortunate we are bringing a spotlight onto a particular case but it is incumbent on us to highlight it so we can do the right thing for children.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State acknowledged that foster carers undergo a rigorous assessment process.  That is absolutely the case but where it falls down is in regard to the follow-up, the governance and the procedures covering checks and balances.  I am reading HIQA reports monthly, and I have read reports from areas such as Cavan, Monaghan, Cork and Dublin, where I can see major non-compliance.  Some of the instances of non-compliance are very simple, for example, Garda vetting, which is a simple requirement that we need in order to protect children.</p>  <p>  I and my colleagues in Fianna F&aacute;il believe that the possibility of an independent commission of investigation should be examined.  There have been far too many cases where poor and tragic decisions have been taken with regard to children in the care of the State, such as the Grace case last year and the Mary case.  I do not want a litany of such cases.  I want us to find how best to protect our most vulnerable.</p>  <p>  We know from the testimonies of foster parents, as well as from Tusla figures, that even where protocols are in place, they are simply not being enforced or implemented by Tusla.  At the end of 2017 over 10% of children were awaiting an allocation of a link worker - a social worker intended to support foster carers - and some 5% of children in care did not have an allocated social care worker.  In January 2018 there were 4,256 child protection cases awaiting the allocation of a social worker, and 1,787 of these cases were high or medium priority.</p>  <p>  I have laid out the position.  What I and my party want is an independent commission so we can learn from all of these cases.</p></speech>

We are awaiting the national review panel report, which should be completed very soon, according to the information presented to me by the officials before I came in.  The Deputy asked a direct question earlier about why the apology was only made on Tuesday and I am not in a position to answer that.</p>  <p>  We have had too many of these cases.  I deal with foster families, as do all Members of the House in their constituencies, and I know the care they offer is invaluable and much-needed, and more is needed, as the Deputy pointed out.  However, those families are done a huge disservice when the system does not work, in particular when governance do not work.  The time, love, attention and care they give to children is not matched by some parts of the system when we see examples such as this case.</p>  <p>  When the Minister, Deputy Zappone, returns, I will speak to her directly on the issues the Deputy has raised and, in particular, on the correspondence she has received in regard to an inquiry.</p></speech>

His response was that his Department had consulted the NTA and the NTA was not aware of any anomalies.  I had a fair idea of what the NTA would say and I was probably more interested in the Minister's thoughts.</p>  <p>  On 3 January 2017 the Minister was sent a letter from a statistician raising serious concerns about the reliability of route profitability figures in the 2016 rail review.  I have a copy of the letter and the generic response from the Minister's private secretary.  In the letter the statistician provides clear evidence of cost misallocation across various routes, including four earmarked for closure.  Across ten routes he examined he noted that the cost figures were either impossible or improbable.</p>  <p>  The most glaring anomaly in the figures appears to be on the Gorey to Rosslare segment of rail track, a route that could be earmarked for closure.  Here I will give just three examples but there are many more.  Perhaps someone can explain how the five stations on the Limerick to Ballybrophy line - three staffed and two not staffed - can cost &euro;31,000 per annum to maintain while the four stations on the Gorey to Rosslare line - two staffed and two not staffed - can cost &euro;1.17 million per annum to maintain?  How can CCTV on just one crossing on the Limerick Junction to Waterford line cost &euro;252,000 per annum to maintain while on the Ennis to Athenry route, CCTV costs on seven crossings work out at &euro;71,000, or just over &euro;10,000 each?  Why does the report state that &euro;194,000 could be saved in wages for centralised signalling by closing the Gorey to Rosslare segment, when the centralised signalling base is in Greystones and the controllers will still be employed?</p>  <p>  There is no doubt the figures Irish Rail, the NTA and the Department are working off which will determine whether rail lines are kept in service or closed, are flawed.  I am aware the NTA states it is confident the route profitability methodology used by the experienced consultants is robust and suitable for the comparative analysis that was carried out, but why have these experienced consultants only been awarded one contract across all Government Departments since 2011?  I ask the Minister to direct that an independent audit be carried out on the figures arrived at in the 2016 rail review.</p>  <p>  Closing rail lines is probably one of the most regressive decisions any Government could take.  Threatening to close rail lines using incorrect costing figures in conjunction with a flawed business model is doubling down on this stupidity.  The Rosslare to Dublin rail line is one of the most spectacular routes, not just in Ireland, but in Europe.  However, not enough people avail of it, the route is slow and the service is not regular enough.  The trains do not match up with the ferries that arrive in Rosslare and, in another moment of madness, the station at Rosslare Harbour was relocated a good distance away from the terminal - close to 600 m away.  It is almost like someone set out to sabotage this line to make it unusable and then adjusted the figures to make it seem even more unprofitable and unviable.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt there has been no political pressure for many years about this line.  However, while it does not require political will to continue to have it operating, closing it would essentially amount to branding Wexford as a backwater of lesser socioeconomic relevance than towns like Sligo, Killarney, Westport and Dundalk.  It would be a poor decision if it was ever closed.</p></speech>

It is a bit of a straw man that he is putting up.  He is saying that another consultant produced figures which would indicate there was a good case for closing this line.  Let me say one thing.  While we can argue this until the cows come home, including the merits of the various consultants, I and the Taoiseach have said there is no intention whatsoever to close rail lines.  That is Government policy.  To say the idea of closing a rail line is abominable is something the Government and the Deputy share.  However, we are the ones who make that decision, as Government policy, and it is not Government policy to close any rail lines, which includes the Rosslare to Dublin rail line.</p>  <p>  I note that Deputy Wallace is concerned about this and he has every right to be because it is his constituency and he is doing the right thing.  However, whereas, as he suggests, the Dublin-Rosslare, Limerick-Galway, Limerick Junction-Waterford and Limerick-Ballybrophy lines were the ones which came out worst in the review, there is no intention to close any of those rail lines, despite the findings.  We recognise the need of people for railways and we recognise the need to run what are, in certain cases, very uneconomic rail lines.</p><p> That may not be a good commercial decision, but it is a good social decision, and it is Government policy that these rail lines, despite the findings of the rail review, will not be closed.</p> <p> This review was undertaken jointly by the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and was published in 2016.  The purpose of the review was to look at the existing rail network, identify the funding required both to maintain the network and to provide the necessary capital works and to consider the gap in funding.  The review also examined the potential of the rail network to meet the economic, environmental and social needs of the State in the future and discussed the importance of maintaining a rail network to support sustainable strategic growth in travel demand.  The review highlighted the considerable amount of taxpayer support currently provided to the rail network.  It also provided an overview of the estimated amount of additional funding needed to support the network over the period from 2016 to 2021.  My Department has consulted the NTA on the matter raised by the Deputy and the authority has advised that it is not aware of any anomalies in the figures published in the 2016 rail review, despite what the Deputy says.  The NTA has stated that it is confident that the route profitability methodology used by experienced consultants on behalf of the authority and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is robust and suitable for the comparative analysis that was carried out.  The review identified a funding gap for Irish rail of the order of &euro;100 million per annum at that time.</p> <p> I am glad to point out that since the report was published in 2016, the Government has announced significant additional funding for rail infrastructure and services, which is addressing the funding requirement.  Public service obligation, PSO, subvention increased in 2016 and 2017 and is increasing further this year.  Over those three years, PSO subvention will be increased by some 35%.  In budget 2017 alone, we allocated over &euro;50 million in additional funding to Irish Rail, bringing the total amount for the year to over &euro;300 million.  This significant increase in funding allows for increasing investment in maintenance and renewal of the network and the rolling stock, and also provides more funding for safety projects.  On the capital side, in budget 2018 we announced &euro;2.7 billion of Exchequer investment in public transport infrastructure and facilities over the next four years.  The recently published ten year national development plan will prioritise key investment actions that protect the quality and value of the existing extensive transport networks and progress new key capital public transport programmes over the years leading up to 2027.</p> <p> The public consultation process held by the NTA following the publication of the review helped to begin an informed discussion about the current and future role of rail transport in Ireland.  More than 300 submissions were received in response to that consultation process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-26a.402" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600040#RR00200"><p>I am glad to hear the Minister confirm again that he does not have any intention of closing the line.  However, I could be forgiven for suspecting that Irish Rail does not have much of an appetite to keep it open.  I still insist that this particular report, which would have been driven and very much determined by Irish Rail, is a flawed one.  The Minister and the Taoiseach may not be captive to it, which is good news.  I am sure the experienced external consultants referred to are very experienced, but they would have been totally captive to the way Irish Rail presented the information to them.  What input did the Commission for Railway Regulation, CRR, have into the review, particularly in respect of attaching infrastructure costs to specific routes in the network?  CRR is mandated to independently monitor the infrastructure costs of the network.  That is distinct from the role of the NTA in awarding PSO services contracts, which is purely related to the operation of the services.  The NTA is, therefore, not expert on infrastructure costs of maintenance and renewal.</p>  <p>  The Minister must agree with me that assumptions on data on those infrastructure costs are critical to any analysis of route profitability.  Although he says that neither he nor the Taoiseach have any intention of closing it, God knows that there may be a change of Government one of these days, and maybe Irish Rail will get its evil way and force the closure.</p>  <p>  The Minister said that more money is being invested in this area.  Is any money specifically targeted at the Rosslare-Dublin line?  At the moment an express train runs from Gorey to Dublin, which is good.  What about a train from Rosslare to Wexford and Enniscorthy, and which then goes on an express run to Dublin?  The line needs help.  I know it is not used by an awful lot of people, but we can change that.  It would be a good thing to do all-round.</p></speech>

It is significantly constrained south of Bray as it is a single-track line with limited passing capacity.  This reduces the competitiveness of rail against travel by road.  In addition, Wexford is currently well served by commercial bus services provided by Wexford Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann and as a result, there are no plans to provide an express rail service from Wexford.  In other words, the roads have had a large amount of money spent on them already and there are no plans to do what the Deputy has suggested.</p>  <p>  The merits of various consultants and their reports can certainly be argued by Deputy Wallace or myself.  My guess is that the consultants to whom Deputy Wallace referred, who were asked to produce the rail review, had a mandate which was very much weighted towards the commercial side.  What they came up with in the rail review were the figures for losses on the Dublin-Rosslare line, which I have read out.  The cost per passenger journey to break even was &euro;30.80 in 2014 while in 2015, it was &euro;29.10.  However, we cannot measure its value by this alone.  That is what Governments and Government policy are for.  We cannot measure every rail line in terms of commerce.  These are commercially unviable rail lines which we are running for social reasons. </p></speech>

Hopefully, she will be able to take some of the concerns I will raise back to the Minister of State.  I raise these concerns pertaining to the progress of disability services and the lack of those services on the ground on behalf of my constituents in Kildare North who are parents of children with disabilities.</p>  <p>  As I raise this Topical Issue matter, I am conscious that the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, met these parents on a number of occasions at my request.  I want to put that on the record and thank him for doing that and for his co-operation.  Before Christmas, I think, in November, he also secured extra funding in this area.  Unfortunately, however, as in so many other areas, we are not seeing the dividend of that investment on the ground and services are not being delivered.</p>  <p>  One area I want to focus on is the assessment of need.  At the moment, an assessment of need is carried out on a child with a disability, but despite what is being said, a period of between 18 and 24 months elapses from then until the actual care plan is implemented.  A child with a disability, or some degree of special need, needs to get the appropriate supports as early as possible, as any of us would in order to reach our maximum potential, but that is not happening.  When the actual care plan begins to be implemented after 18 to 24 months, that child's disability has developed and progressed further.  The care plan that is being implemented therefore does not accurately reflect the child's needs at that time.  That is a massive problem.</p>  <p>  Occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and physiotherapy, which are critically important in these cases, are not there.  They are not being delivered.  The reason the resources are not forthcoming and the care plan is not being implemented is not that they are not being provided and the staff do not want to implement the care plan but rather the staff are not there and the services for these children and their parents are not there.  We all acknowledge that these parents work tremendously hard.  They do an excellent job at caring for these children and helping them to develop to their maximum potential.  They do wonderful work.  However, it should not be part of their job to fight the system every single day to get services that are needed for their child's development to progress.  That is what is happening at the moment, and that is what needs to change.</p><p> Another concern is that reviews are suffering because care plans are not being implemented.  Once an assessment of need has been carried out, a care plan should be implemented quickly in the areas identified.  Thereafter, a review of the case and the child's needs should be carried out within 18 months or two years and the plan progressed accordingly.  None of this is happening, however, despite what the Minister of State may have been told and what she may tell me.  I speak and engage with the parents in question, who also met the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and that is the message they have given.</p> <p> Certain equipment is critical in helping children with disabilities to make progress.  In one case before Christmas, a child needed insoles to assist with walking.  In a letter to the child's parents, the Health Service Executive, HSE, stated the insoles could not be provided because it did not have the funds to do so.  I provided the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, with a copy of the letter in question, which flatly contradicts the statement made by the Minister of State six weeks ago that there was plenty of money available for services.  While I do not doubt the Government's commitment to provide funding for services for disabled children and young adults, this funding is not getting through and the services are not being delivered. </p> <p> Area respite is vital for carers, parents and guardians of children with disabilities as it allow them to recharge.  However, it is not available to some carers.  Providing care is a big job and parents need to be at the top of the game at all times to give their child the full care required.  If respite and other appropriate and necessary supports are not available, it will have a negative impact on parents.</p> <p> The Government must deliver in the areas I have highlighted.  I will raise a number of other issues when the Minister of State has responded.</p></speech>

I apologise that the Minister of State cannot be present for this discussion.  I will make a statement and refer to some of the issues the Deputy raised.  I hope I will also be able to fill in some of the gaps for the Deputy.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to confirm that the national programme, Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People, is changing the way services are provided across the country to make access to services equitable and consistent for all.  The programme is based on family-centred practice based around a child's natural environments and the everyday routines, activities and places of daily life of the child and his or her family.  This model is recognised as an effective model of support for children with complex needs and lifelong disabilities to support the development of skills to maximise active participation within their communities and daily life.  It also recognises that children with complex needs may present with requirements across a number of areas and that services provided in isolation within one environment of a child's life are not appropriate.  For these reasons, support and intervention are provided in a variety of environments such as home, school, clinic and community settings.</p>  <p>  Under the national programme, all children disability services in Kildare west Wicklow were reconfigured in May 2014 and three network disability teams were established in south Kildare west Wicklow, mid-Kildare west Wicklow and north Kildare, respectively.  Significant investment has been made in the children disability network teams in Kildare west Wicklow.  In addition to the staff that reconfigured in May 2014, an additional 22 permanent posts have been allocated to the Kildare west Wicklow network disability teams.  Another nine temporary posts have also been provided as part of a waiting list initiative.</p>  <p>  The Kildare west Wicklow teams have developed strong working relationships with many of the schools in the area.  Supporting children to actively participate within the school environment forms a significant part of the daily work of the network disability teams' therapists. The referral rate to the service continues to grow across all three teams.  The average referral rate to the Kildare west Wicklow network disabilities team is 35 children per month, while the current average wait time for services is between six and 13 months.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-26a.410" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1324" speakername="Frank O'Rourke" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600041#SS00300"><p>While I appreciate the Minister of State's comment, if they were true, I would not need to raise this issue.  The reason I am raising the issue is that the parents of children with disabilities are tired and worn out.  They are at their wits' end as they seek to access the necessary and appropriate supports and services identified for their children.  They are no longer able to fight.  We have all heard about various cases.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Durkan, and I share the same constituency and both of us have heard these problems being outlined at many meetings.  Given that the problem has been ongoing for many years, I am not making a party political point.</p>  <p>  Services are not available and parents are no longer able to fight.  They want the services identified as necessary for their children to be provided.  As I outlined, once an assessment of need has been carried out, a care plan should quickly follow.  A review should then be carried out after a certain period and the care plan should be changed and modified according to the child's needs as he or she develops.  The equipment identified as necessary for a child should also provided and families should not be told such equipment is not available because of a lack of money.  Respite is not available at the moment and must be provided.</p>  <p>  Behavioural therapists and psychiatrists must also be involved in the assessment and review teams, which is currently not the case.  In addition, the July provision should be made available to all children with mild and profound disabilities.  This has not been the case for some time.  There is also a lack of communication between the Department, the HSE and parents.  This is a critical area and the parents of children with disabilities do wonderful work.  If they are to sustain this work, they need access to the supports and services identified as necessary for their children and which they deserve. </p>  <p>  I thank the Minister of State for taking this matter.  I hope she will take my message back to the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, who kindly met me a couple of times to discuss this issue.  I ask that the Minister of State meet me again in the next few weeks to discuss the points I have raised, with a view to providing a timeline for the delivery of these issues, which are important for children who require services and their parents.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-26a.411" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1307" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600041#SS00400"><p>As I indicated, the rate of referral to the services in Kildare west Wicklow continues to grow.  As a public representative, I understand that parents need to have their children assessed within a specified timeframe.  If a timely assessment is not carried out, a child will, unfortunately, regress to a certain extent.  While there is no issue with funding for services, sometimes staff are not available.</p>  <p>  Having spoken to the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Finian McGrath, I know everything is being done to deliver services to facilitate respite, especially for children.  We all understand that in families with a child with special needs, there can be turmoil in the home and parents need a break to be able to take time for themselves.  I concur with many of the points made by Deputy O'Rourke and I will convey them to the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath.  I will also ask the Minister of State to meet Deputy O'Rourke. </p>  <p>  The Kildare west Wicklow network disabilities teams currently support 367 children in services.  There are 21 children on the waiting list and the average waiting time is between seven and 13 months.  The area has 19.7 speech and language therapist posts and there is one vacancy in this area arising from long-term sick leave.  The service also has 11.8 psychotherapist posts and there are five vacancies for psychotherapists, which is a significant vacancy rate.  The Deputy is correct that services are not available in certain areas.  Recruitment is a problem in all parts of the health service.</p></speech>

I have just attended a mental health launch by the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health.  It was shocking to read the committee's report.  According to the HSE's health capacity review, Ireland's hospitals need at least 2,600 new beds in the next 15 years.  The review goes on to say the number could jump to 7,000 if HSE reform is not prioritised.  There is no reform.  It was also reported last year that more than 2,400 children were availing of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  At the same time, Ms Anne O'Connor, national director of mental health with the HSE, made the astonishing claim that the problem is that CAMHS takes everyone because there is nothing else.  Imagine, the director of mental health in the HSE said that.  We should let it sink in.  There is nothing else there.  Ms O&rsquo;Connor went on to say that in an ideal world the first step for a young person presenting with a mental health problem would be to get help in school and go to his or her GP to get access to primary care-based psychology or family counselling services.  She said the HSE&rsquo;s mission was in fact to keep people out of CAMHS.  At every point of intervention described by Ms O&rsquo;Connor, there are profound and systemic failures.  Primary care, GP services, school-based solutions and family counselling services are all in near total disarray despite the heroic work of the front-line staff involved.  The most recent report I have indicates that almost 220 children have been waiting for more than one year for access to CAMHS while at least 70 posts across CAMHS teams nationally remain unfilled.  Meanwhile, the HSE continued to recruit all through the recession with three out of every four recruits being managers and pen-pushers.  There is something rotten in the HSE when 70 posts in CAMHS are left unfilled nationally.  According to the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland, at 6%, spending on the delivery of mental health supports in the context of national concerns on this issue remains scandalously low, particularly when compared with the UK at 12% and Canada and New Zealand at 11.5%.</p>  <p>  There are a number of young children in my constituency who are incarcerated &ndash; I have to use that word &ndash; in South Tipperary General Hospital.  I could name them - a Boyle girl and an O&rsquo;Brien girl from Carrick-on-Suir.  The parents have contacted me, particularly those of the Boyle girl.  I apologise, she is a Kennedy and a 14 year old.  This is her tenth week in a children&rsquo;s ward in a general hospital where she is getting no treatment.  It will be her 11th week on Monday.  That is frightening, shocking and appalling.  If it was a war situation, the Government would be hauled in for war crimes.  It is a totally unsuitable setting.  The nurses and other staff are doing their best but her mother or someone else has to sit with her all night and on a 24-7 watch.  She is waiting for a bed in Cork University Hospital, CUH, or somewhere else.  It is appalling.  I have raised this with the Taoiseach over the past two weeks.  It is the same with the O&rsquo;Brien girl.  She is 13 and has also been waiting several weeks.  There have been four or five others over the past six to eight weeks in the same situation.  These are adolescent girls.  They are nearly adults but they are in a paediatric ward which is totally unfit and they are getting a small level of treatment each day from CAMHS.  It is pathetic and disgraceful.</p>  <p>  I attended the report launch today and heard consultants talking about the matter.  I saw the sheer frustration felt by everyone present because of the inertia and lethargy of an inept and uncaring HSE.  It must be disbanded in order to allow people access the services to which they are entitled.  It is despicable to have these children in a ward that is so overcrowded.  Those beds are needed for sick children.  These young adults must not be left to languish in these conditions in a hospital which is unfit to deal with them.  They need specialist treatment and they must get beds somewhere else.  Something has to be done about the HSE in order that sense will prevail.</p></speech>

I have been asked to take this matter on his behalf.  I have taken notes because the initial issue submitted was so broad and the reply may not cover all of the matters to which the Deputy referred.</p>  <p>  Mental health remains a priority care programme for Government.  Since 2012, approximately &euro;200 million, or 28%, has been added to the HSE mental health budget, which now totals over &euro;910 million.  This is a significant investment by any standard and the programme for partnership Government gives a clear commitment to increase our mental health budget annually as resources allow to expand and modernise all aspects of our services, including those in Tipperary.  HSE mental health funding for Tipperary this year is in the region of &euro;24 million.  One of the strategic priorities for mental health in the HSE national service plan 2018 is to deliver timely, clinically effective and standardised safe mental health services in adherence to statutory requirements.</p>  <p>  The provision of acute inpatient care to the adult population of north Tipperary, which is in community health organisation, CHO, 3, is provided between the acute unit in University Hospital Limerick, which has 50 beds, and the acute psychiatric unit in Ennis, which has 39 beds.  The 44-bed department of psychiatry based in St Luke's General Hospital in Kilkenny is the designated approved centre for acute inpatient services for south Tipperary, which is in CHO 5.  This enables all acute inpatient admissions for the CHO area to be managed at a single site.  Referrals to the department of psychiatry are through a consultant psychiatrist who makes the clinical decision to admit on the basis of the level of acute presentation or need.  In addition to the department of psychiatry, there is a dedicated psychiatric liaison team operating from the emergency department at St. Luke's.  All service users presenting to the emergency department who require psychiatric assessment will receive that assessment within agreed timeframes in line with the relevant department of psychiatry and emergency department guidelines.  Onward referral pathways are agreed with all service users upon completion of psychiatric assessment in the emergency department.  Pathways can include admission to an acute unit, referral to a relevant community mental health service team or referral back to a GP.</p>  <p>  There is a range of other mental health services for adults in Tipperary.  These include, for example, psychiatry of old age teams, non-acute beds, day hospitals and day centres, community mental health teams and high, medium or low support community residences.  There are three CAMHS teams operating in Tipperary; one in north Tipperary and two in south Tipperary.  The CAMHS acute units at Eist Linn in Cork, and Merlin Park in Galway, which has a total of 42 beds, serve the Tipperary catchment area.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, recently met with Oireachtas Members, and various local representatives, to discuss current and future provision of mental health services in Tipperary, including reviewing bed capacity.  He also visited mental health facilities in south Tipperary in February last.  Deputy Mattie McGrath can rest assured that the Minister of State will continue to closely monitor the development of all mental health services in Tipperary, particularly in the context of progressing new service developments agreed under the HSE service plan and through additional investment for mental health provided by Government.  I will come back on other issues raised by Deputy Mattie McGrath.</p></speech>

He seemed to make an effort.  However, if the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, continues to read out stuff officials write for her, we will change nothing.  It is pure and utter balderdash.  We do not have a single bed in Tipperary for mental health services.  The Minister of State may talk about Ennis and Kilkenny but units there are overcrowded.  The HSE is spending &euro;400 million of the mental health budget every year on medical treatments for illnesses but just &euro;10 million on psychological and counselling services while the Ministers of State in the Department and the Minister, Deputy Harris, read repots and listen to balderdash and baloney from the HSE.  These are mandarins who are not accountable.  CHO managers and others move on in a chain.  Mr. O'Brien is going off into the sunset and leaving also.  Meanwhile, unfortunate children and others with mental health issues would be in a wasteland but for volunteers, the suicide watch people in Clonmel and all of the other organisations doing such great work in this area.  It is unbelievable that the Minister of State should come to the House and read out such rubbish replies and that she or another Minister of State will do so again next week.  I do not mean any disrespect to the Minister of State personally but ministerial officeholders must take charge of the HSE and its budgets and demand accountability.  They must listen to front-line workers and stop hiring more mandarins and pen-pushers.</p><p>Three out of every four new recruits to the HSE is a manager.  It is despicable, out of control and morally, and in every other way, wrong.  To deny these young adolescent girls and boys these services and have them languishing in hospitals is wrong.  It is wrong that their parents and their families at home are traumatised because of this upset too.  However, all we get are toilet paper replies like this.  It is disgusting.</p> <p> At the report launch today, the entire health committee attended.  Several clinicians told us the system is so broken and rotten they cannot change it.  They said there is no accountability.  What are the jobs criteria for these HSE managers?  They have not a clue what they are trying to manage.  Above all, they have no empathy.  It is devastating that we are going to put up with this and continue listening to it from the HSE.  It does not care about the people.  All it wants are offices.  We have a hospital in Tipperary which is closed up and is a bed-free zone.  That is how the HSE operates.  Its managers are all about furthering their careers and to hell with the people and the services.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-26a.440" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1268" speakername="Pat Deering" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600043#UU02500"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann shall consider the Report of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine entitled 'Future of the Tillage Sector in Ireland', copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 22nd November, 2017.</blockquote><p>Last autumn, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine examined the issue of the tillage sector and its future.  In undertaking this body of work, it wished to explore the full range of actions which could benefit the tillage sector.  One of the main reasons the committee decided to examine this sector was because it had suffered several bad years with poor weather and low prices.  While the focus of agriculture continues to be placed more on dairy and meat production, the tillage sector represents an area that could hold a high degree of untapped potential.  For example, it may hold the key to emerging industries such as energy crops, as well as underpinning a vibrant and diverse artisan sector.</p><p>Launched last November, the report illustrates how the future of the tillage sector has its challenges, but within those challenges there are opportunities.  While capturing some of these opportunities and benefits may not yet be feasible, others can be implemented now and in the short term.  This report sets out several options that are comprehensive, wide-ranging, concise and realistic, all supporting a vibrant tillage sector with a strong future.  The report itself covers a large range of sectors and issues, highlighting the importance of tillage to the economy.  There are 35 recommendations in total, covering the tillage sector generally; increasing yields and profitability; energy generation and energy crops; supporting agriculture; and the input costs and support of the tillage sector.  The report and these recommendations are intended to provide a basis for engagement between stakeholders in formulating a tillage sector plan, as well as a strong and solid future for the tillage sector.  Most of the report's recommendations deal with increasing profitability and yields, along with energy generation and energy crops.  They also touch on horticulture, input costs and supports such as insurance.</p><p>On the tillage sector generally, one key issue considered is the potential for insurance-type schemes, as operated in other countries and other member states of the European Union.  As we have recently seen, the tillage sector operates in a high-risk environment.  While the report does not set out the structure such a scheme could take, the magnitude of the risk necessitates an examination of the merits of such an approach in Ireland.</p><p>Among the key recommendations is the importance of glyphosate in the farming community.  The committee has recommended that the Minister would vocally support the extension of the licence for glyphosate, which was subsequently extended by the European Commission.  While this is to be welcomed, the continuing importance of such fertilisers cannot be overstated.  The report notes there are some questions on the long-term reliance on specific chemical products and there is opposition to glyphosate in some member states.  However, it continues to be essential in achieving acceptable yields.</p><p>One aspect of the tillage sector that could be viable is the domestic sugar beet sector.  One key recommendation concerns an updated review of the potential to revive the sugar beet sector.  Ironically, with the demise of the domestic sugar production sector, the difficulties in the tillage sector became more apparent.  The support of small scale sugar beet production for the provision of molasses to Irish poit&iacute;n producers was also recommended.  The sourcing of Irish raw material by Irish distillers and brewers is to be welcomed.  The report suggests an industry-wide conversation should be held on the value of Irish inputs in the context of Origin Green.</p><p>However, there are a number of recommendations that address particular points.  The adoption of a fair trade system for Irish brewers was one possible avenue recommended by the committee.  This would involve brewers paying a slightly higher price per tonne in exchange for the right to use a specified logo identifying them as being supportive of Irish farmers and aligning commercial breweries with a form of social enterprise.  The use of long-term contracts is also a possible avenue that could be explored.  This would provide security to farmers and allow them the flexibility to invest more in their farms.  In addition, with the impending impact of Brexit, there is an opportunity for Irish alcoholic beverage producers to increasingly rely on Irish grain for production purposes.  Such an approach could help enormously in stabilising the tillage sector in the face of the considerable difficulties it is currently facing.</p><p>The unique selling points of certain products must also be preserved.  This is particularly the case for Irish whiskey, where the ageing requirement is essential to the recognised quality of Irish whiskey.  The committee recommended retaining this as any change to the requirement could undermine this recognised quality.</p><p>While the committee did not issue any specific recommendations on the use of genetically modified organisms, GMOs, it is explored in some detail.</p><p>The case for and against GMOs is set out in the report, as well as whether such crops are commercially viable for development or whether they suit Irish conditions.  The report highlights two key questions, namely, whether the Irish people are willing to accept GMO as safe on the basis of the body of research in existence and whether the use of GMO is viable economically or scientifically in Ireland.  <br/><br/>Organic crops have some potential and the report discusses the benefits and challenges associated with such crops in some detail.  The report's key recommendations are the development of a new organic action plan along with a commitment to produce new action plans on an ongoing basis.  The report recommends that organic farming should be prudently encouraged and it is essential that this is done where it is viable.  However, given the high risks involved, appropriate risk mitigation tools may also need to be explored.<br/><br/>Tillage has considerable potential to be a more central component of Irish agriculture and in achieving a stable future, the marketing of Irish produce is also important.  The committee recommended that Bord Bia should work with exporters to promote Irish products that are labelled &ldquo;Produce of Ireland&rdquo;.  Such labels can leverage the &ldquo;Irishness&rdquo; of these products and make a strong distinction between what is &ldquo;produced in&rdquo; Ireland and what is &ldquo;produce of&rdquo; Ireland.  <br/><br/>Turning to energy crops, the report notes it will be essential that financial support is made available in order to avert the negative fiscal and environment consequences of reduced tillage farming in favour of higher emission alternatives.  The joint committee has recommended that policies should, insofar as possible, support tillage farming and has highlighted the importance of a strong tillage sector in terms of food and feed security.  In the event of a substantial number of tillage farmers opting to pursue livestock farming instead, this could have a profoundly detrimental effect on Ireland&rsquo;s agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. <br/><br/>Additionally, the committee recommends the swift implementation of the recommendations of the tillage sector action plan of 2012 if, following a review, it is warranted.  It calls for a major co-ordinated review of all support schemes; the consideration of supports for the conversion of large-building heating units; rewarding energy crops through agrienvironmental schemes, for example, for biodiversity; and available support to help biomass boilers achieve lower emissions.<br/><br/>The potential benefits of energy crops are discussed in the report, and the committee is currently completing a report on climate change in the overall agrifood sector.  A key recommendation is that a review be undertaken of its potential to fully identify its feasibility in Ireland and to inform policies to enhance its potential.  This is not without risk, however, particularly in respect of the potential failure to meet the 2030 emissions targets.  To establish the economic risks involved, the report recommends that a likely figure for the cost of such a failure be determined.  <br/><br/>Another area discussed in the report is the potential of horticulture, which may offer an opportunity to dramatically increase agricultural output.  The benefits and challenges of controlled environment horticulture in particular are discussed in some detail.  The committee recommended that a detailed study be undertaken on the viability of expanding greenhouse growing in Ireland, and recommends that opportunities for controlled environment horticulture and vertical farming be explored.  <br/><br/>The recommendations also include the crucial issue of input costs is also included in the recommendations.  Reducing costs to farmers should be a consideration of net contributors to the EU and the primary issue identified in the report is the level of tariffs placed on fertiliser imports.  <br/><br/>The report includes a welfare analysis, which highlights the potential benefit that a complete elimination of import duties on fertilisers would have for farmers.  The committee recommends that the Government try to form a coalition of net contributors to the Common Agriculture Policy, CAP, to seek action by the European Commission on these tariffs.  <b></b>I will conclude by emphasising the importance of the CAP for the tillage sector, the sector which has probably suffered more than any other in the last CAP reform.  The report highlights how direct payments accounted for 85% of farm income in the sector in 2016, which further underlines how important the CAP really is.  We have an opportunity to maintain and enhance supports to the Irish tillage sector - and the EU tillage sector in general - in upcoming CAP negotiations.  Protecting the direct payments to this sector, while exploring ways to enhance supports, is of paramount importance.  This can be done by maintaining the CAP budget and using resources in a targeted and effective manner to provide the greatest benefit to all producers, including tillage farmers.<br/><br/>I am confident this report represents a comprehensive overview of the Irish tillage sector, the challenges it faces and the potential gains open to it.  It outlines options and avenues to be explored and, if approached in the right way, I believe there is a bright future for tillage farming in Ireland.  I hope this report meets the favour of the House and look forward to the debate.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-26a.442" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1356" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="17:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600044#VV00200"><p>I very much welcome this report and commend the committee members on their effort and contribution.  This is a very timely debate on a very important sector and we should carefully consider this report. The overall thrust of the report is very much aligned with the tillage actions outlined in Food Wise 2025, the industry blueprint for the development of the whole agrifood sector.  The tillage sector is an important and integral component of our agrifood industry, making a significant contribution to overall agricultural output.  Crop production as a whole, including horticulture, contributes in the region of &euro;700 million annually to agricultural output at farm gate prices.  In particular, the cereals sector is a major contributor to livestock production through the provision of animal feed.  Cereal growers also make a significant contribution to the food and drinks sectors in the form of malting barley, milling wheat and oats for the breakfast cereal industry.</p>  <p>  I will begin my contribution by referring to the sector for which I have specific responsibility, namely, horticulture.  The Irish horticulture industry makes a very significant contribution to the Irish gross agricultural output with a farm gate value of &euro;432 million in 2017.  In 2018, I have committed more than &euro;5 million in funding through the commercial horticulture grant aid scheme.  This funding will leverage a significant additional commercial investment by the sector.  The investment in new technologies that creates more sustainable production systems is central to achieving targets set out under Food Wise 2025 and this nationally-funded scheme underscores the Department's commitment to achieving these targets.  </p>  <p>  I firmly believe the report's recommendations on diversification into horticulture are timely given the effect of weather events on the tillage sector in recent years.  Diversification in agriculture and horticulture is something that can be used by primary producers to spread risk against losses in individual crops as a result of adverse weather or other challenges or both.  </p>  <p>  I will focus my comments on cereals to the potential of this sector to add value to agrifood output.  As I noted earlier, approximately 80% or approximately 1.8 million tonnes of the annual cereals harvest are used for animal feedstuff.  As a country, we need to import in the region of two thirds of our total feed materials requirement.  This is in marked contrast to many of our EU counterparts, where the import requirement is much lower.  Home-produced grain, either on its own or included in a native ration, provides a fully traceable feedstuff that supports the goals for the livestock sector contained in Food Wise 2025.  </p>  <p>  While the majority of cereal crop production has traditionally been based in the provision of feedstuffs to the livestock sector, end uses are changing.  The demand for grain by the food and drinks industries such as malting, milling, breakfast cereal, distilling and as ingredients in the food sector is growing.  Current demand for malting barley in Ireland is in the region of 200,000 tonnes, of which 180.000 tonnes is met by contracted malting barley growers.  This represents 20% of the total spring barley area sown each year.</p>  <p>  While not the answer to all of the challenges facing the tillage sector, the development of niche and specialist markets has potential to improve our competitiveness and sustainability.</p><p>The demand for Irish malting barley is growing in line with the sustained growth in demand for Irish whiskey.  The marketing opportunity offered by maximising the amount of Irish grain in what are quintessentially Irish brands must be developed to the benefit of all involved and I fully support the initiatives that help to attain that aim.  Within the malting barley sector, another specialist niche being promoted by the Department is the use of heritage Irish-bred barley varieties as a unique selling point for individual companies in the ever-expanding craft brewery and distillery industries.  I am pleased to report that my Department has funded research on novel high-end lifestyle foods under our research programmes.  I very much welcome that an important step at the end of these research projects is the engagement with the food industry with the view to commercialisation.</p> <p> In view of these areas, I am most conscious of the importance of the maintenance of an efficient and viable tillage sector.  I acknowledge that one of the major challenges facing the Irish tillage sector is the low price of grain.  This was confirmed in the results of a poll carried out among those in attendance at the recent Teagasc national tillage conference.  Unfortunately, cereal prices are highly sensitive to global supply and demand.  Low prices have become a feature of world cereal production in recent years.</p> <p> With regard to the sugar beet industry, my Department continues to monitor market trends.  It must be noted, however, that the landscape has changed since Ireland exited sugar production in 2005 and EU sugar quotas were removed in 2017.  Prices continue to decrease significantly as they align with world market prices.  I am fully committed to the Programme for a Partnership Government statement that &ldquo;State enterprise bodies will be asked to examine any substantial business plans related to rebuilding the industry with a view to considering appropriate State supports".  I reiterate that it is a matter for interested parties to move forward and garner sufficient commercial and financial support to turn their plans into a viable reality.</p> <p> The recent difficult winter and late spring affected all farming enterprises, and the tillage sector is no exception, with poor ground conditions resulting in delays to planting of spring crops.  Teagasc estimates that the area of winter crops sown for the 2017-2018 season has decreased by 14.5% compared with the previous year.  It is expected, however, that the recent general improvement in weather conditions will lead to an increase in spring sowing, especially in spring barley and forage maize.  In 2017, &euro;3 million was paid to Irish farmers under the EU protein aid scheme, primarily for the production of beans.  Earlier this year an extension to the protein aid scheme for 2018 was announced with the same level of funding as 2017.</p> <p> I come back to some of the recommendations of the report and how these fit with Food Wise 2025 and the supports provided by the Department.  On recommendation 24, which specifically mentions forestry for fibre, the mid-term review of the forestry sector addressed that issue.  It extended the payment period from ten to 15 years and increased the level of annual premiums to grant and premium category, GPC, 3 from &euro;180 to &euro;510.  The establishment grant per hectare per year was increased from &euro;2,165 to &euro;3,650.  Therefore, there is an incentive there.  As was outlined, the renewable heat incentive, RHI, scheme is under active discussion.</p> <p> The Department's independent crop variety evaluation programme is a service to the industry provided by the Department and it is based on comprehensive field trials conducted over a number of years in the main tillage regions.  An example of the progress made in the crop variety evaluation programme is spring barley yields.  Average spring barley yields of control varieties in the recommended list trials have increased by 27% over the past 21 years.  The multi-year evaluation programme provides Irish tillage farmers with unbiased information on the varieties most suited for growing under Irish conditions.  The trialling system evaluates various crops for yield, quality and agronomic traits, including disease resistance traits which are increasingly important given the continuing reduction in the approvals of plant protection products available for use.</p> <p> The seed certification scheme is implemented directly by the Department and is invaluable to growers in giving them peace of mind that the seed they sow is of the highest quality and free from weed seeds.  This service is provided to industry with only partial recovery of the total costs incurred in running the scheme.  I also highlight the additional actions that we have taken to aid the tillage sector.  The agriculture cashflow support loan scheme was introduced in January of last year and has been extended through provision of national funds to cover the tillage and horticulture sectors.  The banks have advised that all of the &euro;150 million available under this scheme has been committed and is in the process of being drawn down.  There has been a very positive reaction by farmers, including tillage farmers, to the scheme, which has proved that significant demand exists for low-cost flexible finance.  As announced in the budget last year, funding of &euro;25 million has been secured for the Department to facilitate the development of new Brexit response loan schemes during 2018 for farmers, fishermen and food businesses in primary production.</p> <p> With regard to the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, and the green, low-carbon, agri-environment scheme, GLAS, as a further support to tillage farmers, the tillage capital investment scheme under TAMS Il covers specific areas of investment, including minimum disturbance tillage equipment, sprayers, fertiliser spreaders and increasing grain storage and drying capacity.  There has been a significant level of interest in investments under this measure, with 1,015 applications received so far and 779 approvals.  More than &euro;2.63 million has issued in respect of 239 payment claims.  The measure remains open to further applications.  In addition to TAMS, the GLAS tiered entry system prioritised tillage farmers who chose the minimum tillage or catch crop establishment environmental actions.  To assist tillage farmers as well, in particular specialist malting barley growers, the Department decided to grant a special exemption from the basic payment scheme three crop rule to farmers who entered GLAS and committed to establish a catch crop on all of their tillage area.</p> <p> In response to the exceptionally challenging harvest conditions of September 2016, we introduced a weather related crop loss support measure to assist farmers who experienced significant yield losses in cereal crops.  This measure provided support for verified crop losses.  Particularly hard-hit growers who experienced verified significantly higher crop losses were eligible for an additional payment per hectare on the same area.</p> <p> With regard to risk management, all farmers understand that severe weather events come with the territory.  I am strongly committed to supporting farmers in managing as much risk as possible.  I sincerely believe there is scope to improve the functioning of the EU crisis reserve fund.  We will also consider selecting risk management tools such as using mutual funds, insurance schemes and income stability tools to mitigate the effects of severe weather events.  Given the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, we must now give strong consideration to implementing these risk management measures in Ireland.</p> <p> I will leave it at that.  I know there are other contributors.  The Minister, Deputy Creed, will conclude.  Once again, I express my appreciation for the work which the committee put into this report.  From my time on the committee I know the amount of effort that goes into such reports.  It is quite obvious that all Members have engaged in and contributed positively to it.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputies very much for that.  I hope they will not report me if I get there for that time.  I thank the Minister of State and the Chairman for their contributions.  I also acknowledge the tremendous work which all members of the committee put into developing this report.  I acknowledge especially the role played by the staff, including Kieran Tuohy, who is a researcher and did a lot of work on the report.  I know that Kieran has moved on and been replaced by Ivan Farmer.  I thank Kieran and the clerk to the committee, Josie Briody, who works alongside Alan and Hubert.</p><p>I appreciate the time that was given by the many people who came in not only to do written reports, but also to present.  Great commitment was shown and I acknowledge the leadership of the Chairman who very much took this issue on and drove it through and deserves very strong credit for that.</p> <p> Both the Chairman, Deputy Deering, and the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, outlined a number of the key recommendations, so I will not go into them as indepth as they did.  However, I will touch on a few of the key points from a Fianna F&aacute;il point of view.  Working closely with Deputy Cahill and Senator Paul Daly, we felt this was an issue which merited very significant time and was a worthwhile pursuit because there is no doubt but that our grain industry is under tremendous pressure.  The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, in his contribution outlined how the area under winter cereal last year dropped by 14.5%.  Some of this was weather-related but it is symptomatic of a trend whereby we see 2% to 3% of tillaged land being taken out of tillage each year.  This is a very concerning issue when one considers that we have to import two thirds of our total grain needs.  For a country with the agricultural potential of Ireland and where we pride ourselves on our tremendous agrifood exports and what we produce, it is very disappointing to see that, from the point of view of grain, two thirds of what we require must be imported.  Of course, there is also the point that a significant amount of those imports comes from countries where genetically modified organisms, GMOs, are used.  That presents issues as to how we bring our agrifood sector forward because I think consumers will increasingly look for produce that can be certified as entirely produced on this island with produce from the island.  It is a concerning trend which we need to try to find ways to arrest because once a lot of ground moves out of tillage, to get that industry back up and running and back to that capacity may prove nigh impossible.  Therefore, where possible, we need to try to take whatever measures we can to address this.</p> <p> There has not been much mention yet of the issue of the Common Agricultural Policy, the ongoing review and the funding that will be in place from 2020 to 2027.  This will be significant to all agrifood sectors but it will be particularly important to the tillage sector.  We need to see the CAP supports done in a way that recognises that the tillage sector needs to be supported and the level of hectarage under tillage continues.  This is challenging, and we see it particularly with the growth in the dairy sector, whereby profitability in the dairy sector has been higher in recent years than in other sectors.  This is putting increasing pressure on the area of land under tillage.  I am sure the Minister, Deputy Creed, and the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, are well aware of this.  We had the former Minister, Mr. Hogan, before the committee today.  As for how Deputies Creed and Doyle approach and engage with Mr. Hogan and the Commission in the coming period, it is important to keep this issue at the forefront of their minds.</p> <p> The report also touches on the need to examine properly the potential for energy crops, and I ask that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister and the Minister of State take on board from their end this recommendation, fully explore it and examine its potential.  I know the sugar beet sector was covered in the tillage sector report of 2012.  There is a commitment in the programme for Government that State supports be considered as appropriate in respect of proposals put forward.  I know this is being examined and scoped at present by some interested parties.  We should work to see where the potential and capacity is to reignite that and whether it stacks up.</p> <p> Another key point, which runs across all our agricultural sectors, is the need to ensure a fair price for the product.  When it comes down to brass tacks, the biggest problem with the tillage sector is that in recent years the price per tonne and the price that farmers get for their land has meant that incomes have been dropping and many are questioning how viable it is to continue in tillage.  This is a very challenging issue to grapple with.  Cereal prices operate in a world market and are very much exposed to what happens in other parts of the world at any one time in a given year.  However, where we can, particularly at European level, improve the position of the primary producer, it is important we explore that further.  There is no easy way to do so but it is something we must grapple with and try to improve.  An example given in our report is the brewing industry.  Regarding the prices paid to distillers and brewers, a one cent increase in the price of a pint would lead to a 20% increase in the price the farmer gets for his grain.  Therefore, a very small increase in the price the end consumer pays would have a very significant impact on the primary producer and the farmer in this instance.</p> <p> I also wish to touch on the issue of low-income loans.  Deputy Cahill raised this during Question Time today and the importance of these loans to the farming sector, particularly the tillage sector.  We see right across the country currently that farmers are under massive pressure because of how late this season has been.  A survey that the Irish Grain Growers sent to me earlier today indicates that, according to those who responded to the survey, 50% of farmers have less than half of their crops sown at this stage.  The respondents to their survey also indicated that 30% of farmers have reduced their areas of land under tillage.  This is a reflection of the pressure they are under.  A low-interest loan scheme needs to be opened up soon, and there is an allocation for it in the budget.  However, it is important that it is expedited by the Government to try to relieve some of the financial pressure the tillage sector is under.</p> <p> Our report also refers to the need to look at the price paid for fertiliser and the tariffs that are applied.  I know the IFA has pushed this and raised it in Europe and with the Government.  This could be addressed and could help address the costs that tillage farmers must deal with.</p> <p> It is also important that the Government shows itself to be responsive to the pressures under which farmers find themselves.  The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, did refer to the fund which was introduced to try to assist some of those farmers who suffered from a very bad harvest in 2016.  However, in that instance we must recognise that the Government was very slow to recognise the plight of those farmers and to come in and support them.  It took a Private Members' motion on the floor of the D&aacute;il to get movement on it.  The Government must learn from this and work closely with the sector to recognise the pressures the tillage sector experiences.  The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, referred in his comments to the need for additional volatility tools, insurance schemes and funds within the CAP programme, I believe, to be able to respond to adverse weather conditions.  That is important in the tillage sector, as it is in other sectors.  It is certainly a suite of policy tools that we must focus on and further develop, given our experience in recent years.</p> <p> At that, I will sign off.  I again thank everyone who contributed to the report and my colleagues for their generosity in letting me commence the Opposition contribution.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman, all the members who compiled the report and the secretariat, as Deputy McConalogue and others have.  Agriculture is the most important industry in this country.  I know the Minister himself is a cereal grower so he has an understanding of these issues.</p><p>I note from reading the report's many recommendations that the following proposals have been outlined.  I will make a brief comment on some of the recommendations on the tillage sector.  Recommendation uimhir a haon states:</p><blockquote>The Committee recommends that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine analyse the potential for agricultural insurance schemes as operated in other countries.  The Committee also recommends that the result of this analysis be forwarded to the Committee along with the Department&rsquo;s views on it in the context of a new Common Agricultural Policy.</blockquote><p> The committee also recommends that consideration be given to policies which encourage the use of as much suitable land as possible for tillage.  I am worried about this.  I have no corn myself, as I have only a small bit of hill land, but I was brought up on a very mixed farm and I worked as an agricultural contractor.  I did everything one could think of with corn.  I remember bagging corn as a buachaill &oacute;g on the bagger combine and it was hard work.  I remember the 20 stone bags which I could not lift.  Deputy Durkan and others will remember them also.  Men with the same physique as me could lift them and throw them up onto a trailer.  I could not believe it.  They could carry them up the stairs to a crusher in a mill.  Those days are gone.  I remember in 1977 drawing corn and barley and people were getting &pound;100 a tonne with 19% or 20% moisture.  It was nice dry corn, which was well ripened.  As a farmer said to me recently, at that time we could buy a tank of diesel for a tonne of corn, and he was speaking about a 300 gallon tank.  Now we would not fill a tractor for the price of the corn.</p> <p> We had the set-aside programme for a long time, which I thought was a blight on the landscape with so many people starving.  There were costs associated with it and there were the costs of conacre.  It has settled a bit, but the prices being paid never cease to amaze me because of the inclement weather and the poor climate.  This is a very late spring.  Winter corn is starting to recover but we got some corn in on only a couple of days this week.  We grow potatoes as well and none of them is in yet.  My point is the costs are huge and the cost of the commodity is not keeping anywhere near pace.  I do not know how people survive.  There is the cost of a combine harvester and the cost of the tractor and plough, the tiller, the one pass system and sprays.  Back in 1976 after setting the corn we would not see it again apart from looking over the ditch to see whether it was ripe or getting a bit into our fists to rub the grain to see whether it was ripe.  Now it is sprayed so many times and washed and there is nitrogen and God knows what.  The costs are savage and we are not keeping pace with them.  It is in crisis because people are flocking away from it because the costs are too high and the return is not there.</p> <p> The banks are not good at supporting farmers anyway, but they are reluctant to give people a loan to till, set and sow.  They always used to wait until September or early October for the cheques but this is not happening.  Farmers are not getting those loans.  The country needs to recognise that agriculture is a vital industry.</p> <p> We had a lot of beet but we had the demise of the beet industry.  It was done by my party at the time and it was the biggest scandal in agriculture.  It was the then Minister, Mary Coughlan.  It was a crying shame that the industry was closed down.  South Tipperary was a hub of beet growers.  The whole season started when people would meet, often in a public house or some venue, when an agent would come along and people got their acreage.  Then they started ploughing, tilling and sowing.  At that time we had to till it and I often tilled it and hoed it.  As a young fellow I pretended to do this as I ran up and down the drills.  Then we came to the harvesting, loading it into trailers and bringing it to the railway station in Cahir and then to Thurles.  There was a whole pulp industry and lime industry.  There were seasonal jobs in Thurles.  It was huge.  There was also the whole area of the tops.  It was full year round employment.  As well as work for farmers, nine or ten young fellows would be thinning beet.  Of course, they cannot do it now because NERA and other agencies would be out saying we cannot have young fellows under 16 thinning beet.  We have lost that whole understanding of how food is produced and where food is derived from.  It is not their fault, but some children now think money comes out of a hole in the wall, that milk comes from a factory and that sugar comes from wherever.  That is the way it is gone.  It was wonderful training.</p> <p> The Minister is laughing - t&aacute; s&eacute; ag g&aacute;ire - but I remember an old man, Jimmy McGrath, who used to thin the beet with us.  He was a big heavy man at the time.  We passed him out on the drills because we were young and light, and he used to be savage because he prided himself that no one could beat him at anything.  We were up and down the drills and the older men were hoeing.  There was all the work in that, and there were also the hauliers and people selling the lime.  God be good to Liam Devaney, who was a great Tipperary hurler.  He had more dinners in our house than anyone else and he was welcome.  He always arrived at that time of the day.  It was a whole way of life.  Now the farming has gone and we see it today in the fodder crisis.</p> <p> I am frightened for young dairy men.  I salute their courage but I do not think the banks are saluting them.  They have made investments in cows and big herds.  The small farmers are gone.  Every farmer at that time had a couple of acres of beet and a mixed farm.  We had everything from pigs to cows to sheep to beet, potatoes, mangles, turnips, wheat, a bit of oats and everything else including barley.  It has changed now.  There is talk of diversification but we are becoming industrial farmers now and we have a huge loss of employment and a loss of those valuable resources.</p> <p> I know the committee looked at this, and the CAP is up for review and God knows what, but in my experience it is unviable now to grow and harvest corn.  This late spring will not help.  I do not want to be a prophet of doom because if corn gets in and gets the right conditions it will come and we will have a good harvest.  Last year, we saw 1 million big round bales of straw fewer than we did the year before.  That gives us an indication.  It was not because the crop was so low and so small, it was because people are going away from growing cereals.</p> <p> We have another problem in Tipperary and in the Golden Vale because a conglomerate, namely, Coolmore, is buying every bit of land.  If someone had an A4-sized piece of land it would almost buy it.  It is pricing everyone else out of the market.  The people there always told us they wanted land to breed excellent horses, and I salute their prowess and the many famous horses and the O'Brien family in south Tipperary, but they also have 3000, 4,000 or 5,000 acres of corn.  They cannot say that is to feed the horses because very little of it is oats and horses do not eat wheat, as far as I know, especially thoroughbreds.  We need to look at this.</p> <p> We need the land commission back or something like it.  Rural villages and towns are lonesome places because we do not have people on the land.  We had the Bill from the Minister, Deputy Ross, yesterday which will mean drivers will have to keep a metre away from bikes.  Holy God, imagine going down a narrow road with a combine taking up the whole road and then keeping a metre away from a bike.  We just have to get some bit of common sense back in here and allow people to live on the land and have the land productive.  I know we will never go back to the day of what I am speaking about and is m&oacute;r an trua &eacute; sin.  We need to look where we are going.  We need to have control over the acquisition of thousands of acres by a horsing conglomerate.  This is also happening in Wicklow and other places.  The small man who wants to keep going or the young farmer who has all his green certificates and wants to be able to expand a little to be viable gets no look in.  This is reprehensible.  We need a land commission or something like it.  Although this report has taken a pretty exhaustive look, we also need to look at the more deeply rooted problems because agriculture is in crisis.</p> <p> I have not even mentioned the fodder crisis but part of it was because there was no straw.  There were 1 million fewer round bales of straw last September then the year before.  That tells its own story.  People are going away from it because it is not viable.  I know they have tried maize and other crops.  The big issue with sugar beet was the loss of a rotation crop.  It was a fabulous rotation crop.  Efforts have been made by Deputy Deering and others, and I support them, to try to encourage the industry back again but it will be an uphill struggle.  It was a most valuable industry to lose and shame on the Government at the time that destroyed it.  Look at what it did to the town of Thurles.  It is a pity Deputy Cahill is not here.  It is falling down around the place.  I drew beet in there and cut across to Littleton with a tractor and trailer and drew briquettes home.  The briquette factory closed only three weeks ago.  What is going on in rural Ireland?  We can talk all we like here and have reports and investigations, but it is like Cromwell and to hell or to Connacht.  Where will they send us?  Agriculture plays such a vital part, and any young fellow who got training, whether villagers or farmers' sons, were well trained in milking cows with a stool and bucket, tilling beet, loading mangles or beet, hunting sheep, dipping sheep-----</p></speech>

I had to do everything with it.  I picked up 20 tonnes of loose beet off the field by hand after the machine was done, which took me a week.  I was born on a 36 acre farm.  Most small farms tend to be a mixture of different aspects of farming involving cereals and different animals, be they pigs, cattle or sheep.  Small farmers tended to have a bit of everything and there was something very good about it.</p>  <p>  The reason I decided to contribute was because I have been listening to some small farmers in Wexford.  The fodder crisis was the stimulus for it.  Small farmers contacted me to say they wondered why in God's name we do not do anything for the small farmer.  I am of the opinion that we take much better care of the big farmer than we do of the small one.  The small farmer needs the Government's help more.  I was away at the time but it was pointed out to me that on the radio, the Minister had called on the banks to be more open to giving farmers short-term loans to help them with the crisis and said that the agricultural sector was one of the most bankable in Ireland.  The farmers told me that they tried but they could not get it.  We all know that if the sun was shining, the banks would give a person an umbrella, but if it started raining, they would want it back.  There is no doubt that the less money a person needs, the easier it is to get it from a bank, but the more money he or she needs, the more difficult it is to get it.  That is not just in farming.  It is in all areas.</p>  <p>  The small farmers who were contacting me about the fodder crisis were very frustrated.  They feel abandoned.  We know there has been great help for certain areas of agriculture.  We have probably made millionaires out of the big dairy farmers.  We gave away our fish on the cent of it.  I would not expect the Minister to agree with me on anything anyway.  The small farming sector is worth protecting.</p></speech>

That is what he said in 2007.  We have argued in here about the increase in the dairy herd.  I do not think it is a good idea.  Aside from the climate change aspect of it, we are making more problems for ourselves.  We cannot have milk without calves, so we are increasing the beef herd, which adds to our climate challenges.  On top of that, where is the extra feed coming from?  The number of animals in the country has increased a lot so the amount of feed would need to increase a lot.  Aside from how we deal with the challenges of climate change, we must accept that sometimes winters are wetter at certain parts of the season than they used to be and weather is becoming more unpredictable.  It is part of the reason the banks might not be as keen to give money to small farmers anymore.  Maybe the banks find that the industry is less predictable and more precarious.</p>  <p>  A lot of money goes to the farming sector and it is by far our best indigenous industry.  It is the only real indigenous industry of any size worth talking about in this country.  I wish the Government would direct more money towards those who need it most, namely, small farmers.  I do not know how we could do that.  I am sure the Government has talked about it more than I have.  Unless we change tack, I honestly believe the small farming sector is under serious threat and that would be a terrible shame for this green island because it has so much to offer the country in so many different ways.</p>  <p>  I was going to talk about a lot of different things, many of them around climate change.  I just want to register the worry of small farmers whom I have met.  They are genuinely worried about whether they have a future in the game they are trying to make work for them and rear young families on.  One of them pointed out to me that some of the small farmers he knew were so challenged, he was worried about their mental health.  We all know the link between financial pressures and mental health difficulties.  The number of small builders who took their own lives during the recession is well known, as is the number of people who took their own lives because of difficulties with banks.  I appeal to the Department to be more conscious of the difficult place small farming is in.</p></speech>

I compliment Deputy Deering, who is an excellent Chairman, as was his predecessor.  The moral or lesson is that one can become a Minister of State, just like Deputy Doyle, who was previous Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and did an excellent job.</p>  <p>  When I was growing up in Westmeath, some farmers spoke slightly resentfully of "the time of the tillage", by which they meant the years of the Second World War when farmers were compelled to increase their production of cereals and root crops which could not be imported due to the war.  As much of the land in Westmeath is fairly heavy land and not suitable for tillage, it took a big effort and a lot of hard work, and that was why a bit of resentment was understandable.  Up to the 1970s, nonetheless, a large proportion of farmers in Westmeath grew some cereals and root crops.</p>  <p>  The price supports for beef and milk provided under the CAP resulted in a sharp decline in Irish tillage farming as very little CAP support was provided for tillage.  Only 9% of arable land is now devoted to tillage and the acreage has declined by 14% in the past five years.  There are now only 3,000 specialised tillage farmers but they are highly productive, as shown by the fact that Irish crop yields are among the highest in the world.  A large part of the decline in tillage is due to the abandonment of sugar beet production because of the EU allowing greater tariff-free imports of cane sugar.  One of the recommendations focuses on the revival of the sugar beet industry.  I think all the stakeholders who have expressed an interest should get together and redouble their efforts.  The Minister should help out in a practical way to secure this worthwhile objective.  It was a sad and poor day for Ireland when it was closed in 2005.  I remember it went through here nice and coolly, but even a midlander like myself knew the importance of the sugar industry.</p>  <p>  The reduction in tillage output has led to increased dependence on imports with only 40% of Ireland's cereal consumption being domestically produced.</p><p> Many of the cereals imported into this country are genetically modified.  While Ireland does not grow genetically modified crops, I am concerned that if imported cereals are fed to livestock, it will be difficult to sustain the clean and green image of Irish food production.  That is why we need to increase tillage production.  I know it is a very big threat.  We are very proud to have a very clean and good industry.  We can secure the industry completely if we ensure that we increase production.</p> <p> The fact that Irish cereal production is free of genetically modified organisms, GMOs, offers an opportunity for the tillage sector to produce more premium products for food production rather than for animal feed which accounts for most cereal production at present.  The establishment of several new whiskey distilleries and numerous craft breweries, including some in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath, also offer opportunities for increased production of high-quality cereals.  There may be a case for a quality-assurance premium for Irish GMO-free grain which could establish for such grain incentives similar to those for the quality-assured Irish beef of which we are so proud.  While Irish beef and dairy production are major contributors to Ireland&rsquo;s CO2 emissions, tillage crops sequester carbon in the soil as they grow.  As the EU moves towards more carbon-friendly farming, greater tillage output will help Ireland achieve its carbon reduction targets.</p> <p> The potential for biofuels is not being realised and the acreage under such crops has stagnated.  There are opportunities not only for biomass crops as a source of energy but also for biopolymers, biochemicals and insulation materials.  Biofuel crops can be grown in areas not suitable for cereals and are less weather dependent than the latter.  However, we have some history in this regard and people have not forgotten the lessons of the past decade, when many farmers got burnt.</p> <p> The potential for organic crops in Ireland is not being developed.  I am aware that organic production is very hard work and that the price premium for organic products is often not enough to make production worthwhile.</p> <p> Over the past 20 years the arrival of discount supermarkets has put relentless downward pressure on the price paid to farmers for vegetables.  Not only did the big supermarkets coming in from abroad eliminate the little local shop, they also did terrible damage in the context of the prices farmers get.  They did that with vegetables.  Earlier, Commissioner Hogan said something to which I subscribe, namely, that the abolition of the groceries order was the biggest mistake the country ever made and we are paying a significant price.  Fair play to the Commissioner, who sent out a clear signal to whatever Government might be around that he should be reappointed to the position because at least he speaks the truth to power.</p> <p> While low food prices are obviously good for consumers - at least they think they are good - particularly those on low incomes, good-quality food cannot be produced cheaply.  Darina Allen has said that when she advocates for good-quality food, she is dismissed as elitist and told that people cannot afford quality food.  However, a recent survey found that the average Irish family spends one fifth of its food budget on so-called treats that are full of sugar and fat and empty of nutrition.  Many people seem willing to spend money on anything other than good-quality food.  An effective campaign of education of consumers is needed to inform people of the importance of domestically-produced wholefoods.  Families with children in Ireland spend on average &euro;1,037 per annum on crisps, chocolates and sweets and only &euro;346 on vegetables.  As a result of this consumption pattern, there has been an alarming increase in childhood obesity - I suppose I am a good example of that - and all the attendant health risks that go with it.</p> <p> The snow in late February and early March also highlighted a vital reason for Ireland to produce more of the food it consumes.  Many people think that because Ireland is a large food producer, we could survive any crisis in which food supplies were disrupted.  We know that 90% of our beef is exported.  The supply chain for many foods is now long, complex and easily disrupted.  There is a strong case to be made for Ireland to become more self-sufficient in basic foodstuffs and in order to achieve this, tillage farmers need greater support.  While the old CAP led to overproduction and left us with butter mountains and wine lakes, the withdrawal of price support for wheat has led to a huge drop in stocks of wheat.  This means that there is little wheat available when shortages emerge due to adverse weather conditions.  Such weather conditions will be more frequent in the future.</p> <p> Transport is the major contributor to CO2 emissions and consumers are becoming more conscious of food miles.  Supermarkets offer green beans from Guatemala, asparagus from Peru and strawberries from Egypt.  While I am not suggesting that Irish consumers be confined to carrots and turnips during the winter, the current global system of food production and transport is not sustainable.  A return to sourcing more of our food supplies locally is vital if we are to slow down global warming.  We could have a treble hit here.</p> <p> Irish tillage has a promising future if it can respond to the demand for more sustainable and healthy food products but tillage farmers need greater support  from the Government and the EU.  In the forthcoming reform of the CAP, tillage crops should be given more consideration and more resources need to be put into supporting sustainable agriculture.</p> <p> I mentioned the Second World War.  Irish agriculture prospered during that period because we were able to meet much of the increased demand for food in the UK.  Brexit poses a challenge for all Irish food exporters but Irish tillage producers will require support to maintain their share of the UK market and to enter new markets.</p> <p> The prediction is that, by 2025, there will only be 1,500 full-time tillage farmers who will produce 60% of the output, with 11,000 people involved in tillage and energy production at some level.  As I discussed with Deputy Martin Kenny, it is not profitable to produce tillage crops and tillage farmers are competing with a pretty profitable dairy industry.  While I hate to use the term, it is a perfect storm.</p> <p> It is not often that I praise the IFA; I rightly take issue with it.  I would be one of the few Deputies to have the courage to do that.  I know many farmers support what I say and not what the IFA says.  However, I have great admiration and time for Liam Dunne of the IFA grain committee.  He is based in the Acting Chairman's county.  He knows his onions.  He has been arguing about ways of reducing input costs, including initiatives relating to VAT.  Whenever he speaks, I listen with care because I know he puts considerable work into it.  Nevertheless it is a huge challenge to get people into tillage.  Unless it becomes profitable we will be shooting against the wind.  Given issues such as input costs and VAT, we have to discriminate in favour of tillage.  We need more domestically produced food.  I think we can do that profitably and make tillage attractive again.  It was always attractive.</p> <p> We need 6 million tonnes of animal feed and, as the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, said, we are producing approximately 2 million tonnes per annum.  The balance is imported.  We have climate issues and rotation issues.  The real issue is that there is inadequate financial return for those who sow tillage crops, which says it all.</p> <p> In 2016, the average income on special tillage farms was approximately &euro;30,800, with direct payments making up &euro;26,000.  Less than &euro;5,000 was coming from the market.  That was for enterprises other than cereals.  Only a quarter of tillage farmers earn in excess of &euro;50,000.  Machinery is the biggest cost incurred by tillage farmers, amounting to approximately 40% of the total cost of growing crops in Ireland according to Teagasc specialists.  Farm and land fragmentation plays a significant role in that.</p> <p> Protein crops and others that the Minister of State mentioned have potential.  However, in order to get back into grain and tillage properly we will need to ensure it is profitable and reward those who take risk in the tillage area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-26a.464" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="18:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600049#AAA00200"><p>I compliment the Chairman and committee members on the work done on the report.  I also compliment the staff and the various organisations that sent in witnesses who gave us their knowledge and expertise on the issue.  I also acknowledge the others who made submissions on it.</p>  <p>  As has been said, the tillage sector has been under pressure.  The Teagasc report for the period 2007 to 2016 shows a reduction in the tillage crops grown in nearly every county.  Deputy Penrose will be interested that the figures for Meath and Westmeath increased slightly.  They are not all lazy in that part of the country.  Despite everything, they are pushing it forward.</p>  <p>  The reality is that it is about price.  Other speakers referred to the animal feed element.  The feedstuffs necessary to keep the dairy and beef sectors going must come from somewhere.  Even if we were growing all the grain in Ireland, the reality is that the imports from abroad are considerably cheaper.  Given those prices, Irish farmers will not grow that animal feed product.  However, the position relating to foodstuffs is completely different.</p><p>There is a huge opportunity to produce cereal crops for food and for the whisky and beer sector.  We have a distillery in Drumshanbo in County Leitrim which produces gin, whiskey and vodka.  Pat Rigney, who runs an excellent business there, tells me that he tries to get as much grain as he can from Ireland, but cannot always do that.</p> <p> The report shows that a farmer gets 1% of the price of a pint.  It costs &euro;7 in the city centre of Dublin but the farmer's share is very small.  It costs less than &euro;5 where I come from but farmers face the same reality.  A consumer would expect a farmer to get a lot more but it is the same in every sector.  Earlier today the EU Commissioner, Mr. Phil Hogan, spoke of the pricing system and the way a product gets to market.  Everyone between the primary producer and the consumer seems to be making a lot but the two at the ends are suffering, with the consumer paying a high price and the farmer getting a low price.  I acknowledge that work is being done to change this.</p> <p> The Irish whiskey sector has a huge opportunity across the world.  We have made huge advances in Mexico and other countries.  The French are the largest consumers of whiskey and have whiskey before and after every meal.  If we got just 1% of the Scotch on the French market it would add between 30% to 40% to production in Ireland.  I am not an advocate for alcohol as it has many dangers but there is an opportunity for a product that has a story to it.  I spoke to somebody who provides food to luxury hotels in the Far East, who told me they cannot get enough of food that has a story, whether it is cheese, meat or anything else.  They want to put on a menu that a piece of lamb came from such a place in Ireland and was raised on a mountain with pure feed.  We produce a lot of food for export in Ireland but we are tiny in proportion to the food consumed throughout the world.  We need to put ourselves in a place where we get a premium price for our product, which means we have to do it not just better than everywhere else, but purer than everywhere else.</p> <p> An opportunity exists for the tillage sector, which is a vital part of our beef and dairy sectors, as well as beer and whiskey.  What is missing is a bit of joined-up thinking.  The industry has to come on board but the people who produce the final product have to recognise that the farmer needs to be knitted into the picture, which means they must be given not just a fair price but an excellent price to enable them to expand.  In Leitrim and north Roscommon, they used to say that the money that bought land was never made on land.  People went away, worked hard and then came home and bought a farm, almost when they were due to retire.  We should have an agricultural industry which does not just provide a living for people.  It should sustain the next generation and there is now an opportunity to do that, with the tillage sector central to this.  Deputy Penrose mentioned a quality assurance scheme and this needs to be looked at.  If we put Origin Green on a bottle of whiskey or anything we produce it should mean all the ingredients are produced in Ireland.  It should also mean that the farmer who contributes to those ingredients gets an excellent price and is well looked after.</p> <p> The report is an excellent document and goes into many of these issues.  It sets out a roadmap for the way forward but we need to be even more imaginative.  The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Andrew Doyle, spoke of the horticulture sector.  I grew mushrooms for many years in the mid-1980s, when small farmers were encouraged to have an alternative farm enterprise, with the assistance of grant aid and other things.  It kept farms going but, with economies of scale, in order for people to make money they had to expand from one mushroom field to two and then, after a few years, to ten, 15 or 20 and not everyone could do that.  A few big players got very big and the rest disappeared.  Where there is pressure to make money in this scenario, Government has to become a leveller by supporting the small people to stay small.  I heard what Deputy Mattie McGrath had to say and, while it is amusing to think of the hard work there was on a farm, in the shape of thinning and other things, we do not want to go back to those days.  Nevertheless, mass efficiency will eventually mean we have very few people working and a lot of stuff produced but without the quality.  We need to have balance and to rethink where we are going.</p> <p> There is a piece in the back of the report on alternative and new ideas for the horticulture sector, involving technology and other things and we need to look at opportunities such as them.  The important thing is that the sector needs to stay small scale, though I do not mean micro level.  It needs to be manageable and able to sustain a family farm.  If we do that with horticulture there will be opportunities for us.</p> <p> This report is an excellent document but it will have to be bought into by several industries, particularly the food and drink industries, as well as the Minister and Government who have a big role to play.  To have a vibrant tillage industry, the people who grow the grains have to know they will get a very good price consistently into the future.  There are great opportunities if everyone works together because when communities come together, they can do something different.  Everyone in the world recognises that Ireland is a country from where clean and high-quality food and drink comes and we need to use that to our advantage.  We must ensure that those in a strong position, such as those in the processing industry, do not abuse their strength.  The job of Government is to ensure that does not happen.  I commend the report and thank the committee and everyone who put so much work into it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2018-04-26a.466" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="18:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042600050#BBB00200"><p>It has been fascinating to listen to the debate and I acknowledge the work done by the committee, its individual members, the secretariat and the Chairman in bringing forward a report.  It is timely as we are at a critical stage in negotiating the shape of the Common Agricultural Policy after 2020.  The viability of the tillage sector is contingent on the appropriate policy framework being delivered and that needs to happen to ensure this critical industry can survive.</p><p>I take note of all of the contributions that have been made on the level of acreage under the plough and the fact that it has dropped.  However, one of the most significant structural challenges the industry faces is that it is substantially dependent on rented land.  Deputy Martin Kenny and I had a conversation earlier today about the future of the Common Agricultural Policy.  I understand from where he was coming in his point which, in principle, I support, about delivering more supports to smaller farmers, but here is the rub.  In this sector which is particularly challenged they have, on average, among the highest payments made under the single farm payment system.  The payments are a historical legacy or entitlement and in order to retain them, farmers are obliged year in, year out to pay extraordinary levels for rented land.  It is a vicious circle and we need to find a rational way out of it.  They are now competing with farmers on the dairy side and those involved in both sectors are paying excessive amounts.  We hear extraordinary figures quoted for an acre of rented land for tillage or dairy production, which brings into question the issue of sustainability.  We use that word very often in the context of environmental policy but financial sustainability also applies.  The farmers in question receive among the highest payments, but a lot of it - I use the term advisedly - is frittered away.  Because of the paradigm in which they are stuck, they have to take land in order to retain the entitlement.  Deputy Martin Kenny made a point earlier today at Question Time about capping payments.  We need to deliver a fairer model and provide for more equity in the allocation of CAP funds without having unintended consequences, which was the point I made.</p></speech>

There is a real challenge in that regard.  I am not sure if that is something the committee has specifically got its head around in respect of a model for the tillage industry in the context of a reformed CAP.  I suspect nobody from Deputy Martin Kenny's neck of the woods would thank him much for salvaging the tillage men who might retain a payment of in excess of or sometimes multiples of the proposed cap.  I do not think that reflects the income they make from their enterprise.  There is the rub.  We need to be careful of unintended consequences in what we do.  Tillage is a very interesting sector to expose it and to see how a movement in one direction can have catastrophic consequences for others.  Therefore, we need to be careful.</p>  <p>  The point has been made about the country's dependence on imported grains for animal feed and protein, in particular.  If my recollection of figures is correct, we are only about 5% self-sufficient in protein crops.  That is an extraordinary exposure.  The European Union as a whole is equally dependent on imported proteins.  I saw somewhere recently that we imported the equivalent of the size of the Iberian Peninsula in terms of the ground required to grow the volume imported.  That is a huge deficit that the European Commission now acknowledges.  In fairness to the Commissioner who was before the committee earlier, it has committed to bringing forward a protein plan for the European Union.  I hope it will offer some support to the tillage sector here.</p>  <p>  We have lamented the demise of the sugar industry, rightly so.  It happened in a context that was extremely regrettable, but that is water under the bridge.  In fact, we are not hidebound by the constraints introduced when the industry was closed down.  The Government has always indicated - the programme for Government specifically references it - that it is open to a business case that might see an opportunity to re-establish a sugar industry here.  It would receive the supports any prospective business would.  I acknowledge its role in terms of animal feed and as a break crop for the tillage sector.</p>  <p>  The EU protein plan which I think is anticipated by 2019 could form a very interesting part of a new architecture for the tillage sector and in addressing our and the European Union's deficit in production.  We are really significant in that space.  I take Deputy Willie Penrose's point about our exposure to imported grains, GM crops, etc.  On specific immediate issues of interest to the tillage sector, there is the three crop rule.  The adverse weather in recent weeks has affected crops that would and should have been sold to meet the greening obligations under the CAP.  The Commissioner has been very proactive in indicating that they will not apply for the current tillage year, which is welcome.</p>  <p>  It is true to say one of the shining lights on the horizon for the tillage industry is the expansion of the drinks industry.  Although for many years - since the foundation of the State - we trundled along with three or four distilleries, we are now heading towards having over 20 distilleries and close to 100 micro-breweries.  All of this requires a supply chain of locally grown grains.  A point has also been made about the level of interest in provenance.  That is one of the great things about the success of the agrifood and drinks industries.  Globally, there is interest in the story of our food production.  It can be brought down to a more local and parochial level in the context of the point made about being able to grow more food locally and shorten supply chains.  We have indigenous drinks on which we should not turn our back.  We can produce food in an environmentally sustainable manner in which others are interested and that also has a story behind it.  The drinks industry has a great story to tell.  We were where the Scottish whisky industry is today.  We were the world leader 100 years ago.  For many reasons into which I will not go, we tumbled from that position, but the industry is now growing at quite a considerable pace.  Irish whiskey is the fastest growing brown spirit consumed in the world and we are now almost struggling to keep up with the global demand.  The industry is on a really exciting expansion curve.  The grain industry is a critical part of it.</p>  <p>  I was in Deputy Willie Penrose's constituency with my party colleague last summer.  I had a very interesting experience with an organic grain farmer.  If one keeps doing the same thing year in, year out and expects a different result, it is not a sure-fire recipe for success but rather the opposite.  However, here is someone who switched from conventional grain growing to organic and made a real success story of it.  I am sure he will not mind me mentioning his name.</p></speech>

There is huge potential on the organic side.  The two sectors in which consumer demand is greatest are probably tillage and dairy.  I remember being in a supermarket in South-East Asia which was part of one of the prime retail chains.  It stocked Glenisk organic yoghurt.  The store manager said he could sell as much of it as we could supply to him.  That market is insatiable on the organic and tillage sides.</p>  <p>  We could become quite despondent about the industry.  It is critical to the future not just of the farmers directly involved in it but also to those involved in the broader agrifood space, including livestock, dairy, pig and poultry producers - Irish rations.</p><p>In the context of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, this is a critical juncture for the tillage sector.  We must make sure that, as we embark on the new architecture, there are no unintended consequences for a sector that could suffer significantly from some of the things that are on the table.</p></speech>

It has been a very interesting and informative debate.  We do not get the opportunity to discuss agriculture at length in this House very often, but I believe we should discuss it more often.  If it had not been for the report, this debate would probably not have happened.  In particular, I thank the members of the committee for the work they put into the report.  When we came back after the recess last summer, we decided that there were a number of issues on our work programme that we wanted to deal with.  The tillage sector was one of the issues because of the difficulties it had experienced in the previous year.  I also thank the secretariat for its work, including Josie Briody and Ivan Farmer, and prior to him Kieran Tuohy, who did the leg work and spade work in terms of putting together the report.</p>  <p>  The tillage sector needs to be saved.  We could be negative about it.  We have already lost the sugar beet industry, a fact which has been well articulated in this House.  It would not take much for the tillage sector to go down the same road, which is why we need to take action.  There are a number of recommendations in the report, but there is no silver bullet, and we never suggested there was.  We did not publish this report so that it would lie on a shelf and gather dust.  We want action to be taken as a result of it to ensure the tillage sector does not go down the same slippery road as the beet sector did in the past.  The beet industry, as was pointed out by various speakers, should not have been allowed to disappear in the way it has.  My own area, Carlow, has never recovered as a result of the sugar factory closing.  It had a knock-on effect, not just for the farmers but for the town itself.  People in Carlow town worked in the industry for whatever number of months they could, and that kept them going for the rest of the year.  That has been lost, and we want to make sure that does not happen in the tillage sector.</p>  <p>  There are approximately 7,000 tillage farmers left in the country.  We received submissions when we were compiling the report, and Teagasc appeared before the committee.  I remember asking it how many acres a tillage farmer needs to be sustainable going forward, and the answer was between 600 and 700 acres.  That is a huge amount of land.  We spoke about scale a few moments ago.  How is a man who grew 30 or 40 acres in the past going to survive?  He will not.  The Minister spoke about the amount of leased and conacre land that is required for the tillage sector.  That small farmer is now competing against a diary sector that is expanding at an enormous pace.  I happened to be at a function yesterday in Kilkenny where there was a panel of young farmers who spoke about the amount of money they were prepared to pay for land.  They were willing to pay &euro;300 an acre as a starting point.  The tillage farmer cannot compete.</p>  <p>  We spoke about CAP and its importance.  The Minister and Deputies Penrose and  Martin Kenny all referenced it.  Some 85% of a tillage farmer's income comes from direct payment.  That is a huge problem.  No matter how much one has, one is dependent on that cheque coming in in October, with the balance at Christmas, which will only serve to pay the bills from the previous year in many cases.</p>  <p>  I would like to compliment the Irish Grain Growers Association, which took the lead immediately after we published the report.  It organised a meeting of tillage farmers from the south east.  It invited Michael Hoey from Country Crest, who has been the leader of a movement to get the sugar industry going again in Ireland.  He is hugely ambitious and enthusiastic about it.  He attended that particular meeting and made a very valuable contribution, in my opinion, outlining exactly what would be required.  He said that it would be up to the farmers to come along and make an input to ensure that such a move would be possible in the future.  I believe it is worth looking again in detail at the proposal from a number of years ago that the sugar industry be re-established in Ireland.  A review was carried out by the previous agriculture committee, which Deputy Penrose was on about five or six years ago.  Times have changed and we should take another detailed look at that review and establish whether it would be a viable prospect or, indeed, investigate what would be required to make it a viable prospect.  It could add huge value to the tillage sector going forward.</p>  <p>  One of the growth areas in the past number of years has been the growth of the local distilleries and local breweries.  There are two in my constituency, namely, Hara's Brewery, which is a worldwide business at this stage, and Walsh's Whiskey Distillery, which invested &euro;25 million in a new distillery in Carlow and is exporting to 45 or 50 different countries around the world.  That is hugely beneficial to the local community, and it has to have a knock-on effect on corn and barley growing locally.  That has to be supported going forward.  The number of tillage farmers - 7,000, as I said - cannot be allowed to shrink any further.  There have to be incentives built into tillage farming.  It has to be attractive for the young farmer today who comes out of agricultural college to go home to a tillage farm.  Tillage farmers have to work together with suckler and diary farmers.  They can work hand in hand.  The tillage sector is more seasonable, and there is a possibility for the tillage farmer to help out suckler and diary farms and potentially generate extra income.</p>  <p>  This has been a worthwhile exercise and I would like to compliment all those who made contributions to the report.  For the record, I thank the Irish Grain Growers Association, Irish Farmers Association, Teagasc, the Alcohol and Beverage Federation of Ireland, the Irish Organic Farmers and Growers Association, the Science Foundation of Ireland, Boortmalt and Minchmalt, which made submissions to the report and contributions to the hearings we had.  I also thank the members of the committee who put a lot of work into the report.  The committee works hard and does not normally get much recognition.  The committees in general do a large amount of valuable work.  This report can be a stepping stone for the future of the tillage sector.  It was not put together so that it would gather dust on a shelf in the Department.  I urge the Ministers to ensure that as many of the recommendations in this report as possible are implemented, and as soon as possible.</p></speech>
