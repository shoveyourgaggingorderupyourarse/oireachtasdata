    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-23a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1551" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="10:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300003#A00200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I will be sharing time with Deputy Nash.  I am very proud to propose this Bill to the House as a member of the Labour Party.  This party and the labour movement were founded to protect workers and what is more important in a pandemic and health crisis?  What greater action can the State take to protect workers during this pandemic only to ensure there is statutory sick pay for all?  Sick pay is required in a health crisis.</p>  <p>  It may surprise many people in this country that we are one of only five European Union countries without statutory sick pay.  We live in a low-tax and low-pay economy.  As has been outlined by my colleague, Deputy Nash, on a number of occasions, 23% of Irish workers are in a bracket of statistical low pay, according to the OECD.  Approximately 40% of workers under the age of 30 are in insecure work and who is most at risk of illness and needs sick pay more than those who are in low pay or insecure work?</p>  <p>  These people include workers in meat factories, childcare workers, contract cleaners and front-line staff in retail and hospitality, as well as agency staff in our health service.  All these workers are holding our country together on the front line and all of them, at different stages, have gotten rounds of applause and plaudits from this House.  Not all of them get sick pay.</p>  <p>  We can think of the worry and anxiety experienced by a person waking up with symptoms of illness and who is genuinely concerned about infecting others and about his or her own health but who must balance this with the fact that he or she might not get paid if he or she does not go to work.  That is if the person is honest about his or her health.  The person might struggle into work, thus contributing to the problem.  Such a person's biggest problem, however, is low pay, poverty and insecure work.  What are we doing to protect such people?</p>  <p>  All the schools are back, with 1 million children returning this September, which is good.  What if a child is sent home from school because of an outbreak, however, or even a suspected outbreak or because the school has made the decision that a child must go home?  A parent, grandparent or guardian of the child could have to care for the child without any statutory provision for sick pay.</p>  <p>  This Bill is a reasonable suggestion, if not a necessary emergency measure notwithstanding the fact we should have had this provision before now, in the teeth of a health crisis that is deepening and worsening.  In my part of the country and that of Deputy Nash, the statistics are terrifying.  As the numbers of people infected with Covid-19 increase, the supports for individuals are lessening, as we have heard on national radio.</p>  <p>  The Government's response to our move today, meanwhile, was not to reject this Bill out of hand.  We welcome that.  However, the Government is suggesting we should spend six months thinking or talking about the legislation.  In the midst of a pandemic, we do not have six months to talk or think about something as fundamental as sick pay.  We do not have six months.  We could have a vaccine by the time the Government gets around to enacting legislation that would provide statutory sick pay for all workers.</p>  <p>  The Government is at risk of losing public support for its measures.  We are on the brink of losing that support if rationale is not provided and supports are not maintained and if the Government is not seen to be on the side of the people.  </p> <p>It is very difficult for us in public life to see the Low Pay Commission, LPC, advocating a ten cent increase in the minimum wage and to see the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, which is relentless in supporting and advocating for those who are the lowest paid in our economy, having to walk away because that was the best the LPC could come up with.  The Government does not have to accept the commission's recommendation in this regard.</p> <p> Let us turn our attention to those who are having that conversation in their own heads, that wrangle in their own minds, that horrible discussion with themselves.  Do they go to work knowing that they are not well or do they do the right thing, in line with the restrictions relating to the pandemic, knowing that they are going to be out of pocket and that it will be harder for them to pay their rent and their bills and feed their children?  There are also situations where parents, grandparents or guardians who have to look after sick children will be out of pocket.  My very clear message to the Government is that, in a pandemic and a health crisis, the most basic provision that politics, Parliament and Government can provide is statutory sick pay.  This pandemic has ripped open all of the problems in Irish society.  It has identified major problems with our society, but a crisis is an opportunity to fix issues.  If Ireland is an outlier and has a low-pay economy, we should do something about that.  If we do not have statutory sick pay, unlike 22 other EU countries, we should also do something about that.  I believe the Cabinet agrees that we should do something about it.  The argument is not whether we should do something about it but whether we should do it today, this week, next week - when the vote is taken - or in six months' time.  We do not have six months in the middle of a pandemic.</p> <p> We are hopeful of Opposition support for the Bill.  We are also hopeful of Government support for it.  We hope that the Government will move from a position of talking, assessing and negotiating, to one of this Parliament collectively saying to the people of Ireland that in a pandemic sick pay is a basic provision that any decent democracy and Government should provide.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-23a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1599" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="10:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300004#B00200"><p>The Minister will remember the years between 2011 and 2016 very well and the oft-quoted mantra of the then Taoiseach, Enda Kenny.  Was it a bit of virtue signalling and not a mantra, as the current T&aacute;naiste might say?  Enda Kenny wanted to make Ireland the best small country in the world in which to do business.  I always countered that assertion by saying that we should also make this country the best small country in the world in which to work, but, manifestly, it is not and nowhere is this more evident than in the State's failure to make provision for a legal right to statutory sick pay.  Sick pay is not an extravagance or a luxury and neither is it something that workers should have to beg for or to go, cap in hand, to their employer to receive.</p>  <p>  We pride ourselves on being a progressive, liberal, open and tolerant country and society, an outward-looking place.  We have shed our inward-looking past, our introversion.  There is nobody better for wrapping the progressive flag around himself than the T&aacute;naiste and leader of Fine Gael.  Progressive countries do not deny hard working people a decent cushion when they fall ill but Ireland has always done so.  This needs to change and quickly.  We have had reams of emergency legislation pass through these Houses in recent months in response to an unprecedented pandemic and to the economic fallout from this public health crisis.  Eye-watering sums of money have been paid out in business supports without any conditions attached whatsoever.  Enormous sums of money have been allocated to make sure that people receive reasonable pay packets at a very difficult time and to ensure that they remain linked with their employers.  We have seen the parking of the right of a worker who has been temporarily laid off to access redundancy.  However, not a single attempt has been made by this Government to address a massive gap in our worker protection system by legislating for the legal right to sick pay.</p>  <p>  It is an objective fact that this Government's commitment to review the position would simply not have arisen were it not for the fact that the Labour Party decided to propose this urgent legislation.  By virtue of that commitment, in fairness to the Government, it has conceded that this is a gap which needs to be addressed.  However, the matter is so urgent that we cannot wait a further six months to hear the outcome of a review and then another few months until legislation is in place to protect the workers that I, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and our Labour Party colleagues want to protect today.</p>  <p>  In health and financial terms, the Covid-19 pandemic has hit the poorest in our society hardest.  This is true when it comes to the risks that have to be taken by those who decide that they have to go to work even though they may have symptoms of or may have Covid-19.  It is also true that those most impacted are those who are among the lowest paid in Ireland, as my colleague outlined.  Shop workers, food service workers and others who are paid the lowest permissible rate of pay in this country woke up this morning to a kick in the stomach, frankly.  They will have been dismayed to learn that the most many of them can expect to earn next year is an extra ten cent per hour on top of what is already a meagre salary.  These workers cannot eat applause.  A candle in the window will not warm them and it will not help them to pay their rent.  The Minister will tell the House that the LPC is an independent body.  She is right - it is independent in its deliberations and in terms of its recommendations and that is appropriate.  It was set up to advise the Government and not to make a decision for the Minister and her colleagues.  In terms of the minimum wage, the buck stops with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Varadkar.  If so minded, he and his Cabinet colleagues do not have to accept the recommendation of the commission.  This year, the Government has more skin in the game than ever because the State is providing massive subsidies to support wages through the wage subsidy scheme, to the tune of over &euro;2 billion before the scheme ends in March 2021.  The Government has a role in terms of directing how that money is spent and in terms of subsidising and supporting the lowest paid workers in this country through an unprecedentedly difficult challenge.</p>  <p>  Will the Government put its money where its applause is and provide for a meaningful and reasonable increase to the national minimum wage?  The Government must put a lot of thought into the position of the LPC.  It is such an important institutional framework and bulwark against the scourge of low pay in this country and it needs to work.  The Government needs to reflect on how it can make the LPC work in the context of the difficult situation this country faces.  We have heard the case made by ICTU and those representing working people on the LPC for the kinds of increases that should be proposed and considered this year.  They are reasonable, rational, fair and objective.  How can the Government possibly argue on the one hand that public sector workers, Deputies included, will receive a 2% pay increase in October while, on the other, state that the lowest paid workers in this country are not deserving of a miserable increase of 20 cent per hour, which is what a 2% increase would represent?  The Government must reflect on its attitude to those who are on low pay.  Applause is all well and good.  Tea and sympathy is all well and good but it will not pay the rent or the bills and will not heat a house during a difficult winter.</p> <p>I look forward to the Minister's response.  I apologise that I will not be in the House to hear it as I have a long-standing commitment to speak at a TASC event for the remainder of the morning.  I mean no disrespect to her. </p></speech>

The Government has put in place a broad range of measures, which are specifically designed to support people in this time of crisis whether because they have lost their jobs or they are sick.  </p><p>On sickness, we have put in place a special arrangement for an enhanced Covid-19 rate of illness benefit of &euro;350.  Payment is made where an employee or self-employed person is diagnosed with Covid or is a probable source of infection.  Significantly, payment is made from the first day of illness so there are no waiting days.  Payment is for two weeks for a person who is a probably risk of infection and up to ten weeks for those diagnosed with Covid-19.  The Government has extended the enhanced Covid illness benefit payment of &euro;350 per week until the end of March 2021.  It is important that employees and the self-employed comply with public health advice to self-isolate where appropriate while having their income protected to the greatest extent possible.  This is essential to limit and slow down the spread of the virus.  My Department will spend an estimated &euro;599 million on illness benefit payments alone in 2020.  </p><p>The background to a scheme of statutory sick pay revolves around two key issues, namely cost to employers and improvements to the working conditions of employees.  In Ireland, sick leave forms part of the terms and conditions of employment contracts, offered voluntarily by employers to their employees, taking into account the financial and other resources of the business.  The proposal in the Bill is to move away from the voluntary nature of sick pay and to instead make it a compulsory part of the terms and conditions of all employment contracts.  In discussing statutory sick pay, I am conscious of the need to balance the positive aspects of statutory sick pay against the pressures being faced by employers, particularly small businesses, as a result of Covid-19.  While I acknowledge the Bill is well intentioned, we need to be conscious of the impact of the proposals for employers at a time many of them are struggling.  It is important to point out that proposals for statutory sick pay were discussed extensively in the past.  In 2012, the then Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Joan Burton of the Labour Party, examined this issue in some detail but did not proceed.  I understand there was substantial consultation with employer representative bodies, sectoral bodies and trade unions at the time by the Minister on how a statutory sick pay scheme might work.  In fairness, 2012 was in the midst of a recession and was also a very difficult time for businesses.  Ultimately, because of the concerns expressed in terms of the potential impact on businesses at a time they were struggling, it was decided not to proceed with the proposal for statutory sick pay.Its ironic that we are now talking about statutory sick pay again today at a time businesses are again facing huge challenges.</p><p>This is not a simple matter and the fact that it crosses over a number of Departments demonstrates that.  There is no doubt that the idea of statutory sick pay is worthy of examination, but it is also one that raises very significant economic and administrative challenges.  Under the Bill, the rate of sick pay is proposed to be the same as the employee&rsquo;s earnings for a full six weeks.  In the past when this was discussed, a period of two weeks had been mentioned and the cost of that would be more manageable from a small business perspective.  </p><p>There are issues that would need to be addressed before the Government could make a decision on whether to introduce a scheme of statutory sick pay such as the duration of payment, the rate of payment, how those who would not qualify for statutory sick pay would be dealt with, and how such a scheme would be enforced and monitored. </p><p>As eight years have passed since statutory sick pay was last analysed, the idea certainly merits detailed reconsideration.  This would involve consultation across several Departments, as well as the social partners, and it requires informed financial estimates to measure its viability.  For that reason, the Government proposes that the Bill be deferred for six months to allow the necessary time for full discussion and examination of all of these issues.</p><p>If anyone reads the T&aacute;naiste's contribution in <i>The Irish Times</i>today, it is very clear that the Government does want to act on this but, in doing so, we need to be cognisant of the impact on small businesses.  Given the significant challenges facing SMEs, it would be wrong to impose this on them overnight without meaningful consultation.  We will now commence engagement with employers and unions and come back to this House when all of the issues have been considered in full.  I look forward to working with Deputies on this.  In the meantime, the Government will continue to provide support through the enhanced Covid illness benefit of &euro;350 per week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-23a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="10:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300005#C00300"><p>The last seven months has been a challenging time for everyone.  We have all been asked to play our part, to stay apart, to wear masks, to wash our hands and to isolate when we display symptoms.  Covid-19 continues to have significant impacts on all of us, and on children, as 1 million of them go back to school this month, and working parents.  Many families are experiencing significant stress due to the unavailability of family support, and in situations where a child's school or childcare provider is closed due because a child or children have tested positive for the virus.  I have dealt with people this week on that exact issue.  I am extremely sympathetic to these families, and acknowledge the challenges that working parents and employees face, and, unfortunately, will likely face in the months ahead as we learn to live with Covid-19 restrictions.</p><p>The previous Government acted quickly when Covid-19 first emerged and since March, we have implemented measures to support people, households, workers and businesses impacted by Covid.  These include unprecedented levels of emergency income support measures for households and workers.  We have also ensured that all workers who are certified by a doctor as diagnosed with, or suspected as having Covid, awaiting a test result, or isolating because of a close contact with Covid are entitled to the Covid-19 enhanced illness benefit, which is &euro;350 a week for up to 10 weeks.</p><p>However, as the T&aacute;naiste acknowledged in an article in <i>The Irish Times </i>this morning, Ireland is one of a small number of wealthy countries in which there is no statutory obligation on all employers to provide sick pay, that is, a scheme whereby all employers must, by law, pay employees who are unable to work because of an illness.  This needs to change and we fully acknowledge and accept that.  The T&aacute;naiste confirmed that discussions with unions and employers will get under way immediately.  </p><p>I welcome the Labour Party Bill as an important contribution to the debate in this area.  My colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, has dealt with the areas of the Bill relating to her Department.  I will deal with the areas of the Bill that are currently the responsibility of the Department of Justice and Equality, but which will shortly move to the Department of Children.  The Bill calls for an extension of <i>force majeure </i>parental leave where a child's school or childcare provider is closed due to an outbreak of Covid-19.  The House will be aware that <i>force majeure</i>leave is a form of paid leave provided for under the Parental Leave Act 1988 and the Parental Leave (Amendment) Act 2006.  It is intended to provide for short periods of leave for urgent family situations where a close family member is ill or has been injured.  The maximum amount of leave allowable is three days in any 12-month period or five days in a 36-month period.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge from the outset that it is probable that if an employee suspects their child has Covid-19, the employer may not want that employee to attend the workplace until clarity has been brought.  I fully accept this, especially having spoken to families during the week.  However, acknowledging that and the intention of the Bill, there are several issues with it that need further consideration.</p><p><i>Force majeure</i>leave applies in emergencies when an employee must deal with an urgent family crisis.  The proposed legislation, however, would place it on a more long-term footing similar to other family leave but without considering the necessity for some short notice period.  That would need to be looked at.  The Bill does not take account of possible working from home arrangements that may be in place and this would need to be looked at further.</p><p>The Government's position that the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation will commence a consultation with unions, employees and employers is the correct approach.  It will ensure we can give proper consideration to reforming Ireland's statutory sick pay laws and any related change to illness benefit.</p> <p>It will allow research into the extent of the problems identified by the Bill and will allow for full evaluation of the costs.  Whether intentional or not, it appear the Bill would place on employers, and especially our SMEs that have been severely hit by Covid-19, most, if not all, of the costs of these proposals at a time when they are struggling to keep their doors open and their employees in jobs.</p> <p> If we can get this right, it will reform the State's sick pay laws and any related illness benefit funded by PRSI.  The Government is committed to doing so, to supporting working parents and to developing solutions that suit their needs.  I look forward to discussions with unions, employers and employees getting under way as soon as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-23a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1620" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="10:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300006#D00200"><p>I am very proud to support the Labour Party's Bill.  I believe that sick pay is a moral imperative.  It was a moral imperative before Covid-19 but it is absolutely one now.  While we can look back to say, &quot;Why was this not done earlier?&quot;, we can do it now.  We are not reinventing the wheel.  Despite the T&aacute;naiste's comments in <i>The Irish Times</i>today, as long as these provisions are not enacted, the lack of statutory sick pay will remain a fundamental weakness in our all-out fight to defeat this awful virus.  As colleagues said, Ireland is the outlier on this issue.  This issue is being addressed in 22 nations of the European Union and is being legislated for.  It is not rocket science.  There are no fundamental issues that cannot be addressed during the debate on Committee Stage and as the measures pass through the Houses, if they need to be corrected.</p><p>Ireland is among the small minority of five EU nations yet to provide for statutory sick pay.  Work is a bargain between employer and employee.  In my judgment, the bargain goes well beyond a transactional arrangement to simply provide an agreed amount of cash for hours worked.  There is a bond.  In return for a person's work and labour, if that person becomes ill, surely the responsible employer will wish to support that employee and loyal worker to ensure he or she is provided for and can come speedily back to work.</p><p>The Government amendment I read last night is a device we have seen previously.  When a Government has no moral argument to make against a proposal, it seeks to kick it down the road.  The last time I remember this device being used was when I introduced the Labour Party's Civil Unions Bill 2006.  Members might recall that this Bill was to recognise same-sex civil partnerships.  It was as far as we could go at that time, pending constitutional change.  We made the argument that there was no counterargument with any substance at the time.  Because the Government of the day was bereft of any argument to oppose the Bill and were politically afraid to defeat the Bill, it tabled a delaying amendment, crafted exactly like the amendment presented yesterday.  The need for these measures is now.</p><p>There is a requirement for the protection of workers in this regard.  I listened to the sympathy expressed by the Minister for Justice and Equality but sympathy is of little value to the people who have contacted her and who have contacted my office.  These are families, for example, who have a sick child and whose employer wants them to stay away from work.  They need a statutory buffer to ensure basic household needs are met as they do the right thing and so there is not incredible pressure of them to go into work when they might extend the life of the virus and infecting their work colleagues.  That is not what we need now.  The requirement for this legal and new right, enjoyed by most citizens in the European Union, is now.</p><p>I ask the Government to reconsider what I regard as a cynical amendment, and to allow the Bill to pass Second Stage this week in order that we can tease out any concerns and have any bilateral discussions that are required on Committee Stage, before the Bill becomes law having passed through this House and the Seanad.  Let us please support this important and vital measure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-23a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1514" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="10:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300006#D00300"><p>I support the my party's Bill.  Unlike most other European countries, Irish workers have no legal right to be paid by their employer if absent from work because of illness.  Whether to pay sick pay is entirely the decision of an employer.  There is no legal obligation to do so.  Dr. Ronan Glynn has spoken on this issue and said that NPHET had recommended to the Government that "whatever measures need to be put in place" should be put into place to ensure that workers who are sick can afford to not attend work.  Dr. Glynn effectively said that the introduction of sick pay was important to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and recommended the Government to take action several weeks ago.  So far, this Government has done nothing except to say that it will have a consultation process, which the Minister spoke to earlier.</p>  <p>  While many unions have delivered sick pay arrangements for their members through collective bargaining agreements, workers in non-unionised jobs in the private sector can be forced to continue to work while sick or else they must rely upon social welfare.  The enhanced Covid-19 illness benefit only provides &euro;350 per week, so if a person is earning more than this but is struggling financially, he or she may be tempted to continue to work while sick with Covid-19.  The issues experienced in meat factories, which played a big part of the lockdown in counties Kildare, Offaly and Laois, are examples of this problem.  All workers are being asked not to go to work if they are showing symptoms of Covid-19.  An employer, however, is not obliged to pay a worker who cannot come to work because he or she is sick with Covid-19, unless it is part of the contract of employment.  This situation means that some workers who might have symptoms of coronavirus are forced to go to work as they cannot afford not to, thus spreading the virus further.</p>  <p>  Ireland has an illness benefit scheme of &euro;203 per week before tax for full-time PAYE workers, but in my experience as a Deputy, this can be very hard for people to access.  Illness benefit is only paid from the seventh day of illness.  A person must have at least two years of PRSI contributions and must have a certificate of incapacity to work signed by a doctor.  We are all aware of the cost of a GP visit if one does not have a medical card.  A GP visit can cost from between &euro;30 and &euro;70.  Self-employed workers and workers over the age of 66 do not qualify.</p>  <p>  The Labour Party Bill proposes that workers are entitled to six weeks' sick pay at the same rate as annual leave.  According to the WHO, six weeks is the recovery time for a moderate to severe case of Covid-19.  We propose that after six weeks the person would move onto illness benefit.  Employers would pay the first six days of sick pay in its entirety for all workers, but after six days, the employer can claim any illness benefit that would be due to the worker.  To encourage collective bargaining, the draft Bill provides that a collective agreement in the workplace can improve on this.  In the public service, unions have delivered collective bargaining agreements providing sick pay of three months on full pay, followed by three months on half pay, with limits over a four-year rolling period.  This draft Bill is an important protection for workers but is also very important in combatting Covid-19, as the lack of paid sick leave encourages workers who are struggling financially to continue to work even if they are ill, thus spreading the virus further.  The Labour Party considers sick pay to be a basic right that workers in Ireland should have.  We are launching the Bill to give workers the right to sick pay.</p>  <p>  I now turn to the issue of parental leave.</p> <p>As schools have reopened, parents have been in a position to return to work, but the threat of Covid-19 remains.  Many parents will be forced to take unpaid leave for the duration of the school closure, evidence of which we have seen already.  Those who may be struggling financially will find it incredibly difficult to cope if they are forced to take unpaid leave to look after their children.</p> <p> As an extraordinary measure, the Labour Party is proposing paid parental leave when a school or preschool must close or reduce the number of pupils who can attend in order to comply with Government policy to stop the spread of Covid-19.  In such a case, an employee who is the parent or adoptive parent of a child will be entitled to Covid-19 parental leave at full pay for so long as the child is unable to attend the school or preschool and the presence of the employee is required at home to care for the child.</p></speech>

I was a trade union official at the time and I well recall it.  In fact, we managed to stave off the worst of what the Deputy was trying to do, but what public servants were left with was a sick pay scheme that was effectively half of what it was before he entered government.  However, his road to Damascus-type enlightenment is welcome and I thank the Labour Party for introducing the Bill and giving us this opportunity.  It is a timely debate for the House.</p><p>I will take a few seconds of my time to wish Mr. Sam Nolan a special happy birthday today.  He is a stalwart of the Irish trade union movement and the Irish left and a long-time campaigner.  Were he present, he would support a statutory entitlement to sick leave just as he would have opposed the cutting of sick leave for public servants when that was done.</p><p>A number of elements of this legislation merit further consideration and discussion.  The fact that Ireland is an outlier in Europe should cause us to act with the urgency that the Bill calls for, but no Deputy is naive enough to believe that a statutory sick leave scheme can be introduced overnight.  That notwithstanding, there is a real and urgent need for people to be able to take time off without having to fear losing money or being unable to pay their rent, heat their houses or feed their kids.  These are very tangible concerns for people and now is the time for a detailed dialogue as this legislation progresses.  I do not see a need to defer the Bill - we can have a process that involves a detailed dialogue taking place in parallel.</p><p>There are measures that can be introduced in the short term.  For example, <i>force majeure</i>leave can be extended separately.  This would also cover a group that is noticeably absent from this legislation, although I am sure that absence was not the intention when drafting it.  Carers have been left out of the Bill but should be included.  If day services close, then the carer of a person who attends those services will also have to isolate.  It is important that we make this Bill inclusive legislation.  It is also important that we ensure the involvement of the trade union movement, which is central to this issue.</p><p>I express my thanks for the position taken by Ms Patricia King and Mr. Gerry Light this morning in standing up to what some of us in the trade union movement used to call the &quot;Pay Restraint Commission&quot;.  The Low Pay Commission was not delivering for workers and Ms King and Mr. Light were right to walk away from it.  I hope the Government will heed their message and legislate for a decent increase in the minimum wage.</p></speech>

Its timely passing by the House would take immense stress and strain off many working families, in particular working parents who are raising children on their own.  For workers and families, the past six months have been difficult.  The difficulties did not suddenly arise when schools returned.  When the first State-wide restrictions were introduced, I was contacted by a number of parents, mothers in particular, who had children with lifelong illnesses.  They were put in a position of being forced to choose between staying at home with their children and limiting their contacts.  Many used their annual leave at that stage.  They had to choose between staying at home and looking after their children or going to work.</p><p>In many ways, all parents across the State are now on call.  If a parent gets a phone call from a school because his or her child becomes ill or shows symptoms of Covid at school, that parent has to drop everything, walk out the door of his or her job and go to collect his or her child.  I am unsure as to how many jobs there are where parents would be in a position to do that.</p><p>We know of the prevalence of low-paid employment in the State.  According to figures from Social Justice Ireland, there are more than 100,000 people at work but living in poverty.  Last year, nearly &euro;400 million was spent by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection on the working family payment.  That payment essentially tops up poor wages for workers with children.  While the payment is necessary, it signals that none of these parents can afford to take unpaid leave if his or her child becomes sick.  Deprivation levels have increased in the past year, which we know from a Central Statistics Office, CSO, report published this month.  Nearly half of lone parent families are living in deprivation and more than one in five children experiences deprivation.  If someone is living in deprivation and is in work, he or she will not be able to afford to take time off unpaid.</p><p>There have been issues with the illness benefit for some time: it is dependent on PRSI contributions; the self-employed have no access to illness benefit or, indeed, any short-term sick pay; previous cost-cutting measures increased the waiting days from three to six, which made the situation even more difficult; and it is costly for anyone to take illness benefit, given that every time someone attends a doctor for the form, he or she must pay upwards of &euro;30 or &euro;35.</p><p>In the short time the Government has been in office, it has failed parents in failing to extend maternity leave.  I note how in the T&aacute;naiste's letter in today's <i>The Irish Times</i>, he mentioned that enhanced maternity benefit was coming down the road.  We would all like to know what that is.  Instead of extending maternity leave, the Government extended unpaid parental leave.  That eliminates many parents who cannot afford to take such leave.</p><p>While Covid has created difficulties for many workers and families in 2020, it has also taught this Government two immediate lessons: the waiting days for illness benefit are inappropriate and inadequate; and the payment of &euro;203 is inadequate.  The enhanced illness benefit was introduced for this reason and no other.  The Bill presents an opportunity to do the right thing by workers and families.  No worker can wait six months for that.</p></speech>

This will be just as challenging as getting schools open in the first place was.  We have identified clearly that protecting the incomes and jobs of workers and parents is a crucial component.  The reasons for this are obvious.  Parents want to do the right thing by their children, themselves and their children's schools.  In the context of the pandemic, this often means that parents will have to keep their children at home if they are symptomatic or if either a child or parent tests positive or is connected to a positive case by way of a close contact.  This has obvious implications for workers who might have to take time off.  Cr&egrave;ches and childminders will be off the table as options.  The option of grandparents minding children will often be off the table as well.  As such, many workers will have no protection.  They will have to take unpaid leave, particularly if this happens more than once.  Many employers will be reasonable and flexible and some workers may have the option of using leave, but others will not have that protection.</p>  <p>  In most developed countries, sick pay has been extended during the pandemic to cover such circumstances.</p> <p>In most developed countries, they have a statutory sick pay scheme.  Imagine that.  It is a disgrace that Ireland has such desperately poor protections for workers in terms of sick pay.  Should parents be obliged to stay at home with children, the Government must act to protect their incomes and jobs.  Keeping the virus out of schools necessarily means supporting parents to do the right thing and keeping symptomatic children home.  That is why Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed a significant extension of emergency leave and why Sinn F&eacute;in is supporting this legislation and I commend the Labour Party on bringing it forward.  The Government's approach to this, proposing a delay of six months, is lamentable.  It would be laughable if it were not so serious.  We do not have six months to play around with.  I know there are details in this regard that must be worked out but that is why we have Committee Stage hearings.  That is the forum in which to navigate the complexities of the detail of this legislation.  It can be done and this is just a delaying tactic in order that the Government does not have to vote this down, which was probably its first impulse.</p> <p> It is not only Sinn F&eacute;in that has identified protecting the income workers as a key element to protecting workers and ensuring schools can remain open.  None other than the acting Chief Medical Officer, CMO, Dr. Ronan Glynn, has affirmed this position.  He noted that people who need to self-isolate should have no fear about their employment and stated "Economic circumstances simply should not be a barrier to people coming forward and getting tested."  Schools are open, which is good, but to keep them open safely and sustainably, the Government needs to do a number of things.  It needs to reduce class sizes, introduce rapid testing and remove the fears of parents as to how they will cope if their children fall sick.  It is unconscionable that parents should fear being unable to pay the bills because they have to keep children at home and take unpaid time off.  The same principle applies to workers across the board and many workers can scarcely afford to call in sick, which we have seen in the meat factories and so on.  The Government should give parents and workers security and confidence and should protect their incomes and jobs.  It is a crucial and strategic part of the fight against the pandemic.</p></speech>

I am pleased to be able to speak on this Bill and offer my support to it.</p><p>As has been previously mentioned and will be well known to many who have the experience, Ireland is an outlier in terms of sick pay within the European Union.  There is little to no legal right to sick pay here.  It is instead left to the discretion of the employer, which means many workers, particularly those in poorly paid and non-unionised roles, do not have access to sick pay.  I heard this on the doorsteps in Shannon in County Clare during the general election campaign.  People were furious as they were at home sick with no pay.  They were asking me who had their backs.</p><p>No lower or middle income household can survive a week with no income.  Unfortunately, it took a major issue like a global pandemic to highlight these issues and force us to make a move on it.  Covid-19 clearly showed us the need to have sick pay as a basic right to workers the length and breadth of this State.  Imagine the contradiction of a Government Minister telling people who are barely earning enough to get by that if they feel a bit unwell, they should not attend work.  I can tell Members that such a decision is not taken easily when one is already struggling to raise a family or keep food in the fridge.  Let us say this person does not go to work and loses a day's pay.  This could mean he or she goes without fuel in the winter, for example, or without several meals throughout the week.  It could also affect his or her children in terms of extra tuition or any hobby or outlet they may have.  It has a direct effect on people's well-being.</p><p>Section 3 of this Bill deals with the issues around <i>force majeure</i>and the right for a parent to take leave if a child is out sick from school.  This is a no-brainer, especially in a time like now with Covid-19.  I have received emails from workers, including front-line workers in University Hospital Limerick, for example, who are being told they may have to restrict their children's movements due to suspected close contacts.  These parents are being obliged to stay at home, as we are all in this together, yet still they are doing so without any pay.  We need to get a grip on reality, come back down to earth and deal with the real issues facing workers and parents.  We need to show we can stand with the workers and make sick pay a basic right, while supporting small businesses that may need such support.  We need to ensure that a working group is established that will look at all the factors in ensuring that a proper workable solution is found to the benefit of workers and their employers.  This steering group must include representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the wider trade union movement to ensure the voice of workers is heard.  I call on all Deputies in this House to support this Bill.</p></speech>

I ask all voters to pay particular attention to those who vote against this Bill.  Those Deputies who claim to be champions of workers' rights will be exposed as frauds in the way they vote on this Bill, in the same way that they were exposed by their response to the recent motions relating to the Debenhams workers.  These are workers who I supported in Newbridge yesterday evening after the liquidator sent in a crew to pack up stock for export to England.</p><p>We are long overdue a statutory sick pay scheme in Ireland.  The European picture varies greatly, from &euro;38 a week in England, all the way up to &euro;875 in Switzerland.  In fact, the average worker across Europe receives 65% of his or her salary as pay during a week of sick leave.  In Ireland, he or she receives nothing.  Norway, Luxembourg, Germany, Austria, Malta, Croatia and Belgium pay out 100% of workers' wages.</p><p>Ensuring workers are well at work is a basic issue of safety and simply the right thing to do.  When workers are unwell, they need to rest to recover.  When sick workers stay at home, they reduce the spread of infection and the risk of workplace accidents and they keep others safe.  We only have to look at the meat factories to see the effect that the absence of sick pay had on Covid-19 cases.  We have heard of workers swigging Calpol before going to work in an effort to keep their temperatures down, i order that they could continue to earn money to provide for their families.</p><p>This Bill also calls for the extension of <i>force majeure</i>leave for parents and workers who will have to take time off work to look after children who must isolate due to Covid-19.  This is something for which Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling in recent months.  We cannot have a situation where cases of Covid-19 arise in schools and parents are left taking unpaid leave to look after their self-isolating children.  We need this matter clarified for parents and this Bill does exactly that.</p></speech>

We hope the Government will both support it and ensure its speedy progression and we thank the Labour Party for bringing the Bill forward.  It addresses deficiencies in existing workers' rights and provides additional, much-needed protection during a pandemic.  Bills like this must be a point of unity during the Covid-19 crisis.</p>  <p>  Workers in this country have no entitlement to sick pay.  It is essentially a voluntary measure, which thankfully many employers provide.  However, there are also whole sectors that can afford it and choose not to give people the dignity of it, including the State.  Sick pay should be a basic entitlement and it should not be a matter for debate.  Ireland is an outlier in a European context.  In economically comparable countries, sick leave is a given and an entitlement.  We need to address this deficiency here.</p>  <p>  Sick pay is less likely in precarious work environments, in more physically demanding industries and in the ever-increasing gig economy.  This leaves people in extremely vulnerable positions.  The absence of proper support for older people, including sick leave, can push them out of the workforce early.  The European Commission&rsquo;s Social Protection Committee&rsquo;s review on sickness benefits highlighted the gendered aspects of sick pay.  On average, women take more short-term sick leave, due to factors such as part-time work, sick leave related to pregnancy and birth and the demands of work in the home and care for children.  As a result, the lack of sick pay in Ireland disproportionately affects women.</p>  <p>  This Bill is not only a social and economic consideration during a pandemic but it is also a public health consideration.  What happens when a low-paid worker gets sick?  What happens when a mother struggling to pay for her children&rsquo;s education falls ill or when a father, unsure if he can pay next month&rsquo;s rent, feels unwell?  We all know what happens.  They still go to work because they do not have a choice.  Without sick pay, we are directly incentivising people to go to work sick.  This is ridiculous at the best of times but during a pandemic, it is scandalous.  Presenteeism, that is, going to work while being in poor health, is recognised as being an increasing challenge in European workplaces that is costing businesses and social welfare systems due to the spread of illness.  Sick pay is a necessary security blanket for people.</p><p><i>11 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>For businesses, it is an assurance that ill employees will stay at home.  During a pandemic, it is an essential safety net for everyone, especially front-line workers.  Sick pay is a basic public health policy.  It not only helps protect and improve individual and communal health, which leads to a better and more productive society, it also means considerable savings for our overstretched hospitals.  This point cannot be emphasised enough during a global pandemic.</p> <p> An OECD paper on policy responses to coronavirus shows that expansions to paid sick leave play "a key role in protecting incomes, health and jobs during a health-driven labour market crisis" and that paid sick leave can be a particularly effective tool to tackle the disease "as part of a rigorous testing, tracking, tracing and isolating strategy".  Research from the US shows that the introduction of sick pay in a region is associated with a decreased rate of contagious flu-like disease.</p> <p> Meat plants, to which several of my colleagues have referred, are a clear example of the need for sick pay.  There have been over 1,500 cases and more than 30 clusters within meat plants to date, with some clusters currently active.  Some workers have a choice between going to work with symptoms of Covid and not getting paid.  The sector is refusing to engage in an industry-wide agreement on sick pay.  It is essential that this Bill passes in order to address this disgraceful treatment of workers in a sector that continues to be one of the largest threats to public health.</p> <p> The granting of paid leave to care for a child who has, or potentially has, Covid-19 is not only a humane response but a good public health measure.  This will allow people to take the time necessary to take care of their families and isolate if needed.</p> <p> Concerns will rightly be raised about the costs of these measures for small businesses and self-employed people.  However, many small and family run businesses that I know in west Cork already provide sick pay and parental leave to employees.  These enterprises, which are the backbone of the rural economy, are excellent employers and this Bill helps create a level playing field by requiring larger employers to do the right thing too.  The State also needs to step in to provide comparable measures for the self-employed, especially for the farming and the fishing communities, which should have sick pay and parental leave as well as injury and bereavement support.  If the Government is serious about helping rural Ireland, these forms of paid leave should be introduced.</p> <p> This Bill is about public health and the fair treatment of workers.  Similarly to the Social Democrats workers' rights motion and the Sinn F&eacute;in motion to extend maternity leave in July, both of which were hollowed out through Government amendments, this Bill responds to the needs of ordinary people during a pandemic.  The Government needs to stop routinely ignoring Opposition motions if we are all to work together during this pandemic.  This Bill is about people in precarious employment, many of them on the front line, who do vital work but who are denied sick pay.  If media reports are correct, the Government intends to send this legislation to consultation with unions and employers' groups to report back in six months.  This stalling tactic puts public health at risk and allows very profitable sectors and the State to continue to deny people basic entitlements.  This is about tackling the spread of Covid-19.  The Government has been criticised for ambiguities and inaction before.  Please do not let this be another issue left unaddressed.  Sick pay is essential and is necessary now. </p></speech>

However, we will seek to amend and strengthen its provisions and ensure there is a legal, mandatory statutory sick pay scheme for all workers in this country.  The Government amendment spins it that the Government will legislate for a sick pay scheme but that it will take time.  I do not believe a word of that.  I have absolutely no faith that Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael or the Green Party can be trusted to return to this issue in six months.  The Covid crisis has shown us the effects of allowing employers to evade the responsibility of providing a sick pay scheme, especially in the meat plants.  It is literally a matter of life and death for these workers, who cannot wait.</p>  <p>  When it comes to the rights of workers and entitlements, Ireland is the sick man of Europe and we have been for decades.  Compared to other countries like France, Germany, Finland and Sweden, we are at the bottom of the table for basic rights and the provision of entitlements and public services, with less annual leave, fewer public holidays and less full-paid maternity and paternity leave.  Workers have no legal right to join a trade union and have it recognised or negotiated with by their employer.  We have constitutional rights which protect property, privilege and wealth over the provision of public goods.  We pretend that employers and workers are equal in position and power.  It is incredible that the State, through its unwillingness to tackle bogus self-employment, ensures the social fund used to pay for workers' benefits is deliberately defrauded on a grand scale day in, day out, while our former Taoiseach wages war on welfare.  He and his Government were happy to allow corporate cheats to cheat us all.  This is largely a result of political choices made in this House and the weakness of the party that claims to represent workers and to be the party of Connolly and the trade union movement. </p>  <p>  It is an outstanding irony that this Bill was brought here in a flurry of PR releases and media grandstanding by the Labour Party.  It must hope or believe that the working class and the trade union movement will have a bout of collective amnesia.  Its memory may be short-term but the hurt and misery it has inflicted on workers and the most vulnerable will not be forgiven or forgotten anytime soon.  It was the Labour Party and a Labour Minister that decided in its last turn in government that workers should be forced to wait six days before they received any sick pay from the State.  The Labour Party extended those waiting days.  The period without State benefit was extended from three to six days with no compulsion on employers to fill the gap.  One would wonder what the party of Connolly thought workers were supposed to do for six days with no income.  The Labour Party adopted this policy, as in so many areas, in the belief that workers must wait.  It only took a global pandemic to reverse that particular cut brought in by the Labour Party, though I am sure the current Administration will try to revert back to that position as soon as it gets the chance.</p>  <p>  Many a public sector worker will have an ironic laugh at the fact that the Labour Party is now championing a mandatory sick pay scheme.  The Labour Party attacked and radically overhauled the sick pay scheme available to public servants, teachers, nurses, many of our front-line workers and those in the Civil Service.  It closed the door on new recruits having the same rights and entitlements to sick pay in the public service that had existed previously.  It shamefully joined the attacks on pension entitlements of public sector workers and the campaign to divide the public and private sectors.  It rode in with plans to extend the age at which workers could get the State pension and changed the bands on the amount workers could expect to live on when they retired.  For this, it supported the FEMPI legislation that represented the greatest assault on trade union collective bargaining in the history of the State.  Now the Labour Party has moved a Bill to make sick pay mandatory.  That is very good indeed, but it is going to have to move much more to convince workers and the most vulnerable in this country that it is anything other than a mudguard for the parties of the bosses and employers in this State. </p></speech>

It is attempting to kick this issue down the road and is hoping that Covid, and the struggle for workers' rights which is connected to the struggle against Covid, disappears in some way.  We simply cannot tolerate an ongoing situation where meat plant workers, nursing home workers and care workers of all sorts with Covid symptoms have to show up to work despite being sick because they cannot afford to lose a day's pay.  It is simply not acceptable that workers in Ireland have no guaranteed right to sick pay whatsoever while almost all other European countries ensure this is a right.  In Germany, workers get six weeks' sick pay but in many other countries they have even better rights.  In Norway they get a full year.  In the Netherlands, bosses are required to cover sick leave for up to two years with supports for small businesses that cannot afford to do so.  We can and should do the same here.  The meat plant workers epitomise the problem.  Despite the pandemic, the beef barons are still denying sick pay to 6,000 meat factory workers and the Government is letting them away with it.  We need to end that situation now.</p>  <p>  I will speak briefly about the proposals for parental leave.  Working parents have been made shoulder the burden of the fight against Covid with very little support from the Government.  When the schools were closed, parents, and women in particular, were the ones who had to pick up the slack, working full-time and double-jobbing with no entitlement to paid parental leave.  With Covid outbreaks now in some schools and some children having to stay home again, we need to support parents by extending paid parental leave.  If a child cannot go to school because he or she has symptoms or the class or school is closed, parents should be entitled to leave from work to stay home if needed.  That is the very least they should be able to expect.</p></speech>

Workers in HSE nursing homes are entitled to sick pay.  If they present with Covid symptoms, they can quarantine with a guarantee of full pay.</p> <p>They are under no economic pressure to go to work.  Only 20% of nursing homes in the State, however, are HSE nursing homes; the other 80% are privately owned.  There is no legal obligation on those employers to provide sick pay schemes.  When the chief executive of Nursing Homes Ireland, Tadhg Daly, came before the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response some months ago, he was unable to tell me how many private nursing homes operated sick pay schemes or what percentage did so.  There are clearly many workers in private nursing homes - I suspect a majority, and possibly a large one - who cannot quarantine with a guaranteed decent income if they come down with Covid symptoms.  They are under real economic pressure to go to work.  <br/><br/>That is pure madness, as it is for the Government to try to postpone the prospect of any action on this for six months.  According to SIPTU, 90% of meat plant workers are not in sick pay schemes.  One of the Ministers of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Senator Hackett, stated this was unacceptable and told the <i>Sunday Independent</i>last month that these workers deserve dignity, respect and the full protection of the State.  Today her Green Party colleagues are lining up alongside Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, trying to prevent any action on this issue for six months.  What hypocrisy this is.  Is it not a really dangerous path to go down as the second wave begins to build in this country?</p></speech>

The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted and shone a light on the issue of sick pay and the continuation of income for families throughout the country.  The Bill seeks to amend the existing sick pay legislation on the basis that we need to give entitlement to people who cannot attend work on grounds of <i>force majeure</i>or whose children are unable to attend school or preschool services for Covid-19 reasons.  Its principle is very commendable, in that it will maintain income streams for families who otherwise would fear being absent from work or would find themselves in circumstances such as those ably described by other Deputies.  We all accept that.</p><p>We need to protect families in these uncertain times but, at the same time, the question arises as to who will pay for this.  Is it expected that employers, which are currently hanging on by a thread, will have to pay for it?  Small businesses such as those that have been in contact with me over the past six months and that are making decisions daily as to how to keep their doors open and their employees at work cannot now be faced with another cost to business.  They cannot be expected to foot the cost of this.  We all agree the current supports do not bridge the gap; we need to put in more supports.  The small business sector, examples of which we all know throughout the country, employs people, who create the economy.  If we are to frighten such businesses by putting more and more obstructions in their way, we will find that more and more businesses will close.  We need to respect the circumstances of business people, especially those in the small sector.  We can always talk about the beef barons but not every employer is a beef baron or a person full of wealth.  Many people working in business at the moment and employing people are not making any money and are probably not even drawing a wage for themselves.  We need to respect their circumstances too.  If this legislation is to be successful, we need to know that the gap in sick pay benefit will be met by the State.</p><p>I listened with interest earlier to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, stating her intention to talk to employers and trade unions.  That is the proper way to deal with this.  We do not need a knee-jerk reaction whereby we bury more business people.  In the interim, however, we need to ensure that people who are affected by Covid and cannot go to work will be taken care of.  I plead with the Government to ensure that interim measures will be put in place in order that nobody is left without money to put food on the table during these times.</p><p>I reiterate that the main idea of the Bill is commendable but what we need to do is to ensure that people who are suffering are taken into account by the State right now and that any gaps in payment are met by it.  We can look at sick pay benefit into the future after that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-23a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1504" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="11:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300010#H00400"><p>A significant theme is crystallising around how the Government is tackling the Covid-19 crisis.  It is a tale of two countries.  The Covid-19 restrictions are hitting low and middle income workers far more than any other element of society.  Instead of reducing that impact, the Government is rubbing the noses of people in those incomes in it.  There are pay rises for Deputies at the same time as income support cuts for hundreds of thousands of workers who have just lost their jobs.  The Government is spending millions of euro on up to 70 special advisers while, at the same time, cutting income for 200,000 families in various parts of the country.  It is reminiscent of the days of Charlie Haughey, when he was telling people to tighten their belts while, at the same time, he was purchasing Charvet shirts in Paris.  This is a two-tier approach by Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party, and it can also be seen in how they are treating workers.</p>  <p>  The Government has sought to lock down the economy, shut down schools and childcare facilities, and has called on people to suspend their livelihoods and incomes in the battle to stop Covid-19.  It has made these demands but does not want to provide these workers with the necessary supports.  It is absolutely willing to exhibit a demand from citizens but unwilling to support those workers in their time of need.  We have seen it happen with the childcare sector, the entertainment industry, the aviation sector, the events industry, the pub trade and the taxi trade, to name but a few.  Now we are seeing it with workers who are sick or with parents who are unable to go to work because they are unable to care for their children.  At a time of an international pandemic, no one should be punished for falling ill and no parent should be punished for caring for their sick child.</p>  <p>  I welcome the intentions of the Bill and commend the Labour Party on bringing it forward.  If it is the case that a vaccine will not be found for at least a number of years, we need to put a regime in place to allow for sectors of society to function properly while we tackle the virus.  There will be cases of Covid-19 in schools.  Some schools will be closed, as a number have already had to do temporarily.  As such, children will need to be kept at home.  We need to be able to say to parents that they will not suffer a collapse in income if they are minding their children.  They should not have to go in and negotiate with their employer in order that they can go home and have some level of income.  It is incredible what is coming from the Government because the Taoiseach has stated as much, as has the HSE.  They have told people not to go into work if they are experiencing the symptoms of Covid-19.  The Government cannot, however, say that in all honesty to people if it is not going to provide some level of support for them.  Guaranteeing sick pay is the very least that can be done to ensure that people will not go to work and risk spreading Covid-19 around the workplace.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, a key element of the context of the Bill, and one on which I agree with my colleague, Deputy Canney, is that many businesses throughout the country are hanging on by a thread.  Many of them, especially small businesses, would be wiped out if they had by themselves to take on the burden of sick pay.  We call on the Government to step in and ensure there is a floor of necessary supports underneath both workers and those struggling businesses to ensure they can function through this pandemic.</p></speech>

I know the Government is opposing it.  As an employer myself, which I want to declare, I have mixed feelings about it.  It sends all the wrong messages.  What is happening in the country is sickening, with the pandemic and special advisers, including advisers for Ministers of State.  Many are simply not up to the job.  I am not talking about the Minister but many are not up to the job and they do not know what to do, so they need advice on whether to turn right or left or to go forwards or backwards.  It is a pathetic state of affairs to have in the Government in the middle of this pandemic.  One can say that we are all in this together but we are not because Ministers and Ministers of State think they can do what they like.  They are oblivious to what is going on in the real world.  This is the wrong message to send at a time when Dublin is locked down again and the T&aacute;naiste has gone into isolation.  There are many mixed messages.  There is a rush to see how people can make headlines.  People are sick and tired of this.</p>  <p>  Small business people cannot afford the scheme in this Bill, so this is why I will more than likely vote against it.  They are good employers and there are tens of thousands of them across the country.  They do their best.  They are at the pin of their collar and beyond it, and we need to recognise that and have Government supports, because we must root out what is going on in the meat industry and other industries, where they are blackguarding and exploiting workers.  We must certainly tackle that.  A small businessman looks after staff, in the main, including with sick pay, and the staff look after the business.  There is a great bond.  We must get Government support like in other European countries that we are told have this.  The Government has to provide Exchequer support to business people for the sick pay scheme.  If we are going to do this and keep piling more bureaucracy and more onerous levies on small employers, we will not have those employers and we will have a worse off country.  The Minister needs to wake up and stop the mixed messages all the time.  This pay increase is disgusting.</p></speech>

Where will the money come from, however?  I register the fact that I am a small employer myself.  Small employers are under fierce pressure.  In my county, we depend on small employers to a great degree.  We do not have oil, gold or diamonds and if we did we would not be allowed to drill for them anyway.  Small employers are struggling with rules and regulations, insurance costs, the cost of Covid rules and the reduced income and trade that most employers have at present, and many struggle to have the cash to pay employees on Friday, with payday coming around quickly.  Trade and business is slow at present.  As well as employees, we must stop to talk about employers too, especially small employers, and we must do as much as possible to help them because they are the people who pay the employees.  We have to work hand in hand with them.  People are missing such things as home help and carers.  I remind Deputy Kelly that the Labour Party cut women's pensions by a third in 2012.  The Labour Party should be looking to restore that and repair the harm it has already done.</p></speech>

It is a complete farce.  They are trying to cod people.  I remind the people of what the Labour Party stood for and did.  When it was in power and had an opportunity, it was disgraceful and did nothing for workers.  It was the party that did away with the death grant for bereaved families.  It hurt ladies in particular who were trying to get a pension when they retired and to this day they are paying a price.  There are people across the country who are paying a price for what the Labour Party did when it went into power and completely forgot who its voting base was.</p>  <p>  It forgot the people in what I would call honourable Labour.  There were great people in the Labour Party.  In the county that I am from, we had good, respectable people, such as the late Michael Moynihan, and Dan Spring, who served on Kerry County Council with our late father, Jackie Healy-Rae.  There were good people in the Labour Party but, my goodness, they are not related to the Labour Party that is in here trying to cod the people with this Bill.</p>  <p>  The Labour Party is saying nothing about the people who create work.  I again want to register that I am a small employer.  The Labour Party knows nothing about work and is here talking about workers' rights.  There is not one person in the Labour Party who paid a person on a Friday evening and they do not give a damn.  They are just trying to be populist and popular, attacking the Government.  We are all genuinely interested in workers and workers' rights, and we want them to be taken care of, but I will not fall for this nonsense from Labour.  When it had a chance, it did nothing for workers.  Do not cod the people.</p></speech>

It is a bit rich of the Labour Party to put this forward today, when it absolutely destroyed women's pensions.  It comes before me in my constituency every week because of the Labour Party's errors and what it did to persecute the women of this country.  It has forgotten that quickly but we have not forgotten it because we have to face it daily and the women who worked hard have to face it, because of disgraceful decisions made by the Labour Party.</p>  <p>  Every employer I know in west Cork wants to do the best by their employees.  Only a foolish Deputy would come in and say that employers in the constituency that he or she represents are not stretched to the limit.  They are stretched to a complete limit at this time and are unable to do any more.  They are doing their best, with Covid-19, to keep the people they have employed.  I am worried that this Bill will add an extra burden to people at this time.  I was at the annual general meeting of the south-west fishermen's co-operative over the weekend.  People there said to me that the obstacles they encounter when trying to employ somebody such as a foreign national on their boat cost them thousands of euro and it takes months to get somebody on the boat to work.  We should look to see how we can simplify that.  It is simplified for meat factories.  It is an issue for larger trawlers in west Cork.  I was with them for most of the day on Saturday and talked with them about the difficulties they are experiencing.  This is a significant difficulty and perhaps an amendment in this regard should be put in this Bill.  For now, we should be careful where we go with this Bill.  We are adding extra stress and difficulties for employers who are doing their best to stay afloat and this pushes them to their limit.</p></speech>

I support this Bill introduced by the Labour Party.  First, I wish to make an observation.  We seem to have two Labour parties in Ireland, the one that we saw in government and the one that we see in opposition.  In 2012, the Labour Party's Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton, began a consultation process on her stated intention to introduce a mandatory sick pay scheme whereby employers would be responsible for the first four weeks of sick pay.  The usual suspects raised objections.  Deputy Coveney, on behalf of Fine Gael, said it would be a burden on business, and of course IBEC and the Small Firms Association objected.  In 2014, the statutory sick pay waiting times were increased from three days to six days.  This made Ireland unique in the EU, with statutory sick pay for the first week of illness being absolutely zilch, with nothing in people's pockets.  That was introduced by Deputy Howlin.  Instead of much-needed reform, we got yet another austerity measure.</p>  <p>  The European Trade Union Confederation has shown in research that sickness benefits were cut by an average of 65% across the EU after the 2008 crash.  Along with the cuts in public services, especially health services, and the outsourcing of community care and nursing homes, these cutbacks have significantly complicated the measures necessary to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>The fact that 80% of workers in meat plants do not have sick pay entitlement was a key factor in the outbreak of Covid in some of those plants.  The lack of sick pay, as well as the danger of losing one's job, is a factor in one in four people not turning up for tests.</p> <p> The widespread use of agency workers in community nursing home care, including workers employed as agency staff in the HSE itself, is also a significant problem.  Again, young workers are most likely to be in precarious employment and in low-paid jobs with virtually no entitlements.  We should look to the example of countries such as Norway, Luxembourg, Austria, Germany and Belgium where a 100% sick pay rate is paid by employers, provided there is a doctor's note, followed by lower payments paid by the State subsequently.</p> <p> Employers in Ireland already benefit from the lowest level of employer PRSI, less than half the EU average.  How can businesses in Europe maintain workers' rights and sick pay but it cannot be done in Ireland?  Passing this Bill would be one of the steps necessary for a comprehensive response to the Covid crisis.  Others would be a restoration of the pandemic unemployment payment and introducing a ban on evictions.  I certainly will support the Bill.</p></speech>

First, it addresses in a real, meaningful and sustainable way issues that workers, parents and guardians are facing around sick and parental leave because of Covid-19, which many of them will continue to face over the next six to 12 months.  Regarding Covid, we have to accept that it may not be one's problem today but it could be tomorrow or next week.  Many people who thought it would never be their problem are facing that issue of paid parental leave today as their children cannot attend school.  This proposal needs to be an integral part of our Covid strategy, which is reasonable and feasible.</p>  <p>  Second, I am aware from my time as a member of the employment and social affairs committee of the European Parliament that Ireland is one of the few countries that does not have legislation in place that guarantees all workers the right to decent levels of sick pay.  Many Members have  spoken about different EU countries that have mandatory sick pay levels in place.</p>  <p>  The one I know best is Belgium where workers are entitled to 30 days at 100% of their wages.  Belgium could hardly be described as a socialist country or dominated by the far left.  In fact, the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, was the former Prime Minister of Belgium and he is a member of the liberals in the European Parliament.  Yet his and previous Belgian Governments ensured that Belgian workers are entitled to 100% of their wages for 30 days if they are sick.  Germany's Chancellor, Angela Merkel, a bastion of the European People's Party, could never be described as fiscally irresponsible.  Yet in Germany, workers are entitled to six weeks at 100% of their wages.  Let us take some of the fiscal hawks, such as the Nordic countries, which keep a tight rein on the public purse.  In Finland, the benefits range from nine days at 100% while in the Netherlands they range from two years at 70%.</p>  <p>  The proposals put forward by the Labour Party are reasonable.  Not by any stretch of the imagination are they in the highest bracket compared to what is in place across the EU.  The Bill recognises, as it is recognised in many other European countries, that workers are social partners.  That means they should be fully entitled to a guarantee of protection if they fall ill or if they need to take time when their children cannot attend school or cr&egrave;ches.  As we speak, many parents are facing that decision this morning while many others do not know if they will face it tomorrow morning.  Workers have lives to lead and families to feed.  Crucially, illness or adverse circumstances surrounding their ability to work, particularly during Covid, can strike any time.  There is no vaccine or antidote to that.</p>  <p>  The Government call to delay this change is not the solution.  We all know it can propose any amendments it considers necessary to this Bill, as can any other party or group in the House.  The Bill is not the finished product but is a start.  We should not wait any longer.  We also need to look at options to protect SMEs, as well as our workers.  That balance needs to be struck.  The Bill is a good start, which should be voted through.  People will then see that we are serious about looking after them during this Covid period.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Harkin that the Bill deals with an important issue.  We might have different views on the speed at which we can change but most Members are in favour of bringing in measures in this space, which is a positive move.  I thank the Labour Party for leading this debate and giving us the opportunity to discuss it in the House.  The Government welcomes the introduction of this important issue for future deliberation in the House.</p>  <p>  The past seven months have been a challenging time for everyone.  We all have been adjusting to the new realities that the Covid-19 pandemic has brought in its wake.  Extraordinary steps have been taken in our efforts to suppress the virus.  We have been asked to socially distance and to wear face masks in circumstances where it is not possible to stay 2 m apart.  The importance of washing our hands has been stressed and, most important, we have been told to socially isolate if we display the symptoms of the virus.  Employers have been asked to support remote working where possible, as well as to adjust the physical environment of workplaces and associated work practices in order that essential work can continue in a safe manner.  No one should go to work if they are feeling sick or displaying Covid symptoms.  To do so would be harmful to themselves, the people with whom they come in contact and detrimental to our economy and wider society.</p>  <p>  Ireland does not have a statutory sick pay scheme in place, that is, a scheme whereby all employers must by law pay employees who are unable to work because of an illness.  An illness benefit scheme is administered by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  This scheme was temporarily enhanced in the circumstances presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.  The goal is to encourage people not to go work when they should be in isolation simply because they cannot afford to lose out on wages.  The scheme ensures payment from the first day of illness, allowing employees to comply with medical advice to self-isolate to mitigate the spread of the virus.  While I appreciate that the illness benefit scheme does not necessarily cover entire salaries of workers affected by the Covid-19 public health measures, I am thankful many employees enjoy contractual entitlements affording them sick pay entitlements.</p>  <p>  However, as my colleagues have signposted, the proposal to introduce a statutory sick pay entitlement is not quite as straightforward as the Bill suggests.  While most businesses have reopened and are trading, many are faced with the prospect of a slow recovery in domestic consumer demand and decreased international demand, together with the overhang of costs and losses that arose during the past seven months.  The Department is engaging with these businesses daily, as are many Members.  They face many pressures.  The majority of those businesses would accept positive change at the right time in this space.  It is about managing, however, what we have in front of us.</p>  <p>  Government measures have been introduced to support people, households, workers and businesses impacted by Covid-19.  This has included unprecedented levels of emergency income support, measures for households and liquidity support measures for enterprises.</p> <p>These measures have played a significant role in supporting the economy and society.<br/><br/>However, businesses continue to require help to stabilise, reboot and deal with the ongoing challenges they will have to face coming into the winter.  Business owners face a variety of fixed costs which they may struggle to meet due to ongoing public health restrictions.  It is therefore of the utmost importance that we do not hastily introduce new costs on business that would compromise the continued viability and solvency of the thousands of microenterprises and small businesses across the country that are trying to get back on their feet.  This includes coffee shops, small retailers, travel and tourism operators, those involved in the leisure and play sectors, including kids' leisure and play centres, the entertainment sectors and the pubs that have suffered dramatic and catastrophic reductions in revenues.  We are all very familiar with their stories.  They are not just businesses, small, micro or large, but also employers.  They give people the opportunity to go to work, and everybody benefits from businesses doing well.  This also helps to give us the tax revenues we need to provide and upgrade services.  It is a full circle.  It is a matter of trying to make sure we support the employees, the businesses and those who are at home.  That is the balance we have tried to achieve with the supports that have been announced during the Covid-19 pandemic.<br/><br/>From the start of the pandemic, many employers have taken the initiative, in line with subsequent requests from the Government, to be as flexible as possible in allowing staff to manage their family responsibilities and to protect themselves.  Employers have a general duty of care towards their workers, and that care is often expressed in the form of negotiation, compromise and flexibility.  Quite a good rapport has been developed in that respect, and I think most feedback will show that this is happening in a positive way and that those conversations have been had individually in many cases and directly with workforces as well.  In the majority of cases, in fairness, everybody has acted responsibly, and that is a compliment to all involved.<br/><br/>The Government has been encouraging any employees coming into contact with the virus, even indirectly, to follow the guidelines, self-isolate and engage with their employers in the first instance with a view to exploring all options available to enable them to self-isolate and then return to work when it is safe for them to do so.  We continue to encourage all employers to be as flexible and supportive as possible with a view to maintaining good employment relations over the long term.<br/><br/>While employees are obliged to work as needed and in line with the terms and conditions of their employment contract, employers also have a duty of care to their workers in ensuring a safe and healthy workplace.  Employers do not want staff arriving into the workplace when they are sick, which would put at risk not only themselves and other employees but the wider business.  However, the introduction of a statutory requirement on all employers to pay up to six weeks of sick leave per annum would be a very large burden on microenterprises and small enterprises.  For this reason, the Government believes a period of consultation is essential before considering any policies and legal obligations in this area.<br/><br/>In principle, the Government sees many benefits associated with the introduction of statutory sick pay.  However, we need to identify the specific problem or challenge that the absence of such an entitlement is creating and the most efficient and fair manner of addressing that challenge.  This will require cross-departmental co-operation.<br/><br/>We will need to carry out research into the extent and the exact nature of the problems identified in the Bill.  We will need to understand the cost and the impact the proposal would impose on smaller and medium-sized employers who have already been severely hit by Covid-19 related public health measures while still dealing with the fallout from the financial crash a number of years ago.<br/><br/>While some form of statutory sick pay would appear to be clearly a good thing and in the public interest, we must ensure that the way in which such a scheme is introduced is proportional.  If we could devise a workable proposal, it would likely improve healthcare outcomes and make Ireland a more attractive place in which to live and work, and that is something we would all support.<br/><br/>We must engage with the employers and their representative associations as well as worker representatives.  In doing so we will consider reforms to the country's horizontal sick pay laws and any related change to illness benefit, which is funded by PRSI.  We will also explore a range of measures to address the implicit incentive for a sick person to attend work in a way that would fairly apportion costs among the relevant parties.<br/><br/>We will return to this issue in six months' time, as proposed in our countermotion.  I did not get to hear all the contributions but I did hear some of them.  I thank all the Deputies for their input and the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Kelly, who will formally close this debate.  I understand what the party is trying to achieve, and the Government accepts that, but for us the issue is timing and how we move this forward by bringing everybody with us to make sure it has no negative effects.<br/><br/>I will refer to the comments my colleague, Deputy Howlin, made earlier.  I agree that many companies have been supportive of their employees throughout this crisis, and I have referred to that already, but I do not agree with the suggestion made by the Deputy and other speakers that we can iron out all the issues and consider all the implications in just a matter of days.  This is quite a significant proposal.  The Bill proposes a rather large change.  It needs and merits proper consultation across all the Departments and across this House and its committees.  If the Labour Party genuinely wants to achieve progress in this area, it would be best to give the party's proposal enough time such that we could have that proper consultation.  We have to be proportionate and consider the microbusinesses and small businesses and the effects this will have on them.  There is a duty on us all here to protect jobs and not to put more at risk.  We cannot merely push this Bill through this week as its implications are significant.  We have to be very careful not only to protect and sustain jobs but also to put our companies and enterprises on a growth path in order that we can achieve new employment in the years to come across the many sectors.<br/><br/>In response to Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith's comments about the Government returning to this issue in six months, I will reiterate the points my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, made in <i>The Irish Times</i>today.  The Ministers, Deputies Humphreys and McEntee, have also said the Government is happy to get working now through the many issues that arise, so three lead Ministers are very clearly committed to this and to putting our shoulder to the wheel and doing the work on this in the months ahead.  These were not just throwaway comments to put the matter away for six months.  We will commence the work and it will involve an appropriate level of consideration and consultation with all the relevant stakeholders - unions, employers and employees.  We will carefully evaluate the costs and benefits associated with the initiative.  That is the proper way to bring forward a proposal such as this.<br/><br/>I thank Deputies Canney and Mattie McGrath for their comments about protecting microbusinesses and small businesses and not frightening them with new requirements and a knee-jerk response.  Most employers are responsible and would be happy to engage in this conversation in an appropriate way and to make the changes we can all afford.<br/><br/>We continue to work to respond to the needs of workers and households and examine gaps in payments.  This is why I accept the reasons the Labour Party has brought forward the Bill.  I know without a doubt that it is a genuine proposal; the question is how we can make progress in this area.  I thank all the Deputies.  I have not had a chance to refer to everybody who spoke because I did not hear all the speeches, but I will take note of them in the days ahead.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-23a.46" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1610" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="11:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300013#L00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  It is a pity he did not get to hear all the contributions.  I wish the T&aacute;naiste well.  The Minister of State said this is about timing.  It really is because we are in the middle of a pandemic.  If we in the Labour Party had not brought this proposal forward, the House would not be talking about it.  The Minister of State certainly would not be talking about it.  Our party has always fought for workers' rights.  We will continue to do so and it will be to the fore of everything we do.  We have had many successes and have changed workers' rights in this country.  My party has done so more than any other party and we aspire to do so again.  In all that time, however, the issue of sick pay has never been dealt with, and this pandemic has changed that.  It needs to be dealt with.  The Government often puts forward commentary to the effect that the Opposition never brings forward anything, is playing politics or is doing this, that or the other.  This is positive legislation.  It is a proposal that we feel will help in the global pandemic we are in and will make workers' lives better.</p>  <p>  I thank all those who said they will support the Bill.  I regret some of the political commentary from a few Independents who have no intention of ever serving in government or taking responsibility for anything, although we are used to that, and from some other Independents of the rural variety who effectively said they do not believe workers should have statutory sick pay.  Imagine not believing workers should have statutory sick pay or believing that a parent with a child in a school with a case of Covid should not get time off to look after that child.  Imagine going back to one's constituents and saying that is what one believes.  That is exactly what a number of rural Independent Deputies said today, and I will remind them of that forever.  I acknowledge the support of Sinn F&eacute;in.  Again, I regret its commentary, given the fact that sick pay is &pound;89.35 in the North.  Whatever we say about what we are doing down here in the Republic, sick pay is &euro;350 here, so there is a huge differential.  It is therefore hypocrisy to say one thing here and to have another thing in a different jurisdiction.</p> <p>We have made many changes.  My colleague, Deputy Nash, brought in many changes in labour legislation during his time as Minister of State, including the establishment of the Low Pay Commission, which we will speak about again.  Statutory sick pay is an issue that will have to be dealt with.  It took a global pandemic to expose a huge hole in workers' rights.</p> <p> I was taken by Deputy Harkin's contribution.  She did an analysis of a range of jurisdictions across Europe which are hardly socialist bastions, for want of a better phrase.  This included 22 countries which have statutory sick pay and pay proper wages to workers when they are sick.  Some of these countries are getting on better than us in the pandemic.  That has not been correlated here so I ask Deputies to listen to that.</p> <p> Sick pay is currently at the discretion of the employer and I acknowledge there are very good employers out there.  A large number of employers pay sick pay, including the public service and other very good employers.  However, some employers are not good.  Some of the employers represented and spoken about in this House today do not want to pay sick pay.  They want that power over their employees and they do not want to pay sick pay.  That is not acceptable in 2020 during a pandemic.</p> <p> We acknowledge that small and medium enterprises will need financial support in tandem with this Bill, particularly during the pandemic.  The reason we are introducing this legislation before the budget is to align it with the budget in order that these enterprises can get such support.  It is our intention to make sure employers who can afford to pay sick pay but are refusing to do so pay it, and that small and medium enterprises are supported by the Government to ensure they can meet the requirements which will be set out during the process by which we bring this through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p> <p> The suggestion of a six-month delay is complete and utter rubbish.  When there is an outbreak in a place of low-paid employment and a county goes into lockdown as a result, I will point out to the Minister of State that we had an opportunity and he should tell that to people in the county that is in lockdown because a low-pay employer did not pay sick pay.  I know all about low-paid employment, such as the meat industry.  There is a factory in Cahir in my county of Tipperary where workers have to be in full employment for two years to receive sick pay.  I know all about meat factories because I worked in them to be able to go to college.  They are tough places to work.  If employers do not respect workers and provide adequate sick pay, what will the workers do?  They will take paracetemol, Calpol or whatever they can.  Temperature checks are a complete waste of time.  Workers are left in an unenviable position facing the stark choice between going to work or not getting paid.  If they go to work, they will spread the disease.</p> <p> I have a real issue with where we are going with this pandemic and the lack of sick pay because there will be outbreaks and this is the trajectory.  We will be faced with what NPHET recommends and what the Government takes on board.  We will not have used our full armoury or all our tools and some people will go to work and spread symptoms because of the Government's decision not to allow this Bill to go through.  This Bill needs analysis on Committee Stage and outside input but all of that can be done.  Rushed legislation is not good legislation, I heard today, but there has been a huge amount of rushed legislation over the past six months.  This is necessary legislation.  Tusla have reported 63 incidents in early years services already.  What about all of those workers and workers in all low-paid environments?</p> <p> The the mantra from Government that we must follow public health advice is one I support but it is hypocritical.  The chief executive and chief clinical officer of the HSE have both said this measure is necessary.  On 27 August, the acting Chief Medical Officer made a clear recommendation and the journalist asked him if that recommendation had been made to Government a few weeks previously by NPHET, to which the acting Chief Medical Officer replied that it had been.  Some time in August, the acting Chief Medical Officer recommended that the issue of sick pay be dealt with.  The Government has not dealt with it, which means the Government is not following public health advice.  When the Government tells the public to follow public health advice, is it not hypocrisy that one of the issues that NPHET and the HSE have stated the Government needs to deal with has not been dealt with?  When the Government asks young and old people and everyone else to follow health advice, can people not throw back at the Government the argument that it is not following health advice?  The Government is allowing situations where people will go into work because they will not get paid otherwise.  Is that not hypocrisy?</p> <p> I ask the Minister of State to go back to the Government and deal with this issue.  It must also deal with the provision in the Bill on parental leave which would allow guardians, mothers and fathers to look after their children, just for the period of Covid if there is an outbreak in a school.  This is a comprehensive, positive and necessary Bill.  It ticks the box in meeting the Government's challenge to the Opposition in this Chamber to come up with solutions and be proactive, positive and non-political.  This is not about politics; it is necessary.  I urge the Minister of State not to kick this legislation down the road for six months.  If he does so, he and every other Deputy who votes against it are saying that parents cannot look after their children if there is an outbreak in schools and that people who work in low-paid employment which does not have sick pay are not entitled to it.  What they are all saying is that when they want to they can follow public health advice and when it does not suit their political needs, they do not have to.  That is bloody well hypocrisy.</p></speech>

Its general secretary, Patricia King, stated that it did so because the commission was not prepared to go beyond an increase of 1% in the minimum wage for 2021.  A 1% increase would mean an increase of 10 cent an hour for the workers affected - the thousands of low-paid workers who have kept us going during this pandemic.  Overnight, when the going got tough, many of those workers were classified as essential.  When the chips were down it was not to the high rollers, bankers, corporate landlords or millionaire executives that we turned; no, in our time of need, it was to retail workers who stock our shelves, delivery van drivers, supply chain workers, carers and cleaners that we turned.</p>  <p>  These workers were essential, these workers are essential and these workers have always been essential.  They were commended and cheered, but they cannot feed their children with applause and flowery rhetoric.  They rely on a meaningful increase in the minimum wage to pay their bills, rents and mortgages.  Those workers need decent pay - a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.  There is something very wrong when members of a Low Pay Commission cannot agree to a meaningful increase for low paid workers, workers who were rightly described as heroes only a few short weeks ago.  </p>  <p>  One in five workers is a low-paid worker in Ireland, and 100,000 people at work live in poverty.  That is the reality.  The Taoiseach and his Government have turned their backs on these workers.  The new employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, locks 153,000 of the lowest paid workers out and the Government has been put at risk of losing their jobs.  It has left their employers in a terrible position, because they do not have the money or resources to pay the very modest wages.  The Government, therefore, has hurt not only low-paid workers but also businesses.  The pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, has also been cut, a move certain to drive more workers and households into debt and distress, and this has been done at a time tens of thousands of workers remain out of work because of the Covid-19 crisis.</p>  <p>  To summarise the situation, since 1 September, over the past three weeks, the Government has locked 153,000 of the lowest paid workers out of the EWSS, the PUP has been cut for those losing their jobs because of Government-imposed public health restrictions, and now we have a Low Pay Commission that will not deal with low pay.  Is this the Taoiseach's version of "we are all in this together"?  I ask that because it strikes me that all this has the fingerprints of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Varadkar, and Fine Gael all over it.  What does the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, propose to do to reverse these absolutely disastrous decisions that will injure and hurt low-paid workers and their families? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-23a.53" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1458" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="11:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300015#N00400"><p>It is fundamentally wrong of the Deputy to attempt to make political capital out of a decision of the independent Low Pay Commission, which is not dictated to or influenced by the Government.  In fact, the past five recommendations from the commission have been accepted by the Government.  The Government supports low-paid workers.  We have the fourth-highest minimum wage in European systems with a statutory minimum wage.</p>  <p>  Right now, it is an extraordinary political charge for the Deputy to make about the Government not supporting low-paid workers.  Under the EWSS, 350,000 workers will be supported by the State, as it continues.  More than 200,000 workers are supported by the PUP, and a further 200,000 are supported on the live register.  Approximately 750,000 workers, therefore, are still being supported by the State, right now, because of the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>  <p>  To try to create the impression, therefore, that the Government is out to get people is outrageous in the context of an unprecedented intervention by the Government and the State to support workers at all levels, to support sectors and to do so in a sustainable way that can keep us going right throughout 2021.  That is what the Government has been about.  I regret the fact that ICTU has pulled out of the Low Pay Commission.  I understand its reasons.  It wants an increase of 20 cent in the minimum wage as opposed to 10 cent.  I hope ICTU can rejoin the commission, because all of us in the House agree with an independent statutory body to decide on low pay.  </p>  <p>  Regarding the minimum wage, many employers are now in significant difficulty and the Deputy must know that.  That is why the Government is supporting so many employers under the EWSS.  Deputy McDonald and I do not pay the minimum wage; employers in small-to-medium-sized businesses do.  They are under pressure, but, thankfully, many are proving resilient, even in the teeth of Covid-19.  We must continue to support them because, fundamentally, what the Government wants to do is support people on low incomes and support workers, but also to create new employment opportunities.  Substantial funding was put aside in the form of a wide range of placements, including via Skillnet Ireland, Springboard, the apprenticeship incentivisation scheme and additional third level places, to create more than 30,000 new places that can allow people to reorient and help them to get employment in areas such as retrofitting and similar areas where the State can spend additional capital funding to create employment and work.  </p>  <p>  I heard what Patricia King, the head of Congress, said, and I have great respect for the work ICTU does on fairness and in looking after low-paid workers.  There will, obviously, be further engagement between the Government and ICTU regarding this matter, but it also has to be acknowledged that the Government, recognising the independence of the Low Pay Commission, has accepted all of its recommendations since 2016.  We continue, however, to support workers through the various schemes we have developed and to keep as many jobs going as we possibly can in this society and economy.</p></speech>

Let us rehearse the facts again.  The Government's new wage subsidy scheme excludes 153,000 workers who earn &euro;151 a week, or less.  They are not eligible and are excluded from the scheme.  That hurts those workers, it hurts their employers and the Government has left them out in the cold, very deliberately.  That is a fact.  The Government has also cut the PUP, so another 150,000 or more workers are down &euro;50 or &euro;100 a week.  That is also a fact.  That hurts those workers and their families, and now we have a Low Pay Commission that is not minded to deal in any acceptable way with the issue of low pay.</p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach, therefore, agree with ICTU that the minimum increase to the minimum wage ought to be 20 cent an hour or more?  Will he move beyond his sort of delusional reverie and into the real world with us, address those low-paid workers excluded from the Government's wage subsidy scheme and those who will be hurt by the changes to PUP?  Will the Taoiseach tell those workers how he is going to correct for those very bad decisions?</p></speech>

That scheme is about employers who employ people.  The Deputy knows that there are various formulas designed to facilitate, for example, employers whose turnover has dropped to 70% of the previous year and so on.  The Deputy deliberately distorts what has been an effective and unprecedented intervention in the labour market to protect employers, enterprises and workers.  As I said, it is expected that 350,000 people will benefit from the scheme.  Can the Deputy not acknowledge that a substantial and unprecedented intervention has been made by the State on behalf of taxpayers to support employment?  Why does the Deputy always feel the need to distort facts and, if one likes, smear people who are definitely trying to do their best?  She does it all the time for political advantage.</p> <p> We extended the pandemic unemployment payment until the middle of next year and did so quicker than any other European country.  We made that decision.  The rates have come down but they are closely proximate to what people would have been earning before they were laid off.</p></speech>

That is the case for various reasons, which I will not go into now.  The Taoiseach spoke at the weekend about using influencers and I hope he will go ahead and do that quickly.  It is important that we use influencers for all age, interest and ethnic cohorts.  I would like to see the Government doing that quickly.</p>  <p>  Would the Taoiseach also agree that there is a role for cross-party messaging to urge people to comply with public health advice?  Ideally, we would have done that last Friday but it is not too late.  An initiative should be taken by this House in that regard.</p>  <p>  If compliance rates can be raised substantially, we have the prospect of bringing down the current critically high rates.  The aim should be to do that in the quickest possible time, ideally in the next three weeks, but certainly within a reasonable period.</p>  <p>  I wish to raise a wider issue with the Taoiseach.  What strategy should be pursued in the medium and long term?  There has been little or no political or public discussion in that regard.  There are essentially three possible strategies, namely, herd immunity, zero or near elimination and what we are doing.  The five-level plan is a good framework because it distinguishes rates and responses in different areas but it is not a strategy.  We are doing a certain level of testing.  There are few controls on flights.  We are continuing with public health messaging about mask wearing and social distancing but that is clearly not enough.  Our response to a surge is a lockdown or a close-down.  That can work in the short term but is not a sustainable strategy even in the medium term because the price being paid is simply too high and we will not keep the public with us.</p>  <p>  Should we not consider the pros and cons of alternative strategies?  There is no perfect strategy by any means and there are winners and losers in every approach but we need public and political discussion on which is the optimal way of managing the virus.  The way we manage the virus, the strategy that we use, should be reached through open discussion, based on evidence and taking a broad view of what is in our health, social and economic interest.  It is unfortunate that there is no forum for that at the moment.  We need to reach consensus.  Things like cutting the pandemic unemployment payment and extending protections for tenants are political issues but agreeing the best way of managing and controlling the virus should not be political issues.</p></speech>

I accept that a debate on public health should transcend party politics and politics in general.  I said at the weekend that it is important to communicate in different ways on different platforms to different age cohorts, ethnic minorities and migrant workers.  We worked on the issue of employment in meat plants and people in direct provision over the summer in terms of language, messaging and communication in respect of sick pay being available to people in direct provision, for example, if they were positive for coronavirus and required to self-isolate.  I take those points.</p>  <p>  On her point about cross-party messaging, members of all parties in Dublin were briefed after the announcement of the restrictions.  I will go further and organise a briefing with party leaders.  The health spokespersons of different parties were also looking for a briefing.  Last Thursday and Friday were hectic days for members of NPHET and for the acting Chief Medical Officer, CMO, and all involved but they stayed late on Friday evening to brief Dublin representatives.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is correct about compliance rates.  We want people to comply with the guidance.  An enormous collective effort is required to get these numbers down significantly.  It is within our capacity, as a people, to do that by reducing our social contacts, avoiding unnecessary congregations and wearing masks where possible.  We can make an impact on the numbers by doing that.</p>  <p>  On the point that the Deputy made about strategy, by instinct I do not believe in the herd immunity approach.  Those who advocated for it early on did not fully realise the impact of this virus on people's health.  It seems that the virus can be damaging to some people's lungs and health over the medium term even if they survive.  It can have longer term health implications for some people and we do not know enough about how deadly this virus is to go along with the idea of a herd immunity approach because it carries enormous risks.</p>  <p>  The strategy of elimination has not quite worked where it has been tried.  It has been effective in New Zealand but its geographic location is different to ours.  We are in a different situation geographically.  We must also accept that the economic and social implications of an elimination strategy would be significant and severe on workers and society.</p>  <p>  I think that the strategy to suppress the virus that we are pursuing now is the correct one.  That said, I am not an expert on public health.  I recall the Deputy saying, as I said, at the outbreak of the virus that we should adhere as much as possible to public health advice.  Our public health advice at the moment is to endeavour to stabilise and suppress the spread of the virus while maintaining a quality of life, having as many people working as possible, with our schools open and health services resumed to the greatest extent possible.</p></speech>

I am saying that a situation needs to be created where we can have that open discussion, where we are prepared to be open and frank and face up to the serious problems and challenges in testing and tracing.  We need a forum to ask are we adequately resourced and ready for rapid test technology.  Is it right that the HSE should be expected to manage testing and tracing while it is running the health service and coping with the demands of Covid?  Can we trace the places where the virus is being transmitted?  Is there potential for an all-Ireland approach to this?</p> <p>What can we do about importation?  All of those things need to be discussed, not just thrown out here in this adversarial setting.  We need to have proper discussion about the pros and cons of different strategies and how we are going to move forward in the medium and longer term in managing this virus. </p> <p> I do not expect a reply today but I ask the Taoiseach to give consideration to facilitating cross-party discussion of the approach to managing the virus.  What is happening at the moment is not working.  We need to reinforce the immediate messages because they are the only way we can drive down the critical figures now.  That is not sustainable, however.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider a cross-party approach to this issue.</p></speech>

The Deputy referred to the three strategies, so it is reasonable to respond to them.  If she is suggesting some new forum should be created in a non-contentious environment that would facilitate a calmer and more reasonable timeframe to explore these issues, it would be a good idea. </p>  <p>   One of the challenges we face is that many people who could usefully contribute to that debate are on the front line.  I will give it consideration.  I understand where she is coming from because we have to think through how we will manage the situation over the next period of time.  There is a lot of wishful thinking around a vaccine.  That may not come immediately.  The WHO feels it may be the middle of next year before one is available.  I take the Deputy's point overall, and I am willing to respond positively to it and will give it some thought and consideration.</p></speech>

However, a 2006 EU directive allows for an exemption and the maintenance of non-prescription status for a certain number of these products which do not represent a risk to human or animal health.  This meant that the rights of what are termed responsible persons were protected and since then, they have been able to continue to prescribe and dispense veterinary medicines when classified as licensed or agricultural merchants.</p>  <p>  That exemption is now under threat following EU plans to introduce new regulations in January 2022.  This regulation, if implemented, will mean that only vets will be allowed to prescribe these products and this will have a detrimental impact as at least 3,000 jobs in the agricultural merchant sector will be lost.  This will be another blow to rural counties like Laois and Offaly.  There is absolutely no reason this should be allowed to happen. </p>  <p>  The EU justification for the new rules is that only vets have enough knowledge and skill to prescribe certain antimicrobial drugs but this is patent nonsense.  Thousands of highly trained and skilled agricultural merchants have been dispensing these drugs since 2006 and there is no solid evidence to suggest why this needs to change.  Fortunately, there is an additional derogation clause that would permit responsible persons to continue issuing a veterinary prescription when the regulation comes into force in 2022. </p>  <p>  Today, I want to ask the Taoiseach if he will instruct the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and his Department to urgently adopt this derogation and, thereby, save thousands of jobs and prevent job losses in the rural economy.  The sector employs and creates 10,000 jobs directly and indirectly.  Organisations like the Independent Licensed Merchants Association, ILMA, and Ollie Ryan of Midland Veterinary, Tullamore, have already said that if this EU regulation is signed into law it will lead to job losses, possibly create a cartel, be extremely anti-competitive and create another burden for farming families who would also be subjected to a lot of hassle in getting their medicines.  It would also bring up issues around traceability as farmers would be able to buy these products in the North of Ireland, given that it will operate a different system to us.  </p>  <p>  We have an opportunity to save thousands of rural jobs if the Government acts quickly on this issue and seeks a derogation.  I hope the Taoiseach and Government will commit to doing that today and signal their intention to adopt the derogation that is already provided for in EU law.  I understand agri-merchants have received letters stating that the derogation is there to be applied for by the Government.</p></speech>

She indicated that the directive has not been finalised.  There is still work to be done on the directive and I presume negotiations are still under way.  I will talk to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  My understanding is that the Chairman of the agriculture committee intends to facilitate a discussion at the committee on this issue where inputs can be made by Deputy Nolan and other Deputies and Senators and the issue can be examined in greater detail, in particular the application or not of the additional derogation clause.</p>  <p>  The Deputy can take it that nobody wants to create any situation overnight whereby people are rendered unemployed as a result of the application of this directive.  I will discuss the matter with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I take from the Deputy's contribution the significance of what is envisaged and its potential implications for many in the sector.  Obviously, safety and protecting health is always paramount but she has indicated that this issue has been ongoing since 2006 under previous regulatory frameworks.  An update is close to finalisation for application in 2022.  As a member state, Ireland, along with other European colleagues, will be involved in finalising that.  We should also facilitate inputs.  I will come back to the Deputy on the matter in respect of my engagement with the Minister.</p></speech>

I also want to point out that agricultural merchants want to work collaboratively and constructively on this issue.  I have spoken to the owners of many agricultural merchants, including Ollie Ryan of Midland Veterinary and J. Grennan &amp;amp; Sons, based in Kilcormac and Rath.  They want to work constructively and collaboratively but feel there is no way forward other than this derogation which they want to be finalised.</p>  <p>  We can prevent jobs being lost in rural Ireland and can help to protect the fragile rural economy.  I understand that many issues are beyond the reach of the Government, such as job losses due to the pandemic or Brexit, but this issue is within the control of Government.  The problem could be very simply solved by seeking the derogation and I urge the Taoiseach, as he said, to speak to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and his Department about the issue.</p></speech>

It is incumbent on all of us to ensure that the restrictions are fully followed.  As we are standing here today, it is quite possible and probable that my county, Donegal, will move into the next stage of restrictions in the coming days, but we will have to wait and see what happens.</p> <p>There are some restrictions that do not seem to make sense to me and many other people.  I am thinking specifically of the restrictions in place in maternity wards.  It is nonsensical that partners or husbands of pregnant women are not allowed into the delivery ward with their partner, and doubly so that they are not allowed to attend the 20-week scan and have to sit outside in the car park in many cases.  As one constituent put it to me: </p><blockquote>	Pregnant women throughout the country are currently going through appointments, scans, labour and sometimes even birthing alone in what is arguably the most vulnerable time of their lives.  This is especially true for people who get the devastating news that their pregnancies are not viable or those who have to go through a miscarriage without a loved one present.  It is unacceptable and not something anyone should have to face alone.<br /><br />I am expecting my first baby in January and had to receive emergency care at 13 weeks gestation.  I was in the gynaecology unit at Letterkenny University Hospital for almost five hours.  My frantic partner had to wait in the car park for the duration.  He has since missed out on milestone moments like the crucial 20-week anomaly scan. </blockquote> <p>Another constituent states:</p><blockquote>	Letterkenny University Hospital are refusing to permit partners to accompany women to their scans and I really do not think that this is justifiable.  Anyone can walk through the corridors of the hospital to right outside the door of the foetal assessment unit, which is in the gynae department so it is separate from the maternity wards, and if partners take all the precautions then surely that one staff member carrying out the scan is at no risk.  These strict and unreasonable policies are causing such a cruel and unnecessary added anguish to mothers and fathers who are already suffering enough. </blockquote> <p>This is especially true for people who get the devastating news that their pregnancies are not viable and those who have to go through a miscarriage without a loved one present.  The World Health Organization guidelines state that Covid-19 should not impact on a woman&rsquo;s right to have a partner of her choice with her throughout a pregnancy.  It is also true that only allowing the father in at the eleventh hour is putting the man&rsquo;s needs ahead of a woman&rsquo;s and does not recognise that she has an internationally recognised human right to have her support present.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that maternity wards will make the reasonable decision to allow partners to be present at the most important time in pregnancies, at least at the birth and the 20-week scan, which are the most critical points?</p></speech>

For the vast majority of people, giving birth is one of the most magical and beautiful moments that one can experience in life.  For some, it can, as the Deputy has said, be very difficult and traumatic.  In either situation, the presence of a partner is very valuable, important and, in ordinary times, essential.  What has been happening in maternity wards in this situation is a reminder of how indiscriminate and devastating the pandemic has been in upending the norms of the human experience.  We should, in the first instance, always acknowledge that this is Covid-19 really upending our lives and normal experiences.  To be fair to all concerned in maternity and gynaecological wards and so on, the fundamental principle is to do no harm and their fundamental objective is to protect people - mothers, babies and front-line workers.  That is, I surmise, the genuine motivation behind the restrictions that have been applied.</p>  <p>  That said, I know the acting Chief Medical Officer is aware of the Department of Health's engagement with Dr. Peter McKenna, the clinical director for the national women and infants health programme, who has confirmed that the programme is working on a document to seek to ensure that, as far as practicable and having due regard to local circumstances, a consistent national approach to visitor restrictions in maternity hospitals is developed.  I have heard a number of Deputies raise this issue over the past fortnight or so.  The difficulty of uniformity across the system is because different locations have different risks and protocols applying in different hospitals and maternity wards.  That also has to be acknowledged.  There has to be some degree of local decision-making in respect of the overarching objective of protecting people in situations such as this.  I will continue to work with the Minister for Health and those involved to see if we can get a satisfactory national approach to this matter.</p></speech>

He spoke about visitor restrictions and how we are to deal with that issue.  The issue here is not visitor restrictions but restrictions that are stopping one person - the support for a pregnant woman - from being present at vital times in the pregnancy.  It is not about visitor restrictions or visitors attending maternity wards or anything like that; it is about more than that.  If staff are at risk from the partner of a pregnant woman, they are also at risk from the pregnant woman.  Having one extra person in the ward or room is not going to make a significant difference.  That needs to be taken on board.  This is an extreme effect of the restrictions.</p>  <p>  The national maternity strategy is running alongside Covid-19.  This strategy's aim is to achieve a woman-centred maternity system that promises dignity, respect and compassion in the provision of services.  This, sadly, is lacking and it needs to be addressed.  This sounds like another example of male chauvinistic privilege that women tell me they often feel when they interact with services and decision-making around their fundamental rights and bodily autonomy.  They should be able to have the support present for them at all the important times.  The most important person in this whole process is the woman and her child.  They should be at the centre of the decision-making.  I ask the Taoiseach to address that point.</p></speech>

We have to acknowledge the risk managers in hospitals, those whose overarching objective is to protect people.  We should accept the motivation of all involved which, I surmise, is genuine.  Nobody is wilfully doing this.  This goes against the very grain of what is natural and normal in such situations.</p>  <p>  We need to be fair here.  We are politicians who bring back to the Chamber the concerns of the people we represent but we have to balance that with rushing in and ordering or instructing people on the ground who have responsibilities and legal obligations in dealing with the protection of mothers, babies and staff as well.  That said, work is under way on this, as I have said, and my understanding is that Dr. Peter McKenna is working on developing a document for a consistent national approach to visitor restrictions in maternity hospitals.  People understand the issues here.  The important point is to affirm the fundamental principle of not doing harm and protecting all concerned to the optimal degree possible.</p></speech>

I asked him to commit to ring-fencing the necessary funding to ensure that services get back up and running to capacity.  The Taoiseach cited, of course, the Covid-19 protocols, which I recognise.  More importantly, the services, the sector, the families and the individuals with disabilities themselves recognise that those protocols have to be abided by and respected.  However, that means the money has to be committed.  The winter plan is to be published and the Taoiseach needs to make a commitment now in respect of that necessary funding.  The Disability Federation of Ireland states that &euro;120 million is required.  I would like the Taoiseach to put people&rsquo;s minds at ease, bring clarity and commit to ring-fencing and delivering that funding.</p></speech>

There has been considerable investment in and allocation of resources to education for special needs assistants and support for the return of children with special needs to education and to schools across the board in September and, likewise, for the resumption of adult services.  There have been constraints with regard to the degree to which those services have been restored.</p> <p>Not all of them were financial; some related to the impact of Covid-19.</p></speech>

I would like an update because there is serious concern among all GPs and also among many sectors of society.  There are pharmacies advertising the flu vaccine online but when one fills in the form, one cannot get it.  They say one will not be able to get it this year if one is not in one of the priority groups, and we all know who the priority groups are.  What is the position regarding the volume of vaccine we will be getting?  I have raised this issue for many months.  It was flagged quite early that we needed to ensure we had the supply coming in.  Where are we at as regards the supply?  How will it be managed out to the healthcare professionals?  Over what timespan will we have the vaccine this year because we are up against a deadline now immediately and given non-Covid versus Covid, the Taoiseach and I both know that the vaccine is critical.</p></speech>

Some has arrived and is being distributed.  More is on the way and by the end of this month, there should be significant additional supplies.  It is beyond the control of Government and the State in terms of the issues that apply here.</p></speech>

Sl&aacute;intecare identified that as a major issue that needed to be addressed to achieve fairness.  Four measures were announced in the budget, which would have been small steps along the way in this regard.  They were to reduce prescription charges, improve the threshold for the drugs payment scheme, raise the income limits for medical cards for those over 70, and extend free GP care for six to eight year-old children.  Those four measures were to take effect from July.  It did not happen.  Why did it not happen?  When will the Taoiseach honour the promises he made?</p></speech>

I want to raise a specific case with the Taoiseach the details of which I am happy to send to him.  It is a man who is an Irish citizen.  He was born in Iraq.  He fled Mosul in Iraq, after ISIS had taken over and after they murdered his father and other close family members for refusing to co-operate.  He is an Irish citizen in Ireland at this stage but his mother is effectively in legal limbo in Turkey with no documents and is faced with going back to Iraq.  In brief, the mother of an Irish citizen whose husband was murdered by ISIS is faced with being forced back to Iraq and we are asking the Government to intervene on a humanitarian basis to allow her to be reunified with her son.</p></speech>

It needs an outer relief road or an in between road before we get the motorway from Limerick to Waterford, which is also badly needed, on to the Port of Rosslare, especially in these times of Brexit.  I ask the Taoiseach to visit the town to see for himself the excellent work being done by the task force and talk to its members and the other groups that are collaborating and working hard to try to improve the situation in Tipperary town.</p></speech>

I was not sure where I was on the list.  Sometimes I am never sure where I am.</p>  <p>  Before the summer recess I raised the serious health concerns of an 11-year-old scoliosis patient, Sophie Redmond, with the Taoiseach.  Sophie is in need of urgent spinal surgery but she also desperately requires surgery on her knees.  At the time, the Taoiseach mentioned the gravity of the situation and said he understood the time-sensitive nature of it.  Sophie is no closer now to getting her surgery than when I raised the matter before the recess.  I ask the Taoiseach not to forget about scoliosis patients and children such as Sophie Redmond.  Will he make sure that somebody contacts her parents to ensure that her surgery, and surgeries similar to that, are carried out as a matter of urgency?</p></speech>

We are very concerned, particularly in terms of scoliosis or other urgently-needed surgery, that it would be available to children.  Covid-19 impacted on paediatric care as it also did on adult care.  I am not sure of the clinical context here but I will examine this and determine the current position in terms of the delays.</p></speech>

I have been told that this is because ambulance crews were not available, that at one stage the service was covered by a sole practitioner and that ambulance shifts were being dropped on a regular basis around the county.  On 17 September, there were no crews in Cashel.  On 18 September, there were no crews in Cashel or Tipperary town.  For five out of ten nights recently, Cashel did not have any cover.  That is scandalous.  That clearly contradicts the commitment in the programme for Government to increase the capacity in the national ambulance service and expand community first responder schemes.  Is the Taoiseach aware of this happening across the country?  Can we get some information on the reason this is the case, how often it is happening in my county and what is being done to address it?</p>  <p>  On the same issue, will the Taoiseach make a statement on why ambulance drivers and paramedics have not been allowed join a union of their own choosing?</p></speech>

It has been particularly effective during Covid-19 in terms of the work ambulance personnel have done on behalf of the State.  I certainly will engage with the service and the HSE on the points the Deputy raised in respect of Cashel and follow up on that.</p></speech>

It relates to Aer Lingus employees who are consistently being blocked from receiving their social welfare entitlements.  It is a very serious situation where workers in this State who pay PRSI to ensure they can access social welfare entitlements when they need it are being blocked from doing so at the very time they need it.  At first Aer Lingus was not signing the UP80 forms.  It is now issuing letters instead of signing the UP80 forms.  Will the Taoiseach intervene when we come to a situation where nobody in this State should ever be denied their entitlements at this time?</p></speech>

This morning, we hear that the Low Pay Commission will be recommending an increase of 10 cent per hour to the minimum wage.  The workers in question were deemed to be essential when Covid first hit and they continue to work under very difficult circumstances to keep the State running.  Next week, Deputies are going to get another pay hike, of 2%, which is nearly &euro;2,000.  This is a real kick in the gut for the people who had their pandemic unemployment payment cut  It is a real kick in the gut for those low-paid employees who will see an increase to the minimum wage of a mere 10 cent.  I, like all Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies, will not accept that pay hike.</p></speech>

As the Taoiseach has said, the commission is not a arm of the Government.  The representatives know that.  They have walked away because they could not achieve at the table the minimum increase they required, of 2%.  That was not a target; it was their floor.  They could not even achieve that.  My question is simple: does the Taoiseach propose to legislate for a meaningful increase in the minimum wage for workers or is he content to stand here, give them a round of applause and tell them to take that to Tesco and try to buy their food and groceries with it?  These people have brought us through the pandemic.  They are essential workers.  The one thing the pandemic has done was give us an opportunity to re-evaluate the exact meanings of "front-line worker" and "essential worker".  When we are talking about these workers, we are talking about cleaners and people who work in retail, the supply chain, hospitality and accommodation.  Many of them have lost their jobs.</p></speech>

I should have swung by the canteen on the way to the D&aacute;il Chamber just now.  I could have bought myself a packet of peanuts to hold it up in the air and ask the Taoiseach whether it is what he is going to offer low-paid workers in the budget.  There is a recommendation of less than 1% from the Low Pay Commission.  We are talking about workers who played a key role in getting this country through the lockdown earlier this year.  I would like to hear from the Taoiseach a guarantee that an insulting increase of 1% will not even be considered by the Government and that the national minimum wage will be increased by considerably more than that.</p></speech>

Every Deputy in this House supports low-paid workers.  The last five recommendations have been implemented by the Government.  That is the whole reason behind having ICTU, unions and employers together on the commission.  As has been said, ICTU was not in a position to accept the recommendation of 10 cent.  It wanted a minimum increase of 20 cent.</p>  <p>  The State's intervention in supporting workers has been unprecedented.  Over 750,000 workers are now on one State support or other, including the pandemic unemployment payment.  Three hundred and fifty thousand workers are being supported by the wage subsidy scheme.  This is never acknowledged at all but it is an important State intervention and a necessary one because of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  On Deputy Brady's  point, I have heard before about Sinn F&eacute;in Members not taking their salaries.

That is a fact.  I have proof on my phone and I will show it to the Taoiseach after the session if he wants to see it.</p>  <p>  The issue I want to raise concerns increasing our ICU capacity, which is the lowest in the European Union.  Within the programme for Government, on page 47, there is a commitment to increase it.  We need to do so within the public system.  There was a temporary increase owing to bringing private hospital capacity into the public system.  We supported that at the time as an emergency measure but we have only six intensive care beds per 100,000 of the population.  That is half the European average.  Tullamore hospital, for example, has four permanent intensive care beds while Portlaoise has only two.  The catchment area of those hospitals is 200,000.  This is a dangerous set of circumstances, particularly as we move into the winter period.  There was an increase in March and April.  How much of this has been retained?  What are we doing to increase capacity permanently in order to have a sufficient number of beds in the public system?  I ask this question sincerely because this is life and death stuff.</p></speech>

The ratio of nurses to patients in ICU is 1:1.  It is very staff intensive, as it has to be.  Therefore, up to 1,500 staff were trained during the pandemic to be ready for a Covid surge and to significantly increase ICU capacity to deal with any further surges.  The facility exists within the health service to ramp up critical care capacity, if necessary.  There has been an increase in beds since the beginning of the year but we will continue to work on that.  I accept the bona fides of the Deputies in asking their questions.  A genuine objective of ours is to ensure we have sufficient critical care capacity to deal with the issues.</p></speech>

Seamus Ludlow was a man who was killed in May 1976 outside Dundalk by loyalists, including members of the British Army.  Yesterday, we heard the news that Mr. Jon Boutcher will lead a cross-border investigation, that is, an investigation involving the North and South.  There were absolute failings on the part of the Garda, RUC and politicians north and south.  We have all seen "Unquiet Graves" in the past while and know the reality of British collusion.  We know the reality of the operation of death squads.  The Ludlow family has been failed miserably and has been told lies.  It has experienced nothing but failed investigations, and even failures in this House.  Therefore, could we get Government support and all the resources necessary?</p></speech>

Of that, I have no doubt.</p><p><i>1 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>In fact, the Irish Government, in terms of all parties, has probably been the one party that has honoured its commitments under the Good Friday Agreement as regards legacy issues.  We set up the Smithwick inquiry, which is not often acknowledged.  We did, however, and we were prepared take whatever came out of that particular inquiry in respect of the murder of two RUC members.  </p> <p> I am also well aware of the murderous work of the Glenanne gang, the deeply poisonous legacy they left and the degree of collusion involved.  I have met Eugene Reavey on a number of occasions.  He has worked tirelessly over many years in search of the full truth regarding the murder of his three brothers.  We are, and will remain, committed as a Government to getting through it and getting all groups involved who have lost loved ones as result of violence, terror and murder.</p></speech>

It actually does not go far enough.

It is a significant issue that is causing huge anxiety among parents.  There is a general historical credibility and acceptance around the written leaving certificate.  It has served us well.  Can the Taoiseach give reassurance in this regard?  I appreciate the difficulty with Covid-19 but what plans can be put place, the Covid-19 environment notwithstanding, in order that the written leaving certificate can proceed next year?</p></speech>

It is their absolute desire and commitment to have the normal leaving certificate that next year, that is, the normal written exams as well as other aspects of it.   Obviously, Covid-19 will have some impact on, perhaps, some aspects around the oral examinations and so forth.  They are, however, determined to have the leaving certificate and are already working in that regard.</p></speech>

I want to draw attention to a particular situation where an individual is clearly a danger himself or others, often family members.  The person obviously cannot be held in custody once his or her sentence is served but often he or she is diagnosed with a mental illness that is not considered serious enough to move him or her to a mental health facility.  Instead, judges are left with no option but to lift detaining orders, even when an individual who needs mental help is considered a potential threat to society.</p><p>I have an ongoing case in my constituency.  An article in last Saturday's <i>Irish Independent</i>highlighted these issues.  This is a serious and ongoing issue that needs immediate attention and legislation needs to be amended to address it.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach gave a commitment to make representations and revert to me.  He never did get back to me, despite the fact that County Louth is now on a knife-edge and we are looking at the real possibility of heading into level 3.  The people are playing their part and they expect the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, to play his.  He can do mass testing or he can do the lockdown of an entire county.  Can the Taoiseach tell the people of Drogheda and south Louth, following the representations and intervention I presume he has made, when the town will get its Covid-19 testing centre?</p></speech>

That is a commitment from the HSE.  The precise location is a matter for the HSE operationally.

The HSE also deploys mobile clinics and different mechanisms.  I have been in discussions with the HSE CEO on that point.</p></speech>

We are, however, mindful of the issue raised by the Deputy.

As the Taoiseach said, the Labour Employer Economic Forum has helped with discussions between employers and trade unions during this crisis as well as beforehand.  I am really concerned about the collapse of discussions in the Low Pay Commission.  We all know what the Low Pay Commission is.  We in the Labour Party created it through the work of Deputy Nash and others.  It does fundamental work.  We made an absolute commitment to bring it in to ensure that we could get to a threshold level of pay for people.</p>  <p>  Patricia King and others have made a fair and rational argument over the increase in the minimum wage, but employers would not budge beyond 1%.  I have known Patricia King for a long time and she did not take lightly the decision to walk out.  This is not a good moment.  The pandemic has clearly shown that the over-reliance on low-paid work in essential jobs in Ireland is a big problem.  It says a lot that two unions have walked out.  I am concerned not just at them rightly walking out; I am concerned over how employers are behaving.  I know the Taoiseach said this is an independent process.  I know the process off by heart; I helped create it.  That is not the issue.  The issue is deeper for me.</p>  <p>  The commission can still make a recommendation but I am concerned over how it can function without the trade union side.  We need to remember that while it can make a recommendation, the Government does not have to accept it and can always increase it.  That is something the Taoiseach might bear in mind.</p>  <p>  This comes on top of a report from the Central Bank a few days ago which exposed just how unequal Irish society is.  The median wealth of a person in the wealthiest 20% of Irish society is &euro;853,000.  The median wealth of a person in the poorest 20% of Irish society is just &euro;1,000 and the gap has widened in recent years.  The programme for Government commits to progressing to a living wage over the lifetime of the Government.  What process can be used if the commission is broken?  How can the Government fulfil its programme for Government commitment if the commission is not functioning?</p></speech>

On the work envisaged in the establishment of this unit in the Department of the Taoiseach, I understand the models of sectoral engagement are different from the old social partnership process.  I ask the Taoiseach to confirm that for me.  There is no doubt that workers, businesses and all of society face sudden and unprecedented challenges.  The public health emergency and consequent restrictions will create uncertain conditions for working people, but also uncertain trading conditions and business will require ongoing and substantial support from all arms of Government.  Meaningful engagement with employers, particularly small businesses and microbusinesses which provide the bulk of employment, will be critical.  From my contacts with business representative organisations, I know they are very keen that this new model of sectoral engagement comes to pass very quickly.</p>  <p>  I raised the issue of the Low Pay Commission with the Taoiseach earlier.  This commission was destined to fail because the legislation underpinning it is insufficient.  It does not have fairness and the intention to move from a status of low pay to a status of decent pay hardwired into it.  Labour and Fine Gael ignored the work of the British Labour Party which proposed substantial and progressive reforms of the British commission, the model the commission here mimicked.  We need to go back and rewire the commission if it is to fulfil its stated purpose.  It is senseless to have a commission on low pay that refuses to tackle and resolve the issue of low pay.</p></speech>

Not only has KPMG failed to act on that suggestion, but non-union labour is now being hired to pass picket lines and go into the stores to pack stock that is at the centre of an industrial dispute.  In other words the liquidator, appointed by the courts, is overseeing a scabbing operation organised on a national basis.</p> <p>I appeal to those non-union workers to refuse to do KPMG's dirty work and to respect the picket lines that have been organised by the workers - overwhelmingly women workers - who are campaigning for justice.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I would like to ask the Taoiseach a direct question.  Is he prepared, in the House today, to condemn this strike-breaking operation and to call on KPMG to ensure it stops immediately?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-23a.212" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="13:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300023#V00200"><p>Workers in Debenhams in Blackrock, along with almost 1,000 other workers, were on the picket lines at 6 a.m. this morning.  I joined them at approximately 7.30 a.m.  They had to go through the immense frustration of watching strike breakers brought in by their former manager.  To be honest, most of their disgust was directed at the former manager ushering in these strike breakers.  Frankly, I do not think the strike breakers really understood what was going on.  The workers were appealing to them not to do what they were doing.</p>  <p>  It would be a very strong message for the Taoiseach to stand up and say that this strike-breaking operation is absolutely reprehensible.  I have an invitation to him from the Debenhams workers in Blackrock.  If one talks to them, it is clear that they are some of the loveliest people one could ever meet.  They did not blame the strike breakers.  They blamed KPMG, the inaction of the Government and Debenhams.  One of the workers, Martin, has invited the Taoiseach to go to Blackrock and he will buy him lunch in the McDonald's there and give him a cup of coffee.  Martin wants to talk things through in a social dialogue, explain the workers' plight and ask what the Taoiseach can do.  That is a direct invitation from Martin, Viv and the shop steward, Eilis, at Debenhams in Blackrock to the Taoiseach.  They are asking him to go there and engage in social dialogue with them tomorrow morning as they fight for justice in a very just cause against reprehensible treatment at the hands of KPMG.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in and Deputy McDonald could take a leaf out of Deputy Kelly's book.  Let us argue these issues in as non-political and non-partisan a way as we can.  We are all in favour of looking after and doing the best we can for low-paid workers.  The problem I see in the exchanges this morning is one party wants to party-politicise the issues.  That party now blames Fine Gael and the Labour Party for what it is saying is a commission that was not wired properly.  The commission made five recommendations that were accepted by successive Governments.  It is a serious issue that a statutory body that was set up by the Oireachtas and had input from all parties is now in a breakdown situation.  We have to move carefully before we just abandon it.</p>  <p>  This matter can be dealt with as part of the work of the social dialogue unit in my Department.  I established that unit, by the way, because I believe strongly in working with trade unions, employers and other interests to develop a consensual approach to society.  Fianna F&aacute;il brought in social partnership in the late 1980s at a time of great economic crisis.  Social partnership did a lot for this country in its first ten years or so.  It did a lot for workers and it did a lot to advance social entitlements and rights.  I make no apology for saying I am a strong advocate for engagement in social dialogue with trade unions, employers and broader interests in society to advance a better quality of life and better rights and entitlements for workers.  That is why I, as Taoiseach, set up a new unit within my Department to intensify our effort on that front.</p>  <p>  There is a commitment in the programme for Government to move towards a living wage.  Deputy Kelly is correct in suggesting that we must consider what is the mechanism or forum by which we arrive at that.  I believe we should make an effort to restore equilibrium on the Low Pay Commission.  The Deputy is also correct that the Government has not made a decision as to whether it will accept the particular recommendation to which he referred.  That will be done closer to budget time.  We are very conscious of the issues.  One should, in fairness, ascertain the reasons that this recommendation has come forward.  I am conscious that, as a Government, we are supporting a lot of employers.  The vast majority of those availing of the wage subsidy are micro-employers through to small and medium-sized employers, as Deputy McDonald noted.  That is who is availing of the wage subsidy scheme.  More than 350,000 workers are being supported under the scheme and will be supported through to April.  It seems to me, with the prevalence of Covid-19, that this support could be needed beyond then in terms of financial and economic requirements and impact.</p>  <p>  I also take Deputy Kelly's broader point.  I have gone through some of the work of Thomas Picketty, for example, which outlines how, globally and throughout Europe, those on higher incomes have got proportionately more over the decades compared with those on lower incomes.  There is an obligation on the State to work towards bridging that gap and giving people a decent wage with decent entitlements such as sick pay.  The Government is working on that and we want to work constructively with the legislation Deputy Kelly has brought forward.  That was our intention at Cabinet yesterday - not to dismiss it but to recognise the need for a serious engagement with unions, employers and all concerned to see how we can devise a more structured sick pay regime within our overall pay and entitlement framework in this country.</p>  <p>  On the sectoral issues, the Government appealed the High Court decision in regard to the sectoral pay awards.  We are keen to protect the rights that have been enshrined in the various orders.</p>  <p>  In regard to the Debenhams situation, I have met a number of workers on a number of occasions.  I do not approve of strike breaking or any approach like that.  It is not going to resolve these issues.  The union involved has been seeking to resolve the matter.  What I do not want to do either is walk people up a hill by pretending we can do everything.  The workers now know that is not the case.  Whatever we say and do has to be grounded in reality.</p></speech>

It oversees the implementation of the programme for Government commitments in regard to the environment and climate change and receives detailed reports on identified priority areas, including the annual climate action plan.  Its initial focus is to oversee the immediate priority areas identified in the programme for Government.  These include the climate action (amendment) Bill, the development of a national retrofitting plan, just transition and support for moving to a higher rate of renewable energy.  In addition, it considers progress made on the implementation of the current climate action plan.</p>  <p>  The next meeting of the Cabinet committee will take place in the near future.</p></reply>

I was quite disappointed with it on a number of levels.  There are issues I raised with the Taoiseach, some of them very sensitive and important, which he did not see fit to include.  The programme for Government commits to introducing a climate action Bill within 100 days of the formation of the Government.  Will that happen?  It is 88 days today since the Government was formed and it is running out of time.  It will be a comprehensive Bill and if it is not brought forward next week, the Government will not meet its deadline.  I am not sure how seriously this issue is being taken.  In the debate on our Sick Leave and Parental Leave (Covid-19) Bill 2020 earlier today, the mantra we heard from three Ministers was that rushed legislation is bad legislation.  It seems that the climate action Bill will be a fairly last-minute one.</p></speech>

The programme for Government commits to an average seven-year reduction in emissions and will define how five-year carbon budgets will be set.  It provides that a net emissions target for 2050 will be set out in law.  The longer those provisions are delayed, the harder it is going to be to implement them.  I believe there will be a delay in getting this done.  It is something I strongly support and want to support.  I was the person, as Minister, who brought in the initial climate change legislation, making Ireland only the second country in Europe to do so, and I signed up to the Conference of the Parties, COP, on behalf of this country.</p> <p>When will it be introduced?  Will the Taoiseach inform the House on which date inn the next two weeks it will be brought in and when it will go to Government?</p> <p> The Taoiseach has already flagged that carbon tax will increase again this year.  How will we ensure fuel poverty is dealt with?  Will the Government ensure the fuel allowance is increased?  Will it commit to increasing the fuel allowance season?  Four extra weeks were granted last year.  Will the fuel allowance apply from October to April again this year?</p> <p> What is the position regarding the just transition group that has been set up?  On a personal level, I remind the Taoiseach that Littleton, County Tipperary, is not to be forgotten about as part of that process.  The plant there had to close its operation as part of this process as well.  The midlands are often talked about where peat production is concerned but Littleton, as I am sure the Taoiseach is aware, is another area that was badly affected.  I had to fight to have it included in the just transition work.</p></speech>

During our exchange he gave an undertaking that the Government would engage with Electric Ireland on the matter.  I wrote to him subsequently raising the matter again and last week I raised it again to follow up on the outcome of those Government discussions.  At that time, the Taoiseach informed me he had passed the matter on to the Minister with responsibility for climate action, communications networks and transport, Deputy Ryan.  I wrote to the Minister last week seeking details of the response from Electric Ireland to his discussions but he has yet to respond.  I am asking a very simple question and I am at a loss as to why we are going around the houses on this.  I ask that the Taoiseach expedite this matter in order that I can have a report on what Electric Ireland said to him because these price hikes are looming in early October.</p>  <p>  I have one additional matter to raise.  The programme for Government makes a number of commitments in respect of protecting and developing Ireland's biodiversity.  The National Biodiversity Data Centre programme was established by the Heritage Council in 2016.  Included in its work is the hugely successful all-Ireland pollinator plan.  This initiative, with the support of Tidy Towns and the local authorities, has heightened awareness of biodiversity in every community across the island.  Despite this, this organisation is not underpinned by legislation and operates with a very uncertain funding framework.  Staff on the project have significant knowledge and specialised skill sets.  Will the Taoiseach bring the work of the National Biodiversity Data Centre into the Heritage Council and underpin the organisation and its objectives in legislation?</p></speech>

I have already asked that that proposal be abandoned.  I have a positive environmental, climate action proposal to put forward.  If the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, accepted that the ten-year rule for replacing vehicles should be extended to 12 years to avoid financially penalising taxi drivers who might have to replace their taxis, that would also give them time to do something the taxi drivers would very much support, provided the State did it properly and gave them support, namely, electrifying the entire taxi fleet.  This has been done in London.  There are vehicles that are suitable, although the Government would have to do something about the vehicle registration tax, VRT, and give significant grants.  In the interregnum that we now have due to new restrictions and Covid, the Government could kill two birds with one stone.  We could have a just transition whereby the taxi drivers are not punished by the Government but actually helped through this difficult period, while also using the interregnum to plan for the electrification of the entire taxi fleet.  If I had more time, I would talk about the electrification of the bus fleet which should also be considered.  That is a serious proposal whereby the Government could help the taxi drivers who are now in trouble and also plan for the future by reducing CO2 emissions from cars.</p></speech>

It will also establish the climate action council on an independent statutory footing and ensure greater gender balance and increased scientific experience and expertise in its membership.  The objective is to have the Bill ready and published within 100 days, give or take a day or two.</p>  <p>  On the issue of County Tipperary, Deputy Kelly will note that the Minister with responsibility for housing, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, got a &euro;20 million initiative through Cabinet this week for retrofitting in designated local authority housing estates across the midlands and County Tipperary, as well as other counties.  Those estates will be identified by the respective local authorities.  This is the first significant part of the just transition response and it is needed to energise some of the county councils to develop capacity to deliver retrofitting programmes in their counties.  That is something we want to expand more with local authority housing and an expanded programme of retrofitting across the country.  A lot of skilling up of personnel will be needed as well to enable them to do that.  We also want to create incentives for the private sector to engage in the retrofitting programme.</p>  <p>  On utility bills, as Deputy McDonald knows, there is no mystery to how utility bills are devised.  The regulator has a key role in that.  Very often, the regulator becomes the Government overnight in terms of how issues are presented.</p>  <p>  I am a great advocate of the all-Ireland pollinator plan.  It does very significant work.  I will talk to the Minister about the issues the Deputy has raised around the legislative underpinning of the National Biodiversity Data Centre.</p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett raised issues related to the carbon tax, as did Deputy Kelly.  Under the Government's programme, substantial amounts of funding will be raised from the tax over the next decade or so.  It will be potentially up to &euro;9.5 billion over a ten-year period.  The idea is that &euro;3 billion of that will be available to prevent fuel poverty and ensure a just transition.  That will involve the fuel allowance rate and other issues related to that.  It will also involve substantial funding for retrofitting and the national retrofit plan.  Funding will also be provided for a rural environment protection scheme and a rural environmental plan separate from the Common Agricultural Policy, which will be designed to incentivise farmers on the issue of biodiversity farming practice that would be good for the climate and for protecting biodiversity in the country.  While this did not have total agreement, there was agreement on it among parties which were genuinely committed to the environment and getting something done on it.  Last year, the increase in the carbon tax raised &euro;90 million which was used to protect the vulnerable.  It was also used for the just transition and investing in the low-carbon transition.  Also last year, &euro;20 million was spent on the fuel allowance and &euro;13 million on energy poverty efficiency upgrades.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government sets out the broad thrust of how we intend to divide up any carbon tax revenue.</p> <p>We intend to hypothecate it and ring-fence it so the taxpayer is clear that the money raised on a carbon tax will be used for express purposes with a view to achieving our climate change targets while protecting those on low incomes and social protection payments through the fuel allowance and retrofitting, which will give long-term savings to those in local authority housing who would benefit from a good, comprehensive retrofit programme.</p> <p> To respond to Deputy Boyd Barrett's question on bus lanes, my sense is he has wronged the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and I know this would not be his intention.  He has never said that taxis would be barred from bus lanes.  He told me he did not know where that suggestion came from.  He has met the Irish Taxi Drivers Federation and is anxious to work with it.  Some of the issues raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett last week and the week before are matters that are under consideration.  The Minister is very disposed to the idea of electrifying, over time, the taxi fleet but this could not happen without the type of supports the Deputy has suggested and identified.  One has to work with the industry in pursuing these objectives and aims.  The Minister is clear that his engagement with the Irish Taxi Drivers Federation and representatives of taxi drivers will continue on these issues and, in terms of the future, how they can make a contribution to the overall effort to decarbonise the economy itself.</p></speech>

This was the first plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council since November 2016.  It provided the new Irish Government and the restored Northern Ireland Executive the opportunity to meet formally for the first time and exchange views on a wide range of issues of mutual concern, including Covid-19 and Brexit.</p>  <p>  I took the opportunity to emphasise the Government's full support for preserving and strengthening North-South co-operation and the Government's commitment to ensuring the New Decade, New Approach agreement is implemented in full.  I also briefed the council on my plans for a shared island unit in the Department of the Taoiseach.</p>  <p>  The Government is focused on working with the Executive through the North-South Ministerial Council to deliver projects that benefit people throughout the island, including greater connectivity between North and South, investing in the north-west region and Border communities and supporting reconciliation as an integral part of the peace process.</p>  <p>  I also spoke with the First Minister and deputy First Minister by phone on Wednesday, 9 September, to discuss political developments on Brexit relating to the publication by the United Kingdom Government of the draft internal market Bill.  I expressed my deep concern at this development, which is a unilateral attempt to undermine the withdrawal agreement and the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland.  This is completely unacceptable and risks seriously eroding and damaging political trust in Northern Ireland in our bilateral relations and between the United Kingdom and the European Union.</p>  <p>  I have also discussed these issues by phone with Colum Eastwood, the leader of the SDLP.  I have also indicated that I will work with all leaders of other political parties.  I received an invitation to a meeting and we are endeavouring to organise or schedule that, or some mechanism by which I can talk to each individual leader again on these issues.</p>  <p>  We also discussed the practical impact of Brexit for Ireland and Northern Ireland and I assured them of my ongoing commitment to working with them to advance prosperity on this island.</p></reply>

Meetings such as this are exceptionally important and I hope it will be a productive and helpful incentive for all.</p>  <p>  There is no doubt that Downing Street is actively pursuing a path of betrayal by reneging on what has already been agreed and inflicting potentially irreversible harm on the North's economy, undermining the power-sharing administration and the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach listed the names of some of the party leaders in the North with whom he had spoken.  Has he specifically spoken with the DUP leader regarding the comments she made that her party will also work to try to change the protocol included in the withdrawal agreement?  The Government's priorities must be to avoid any border on the island of Ireland, protect our peace process and the Good Friday Agreement and work on an all-Ireland economy basis.</p></speech>

We have consistently called for a new Ireland forum to examine these issues.  To cut straight to the chase, the Taoiseach spoke about telling our colleagues in Northern Ireland about the shared island unit in the Department.  What details did he go into with them?  We do not have a huge amount of detail ourselves so it would be interesting to know what details the Taoiseach went into with them.</p>  <p>  With regard to the withdrawal agreement and Arlene Foster, there was a bit of a schemozzle between the First Minister and some of her colleagues when she said she recognised the reality of the withdrawal agreement and then Sammy Wilson came out and said the complete opposite.  In the Taoiseach's engagement with Ms Foster, what was the outcome of those discussions as regards where she was going to go on this at that juncture?  Obviously she was going in a certain direction, recognising the "reality" of the withdrawal agreement, but was then perhaps overtaken by other comments and other political possibilities or realities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-23a.245" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1478" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="13:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300025#X00900"><p>In the Taoiseach's engagements with representatives of the Assembly he should consider engaging with our MLA, Gerry Carroll.  People Before Profit in the North and South brings a unique perspective that goes back to Connolly and Wolfe Tone on the possibility of uniting Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter in a project to fight for a different type of Ireland.  If we look at the reckless behaviour of Boris Johnson and, for that matter, Arlene Foster, with the health and economic welfare of the North, there has never been a more opportune time to begin to break the grip of Unionism and argue for the unity of Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter in a fight for a different type of Ireland.</p>  <p>  Gerry Carroll would tell the Taoiseach that if we are to make that case, and we should, to unite working people for a different project and end partition, we also need to tackle the legacies of what Connolly called the carnival of reaction down here.  They are manifest.  I mentioned the case of St. Mary's Centre Telford, whereby religious organisations are turfing vulnerable disabled women out of nursing homes and social housing.</p> <p>In the past week, I heard the religious order in St. Laurence College, Ballybrack, is selling off the playing fields of a publicly funded school, similar to what happened in Clonkeen College with the Christian Brothers.  If one was in the North, beginning to question unionism and loyalty to the likes of Boris Johnson, one's questioning would be checked if one looked down South and still saw the rule of religious organisations, taking facilities away from school kids, as well as elderly and disabled women, while the State allowed it to happen.</p> <p> If we are going to fight for a united Republic and end partition, surely we have to be seen to take the lead on matters like separating Church and State to show we are a progressive and modern Republic and, in my opinion, trying to fight for a socialist Republic which James Connolly, whose statue is behind me in this House, argued we should do many years ago.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding if somebody was pro-Brexit or pro-remain, everyone shares a pragmatic view that the least damage possible should be done to workers, employers, the economy and the social fabric of this island as a result of Brexit.  The ultimate deal between the UK and the European Union does matter in terms of the well-being of people for the long-term on this island.  That is what informs my response.</p><p>It has informed my response to the unacceptable behaviour of the British Government in coming forward with the internal market Bill and notwithstanding its new-found alleged concerns about aspects of the Northern Ireland protocol and withdrawal agreement, which I do not accept.  Those concerns could easily have been resolved in the context of the joint committee set up especially between the EU and UK to deal with the practicalities of working out the Northern Ireland protocol.  Some progress had been made on that already in terms of facilities and funding provided for customs and facilities in the North in terms of declarations, SPS, sanitary and phytosanitary, and all of that.</p><p>The European Union is very clear that it does not want to fall into any preordained strategy or react in a knee-jerk way.  It will remain firm on the fundamentals, however.  The joint committee met and there has been engagement between the European Union and the United Kingdom on this issue.  It has not been resolved, however.  I made it very clear to the British Prime Minister, as has the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, to his counterpart, on the Irish Government's position on this.  While the British Government's response is contradictory to the reality of the Bill, it is adamant it does not want to affect, in any shape or form, the seamless interaction of goods and services North and South.  It does not want to create any situation that would erect any barriers on that front.  On the broad thrust of the withdrawal agreement, it is still asserting that it is committed to its implementation.</p><p>There is a distance to go yet.  It really boils down to a will on behalf of the British Government as to whether it wants to do a deal or not.  The European Union will do a deal but it has to be a fair one, based on resolving the state-aid issue, which could be resolved, governance structures around any future trade agreement and ensuring adherence to commitments.  Obviously, the decision of the British Government to introduce this Bill has eroded trust with those it is negotiating with, including ourselves.</p><p>The First Minister and deputy First Minister are aware of the implications of all this for the North and the island as a whole.  I have always been of the view that we should engage with the reality of what is before us.  People voted for Brexit.  We are not going to undo Brexit in the short term.  Our objective is to protect the livelihoods of people on this island.  That is what we will do in the next budget, based on a no-deal Brexit.  We hope that is proven wrong.  We are telling businesses to prepare for a no-deal Brexit and in any event to prepare for customs and the need for declarations, even if we have a basic free trade agreement without tariffs or quotas.</p><p>I have appraised them of the principles behind the shared island unit.  There was a good series of articles recently in <i>The Irish Times</i>around the whole theme.  The unit has been established and we are beefing it up with new people being recruited and deployed.  It will be involved in a number of different strands of work.  Some will be commissioning research and some will be outreaching and engaging in dialogue with different perspectives and people from different backgrounds, irrespective of their views on constitutional or political issues, to see how we can share this island in a better and more effective way across many fronts into the future.  There is rich potential for us to do that.</p><p>I have no difficulty with meeting with Deputy Boyd Barrett's MLA to get his perspectives.  I accept the Deputy's long-standing commitment to a non-sectarian view of how the island should develop.</p><p>Our education system is evolving too.  There is far greater State involvement in our education system now than there would have been historically.  Religious orders did play a significant role historically in the evolution and development of our education system and continue to do so.  It was a Fianna F&aacute;il Minister, the late Paddy Hillery, who brought in comprehensible and community schools.  Mary Hanafin brought in the State primary school system through the VECs.</p><p>I take the Deputy's point that some service providers have capacity issues both in education and health.  I favour a stronger State input in health, social services and education.  That said, we have pluralist system in education where we have different patrons, the Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland and other denominations, as well as Educate Together and Gaelscoileanna.  Our view has been to facilitate different patrons to set up schools and give choice to parents insofar as is practical in given locations.</p></speech>

I am looking to draw attention to two particular cases.  There has long been a belief among the population of Dundalk and County Louth that we do not have a mental health service that is fit for purpose.</p>  <p>  Ian Browne was 25 years old when he died by suicide on Thursday, 14 March 2019.  On Tuesday, 12 March, Ian spoke to his counsellor, who referred him to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital's emergency department so he could get the equivalent of a doctor's note and be brought into the psychiatric service in Crosslanes.  He presented himself to the service in Crosslanes and was assessed.  I am told a document of between 12 and 14 pages was written up.  He was told he would not be seen; he told them he was suicidal.  He said he had taken sleeping tablets.  He got a dual diagnosis, which was a problem.  He came back up the next day with a doctor's note and again was told to go away.  It was three weeks before he was dealt with.  The end result was that he was sent away with leaflets for another place where he could go for treatment that was not a State service.  He just felt like there was no one there for him.</p>  <p>  On Saturday, we had an event organised on the basis of a similar issue we had with Harry Taaffe.  Harry presented himself to the service in Crosslanes, told them he was suicidal and was sent home with medication.  I accept that hospitalisation is not always what is necessary, but he was told community care would not be available to him for four to six weeks.  The following Sunday, Harry killed himself.</p>  <p>  We have had a number of these issues.  We need to check what the protocols are and whatever other resources are required so the people of Dundalk have a better service than we have at the moment.</p></speech>

As I speak, another family in my constituency is trying to come to terms with the untimely death of their 16-year-old daughter.  There is another community gripped by grief and it just is not right.  It is every parent's worst nightmare to see their own flesh and blood feel so lost and down and to see no way out.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, I have seen a significant rise in the numbers in recent months, particularly since Covid took a grip of this country, and age and gender are no barriers.  Within my constituency, the numbers are high and the age profile is young.  Today I talk about a 16-year-old girl.  Last week it was an 18-year-old young man.  A number of weeks before that it was another 18-year-old man and before that, one family in Cavan town lost two members of their family, a brother and sister, to suicide a week apart. </p>  <p>  There are wonderful people on the ground who are exemplary in terms of their volunteerism and while there is help from the HSE and Pieta House, it is still not enough.  I feel passionately that as a county and constituency, we need statutory help.  We need the help of an organisation like Jigsaw.  I have mentioned this to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, before.   We are all new to this position of being in government but while on the Opposition benches, I also made this point.  We also need the help of a suicide crisis assessment nurse, known as a SCAN nurse.  Such a nurse would provide assistance and support immediately so that when people go to their general practitioner, they are given a contact person immediately and are not sent to an accident and emergency unit or put on a waiting list but can be attended to immediately. </p>  <p>  I ask for three things today, namely, further help in primary care psychologist support; a SCAN nurse to be allocated to Cavan-Monaghan; and for the Minister of State to look seriously at the potential of putting Jigsaw into Cavan-Monaghan.</p></speech>

Any loss of life through suicide is a tragedy and I do not want to class the people the Deputies have brought to the floor of the D&aacute;il as being merely "any life".  It is their life and it is their families who have been affected.  Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; spoke about two individuals, from the Taaffe and Browne families, and Deputy Niamh Smyth did not mention names but referred to the age profile and gender of the individuals from her constituency.  There is not a constituency in the country that has not been hit by suicide or that does not contain family members who are grieving the loss of a loved one at this moment.  Deputy Smyth talked about multiple suicides in families and that is not an unusual case either, unfortunately.  That grief really knocks the community so much in such a short space of time.</p>  <p>  I have a script to hand and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, sends her apologies.  She would like to have been here to answer the Deputies.  I know she has spoken to Deputy Smyth in respect of Jigsaw and she told me to assure the Deputies that she is taking both requests in relation to Jigsaw on board.  On the SCAN nurse and the primary care psychology support, I will also relay those issues back to Deputy Butler.  I will read the script that was presented to me but I will take on board that Deputy &Oacute; Murch&uacute; would like to know about the protocols, because that is important.  It is important the protocols are not just read out here but that a meeting be convened with Deputy Butler, in conjunction with the HSE and the local community healthcare organisation, CHO, on the ground in order that there is a clear understanding around protocols and deliverable, tangible actions.   </p>  <p>  Each suicide affects not just family and friends, but the community itself.  It is important to ensure that strong supports are in place to help family, friends and the community to deal with a tragedy.  Protection of the vulnerable continues to be a Government priority, especially in challenging times, and those with mental health issues are often among the most vulnerable in society.  Tackling suicide is an important element of this.  Connecting for Life is Ireland's national strategy to reduce suicide.  Although it is due to end this year, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, intends to bring a memo to Cabinet in the next couple of weeks, recommending the extension of the strategy to 2024.  Implementation of Connecting for Life has involved a cross-departmental, cross-sectoral approach, overseen by the Department of Health.  The HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP, was specifically established to co-ordinate suicide prevention efforts around the country and to implement the Connecting for Life strategy.  NOSP funding has increased from &euro;3.7 million in 2010 to the current level of &euro;13 million and an extra &euro;2.75 million was provided in 2015 for additional resource officers for suicide prevention and for priority actions under Connecting for Life, including in Louth, Cavan and Monaghan. </p>  <p>  I cannot comment on individual cases other than to express my deepest sympathies to every one of them and to others listening in who have lost family members through suicide.  Whether today or in the past, the grief never leaves them and I acknowledge that.  In Ireland, a coroner decides whether someone has died by suicide.  This is a legal decision, not a medical determination made by doctors or the HSE.  The Central Statistics Office publishes national data on deaths by suicide based on coroners' findings.</p>  <p>  A key part of Connecting for Life, CFL, is development of local CFL plans.  All 17 plans have now been launched, including the Cavan and Monaghan Suicide Prevention Action Plan 2017-2020 and similar plans for Laois and Offaly; Longford and Westmeath; and Louth and Meath.  The local plans were developed in collaboration with the whole community. </p>  <p>  I am happy to bring any situations of the type raised by the Deputies to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler. </p></speech>

The reason I referred to those two families was that they did what we tell people to do.  If one has problems, one is told to present to the correct services and they will deal with it.  It seems that this did not happen in these cases.  I welcome what the Minister of State said regarding a possible follow-up meeting with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, involving the head of the local CHO and whoever else needs to be there.  We need a facility for answers for families but also in respect of these protocols because it is about the service we have at present.  We have the wider issue in relation to resources, allocation and the number of acute beds but that is for another day.  At this point, it is about people presenting and it is about ensuring they are given a service, that we do not let them down and we have their back.</p></speech>

I ask that she come to Cavan to meet people on the front line dealing with these situations.  Prevention is what we all want.  I request we have more resources put in psychologist support in primary care, that we get a SCAN nurse provided for Cavan-Monaghan and that we get Jigsaw.  These are the things we need, from talking to professionals on the ground who are providing youth intervention mental health services.  It is critically important, as the Minister of State can see from the numbers I have read out.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the work of Emer Mulligan, resource officer and suicide prevention officer for the HSE and is doing amazing work on the ground with families and communities; of Gerry Soden, health and well-being officer with the GAA, providing immense support for communities and clubs around the country; and of Kathryn McAree, who works with Pieta House providing bereavement services for families afterwards.  </p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to relay those points to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler.</p></speech>

They have come with solutions and suggestions and I take on board everything Deputy Smyth has said and I think the convening of a meeting will ensure the protocols are reiterated and there is a clear understanding.  CFL is about connecting the community.  Deputy Smyth has mentioned the involvement of the local HSE, the GAA and Pieta House and that is what CFL is about.</p> <p>It is important that we also continue to build resilience in all communities to reduce the incidence of suicide.  It is also important to ensure, where such a tragedy occurs, that we have sufficient supports in place to help those who need them.  The HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention works closely with the CHOs, local agencies and communities to deliver strategies and services in the most appropriate manner, in line with available resources and evolving services.  Deputies can rest assured that I will relay their concerns and requests regarding this matter to the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and I am sure she will be more than happy to facilitate a meeting.  </p></speech>

I raise the issue of the Moria refugee camp on the island of Lesbos in Greece.  As the Minister of State is aware, a fire two weeks ago destroyed the camp and people were left destitute.  All their belongings were destroyed and thousands of people are now without any kind of shelter on the island.  This is a humanitarian crisis that has been festering for many years and has not been addressed by the Greek Government or the EU.</p><p>The situation is now also set against the spectre of Covid-19.  An outbreak has happened and 35 people in the camp have tested positive.  This is an ongoing situation and the conditions are beyond inhumane.  An Irish doctor, Dr. Claire Dunne, works on the island for M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, MSF.  She paints a particularly dark and stark picture of life in the camp, and she wrote an article in the<i>Irish Examiner </i>last year, which is deeply troubling to read, to say the least.  I refer to children's mental health from living in the camp and all that comes with that.  Children and adults there have already fled from war, persecution and poverty.  </p><p>Nearly 12,000 refugees are living in the camp and they have all fled from the types of situations to which I referred.  Some 4,000 of the refugees are children and 400 of those are unaccompanied children.  As the site was originally built for 3,000 people, it now has four times the number of people it was designed to cater for.  I seek a comment from the Minister of State regarding what Ireland intends to do in response to this situation.  Germany stated last week that it will take 1,500 migrants from the camp, which is welcome.  I know the Minister with responsibility for equality and integration, Deputy O'Gorman, stated that four unaccompanied minors will come to the State in the weeks to come.  While this is welcome, I make the point that representatives of MSF have stated that Ireland and other EU member states have simply not done anything like enough regarding this issue.  It has been left to fester for a long time but, thankfully, no one was killed in the fire.  Thousands of people, however, have been left destitute.  What will Ireland's response be in the weeks and months to come to take in some of the children and adults from this camp?</p></speech>

Thankfully, no one in the camp was injured or killed as a result of the fire but I suspect that was just sheer luck.  Ireland strongly supports the principle of solidarity and recognises that assistance is required for member states that face a disproportionate number of applicants and where incidents such as this can cause additional hardship.  Officials in the Department of Justice and Equality are currently considering how and if we can accommodate a small number of families, in addition to the commitment already made to accept four unaccompanied minors from the camp, which was announced by the Minister with responsibility for equality and integration, Deputy O'Gorman, on 17 September.  Consideration is being given at EU level to the legal mechanisms by which this can be done.</p>  <p>  In a previous gesture of solidarity, Ireland committed to accepting up to 36 unaccompanied minors from Greece.  Eight of these young people arrived in Ireland in June and are now in the care of Tusla.  More broadly, to date, more than 3,350 people have arrived in the State under the first phase of the Irish refugee protection programme, IRPP.  Last December, a second phase was announced, giving a commitment to welcome a further 2,900 refugees between this year and 2023 through a combination of resettlement and community sponsorship.  The refugee arrivals this year and next will largely comprise Syrian nationals resident in Jordan and Lebanon, together with a pilot group of 150 Eritrean refugees currently resident in Ethiopia.  </p>  <p>  The impact of Covid-19 has unfortunately impacted on the timeframe for these arrivals but the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and the Department are committed to realising the State's commitments in line with our obligations under the IRPP.  Officials are engaging with international partners to share a collective experience of how best to resume arrivals and the lessons learned to date.  Preparations are under way for the arrival of the next cohort of refugees but a precise timeframe cannot yet be attached to this endeavour.</p>  <p>  A new pact on migration and asylum has been published today by the European Commission.  It aims to provide a comprehensive approach to migration management that is sustainable, humane and effective and which can work well on a day-to-day basis and withstand current pressures, as well as the challenges of the future.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, welcomes the publication of the new pact, which will strengthen the EU's capacity to respond to the challenges that migration poses and minimise the impact that it has on the lives of those who migrate and the communities into which they move.</p></speech>

It has allowed people to drown in the Mediterranean.  That is a fact.  It has also allowed this camp on Lesbos to fester.  Pictures on BBC and RT&Eacute; television of people living in the camp show them living in conditions worse than those for animals and the EU has let that happen.</p>  <p>  I refer the Minister of State to the EU's commitment.  Ireland has stated that it will only undertake to accept 36 children from this camp but only eight children have been accepted thus far.  Why is progress so slow?  I refer back to Dr. Claire Dunne's analysis of the camp.  She stated that EU member states should show solidarity and give people sanctuary, which is what they are asking for, and not to be treated like animals.  Ireland should respond better than it has done and should take more of these unaccompanied children.  I cannot comprehend what it is like to be in such a situation without parents.  We should hold out our hands, accept more children from this situation and give people hope and a home.  </p></speech>

I understand that the difficulty has been with the impact of Covid-19 but the Department will now step up, try to resolve the situation, get those children to Ireland and give them the support they desperately need.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, is very much aware of this situation and will ensure that those unaccompanied minors can be facilitated to come here, despite the situation with Covid-19.</p>  <p>  As I said at the outset, officials are currently considering how and if we can accommodate a small number of families as a gesture of solidarity.  We also have existing commitments regarding refugee resettlement under the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR-led, programme.  This will include 650 refugee resettlements this year, 700 next year, 750 in 2022 and 800 in 2023.  Families already resident here may also apply to bring their family members to Ireland under the family reunification policy or family reunification provisions of the International Protection Act 2015.  I understand that the new EU pact on migration and asylum contains a comprehensive series of actions, including some new legislative proposals, across the full range of migration policies, including addressing the root causes of migration, the reform of the common European asylum system, crisis preparedness and response, co-operation and partnership with third countries.</p>  <p>  The proposals, including the legislative initiatives, will require careful consideration regarding their implications for Ireland but we will continue to be a constructive participant in the negotiation process.  I assure the Deputy that I will bring his concerns to the attention of the Minister, Deputy McEntee. </p></speech>

This is obviously a wider issue given the fact that two Deputies from different constituencies are here to speak on this issue.</p>  <p>  Five people were killed in accidents with quads and scramblers between 2014 and 2018, three of whom were under 18.  We have gone back and forth on this.  A few years back, there was an inter-agency, interdepartmental working group on the matter but the Garda still struggles with enforcement.  It says that it needs more powers to be able to enforce effectively the regulations on quads and scramblers which, as we are seeing, are dangerous pieces of equipment.</p>  <p>  Another aspect is that there is little traceability or responsibility of ownership of quads and scramblers.  Social media videos can speak to that.  If one buys a car, another dangerous motor vehicle, there is a logbook which adds some level of traceability of ownership and level of responsibility.  We need to look at legislation in this area before we see an increase in the number of people who die.</p></speech>

As Deputy Costello said, we saw the tragic incident of a young child being injured when a scrambler hit a quad bike last week.  A young man died in Ballymun this month.  In 2017, 62 people were injured in quad bike and scrambler accidents.</p>  <p>  The issue is particularly bad in my constituency of Dublin North-West.  In Finglas, Ballymun and many parts of Dublin, the issue is raised time and again.  At every policing forum and joint policing committee, residents complain about the lack of progress and solutions.</p>  <p>  I was delighted to see the issue included in the programme for Government because I had pushed for it.  While it might have been unreasonable to expect to see it in the autumn legislative agenda announced last week, I urge the Department to prepare now to ensure that it is dealt with in the following D&aacute;il term.</p>  <p>  Representatives of the Garda have been clear regarding the legal ambiguities surrounding quad bikes and scramblers.  They have also been honest about the challenges around enforcement.</p>  <p>  It will not be solved by one measure alone.  When I was Lord Mayor of Dublin, I set up a working group which made clear recommendations that were communicated to the Department.  Those recommendations included greater education and changing the rules of evidence to allow for scramblers to be crushed and destroyed.</p>  <p>  A priority of mine will be to ensure that these measures are progressed during the lifetime of this Government.  There will be no getting rid of me on this until we have a solution.  We need the legislation changed before another person is injured or killed and the communities that we represent deserve to be protected.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-23a.266" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300030#HH00400"><p>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  We are all aware that the irresponsible and antisocial use of scramblers and quads can cause death or serious injury, as well as wider disturbance and nuisance.  The incident to which both Deputies alluded is a good example of the dangers involved.  Many of these vehicles are used by minors and are provided to them by family members and others, who are also acting irresponsibly, putting the users and others at risk.</p>  <p>  As Minister of State, I have responsibility for legislation in the area of vehicles and the area of traffic on public roads.  Scrambler motorbikes and quadricycle bikes are classed as mechanically-propelled vehicles.  It is an offence to supply a mechanically-propelled vehicle to anyone under the age of 16, and to supply one to a person under 17 unless it is a vehicle of a class which can legally be driven by a 16 year old.  "Supply" in this context covers selling, renting, loaning, giving as a gift, or any other form of making the vehicle available to a minor.</p>  <p>  Under road traffic legislation, the user of a scrambler or quad in a public place must have insurance, road tax and a driving licence and must also wear a helmet.  There are stringent penalties under the road traffic laws for not being in compliance with these requirements.  For the purposes of the Road Traffic Acts, a "public place" means any public road and any street, road or other place to which the public has access with vehicles whether as of right or by permission and whether subject to or free of charge.  Road traffic legislation does not extend to private property, including municipal or other publicly-owned parks which are under the control of local authorities and subject to their bye-laws.</p>  <p>  Enforcement of legislation is the responsibility of the Garda.  If a person supplies a vehicle to a minor or uses a quad bike or scrambler in a public place without tax or insurance, or in contravention of any other law, the Garda has the legal powers to address these matters.  The laws available to address the scrambler problem include not only those under my Department but also public order legislation under the Department of Justice and Equality which can be applied in parks.  Local authorities have the power to introduce bye-laws to prohibit the use of vehicles in areas under their control.  The unauthorised use of off-road vehicles is prohibited in certain national parks and the Minister with responsibility for rural and Gaeltacht affairs has powers to prohibit their unauthorised use.</p>  <p>  We know that the problem of antisocial and dangerous behaviour involving scramblers and quads continues.  This raises questions of how best to tackle the problem and one aspect of that is looking at whether changes to legislation would help.  A working group was set up by the Department of Justice and Equality that looked at a cross-agency approach to tackling the illegal use of quad bikes and scramblers during 2019.  The group includes representatives from my Department, as well as the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Courts Service and the Garda.  One option considered related to the fact that the Road Traffic Acts apply to a "public place", a legal term which does not include a public park.  As many of the problems with scramblers and quads arise in public parks, there were suggestions that redefining a public place to include a public park might help by extending certain Garda powers into parks.  However, following legal advice, it became clear that this would create serious unintended consequences.  The concept of a public place is fundamental to traffic law and redefining a park as a public place would mean extending a vast body of traffic law into parks with a wide range of consequent legal difficulties.  It is most likely that a comprehensive solution will have to involve a range of measures including legislation, enforcement and public education, as the Deputies have outlined.</p></speech>

A Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill appeared in the August legislative calendar to provide for a variety of road safety-related measures.  It would be timely if we could include in that new Bill even something small that would enable the Garda to work and improve its response in this area.</p>  <p>  This also seems to be an opportune time to legislate for e-scooters and it would be helpful if those things could be included in the Road Traffic (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.</p></speech>

We need to get all the Departments into a room and start looking for solutions to this problem because, as I said, there is not only one solution.  The Minister of State has highlighted some of the potential solutions but the fact that there is no responsibility on parents who buy young children these bikes for Christmas or birthdays needs to be tackled.  If a bike is seized by the Garda, parents can collect it the next day, or it goes out to auction and the bike is back on the street.  We can end that with cross-departmental action.</p>  <p>  There are a number of measures on which we can take strong action, including legislation and the definition of a public place.  In my area of Finglas, Tesco Ireland agreed to prevent the sale of petrol to under 18s.  We could challenge fuel suppliers right across the country to do the same.</p>  <p>  I believe that a child using a scrambler bike is a matter of parental neglect and Tusla should be involved in cases where it is concerned.</p></speech>

As I stated, under the Road Traffic Acts, there are already comprehensive measures in place for the Garda to deal with vehicles, including scramblers, quads and similar vehicles, in public places.  In addition, there are also forms of legislation which allow for dealing with them outside public places and anyone supplying them to a minor can be prosecuted.  Alternatives have been considered and I understand that the working group on this matter met earlier this year and is to meet again next week to review the situation.  If a viable proposal that would help us to protect the public from dangerous and improper use of these vehicles were to emerge, and it fell within my remit, I would be happy to propose the necessary legislative changes.  This might involve being able to adapt some powers under traffic law to be used in parks, without the major unintended consequences which come from the redefinition of a public place.</p> <p> I have to add that whatever laws are used, whether they come from the transport or justice remit or other Departments, there will always be difficulty in enforcing them.  The Garda must take account of public safety and chasing scramblers or quads could put the users or bystanders at risk.  This is one of the greatest difficulties with these machines and there are no easy solutions.  It is most likely that a comprehensive solution will involve a range of measures, including perhaps new legislation from the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport or Justice and Equality in the form of public order legislation.  It will also involve enforcement and public education on the purchase and use of these vehicles.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, for being here today to discuss this matter.</p>  <p>  Athenry has a population of just over 5,000 people and the town has doubled in size over the past 20 years.  Oranmore also has a population of about 5,000 people and the population has doubled over the past 20 years.  The development of a new town, Ardaun, on the periphery of Galway city connecting Galway to Oranmore, will see a projected population of 18,000 people.  In the next decade we can expect the cumulative total population of those three towns reaching close to 40,000 people. </p>  <p>  The most recent CSO data tell us that there are 1,850 people commuting to Galway city every morning and evening from Athenry and Oranmore and the vast majority of those commutes are made in cars.  If we are deadly serious, as we should be, about effecting a modal shift and encouraging people to leave their cars at home and take public transport, we need to be serious about providing people with a genuine alternative to their cars.  We need to be serious about vastly increasing the frequency of the commuter rail service between Athenry, Oranmore, Ardaun and the city of Galway.  In doing so, I am convinced we can and should encourage people to make that modal shift.  </p>  <p>  We need to give people genuine alternatives to getting into their cars each morning in all of those towns and finding themselves, along with thousands of others, sitting for a very long time on the eastern edge of Galway city as they make their way into the city.  While we are all working hard as best we can to see the development of the outer bypass of Galway city, that will not solve the problem of the accumulation of cars every morning on the eastern side of the city going to one single location, namely, the Parkmore Industrial Estate where the vast majority of people commuting into the city from that eastern side are working.  </p>  <p>  We need commuter trains departing in both directions every 15 minutes.  Irish Rail is ambitious to see this development happening.  I understand the National Transport Authority, NTA, is equally ambitious around this development.  Mr. Jim Meade outlined in a presentation to the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport in 2018 that it was an ambition of Irish Rail to develop a better service between Athenry and Galway and that double tracking the line would facilitate the development of a better service.</p>  <p>  In addition, this will require significant investment on the part of Irish Rail.  It is an investment that needs to be made and makes absolute sense in terms of its sustainability, of vastly improving the quality of life of people residing in those times and of good value for taxpayer.  We also need to ensure that any further investment we make in Irish Rail infrastructure in the west of Ireland is made in the best possible interests of rail users and the taxpayer.  </p>  <p>  I also am anxious to learn when the Minister intends to publish the review of the viability of reinstating a rail service connecting Claremorris to Tuam and onwards to Athenry that was carried out over a year ago.  That review has been with the Department long before the Minister arrived there.  It is critical to have that review in order that we can plan sustainably and efficiently how we can develop build infrastructure in the west of Ireland in the future.  I would argue that these two issues are inextricably linked.</p></speech>

The Government very much shares the ambition for the twin tracking of the rail line between Athenry and Galway city the Deputy mentioned.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government makes a strong commitment to fundamentally change the nature of transport in Ireland, and to deliver on this commitment we need a whole of system perspective across all modes of transport, whether that is active travel, bus or rail.  Getting that whole-of-system perspective requires evidence-based and plan-led transport infrastructure development, as well as transport infrastructure development that integrates with and acts as a catalyst for improved land-use planning.  Land use planning means that local authorities locate houses, jobs and other facilities along high-capacity transport corridors.  That is the framework of many of our EU and international peers and is the framework that can deliver fundamental change for the better.</p>  <p>  In the next few years, I want a real focus on that type of delivery.  There is a transport strategy for Galway, and now a regional, spatial and economic strategy.  There is also a Galway metropolitan area strategy.  It is critical that this connects to land development.  The Deputy mentioned population growth in Athenry, Oranmore, Ardaun and new areas.  It is critical that the connection between new public transport infrastructure and new housing developments goes together.</p>  <p>  Many people are correct in thinking that the capacity of development along the corridor and in those centres is held back by the single track nature of the existing line.  I know of others who consider that there is the potential to develop commuter services along the corridor, and a move to a double track would alleviate the congestion coming into Galway city.  As the Deputy said, there is a particular problem in the Parkmore Industrial Estate with people entering and exiting the estate every morning and evening. </p>  <p>  In a series of meetings I held recently with various stakeholders in the Galway area, this is the one project that everyone agreed needed to be progressed.  It is viewed as a project that can deliver real improvement to people's lives, cut journey times, alleviate congestion and take a large number of private cars off the streets of the city and its suburbs.  I am glad to say that my Department, through the NTA, is this year funding a feasibility study for development options on this rail corridor.  The study will identify the short, medium and long-term capacity improvement options for the Athenry to Galway rail line.  The study will commence by November and will be finished by quarter 2 of 2021.  It will consider all options, including indicating high level costs, and provide recommendations as regards prioritising projects for delivery.</p>  <p>  I fully intend to incorporate the recommendations of that study into the consideration of priorities as we look to review the national development plan.  I want the improvements on the corridor, as well as the development opportunities identified by Deputy Cannon, to be delivered.  He can be assured that my Department is fully supportive of Galway County Council's applications this year to the urban regeneration and development fund for works at Oranmore Station in the meantime.  The project can act as an enabler for compact and sustainable growth in Oranmore and the Galway city region.  The rail improvements planned at Oranmore, however, including the addition of a second platform and a new passing loop, can only deliver short-term improvements to rail services generally in the region.  </p>  <p>  I hope that this response provides the Deputy with an update on the various strands of work under way that will lay the groundwork for significant upgrade and twin tracking of the line in the years to come.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-23a.274" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1483" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Cannon" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300031#JJ00400"><p>I thank the Minister for that very positive response.  It is indeed heartening to hear that the feasibility study for the development of the twin track option will get under way quite quickly and will be completed by quarter 2 of next year.  The land required for the development of that twin track option is already within State ownership under C&oacute;ras Iompair &Eacute;ireann, CI&Eacute;.  One would hope that the feasibility study would arrive at a conclusion that this would be a very positive development and one that could be easily delivered within a relatively short timeframe and at a reasonable cost.</p>  <p>  There is no question but that there is a glaring need for the development of additional commuter rail services.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, has spoken about this on a number of occasions.</p> <p>There is that need there.  I am fully convinced from having spoken to commuters who regularly use that service - I was in Athenry train station this morning heading in the opposite direction - that with the additional frequency one would see a significant amount of additional commuters making the choice to leave their cars at home and hopping on the train from Athenry to Galway, for what is ultimately a very short journey.  I hope to make a submission to the development of the feasibility study.  One particular matter that needs to be addressed in carrying out of that study is for some sort of shuttle bus service connecting Oranmore, because it is a far quicker and more straightforward connection to make to Parkmore, so that ultimately one can get people from door to door to meet their work needs in the future.</p> <p> Finally, I raise with the Minister once again the need to expedite publication of the western rail corridor review.  It is again critical to this particular issue in that we need ultimately to decide where we are going to make necessary investment in our rail infrastructure in the west.  To make those kinds of key decisions we need to have all of the necessary information.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-23a.276" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="14:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300032#KK00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  On the first issue, one of the critical things needed to make this work effectively for the quality of life of people, but also for the economic viability of all of these investments, is that the local authorities all play their part by ensuring that the development plans concentrate development in areas close to public transport hubs.  What makes this a viable proposition is when we integrate land-use and transport planning together.  That is going to be a critical element in making these projects work.</p>  <p>  With regard to the western rail corridor study, I will be answering questions on the same issue tomorrow during priority and oral questions.  I hope that we can publish that report shortly.  I am waiting for a further report from JASPERS, an international organisation which is reviewing the review and I am reviewing it myself in a slightly wider context.  In a series of meetings that I have had with people interested in the project I referred to the fact that if we just look at this in the context of a section of rail line between Claremorris and Athenry, that is a relatively narrative focus.  One has to look at a slightly wider focus as to what is the economic potential for development of the west and north-west of the country and the infrastructure that would best suit that purpose.  It is not just to my mind a question of whether we need a commuter rail service between Tuam or Claremorris into Galway city or to Athenry.  The real consideration is a slightly wider one with regard to the economic development of the whole north-west region and what infrastructure may support that.</p>  <p>  Included in that, I am particularly interested in what the potential is for rail freight developments in the western region and if we are looking at a changed policy as to promoting rather than restricting rail freight, which I think has been the case for the last 30 or 40 years.  I cannot go into the details of that here now but I look forward to engaging with the Deputy.  My focus at the moment is looking at that aspect of it and looking at it in a wider regional context, as well as looking at the content of the two reports he mentioned.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-23a.278" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="14:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300032#KK00400"><p>I will be sharing time with the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton.</p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to address the D&aacute;il on the Covid-19 pandemic and the huge impact it has had on the transport sector in this country.  Since taking on the role of Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in June, myself and the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, have met a series of stakeholders from the transport sector and it is clear that the pandemic has had a catastrophic effect on people working in the industry, on businesses and on the commuters and passengers who use a variety of different transport services.</p>  <p>  We need to bear in mind, in the first instance, the sacrifices many people have made and the work they have done in this past six months.  I want to paise, in particular, the people who have been working in the industry, the bus and train drivers, the pilots and the whole range of different people who throughout the pandemic have been maintaining a public transport service and other essential transport services, so that even in the very difficult months of March, April and May, when the country was by and large working from home and did not have access to services, we still maintained and ran our key ferries, flights and bus services.  This ensured that our shelves were stocked with food and that there was still a skeletal service so that if essential workers and others had to get to work that service was there.  That work, first and foremost, has to be recognised and applauded.</p>  <p>  Over the coming weeks and months our priority is to facilitate the safe operation and the return of domestic and international travel, to protect those jobs and to protect the vital connectivity that the transport system brings to our country, particularly because we are an island nation.</p>  <p>  I draw attention now to the aviation sector, because it is one of the sectors that has been hit worst.  Not just here but in every country across the world there has been a dramatic reduction in the numbers of people flying with a dramatic impact on airlines, on airports, on people whose jobs rely on the airports and on the industrial and other premises that are attached to the aviation sector.  They have been one of the hardest hit sectors in this pandemic.  The question as to when aviation business may be able to resume in a meaningful way is clearly linked to the evolution of the virus, to ongoing travel restrictions and the advisories that may be in place, as well as to the general economic outlook.  The Government is fully committed to protecting core international connectivity and is doing what it can to support the industry having regard to all of the demands of this particular time.  We can, will and have to maintain connectivity.  As an island nation we require, for our own essential purposes and for business connectivity and for a whole range of different needs, to maintain air connectivity into our island and this Government is committing to protecting, delivering and restoring that as best we can.  We have had a number of meetings with key aviation stakeholders and my officials engage with airports and airlines on a continuous basis.</p>  <p>  The Government has put in place a comprehensive suite of generalised supports for companies of all sizes, including those in the aviation sector, covering wage subsidy schemes, grants, low-cost loans, commercial rates write-offs, deferred tax liabilities and liquidity funding as well which is available through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, Pandemic Stabilisation and Recovery Fund.</p>  <p>  We have already implemented several recommendations of the aviation task force, including the publication of safe air travel protocols, and the progression of a European slot waiver for airlines in consultation with European Commission.</p>  <p>  Similar to the aviation sector, the maritime sector is in real trouble because of what has happened with the pandemic.  Its importance is often overlooked but it is critical too, particularly for the development of cargo facilities into our country and to provide people with access to our island.  The sector, while it has had real difficulty because of the pandemic, has proven resilient, competitive and robust right through the crisis.  It continues to provide an essential lifeline to our key markets and a supply of essential goods into the country.  Shipping operators, who I and my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, have met, are clear that their survival is not guaranteed should this pandemic and its associated impacts on international connectivity continue for a prolonged period.  My Department is therefore working to determine what measures we can put in place that will ensure that this sector remains operational through the pandemic with the added complication and challenge of a no-deal Brexit looming.  I am keenly aware that the challenges still remain and they are not just financial ones.  The Department has taken a number of steps to ensure that maritime services continue, such as the facilitation of crew changes and the extension to seafarer certificates.</p>  <p>  Last week the Government announced that Ireland will broadly support the European Commission proposals on both aviation and maritime passengers coming into the country.  We will continue to engage with member states and with the Commission to develop a rating that is consistent with our public health needs.  As a first step towards this Ireland&rsquo;s green list has now been updated to include countries with a 14-day cumulative incident rate of 25 virus infections or less per 100,000 people.  The normal precautions in security ratings apply to these countries and this move to the European approach on the green list will provide a degree of certainty in the scheduling of services.</p> <p>However, in looking at other ways in which we could provide for the ramping up of passenger services, we must be mindful of the need to be consistent with public health requirements and cognisant of resources and the capacity available in our health sector for the testing and tracing of the public.  It is vital that any alternative arrangements we put in place, including testing, do not undermine in any way the public health aspects of our response to the pandemic.</p> <p> The Covid-19 crisis has also had a significant impact on public transport over the past number of months, including on bus services.  Since the onset of the health emergency, measures have been introduced across the public transport system guided by public health advice to ensure the continued operation of public transport bus services during the pandemic.  In common with most other countries, the public transport system has played an essential role, as I said at the outset, in carrying essential workers and making other necessary journeys possible.</p> <p> A number of targeted Government decisions have been made throughout the crisis in addition to general supports that I mentioned earlier.  They included a substantial increase in the 2020 budget for the existing public service obligation, PSO, system which was put in place on 4 June; the introduction of a new temporary financial support for certain licensed bus services. which was provided on 25 June; the introduction of mandatory face coverings on public transport on 26 June; and the introduction of enhancement to certain PSO bus services as announced under the stimulus package on 23 July.</p> <p> I want to yield to my colleague, Deputy Naughton.  I might come back in my closing summary to raise critical issues in regard to the taxi industry, which is in particular difficulty as we know from its members' protest last week, and also the potential for us to develop active travel solutions in this pandemic time.  That is something we will always be focused on but I might return to that in my closing comments or when responding to comments that may be made by other Members of the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-23a.280" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1578" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="14:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300033#LL00200"><p>I wish to reiterate the points the Minister made in terms of the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on our transport sector and international networks.  I have had several meetings with stakeholders in both the aviation and maritime sectors and I am acutely aware of the financial precipice on which they find themselves.  I profoundly hope that the adoption of the broad EU approach to facilitating international travel next month will provide certainty and clarity for these sectors and enable their viable operation into 2021.</p>  <p>  Considering the impact of Covid-19 on international travel and global supply chains, one of my key priorities is to ensure continuity of transport links to and from Ireland as well as ensuring that goods can continue to move throughout Ireland.  During March and April, a drop in overall freight activity levels was evident given the temporary closure of many retail outlets and construction sites in Ireland and abroad.  While supply chains are functioning well at the present time, we continue to closely monitor them.</p>  <p>  As more shops and construction sites reopened through the phases of recovery and as other economies abroad began to reopen, business began to increase for hauliers.  Heavy goods vehicle traffic on our roads has rebounded for the most part to 100% of pre-Covid traffic levels.  Given the importance of the work of our road haulage sector during these difficult times, my Department implemented a number of measures to support the continued functioning of the sector in recent months, including a prolonged temporary derogation for certain provisions of the EU driving and rest hours rules, which expired at the end of May; the extension of expiry dates on driver certificate of professional competence cards of a maximum of six months up to 26 September; and the extension of validity periods for driver licences.</p>  <p>  In addition, a number of communications have also been issued to help support the freight sector as it operates through these challenging times such as the public health guidance developed to assist hauliers in the safe operation of their job in an international environment.  While lockdowns and other co-ordinated restrictive measures were implemented as necessary this year to save lives, these measures have also severely slowed down economies across the EU and can delay the delivery of critical goods and services.  Working in co-operation with member states, the European Commission has taken a number of measures to ensure continued and uninterrupted land, water-borne and air cargo services.  These services are of crucial importance for the functioning of the EU's internal market and its effective response to the current public health crisis.</p>  <p>  Continuing in this vein, member states, under the stewardship of the German Presidency, are now calling on the Commission to consider drawing up a pandemic and crisis contingency plan for the European freight transport sector.  I consider such a plan to be prudent.  We must avoid a situation where member states act unilaterally to adopt their own diverging contingency measures.  Being on the western extreme of the EU supply chain Ireland has a heavy reliance on all member states working together to ensure that goods can move freely across the EU and beyond, not just for land transport services but also for our shipping and aviation services.</p>  <p>  Road works were suspended during the peak Covid-19 restrictions before recommencing in May.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, has not reported significant national road project delays, although a slightly reduced productivity level has been noted.  Just this week I was delighted to announce with the Minister, the completion of a significant &euro;14 million safety investment for the N60 in Roscommon.  As well as the investment in active travel noted by the Minister, on foot of the Government's July stimulus package more than &euro;10 million was awarded by the Department's regional and local roads division to local authorities for climate adaptation works.  Under climate change adaptation measures, 273 projects are to be completed this year involving 150 schemes aimed at alleviating flooding to roads and property, 37 involving works to improve embankment stability to prevent slippage, 41 relating to essential road repairs associated with severe weather and 45 to bridge strengthening and repairs.</p>  <p>  Operationally, road traffic volumes fell dramatically in spring due to Covid-19 travel restrictions falling to approximately one third of 2019 levels during April.  They then recovered significantly as restrictions eased and appear to have plateaued recently at approximately 80% of 2019 levels.  That is in contrast to public transport volumes which remain depressed.  Despite this fall in road traffic, however, road fatalities are higher than at this time last year.  This is seriously concerning to me and, I am sure, to all Members.  I appeal to our citizens to always drive safely.</p>  <p>  Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a number of essential road safety services delivered by my Department and its agencies were closed or severely reduced.  The national driver licence service, NDLS, the national car test, the commercial vehicle roadworthiness test and the driver testing and driver theory testing services closed in March 2020 as they could not be continued at that time in light of overriding considerations of public health.  As a result, the Government moved to extend validity periods of the relevant permits and certificates to ensure people, including essential transport workers, could continue to drive, ensuring continued access to and provision of essential services.  All services have now reopened although due to social distancing requirements not all are able to return to their pre-Covid capacity, and there remains some backlog.  The Road Safety Authority, RSA, which operates the national driver licence service on behalf of the Department, continues to work with its providers to see how they can increase capacity within the NDLS while adhering to the return to work protocol.  The RSA also hopes to extend its online services over the coming months, subject to the appropriate legislation and technical solutions being put in place.</p>  <p>  The driver theory test system capacity since resumption has increased on pre-Covid levels with 19,000 tests per months as against 15,000 tests but the scale of the backlog, combined with the time of year when many school leavers will apply, means increased waiting lists.  The RSA is working with the service provider to see how capacity can be further increased.  My Department has already approved the retention and hiring of a number of temporary testers to assist in the situation.  The authority recently submitted a comprehensive plan for addressing the demands on the service, which is being considered by my Department.  It is important to be realistic.  There are no easy fixes, and public health and safety must come first.</p>  <p>  The transport sector has faced an unprecedented disruption over the past six months due to the Covid-19 pandemic.  Our priority as a Government is to support it through the coming year, ensuring its safe and continued operation, maintain our essential international connectivity, and protect its ongoing and fundamental contribution to our economy.</p></speech>

I will have an opportunity during Question Time tomorrow to raise the taxi industry, public and school bus transport and other important issues relating to transport with the Ministers.</p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>I will be glad to have the opportunity to do that.  I want to focus today on the aviation industry.  I echo the Minister's commendation of front-line transport workers during the Covid period.  Although the aviation sector was one of the worst affected sectors, few specific proposals have been introduced to mitigate the damage caused by the pandemic in this area.  The report, Focus on Aerospace &amp;amp; Aviation, prepared by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and published last month, highlights the value of the aviation sector to the State and outlines the huge challenges now posed as a result of Covid-19.  Some 140,000 jobs are supported by the air transport sector here, but many are now in jeopardy due to the ongoing pandemic.  The staff range from airport staff and cabin crew to mechanics and aircraft leasing employees.  The industry is worth &euro;8.9 billion to our economy.  As an island nation, we depend on quality air connectivity more than most for business and tourism.<br/><br/>Page 8 of the report states: </p><blockquote>	Unaided, many airlines could go out of business before travel restrictions are lifted.  Some governments have already provided loans or taken temporary equity stakes in airlines and airports to moderate disruption, for example in France, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, and the US. </blockquote> <p>On this point, what plans, if any, are afoot here to provide State support to airlines in the form in question?  I am aware of the supports the Minister outlined in more general terms.  The temporary wage subsidy scheme and the employment wage subsidy scheme remain in place.<br/><br/>Workers at Aer Lingus fear for the future of their jobs, given the crisis facing the aviation sector, which will stretch right into 2021 and beyond.  If the treatment of these staff, in terms of the refusal to sign benefit entitlement forms, is anything to go by, these fears are well justified.  That issue is not resolved.  There is some movement on the employment wage subsidy scheme but the temporary wage subsidy scheme and back pay still need to be addressed.  Could the Minister, in his closing comments, state whether he has made contact with the company or his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys?  When will this issue be resolved?  When will staff get their back pay?<br/><br/>On the company more generally, has the Government discussed a proposal on cash for equity in Aer Lingus to shore it up, protect jobs and guard against the loss of important routes?  Similar moves are happening internationally and are being permitted under the relaxed EU state aid rules that have obtained during the pandemic.  Earlier this year, the German state took a 20% stake in Lufthansa in exchange for a &euro;9 billion rescue package.  At the beginning of this month, the European Commission approved a &euro;200 million bailout for Alitalia, with the Italian Government now retaking control of the airline.  It is important that the Irish State try to protect as many jobs and routes as possible to ensure connectivity for the travel, business and inward tourism that we will depend on for our recovery.<br/><br/>It was a terrible decision to sell the State's remaining shares in Aer Lingus in 2015, and one Sinn F&eacute;in opposed.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party ignored the very legitimate concerns raised at the time, and we are now living with the cost.  A sum of &euro;335 million was raised from the sale.  The proceeds were used to set up a fund called the connectivity fund, managed by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund.  According to information I have recently received from the Minister for Finance, only &euro;90 million of this has been invested to date, leaving a pot of &euro;245 million unspent.  Has the Minister examined using the money sitting idle in the connectivity fund to shore up jobs in the aviation sector, including through retaking a stake in Aer Lingus and providing financial assistance to our regional airports, such as Cork and Shannon, which are facing massive challenges?<br/><br/>Our regional airports are facing their biggest challenge due to Covid, with only a couple of flights in and out each day.  Management at Cork Airport has said the Covid-19 crisis has had a catastrophic impact on the airport's finances, with passenger numbers having fallen by 95% during lockdown and not expected to recover to 2019 levels for another four years.  The airport said it will lose around &euro;20 million this year as a result of the pandemic.  Meanwhile, Aer Lingus and Ryanair have threatened to close operations at Shannon Airport, which would be a serious blow for the entire mid-west and fly in the face of the objective of balanced regional development.<br/><br/>Is the Minister planning to provide financial assistance in the upcoming budget to airports affected by the pandemic?  I am not for a second suggesting we automatically dance to the tune of the multimillionaires who run Ryanair and Aer Lingus but we have to recognise that when we come out the other side of this, we will need an aviation sector that is intact and strong.<br/><br/>Airlines will cite the Government's approach to international travel as one of the factors contributing to some of their current difficulties.  Six months into the pandemic, it is shameful that we still have no testing capabilities in our airports, nor even the most basic temperature screening of arriving passengers.  People fill in a form and they are literally on their way.  One will not find a less restrictive process anywhere else in the world these days.  We now have seven countries on the green list.  As of an hour ago, with Germany having been added to the list, six of the seven countries have restrictions on Irish people travelling thereto.  Most of them have some sort of testing regime.  If other countries around the world have introduced testing and temperature screening at their airports, why has the Irish Government decided to take a different approach?  At the Covid committee this morning, we heard about the opportunity that exists regarding testing.  I will not elaborate on that and let my colleagues contribute.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-23a.284" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1463" speakername="P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300034#MM00200"><p>I wish to raise directly with the Minister the serious problems that have emerged with school transport in Donegal but also across the rest of the State.  The Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Foley, overlooked the school transport challenge under the umbrella of the back-to-school plan in a very clear way.  Every year at this time, families are always left behind under the eligible and concessionary tickets system.  It is a major problem in rural areas, including rural Donegal, because parents may have to travel 20 miles, or maybe more, in one direction to get to work although the school is in the opposite direction.  It is not practical for parents to get to work on time, put a roof over their family's head and get their children to school.  Post-primary school is the concern in the case in question.</p>  <p>  Every year, there are families left behind.  We work through it with Bus &Eacute;ireann and the Department of Education and Skills and find a solution.  This year, however, what has been said to Bus &Eacute;ireann is that any families who did not avail of the ticket before 4 August will have to wait until 50% capacity is reached.  In the likes of Donegal, the private transport operators joined other operators across the State to appeal for financial supports beyond the pandemic unemployment payment.  Their industry is in genuine crisis and they really were not financially supported by the Government.  They were left blowing in the wind.  Those very people are now being asked to bail out our school transport system in order for it to reach 50% capacity.  This would of course be desirable in the current climate but surely to God the first thing that should be done is look after the families who have missed out.</p>  <p>  When the Department of Education and Skills instructed that the portal application system be opened, we all believed the directive had changed.  I learned very quickly it had not and that the instruction to the bus operators who work under Bus &Eacute;ireann was that they are not to allow a child on a bus unless he or she has a physical ticket from before 4 August.</p>  <p>Lots of families have been left behind and this is a huge crisis for them.  In summarising later, will the Minister address what he, working with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Foley, will do to resolve this issue?  </p> <p> I will tell him what the solution is and it is very simple.  First, Bus &Eacute;ireann, working with the Department of Education and Skills, must ensure there is capacity for every single child or student who needs it, be it on an eligible or concessionary basis.  As the Minister will be aware, concessionary means the parents pay for the service.  Parents are, or course, willing and happy to do that but we cannot leave them behind before we look for 50% capacity.  The solution is simple.  A clear statement should be issued to Bus &Eacute;ireann that the Department of Education and Skills, in conjunction with the Minister's Department, will resource this service to make sure nobody is left behind, after which it will push towards 50% capacity.</p> <p> The Department must ensure the private transport operators are resourced in order that they can bail out the Government in this regard.  I am sorry for eating into my colleague's time.</p></speech>

I will refer to the proposed northern distributor road and the road from Limerick to Cork but the two issues I want to focus on are the viability of Shannon Airport and the Limerick tunnel.</p>  <p>  Shannon Airport, as the Minister will be well aware, is the heart that makes the economy of Limerick and Limerick West function.  The viability of Shannon Airport is fundamental to the economic performance of the mid-west region.  Unfortunately, since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, the news emanating from the airport has rarely been positive.  In fact, it has been disastrous.  There have been threats by airlines to cut transatlantic routes.  We also had the spectre of job losses and the near-complete collapse of the aviation industry in the State.  On top of all this, we have warnings from Ryanair that it may close its base at Shannon over the winter months.  In her report, Mid-west Economic Insights, Dr. Catriona Cahill highlighted that Shannon Airport contributes &euro;3.6 billion to the regional economy and supports almost 55,000 jobs.  All of this is at risk without strategic convention by the Government.</p>  <p>  Beyond the aviation industry, the mid-west region is solely dependent on Shannon Airport.  Industries have been established in the industrial parks around Limerick and Shannon and many did so based on the close location to a functioning international airport, with worldwide connections through Heathrow and Boston airports.  It is bizarre that we have a region so heavily dependent on Shannon Airport, yet more than 90% of new airline routes are assigned to Dublin.  </p>  <p>  Given the plethora of negative news, it is clear the airport and, by extension, the mid-west region, are in a difficult place.  I have been critical of the management of Shannon Airport in the past and, unfortunately, I have seen little from it since that gives me cause to change my mind.</p>  <p>  In 2012, my party flagged the difficulties with separating Shannon Airport from the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA.  Regrettably, our warnings were not heeded and our concerns have been borne out as legitimate.  It is high time the Government recognised the folly of this move and took remedial action to bring control of Shannon Airport back under the canopy of the DAA.  </p>  <p>  I am hopeful the Minister will today provide a definite date for the completion and publication of the review of Shannon Group PLC.  The report of the task force for aviation recovery was issued almost three months ago, yet we have seen no proposals from the Government.  In this State,140,000 jobs are supported by the aviation sector.  These people need clarity on their position.  The Government must expedite the publication of this new aviation policy and the Shannon review report.</p>  <p>  I will use my final minute to make some remarks about the Limerick tunnel.  The tunnel is fantastic infrastructure that alleviates some of the traffic problems in the city but the initial estimate that it would take up to 20,000 cars daily from Limerick's streets has not been achieved.  This is despite the tunnel having the capacity to accommodate 40,000 cars daily.  </p>  <p>  Since schools have returned, the constant theme on Limerick local radio and bulletins is traffic delays on the Condell Road and the Dock Road.  Shannon Bridge gives immediate access to Condell Road and 15,000 vehicles cross the bridge daily from the north side of Limerick.  Limerick City and County Council estimates that 10,000 of these turn right on to the Dock Road heading in the direction of Dooradoyle, Mungret and further afield.  I mention this in reference to the Limerick tunnel because the tunnel should offer an alternative route for some of those vehicles.  Further use of tunnel could and should alleviate traffic congestion across Limerick.  The tunnel is underused for a myriad of reasons and I believe the chief among them is cost and location.  We cannot change its location but perhaps we can do something about costs.  My party advised at the commencement of its construction that it was too close to the city to build.  It is wonderful infrastructure but it is of minimal use owing to its current configuration.  </p>  <p>  Has the effectiveness of Limerick tunnel been reviewed by the Department?  How feasible would it be to reduce or remove the toll for the use of this roadway?  The tunnel was designed as a remedy for traffic congestion in Limerick city at huge cost to the Exchequer.  Unfortunately, it has not achieved that objective.</p></speech>

As such, I will confine my brief contribution to those who should be travelling by air and those who use transport on the ground.</p>  <p>  In the past couple of months, I and others, including Deputy O'Rourke, have spent an awful lot of time in this Chamber and behind the scenes trying to resolve an infuriating social welfare issue for workers in Aer Lingus.  This was at a time when we should all have been concentrating our efforts on trying to navigate towards a solution, one where we would have a regime in place that would allow our aviation industry to reopen safely within public health guidelines, while giving workers some light at the end of tunnel.  While we hope the social welfare issue has reached some kind of resolution, where has it left us?  It has left these same workers still getting low levels of pay, even if they are now getting their full entitlement to short-time work or jobseeker's allowance.  </p>  <p>  We still do not have a testing and tracing regime in place.  When the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, appeared before the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response at the start of August he said the Government was working on such a system.  That was almost two months ago now and there seems to have been no progress on that.</p>  <p>  Last week, the T&aacute;naiste stated on national media that we needed to get to a place where we have pre-departure screening and testing.  He indicated, however, that this was a long way away.  Imagine a worker in the aviation industry, either in an airline or in support working in catering or cleaning and servicing our airlines, hearing that months into this pandemic, after the industry was shut down so quickly and understandably - the workers understood the reason early on - there is still no light at the end of the tunnel.</p>  <p>  We were given the news today that Germany has put Ireland on its red list.  If any of us was to fly into any airport in Germany, not just in the capital airport, we would be able to avail of a free Covid test.  Germany has that in place right now.  We do not even have anything close to that in place in the airport in our capital, never mind in our regional airports which are struggling as well during this pandemic.</p>  <p>  It is clear the Minister for Health cannot lead on all things Covid and, to be fair to him, we understand that his brief is in health and non-Covid related health issues are mounting up.  We need the Minister's voice on this.  Livelihoods are at stake and we need the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to take a real lead.  All the aviation workers want is to see light at the end of the tunnel.  They want a pathway in which they can believe.  They want to know they will have a livelihood and work to go to in a few months.</p>  <p>  I will speak briefly on cyclists.  One of the noticeable changes during the restrictions earlier this year was an increase in cyclists on our streets.  This was obviously because there were fewer cars and people felt safer and cycled more.  Unfortunately, they were not safer and the number of fatalities has continued at a similar, if not slightly higher, rate as last year, even though vehicular traffic has decreased.  On Sunday, we had another cyclist fatality in a tragedy in my constituency.  At the start of the month, we had the tragic passing of Thiago Cortes on the streets of Dublin.  Almost 19 years ago, I witnessed a fatal collision involving a cyclist on the quays in Dublin city.  There can be different factors involved in every incident involving the death of a cyclist.  However, every death of a cyclist is linked not only by virtue of being a common tragedy but also by the fact that our roads remain unsafe for cyclists.  We have seen work on the segregation of cycle lanes in and around Dublin and other cities during this pandemic.  That is to be welcomed but we need ambitious plans to improve the situation.</p> <p>We need to look at the roads leading into our major cities and towns.  Former national roads, such as the N1 and the N2, have been bypassed by motorways and are ideal to give primacy for cyclists who commute every day on their bicycles.  We need to come out of this pandemic and if we can provide resources in that regard, it would be fantastic.<br/><br/>I want to discuss pedestrians and people with disabilities.  At the very basic level of transport we need local authorities to undertake an ambitious project of accessibility audits for every town and village.  It is happening on a piecemeal and <i>ad hoc</i>basis.  Journeys that all of us in this Chamber take for granted can be arduous or sometimes impossible for people who are in wheelchairs or have mobility issues.  Simple remedies such as the dishing of paths, the matching up of paths with the opposite side of the road and pedestrian crossings are rather mundane and unsexy when it comes transport, but they are the bedrock on which safe and secure transportation networks are based.<br/><br/>We have legislation providing for access officers in all public bodies.  Only 23 of our local authorities have hired access officers and, within that, the work of access officers is unclear.  We need dedicated disability officers in every local authority to work with operations and planning departments to ensure that not only do we rectify the past mistakes in the building of our towns and villages, but that we plan for the future through our development plans so that everywhere is safe, secure and accessible for people with disabilities.</p></speech>

We have tried to grapple, in some cases, with an infrastructural deficit to try to continue normal life, while at the same time we need to look forward to ensure that the supports that are in place are protected for the security and connectivity of the island.</p>  <p>  Let me deal with three sectors.  In July, I was delighted when the public consultation period opened for the extension of the Luas green line to Finglas, an area that is exclusively reliant on bus services, which have posed a real challenge during the Covid-19 pandemic.  The planned extension of the Luas will see a 4 km track travel through from Tolka Valley Park through Mellowes Road.  Some limited objections have been made, which I believe the NTA will address locally.  The people of Finglas are very grateful this project has been announced.  The difficulty is that the previous Government made much of this, but it remains what is called a post-2027 project in the national development plan.</p>  <p>  I do not need to persuade the Minister of the benefits of public transport, which he has championed for many years.  I hope that in the review of the national development plan this Government can bring that project forward from a post-2027 project to a much earlier construction date.  As I have said, my area is exclusively reliant on bus services from Santry right across to Finglas.  The 50% Covid capacity limit has posed a major challenge.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Government's plan to live with Covid and the task force for the aviation sector.  I urge the Minister to do as much as he can to engage with unions and the airlines to ensure that the long-term connectivity of the island is maintained.  I worked in Dublin Airport, which is a fantastic community but it is a very frightened community at the moment.  They cannot see hope on the horizon but we can provide it for them.</p>  <p>  Taxi drivers are a very important public transport resource.  I have raised this issue several times in recent weeks.  The Government has indicated it will provide some support or step-down facility to allow self-employed people, in particular, to go back to work with some level of State support.  I urge the Minister to do everything he can in his discussions with the other coalition parties and with his Cabinet colleagues.  We need taxi drivers in this city.  They are an important part of public transport.  I urge the Minister to do everything he can on those three issues.</p></speech>

During a Topical Issue debate before the D&aacute;il rose for the summer, I raised with the Minister traffic congestion around Castlemartyr, which is causing immense problems for the community in Youghal and Midleton.  The national development plan review will come up shortly.  I reiterate that this project should be put in the national development plan as it is vital to the economic future of the communities I represent and that I previously represented as a councillor before I was elected to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  A number of issues in the Cork East constituency need to be addressed, including the ability of commuters using public transport services to avail of the green zone fare in the Cork region and Cork county.  There is significant discrimination affecting those in large towns in the vicinity of Cork city that have very good public transport links to the city.  Towns such as Midleton, Mallow, Fermoy and Youghal have good bus services.  Some of those towns also have rail connections.  There is a big discrepancy in the fare structure in place and whether people can utilise the Leap card service.  If we want to get cars off the road, we need to make public transport affordable.  For all areas outside the green zone area in Cork East. that is a major issue.  It is extremely expensive for people who want to commute on public transport from towns such as Mitchelstown and Youghal to Cork.</p>  <p>  Another issue is coming up repeatedly.  We are getting calls, texts and social media messages sometimes in the middle of the night from people who have been left standing at bus stops throughout the constituency because the public transport services are deeply unreliable and are insufficient to meet demand.</p>  <p>  I want to highlight another issue with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Parents of children with serious cognitive disabilities who are attending day services are finding it almost impossible, in particular in Youghal, to get their children on to bus services, which is deeply concerning.  I would like the Minister to make an effort with Bus &Eacute;ireann to see if a small number of seats could be reserved for children attending day services in rural communities such as the one I represent so that they can travel between Youghal and Dungarvan.  That is a very valid point raised with me by the Youghal autism group.  I commend them on the work they are doing.  This is an easy problem to solve and it would make an enormous difference to those families to know their children would have a place on the Bus &Eacute;ireann service.</p>  <p>  It is deeply annoying that Bus &Eacute;ireann operates an Expressway service, which is a commercial service, and also the PSO services.  There is a significant price discrepancy between the two.  On the one hand, the NTA advises us that it can operate these PSO services with greatly inflated prices, in some cases double what is being charged on the Expressway services, while, on the other, Bus &Eacute;ireann claims it can operate a commercial Bus &Eacute;ireann service at half the rate, which apparently is making a profit.  The company is hiding behind the excuse of having them under so-called promotional fares, which should be full-time fares for the community.</p>  <p>  We are asleep at the wheel in respect of the opportunities to take cars off the road in Cork city and county.  Thousands of people commute from east Cork to Cork city for work every day, but they must do so in their private cars because there is no reliable and affordable public transport option.</p> <p>I said to the Minister on a previous occasion in the D&aacute;il that if one goes down to the Jack Lynch tunnel in the evening, one will see that the number of vehicles trying to exit the south side of Cork city on a daily basis is absolutely frightening.  There are almost 100,000 vehicles using the South Ring Road interchange with the M25 at Dunkettle.  It is staggering that there is no public transport service on this route, which connects universities, colleges, hospitals and everything else in the southern part of Cork city.  For the tens of thousands of people who live in the east Cork area, there are no public transport services going under the tunnel to link up communities like those in Mahon Point, Douglas and Ringaskiddy, where there are thousands of people working in multinational companies, retail, health services and so on.  It would be a simple thing to begin the process of addressing these problems.  Will the Minister commit to undertaking a feasibility study with a view to ensuring these issues are examined and to see whether potential solutions can be found?</p> <p> I thank the Minister for listening to the points I have raised and I look forward to engaging with him on all of them.</p></speech>

The first concerns Cork Airport and the aviation sector generally, as also referred to by previous speakers.  Cork Airport is responsible directly for some 2,200 jobs and indirectly for another 10,000.  Those thousands of families are deeply worried at this time.  Ryanair is threatening to pull its base in Cork, as is Aer Lingus.  While I recognise that decisions were made in the interests of public health regarding international travel during the Covid crisis, which I support and agree were necessary, we need now to plan for the future.  We know that aviation will not go back to normal today or tomorrow.  We also know that Cork needs a viable international airport to enable it to grow in accordance with what is planned for the region under Project Ireland 2040.  The airport is an essential strategic asset to the region.  My priority in terms of Cork Airport is working with management and workers to seek solutions.  We need direct investment in the airport and to have a high-quality testing regime in place for the aviation industry generally.  I submitted parliamentary questions on these matters to the Minister in recent days and I hope I will get comprehensive answers to them.  I am asking the Minister to do whatever he can to ensure these jobs are safeguarded and that Cork Airport has a viable future.</p>  <p>  The second issue I want to raise relates to the Cork metropolitan area transport strategy.  I was one of the first Cork Deputies in the last D&aacute;il to push for the provision of a light rail service for the city, which I was glad to see included in the strategy.  However, my fear is that there are many ambitious targets for the long term but not enough for the short and medium term.  My understanding is that the proposed east-west line is too limited and that a north-south line is also needed.  In the shorter term, there is scope to look at investing more substantially in our traditional bus service and to look towards Belfast's Glider service.  A bus rapid transit service would be far quicker and easier to deliver than a light rail service.  It would operate on the existing bus corridors and work on the project could begin quickly.  It would be a new and eye-catching service, which would capture the imagination of the people of Cork.</p>  <p>  Finally, I draw the Minister's attention to the L2455 road improvement scheme.  He might wish to write that down.  The delays to this local road project have been going on for some 15 years and the road itself represents the worst of Celtic tiger planning.  There is a community of approximately 1,000 people living in housing estates in Cork city who are within the same distance of other suburbs as this Chamber is from Pearse Station but they cannot get out of their estates.  There are no footpaths and it is not safe to cycle.  It is absolutely incomprehensible that the communities in Lehenagh Beg and Lehenagh More have been left to deal with this situation.  This road project, which is going out to public consultation soon, will be expensive to complete, but this community has been let down again and again.  Some of that is the responsibility of Cork City Council.  When the project lands on the Minister's desk, I ask that he provide the funding to allow it to proceed.  It is important for the road safety of motorists but also, more crucially, of pedestrians and cyclists.</p></speech>

As we approach budget 2021, we will need to look at job creation and capital investment projects.  I urge the Minister to consider the really dangerous conditions of the roads in Connemara and to intervene urgently to address this situation.  The road from Barna to Screebe, which includes cycle lanes, is a prime example of this.  I wrote to the Minister last week about the condition of the road at Cuan na Luinge, which has been sinking and is now impassable for residents in the area.  The unfortunate reality is that the people of Connemara have few alternatives because there is no adequate bus service.  The bus from Carraroe to Galway city costs &euro;13, which is the same as one would pay to go from Galway city to Dublin by bus.  I ask the Minister to intervene in this matter without delay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-23a.294" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1489" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300037#PP00400"><p>It is fair to say that the transport sector has been one of the most impacted by the Covid crisis.  During the lockdown, buses, trains and trams ran regularly, but were virtually empty, to ensure there was transport for essential workers.  During this time, there was almost no income coming in for the operators.  While a subvention under the public service obligation was allocated for the sector in the last budget, it certainly will not be enough to cover that loss of income.  Will the Minister indicate how the allocation for 2020 will be handled and what amount of money will be given?  After the lockdown, the advice from NPHET was to practise social distancing on buses, trains and trams, which is having an ongoing impact on revenues.  I am sure there will be something to address this in the budget next month.  Private transport providers who operate on a wholly commercial basis are being impacted by the Covid restrictions in the same way as those operators that are funded from the levy.</p>  <p>  Dublin Bus usually alters its timetables when schools return but it has not done so this year because it has not received the necessary funding from the NTA to do so.  This is creating very significant problems, not for millions of people but certainly for a cohort.  It needs to be addressed because it is leading to a lot of additional and needless traffic around schools.</p>  <p>  I do not need to tell the Minister that we are playing catch-up when it comes to sustainable transport provision and encouraging cycling and walking.  There has been a good investment in that area this year, in addition to the funding that was provided last year.  It is really important that we know what outcome we will get from that funding.  It is not necessarily buckets of white paint we need but decent networks.  An audit of the funding is required.  Change needs to be delivered not in a fragmented way but through planning incrementally, which is a different thing entirely, so that we end up with a network at the end of it.</p>  <p>  We had a debate in the House in recent weeks on the situation of small public service vehicle operators.  There is no doubt that there are significant problems as a consequence of the loss of tourism, restrictions on the entertainment sector and the numbers of people previously working in towns and cities who are now working at home.  There is a real difficulty for people making a living in that sector and there is no clear end in sight.</p>  <p>  As an island nation on the edge of Europe, we will be even more exposed from January next year when Brexit happens.  Both airports and seaports are a big issue in this context, just as they are in regard to Covid.  A task force was set up by the previous Minister to examine this issue and there has been some criticism that its recommendations were not implemented.</p> <p>It was a snapshot and we have a better idea now that this is going to be a much longer-term issue.  How we protect public health while at the same time managing the aviation sector is a big challenge.  For example, many international airports have testing facilities and we do not yet.  The Minister might address what part that might play.  We have now moved to a green list, which we are told is the real green list.  Is it intended to introduce a red list and even more controls?  We cannot take a risk but, at the same time, this is an important sector.  According to the aviation recovery task force, the key numbers from Oxford Economics indicate that the estimated GDP contribution of air transport to Ireland was &euro;8.9 million.  A total of 140,000 jobs were supported by the aviation sector and the estimated GDP contribution of foreign tourists was &euro;8.7 billion.  If we remember back to the period following the previous crash, the tourism sector was the one that started to deliver in terms of a recovery.  While we cannot look at that with any degree of certainty at this stage, we have to ensure we end up with a viable aviation sector post-Covid.  Having listened to representatives of the aviation sector at the Covid committee, I do not see how that can happen without an injection of funds to the sector.  Setting it up again is going to be very different for the Minister than scaling up a sector that is underperforming for all the reasons we know about.  I would like to hear what the Minister has to say about that sector.  In 2018, domestic tourism made a contribution of &euro;3.3 billion to the economy, which is a significant amount, but foreign visitors contributed almost three times that.</p> <p> Our ports are also going to be challenged.  I have had the benefit of visiting Dublin Port to look at the initiatives it has taken.  What they have done is very impressive and going out there to look at the level of preparedness was very worthwhile.  However, other ports require attention if we are to see the traffic as something we can distribute in a much more equal way.

The first of these is coach tourism.  As part of the July stimulus, private bus operators were provided with a package of &euro;10 million.  The Minster for Public Expenditure and Reform had a meeting with myself and representatives of the Coach Tourism and Transport Council of Ireland, CTTC.  Coach tourism is a vibrant and highly successful industry in Ireland.  As a result of the lockdown and the impact the pandemic has had on international visitors coming into Ireland, this industry has come to a complete and utter halt.  With travel restrictions still in place, there is unfortunately no sign of this industry finding its feet any time soon.  It is essential that this industry be protected so that the tourism industry can recover to pre-Covid levels after the pandemic passes.  If the industry is not supported, viable businesses will close and we will be left without a transport system for tourists when this sector eventually returns to normal.  The fairest way the &euro;10 million can be divided is on a <i>pro rata</i>basis.  The stimulus should be divided on a fair principle that those most affected must receive the most support.  I understand a consultant has been engaged by the Department to determine how this money should be divided within the industry.  I ask the Minister to ensure common sense prevails.  We must get these businesses the money they need as a matter of urgency and it needs to be divided fairly.  The CTTC has prepared a pre-budget submission.  I urge the Minister to listen to their points and give them serious consideration.  Their main point is that they require &euro;42.5 million as part of a direct Government subsidy to help with the dramatic stoppage of almost all of their tourism operations.  I urge the Minister to consider the issues the CTTC is drawing his attention to.  It has also suggested that the &euro;10 million should be divided based on last year's tourism-related turnover and that is the common sense way to approach it.</p><p>I refer to school transport.  We are still yet to receive a response to the complaints raised by parents all around the country about the lack of capacity on school buses.  My county of Tipperary is badly affected by this issue.  There are school routes where more than 20 students have been refused concessionary tickets due to lack of capacity.  For example, upwards of 24 students have been refused spaces on the Hollyford-Upperchurch route.  I have also made representations on behalf of families in Moneygall who have children travelling to secondary school in Nenagh.  Their concessionary tickets have also been refused and this is putting parents under extreme pressure to organise alternative transport for the past few weeks.  The Cloneen to Ballingarry route is also facing similar difficulties.  There are not enough spaces on the bus routes and a number of students are being refused.  There is a simple solution to this: we need additional buses on the roads.  Parents are under significant pressure to get their children to school in the morning when they are trying to get to work.  Some of these families have had access to school transport on this route for five or six years and such a dramatic change in conditions needs to be addressed.</p><p>Finally, taxi drivers provide a vital service to certain parts of rural County Tipperary where there is no public transport.  Many people rely on services such as the individual local taxi driver to get in and out of the local town or village for shopping and personal reasons.  I call for consideration to be made for taxi drivers.  Their businesses have taken an enormous hit as a result of the pandemic and the restrictions they are expected to operate under.  I have been contacted by a number of taxi drivers who are requesting that their licences be renewed free of charge and that they be given access to interest-free loans to enable them to meet the costs of operating their services.</p></speech>

Since 12 March, the world as we knew it has well and truly been turned upside down.  Many of the things we had previously taken as gospel in our transport planning are now in question.  Further urbanisation, increasing commuter numbers, the decline of rural towns and more have been thrown into question by the onset of remote working on an unprecedented scale.  Before 12 March the main roads into our cities were heaving with traffic each day from the early hours until late at night.  Packed buses meant people were faced with a daily struggle to get to and from their workplaces.  Today, many of those commuters are working from home.  Those who must commute are doing so in a fraction of the time and buses operating at a fraction of the normal capacity are getting people to work faster.  We have people who spent hours of their day sitting in cars instead of spending time with their families.  We have had money being spent in local economies, which would previously been spent in major urban cities.  We have fewer cars on our roads, which is driving down emissions and helping us to meet our climate change targets.</p><p>Amid all the tragedy and disappointment we have all experienced over the past six months, these changes are some of the few positives we can take from the experience.  We have learned that spending more time with our families and in our communities does not have to be a mutually exclusive choice.  The illusion that a person must be in their cubicle to be productive has been broken and employers in many industries understand that.  Many will not return to their former ways of life unless they must.  I believe we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to make this change permanent, at least partially.  I accept that the speed of this transition could not have been predicted.  What would previously have taken decades has instead happened over a six-month period.  No Government could expect to react in that time.  We do, however, find ourselves with important choices to make.  First, we have the choice of how we choose to react to this change.  Do we forge a return to the <i>status quo </i>and all the negatives that go with it?</p> <p>Will we return to longer and longer commutes with more and more cars on the roads, spewing more and more toxic fumes, to jobs in our cities where we do not want or need to be?  Instead, will we opt to be brave?  Will we decide that we will retain this to the greatest extent possible?  Will we ask ourselves how we can build a system that encourages those working from home to continue to do so in the long term while retaining access to services they need when they need them?<br/><br/>I do not believe we should go back to the <i>status quo</i>.  I do not believe it is sustainable in the long run.  We need to begin the work now to move in a new direction.  Important work needs to be done if we are to achieve this.  We need to start by expanding on the existing Am&aacute;rach research and collect information on the number of employers and employees who are considering making the current arrangements permanent.  Should we like to do so, we need to understand where in the country the people and businesses are and what they need.  For employers in particular who could do so but who are not considering at least some element of continuing to work from home we need to understand their concerns and what needs to be done to support them.  When this work has been done we will need to work to address their concerns.  After this, we will need to assess how our transport system will work to assist it.  I strongly believe a social dividend should come from the current crisis.  The Minister should work towards this end now.</p></speech>

Many children in Lucan are having great difficulty getting to school.  Social distancing rules have reduced capacity on our local Dublin buses and our school transport buses.  What are the many small bus operators who run just one bus service a day supposed to do?  It is just not financially viable for them to operate at half capacity.  This creates a real dilemma for bus operators, children and parents.  There have been situations in my constituency where children were literally left on the side of the road awaiting collection.  Utter panic ensued.  Parents stuck in work had no way of ensuring their child got home safely.  Even today, a Dublin Bus on the 66 route from Lucan to Leixlip, which runs at a reduced capacity, turned away schoolchildren because there was no room on board the bus.</p>  <p>  Joined up Government thinking can help resolve this.  A tweak to the pandemic unemployment payment that would enable one of the worst hit sectors of the economy to take on school transport work would be a win-win.  What do I mean by this?  I mean that bus drivers, whose bread and butter business comes from the tourism trade and bringing US tourists on the Ring of Kerry or collecting holiday makers from cruise liners in Dublin, and who do not want to be sitting at home doing nothing while their buses are parked up gathering dust, are given the opportunity to help resolve this while continuing to claim their payments.</p>  <p>  The pandemic unemployment payment was a welcome relief to thousands of people who found themselves unemployed so suddenly in March due to Covid-19.  It was put in place seamlessly by the Government and it gave more than 400,000 people hope that they could meet their rent, pay their bills and not need to worry about a roof over their heads.  The wage subsidy scheme has been of huge benefit to people in these impacted industries.  Unfortunately, six months later, we still find ourselves in uncharted waters.  If small bus operators were allowed to retain their payments and do a small amount of work they could help with school transport.  Private bus contractors operate approximately 90% of all school transport services.  They are all working at reduced capacity.  With joined up thinking we could supplement this fleet with buses and bus drivers currently out of work.  Will the Minister work with his colleagues, the Ministers with responsibility for education and social protection, to resolve this issue and get small bus operators back to work so children can safely travel to school without disrupting the working week of parents while reducing pressure on the likes of the 66 bus route from Lucan?</p></speech>

For many in north Kildare, Dublin is so close but for medical appointments or a visit to family and friends the lack of public transport makes it a step too far.</p>  <p>  Public transport is our future.  For climate action purposes we simply must get more cars off the road by making public transport the preferred choice.  While the message right now is to avoid public transport because of public health advice, many cannot do so.  We should not be reducing the frequency of public transport or the number of train carriages.  We should be increasing the frequency and capacity to facilitate social distancing so when we come out the other side of this we can have a decent, well-run and functional public transport system throughout the State.</p>  <p>  Crucially, we must have access to more and better public transport for our people in rural Ireland.  This is common sense.  However, at present the community in Rathcoffey in north Kildare is looking at access to the bus that goes from Naas General Hospital to Blanchardstown with something approaching longing.  We have to fix this.  It can be fixed simply by looking at the route and adapting it to facilitate more commuters.  Just as we have to fix the way Covid-19 is exposing the fault lines throughout our society we also have fault lines evident in public transport.  Equally, for people dependent on public transport we cannot have vehicles filled to the limit sailing past bus stops and leaving them stranded.  This is a common occurrence for the people of Kilcock.  While at present it does not happen every day, it had started to return when the Covid levels were low during the summer.</p>  <p>  We have to address capacity and frequency on public transport.  The news emerging about the significance of aerosol transmission is an issue not alone for schools but also for trains and buses.  I presume the Minister and the Minister for Health are looking at this with all of the necessary urgency.  It is all well and good for new Deputies to be coming in here and making statements in the Chamber but it is quite frustrating.  This might be where issues are raised but it is at the committees where they are sorted.  Can we please get the committees up and running so we can start getting on with the real work?</p></speech>

The first is the reopening of Killucan train station.  Discussion on this dates back to 2006.  It is on the D&aacute;il record and the Minister can check.  Parliamentary questions have been asked back and forth for years.  It was stated in an assessment a number of years ago that it would cost &euro;1.5 million to make the station operational again.  For nigh on 20 years, the residents of Killucan and Kinnegad have lobbied the Department with responsibility for transport and worked closely with various Ministers and Irish Rail, all with a view to reopening the station to the betterment of the area and commuters.</p>  <p>  The population of Kinnegad and Killucan grew multiple fold during the Celtic tiger years.  There are now thousands more people living in the wider area than when the station was closed almost 60 years ago.  Reopening the station would not only make economic sense but it would also make sense from environmental, tourism and common sense perspectives.  Recent correspondence I have from Irish Rail states it would provide the technical expertise and skills but is not in a position to provide financial contributions.</p>  <p>  The second issue is the advanced plans for the Mullingar bus service.  Mullingar is one of the towns recognised in the national development plan.  It has a growing population.  Its population density indicates it would support a public transport system.  It has a population of more than 20,000 people.  We have a central train and bus station, approximately a dozen primary and national schools, four secondary schools and a regional hospital.  However, we do not have a town transport system.  Approximately 6,000 trips are made daily for work and education.  Three out of every four trips, and half of the school trips, are by car but 18% of the population does not have access to the primary car in their household.  Planning is going ahead for a bus service.  Design routes are being given priority.  Public consultation is planned for later in the year.  Contract documents are in preparation.  However, the NTA has said it does not have any funding yet identified for the project.  This is beyond disappointing.  These are only two of the transport issues in my constituency.  The constituency already has a very fractured or non-existent public transport system.  I am looking for a commitment that these projects will be prioritised for capital funding.</p></speech>

Apart from a little bit of tea and sympathy, this and the previous Government have completely ignored and failed to provide support to them.  The taxi drivers who took to the streets in unprecedented numbers a week ago will be protesting again on 9 October.  This time it will be a day-long protest with taxi drivers coming from all parts of Dublin city.</p>  <p>  They have been forced to organise another protest because of the failure of the Minister and the Government to listen to them or give them any assurances of real support.  They cannot even get under freedom of information provisions the answer to the question as to whether the NTA made any recommendations to support them to the Minister or the Minister for Finance.  They have had no traction on the request that the ten-year rule for the replacement of vehicles would be extended to 12 years because they do not have the money to do so.  What are they supposed to do?  There is nothing on an income subsidy.  For many taxi drivers, they incur &euro;11,000 in costs before they make a cent.  Now, given the new restrictions, they have less of a chance of making a living.  Will the Minister give the assurances and supports for which the taxi drivers are asking?  They do not want to protest but they are determined to continue and will do so on 9 October if the Minister does not listen.</p>  <p>  The aviation industry has been decimated, as the Minister knows.  Surely who we need heading the Irish Aviation Authority is somebody who will defend the rights of workers in the industry, who will be scrupulous about safety on the airlines and about protecting consumer rights.  What do we get?  We get the appointment of Diarmuid &Oacute; Conghaile whose former job was as chief executive of Malta Air, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ryanair.  Ryanair is accused by its workers of running out trade union activists, forcing people into bogus self-employment, flouting all social distancing regulations, refusing to comply with the EASA, European Union Aviation Safety Agency, regulations and so on.  It also has a rotten record when it comes to consumers.  However, this is the person we put in charge of the Irish Aviation Authority.  Seriously, what is the Minister up to?</p></speech>

Their demands are just and the Government should concede to them.  Many of them actually involve no cost.</p>  <p>  It is hard to escape the conclusion that the fiasco facing transport workers at Aer Lingus regarding the stamping of social welfare forms for workers on short-term working contracts is anything other than a ploy designed to drive those workers to despair and force them to quit their jobs without redundancy.  The original claim by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, on national radio last week that it was a matter solely between Aer Lingus and its own employees did not go down very well.  Workers know that the Department has been part of the problem and has been slow to intervene.  These issues must be resolved now.</p>  <p>  Aer Lingus and other transport workers are watching with trepidation the clock ticking down to the deadline of 30 September for the mortgage moratorium.  Many workers availed of payment breaks five or six months back and will be due to start repaying in October and November.   For many Aer Lingus workers, these payments cannot be made on the current levels of income and they are fearful of the consequences.  The moratorium must be extended.  There should also be no interest charged during payment breaks.</p></speech>

Every day, cycling in the Dublin area takes up to 60,000 cars off the road and saves 28,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions a year, according to the NTA.  It could be much more than that.  Research from the NTA states that 69% think that cycle tracks along roads, physically separated from traffic and pedestrians, would be useful to help them cycle more.  Accordingly, we need massive investment in cycle infrastructure.</p><p>This was a headline point and presented as a win for the Green Party in the programme for Government negotiations with 10% of the total transport capital budget would be allocated to cycling.  Is that actually being implemented?  According to <i>IrishCycle.com</i>, it appears some of the moneys being allocated to councils, such as Dublin City Council, are not being used for cycling infrastructure.  For example, of the &euro;2.3 million allocated to Dublin City Council for cycling infrastructure, it is planning to use that to resurface 50,000 sq.m.  However, fewer than 5,000 sq.m of those relate to cycle lanes or shared bus and cycle lane maintenance or both.  Essentially, only 10% of that funding for resurfacing is going to cycling infrastructure, while the rest is going on roads.  What guarantee is there that all this money is being spent on cycling infrastructure?</p></speech>

It is in a full state of crisis which has deepened since February and March this year.  The summer season has been a write-off and there is little hope of the aviation sector improving sufficiently for a bounce back in the autumn and winter months.</p>  <p>  Covid presents opportunities to straighten some practices.  An employer told me the other day that he was trying to implement a work-from-home policy a few years ago with his staff but it proved problematic.  Along came Covid and suddenly the pathway for bringing it forward was there in itself.</p>  <p>  In the second quarter of this year, 120 passengers passed through Shannon Airport.  That contrasted with 808 through Kerry, 7,800 through Cork Airport and 155,000 through Dublin Airport.  Shannon accounted for 0.07% of all inbound air passengers into the State.  That is a dramatic and stark fact which shows Shannon's position.  It urgently requires Government intervention.</p>  <p>  The aviation task force, which the Minister's predecessor established, has reported back.  Some of its recommendations have already been implemented, such as those relating to a temporary wage subsidy scheme.  The outstanding recommendation is the need for capital funding for Shannon Airport.  This has been asked by the airport's chief executive, Mary Considine and her board.  Will the Department urgently look at that?  It has been with the Government since 7 July.  It has been too long for that funding not to have been in place.  Covid presents that opportunity for Shannon to redesign aviation policy and appoint a new chairperson to the board.  Will the Department look at improving management structures in the airport?</p>  <p>  The market share of Shannon continues to slide but this is not unique in other European countries.  The Netherlands and Finland implemented aviation strategies and policies to address the overdominance of their capital city airports successfully.  Since 2015, Finland and the Netherlands have examined how to redesign their aviation policies to rebalance the proportion of passengers coming through Helsinki and Schiphol airports.  In this five-year period, Schiphol's dominance has dropped by 5%.  In that same five-year period, Dublin Airport's dominance has risen by 13%.</p> <p>This just shows that the gap is growing and the crisis is deepening.</p> <p> There is an opportunity to redesign an aviation policy for Ireland and to leverage the strength of Dublin Airport.  We have two possibilities: a fund for all passengers landing in Dublin could be leveraged and allocated proportionally to Shannon and Cork airports, or - and this is what Finland and Holland have gone for - every major airline seeking landing slots in Dublin could be subject to a conditional clause to the effect that once or twice per week the airline would have to fly out of Shannon.  If Lufthansa, Finnair or Delta were to fly into Dublin, it would be conditional on the aircraft not only landing and taking off in the capital but operating a service out of Shannon Airport once or twice per week at a minimum.</p> <p> It would be positive if in the coming days the Minister and his Department once again started using the language of Shannon being an international airport.  At some point over the lifetime of the previous Government, a discourse crept in whereby it started to be referred to as a regional airport.  That diminishes its status and standing in European and global aviation and its possibility of obtaining State and European supports.</p> <p> We need to consider a national airport authority.  Dublin had a predatory relationship with Shannon Airport even before Covid came about.  Separation has not been good for Shannon.  That fact has been borne out.  There was a famous economic report, the Booz report, which insisted that Shannon would have to have 1.8 million passengers per annum to be sustainable and viable.  In its best trading year since separating from Dublin, the airport fell well short of that, so it is not measuring up to that metric.  It cannot go back under the wing of Dublin Airport because that relationship has always been quite predatory and there is open competition between the two airports.  We need a national airport authority, as some other European countries have.</p> <p> Aer Lingus and Ryanair in recent weeks have both threatened to pull out of Shannon entirely.  Aer Lingus cabin crew have now set up their own task force of cabin and ground crew.  They would like to meet the Minister.  They are constructive and are coming up with proposals they see as front-line workers to save Shannon.  Aer Lingus has approached the Government, and I have been speaking to the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath.  The company is looking for liquidity and for the Government to help it through these ailing months.  It has received plenty of support in the form of wage subsidy schemes.  Any further support Aer Lingus gets from the Government needs to be conditional on it not pulling services from Shannon or Cork airports.  We need those services.  Aer Lingus is the only transatlantic airline flying out of Shannon at the moment.  The minute it goes, Shannon, unfortunately, will go with it.  Ryanair also feels like it is the poor relation in this regard.  It would argue, to quote one worker, that it is the only reason the lights are still on in Shannon.  It also has come to Government with certain asks.  It is playing hardball, which I understand that, but we now need to start moving a little closer in that regard.</p> <p> The IAA has a strong presence in Shannon Airport.  It has been brought to my attention, however, that in recent weeks some of the authority's junior staff in and around Shannon, not having a huge workload at the moment and there being no planes in the sky, have been put wearing masks and badges.  They are going into catering kitchens and coming through the back doors of places, pouncing on staff and saying, "You never checked my ID."  This has only added to the anxiety of companies that are already on tenterhooks and very stressed.  That has to stop.  It is an aviation authority.  Its role belongs in the sky monitoring air traffic, not as police officers going into local businesses.</p> <p> Railways and trains are very close to the Minister's heart.  There has been a proposal since 2010 to have a &euro;1.5 million railway stop in Crusheen.  It has had many false dawns.  The Minister is quite well acquainted with this situation.  I hope that during his term it will be restarted and that he will look at it.</p> <p> Regarding broadband, we need a better mechanism for communicating the amber and green areas.  This falls under the Minister's brief.  I hope he can look at it in order that people can have a better gist of when broadband will come to their area.</p></speech>

Having used the ferry services myself recently, I know they form critical transport infrastructure for those who rely on them.</p>  <p>  The public have played their part with high levels of adherence to public health requirements regarding the wearing of masks on public transport.  Many people rely on Irish Rail to travel to Dublin from Westport, Castlebar, Ballina, Foxford, Claremorris and Ballyhaunis.</p>  <p>  However, the aviation sector remains heavily impacted by Covid-19, unfortunately.  This has had a significant impact on passenger numbers at Ireland West Airport Knock.  People throughout the west hold Knock Airport in the highest regard as the beating heart of the Wild Atlantic Way.  It is a special place where parents and children are reunited and where families embark on long overdue holidays.  It is an arrival destination for those who have left many years ago to once again set foot back on Irish soil.  As an island, we rely especially on our airports for connectivity, more so than other mainland European countries.  This summer has been different, however, and Ireland West Airport Knock has witnessed a 90% reduction in summer passenger numbers.  Earlier this week the chambers of commerce in Mayo, Galway and Sligo called for additional support via the regional airports programme.  The financial situation of Knock Airport has deteriorated as a result of collapsing passenger numbers.  This is especially disappointing as estimates for the airport had expected 2020 to be its busiest year yet, getting ever closer to breaking the figure of 1 million passengers per annum.</p>  <p>  On 20 June, the Government set up a task force to report to the Minister and the Government on the restructuring of the aviation sector.  The task force report was sent to the Government on 10 July.  I recently asked the Taoiseach how he proposes to deal with the recommendations of the task force but I failed to get a response.  Is it to be referred to a special committee or dealt with by the Covid committee, which is currently in session?  If it is to be referred to a different committee, which Department will oversee its work, and will there be an opportunity for hearings from interested bodies to be heard?  When does the Minister expect the task force recommendations to be acted upon and implemented?  As this is a critical national issue, I ask the him to take a personal interest in this matter in the view of its importance for Dublin, Cork, Shannon and Knock and for Ireland as a whole.  I would like to hear what he has to say in his closing remarks on this matter.  Special consideration needs to be given to regional airports in the upcoming budget as they will play an increasing role in spreading passenger numbers when air travel moves towards normal levels versus over-reliance on Dublin Airport and funnelling passengers there.</p>  <p>  I am also conscious of the need to have the best road infrastructure in place to help tourism and Mayo industries as we navigate a post-Covid world.  With record numbers of staycations in Mayo, road usage has been much heavier this year compared with previous years.  It is excellent to see progress on the N5 Turlough to Westport dual carriageway, construction of which is well under way.  It will be critical infrastructure for our county when completed and will result in much safer travel as the existing road between Castlebar and Westport is quite simply unsafe and operating well beyond its intended capacity.  I would also appreciate it if the Minister's office would undertake to update me on other important road projects that will benefit Mayo, namely, the N5 Ballaghaderreen to Scramogue road project, the N26 Swinford to Ballina road and the R312 Castlebar to Belmullet road.</p></speech>

Transport was severely impacted by the difficulties of Covid-19, but people want to hear solutions and action.  To date, we have seen bus routes cancelled or reduced in capacity, the total collapse of the aviation sector and serious issues exposed in our school transport scheme.  Locally, in my constituency of Clare, I have been informed of a very concerning situation faced by people with disabilities who use the Dulick Enterprise Centre, in Ennis.  I have been told that these people have had bus routes and times changed on them recently, which is leaving service users abandoned for up to three hours, waiting for a bus home following their morning classes.  It gets worse.  Because of the Covid restrictions, these people cannot stay in the centre while waiting for the bus as it is not safe to do so.  I have been informed that the Local Link service applied for additional funding to service this request but that it has been denied. This is outrageous and we need to have this issue addressed and rectified immediately.</p> <p> Moving to aviation, this morning on Radio 1 the CEO of the Shannon Group reiterated that passenger numbers at Shannon Airport are down 97%.  This is causing serious issues in the region and we need the Minister to understand this fact.  Tourism locally has declined and we are hearing threats that Ryanair and Aer Lingus will pull their bases out of Shannon Airport.  If that happens, the key may as well be turned on the airport.  I have spoken to pilots and cabin crew in the Shannon base in recent days and they stated that morale among staff in Shannon is on the floor and their mental health and well-being are being severely impacted.  I have written separately to the Minister on this matter and I hope his response is comprehensive and solution-based.  We need to start testing at our airports and work towards the reopening of key routes to open the mid-west region to keep business links.  We need to ensure we offer direct supports to this sector for these workers.</p></speech>

It is a great honour and a huge responsibility.</p>  <p>  Early in the pandemic, front-line hospital staff in the Dublin City Council area were given free parking when they were near particular hospitals.  This was a very fair and welcome gesture.  This decision was made by the Government and Dublin City Council implemented it.  This measure should be re-introduced while Dublin is in level 3.  Given that teachers are now effectively front-line workers, this measure should be extended to them, specifically those working in schools that do not have parking.  These are mainly inner city schools and there are not many of them.  They include CBS Westland Row, City Quay national school and a few others.  Without teachers, the economy would be effectively closed now.  Given that members of the public are being encouraged to use public transport, this measure would benefit a small number of schools in the inner city.  Not many parking spaces are being used because of the reduction in traffic into the city.  The loss of revenue would be small but the gesture would be big and appreciated by teachers.  The Government should consider requesting Dublin City Council to give teachers in inner city schools without parking on their premises a break.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-23a.312" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1622" speakername="Verona Murphy" time="16:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300042#UU00300"><p>I am disappointed in the statements of the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton.  The Minister stated he had been in touch with all the stakeholders in the transport sector.  According to the information I have, that is incorrect.  He has not been in touch with the Irish Road Haulage Association, IRHA, an organisation that gave hundreds of hours of their time to assist the Government in Brexit and Covid preparations.  There has been no acknowledgement of the stellar performance of the licensed road haulage operators and their employees during Covid.  They called for assistance several times to prevent shipping companies insisting that drivers share a bed cabin space on board ships.  No assistance was forthcoming and no correspondence was answered.  To their credit, the drivers' steadfast refusal to share meant that not one case of Covid has been reported in the sector.  It is disturbing that there is so little regard for the sector.  This was something we had hoped would end with the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, but unfortunately that does not seem to be the case.  However, I am sure the Minister will make amends in his closing statement.</p>  <p>  Is this Government going to continue to take an ostrich approach and bury its head in the sand in relation to Brexit?  Why is it not moving heaven and earth to reduce the economy's reliance on the UK market and the UK land bridge?  The UK Government's current actions are clearly designed to threaten the Irish economy and the Good Friday Agreement.  It is using the threat of being able to cause chaos for the Irish economy to increase its negotiating strength with the European Union.  That includes trying to coerce the Government to compel the EU to capitulate to UK demands.  Surely the Government can see that the thing to do is not to passively live in hope that Boris Johnson and the UK Government will be reasonable and climb down.  Instead, the Government must react proactively and institute measures that reduce Ireland&rsquo;s vulnerability to this rogue UK Government.  It is time to be proactive.  The time has come to put vital daily ferries to mainland Europe in service.  Doing so now would dramatically reduce the risk to Ireland&rsquo;s trade with the EU.  Members of the Government are not listening to warnings from the people in the know.  They are talking among themselves.  They are not reading the correspondence from stakeholders or if they are, they are not answering it.  I have spent 30 years using the land bridge as a haulier and the Government is hiring advisers who, dare I say, have most likely never sat in a truck, never mind been to Dover port, in their lives.</p>  <p>  I urge the Minister to read today&rsquo;s UK media.  All of the newspapers are carrying a story, which was purportedly leaked, that Michael Gove has written that there will be queues of 7,000 trucks post-Brexit lasting for days.  He is telling them what they already know.  The T&aacute;naiste and half of this Government are busy making videos, telling people in business that we are 100 days out from Brexit and the actions they should take.  The T&aacute;naiste stated they should think about their supply chain and if they are using the land bridge of Britain to get to continental Europe, they need to think about how that is going to work and talk to their suppliers and haulage and transport companies.  I will offer my advice for the umpteenth time.  The Government must take its head out of the sand.  The land bridge will not work and the Government needs to put in place a fast, efficient daily ferry service from Ireland to France now.  What is wrong with the Government?  It is telling people to think about something for which there is already a solution.  It appears it is not thinking about it so I will say again that "fast and efficient" means the shortest, most viable option to mainland Europe and that comes from Rosslare to Le Havre or Cherbourg.  It also needs to operate on a daily basis.  That is the appropriate proactive approach we need, rather than trying to be the Stephen Spielberg of Twitter.  Anyone would think the Government is waiting on a sign from God. </p>  <p>  The flour and the sugar that is needed to bake bread in Ireland daily is imported.  When the baking line is stalled because the product is sitting in a queue and people cannot bake bread, will the Minister and the rest of the Twitter gang be making videos apologising to the business owners and staff of Irish Pride in Taghmon, County Wexford?  Will they make videos apologising for the fact that the price of a loaf of bread has risen to &euro;3?  That will be the result of the Government's passive attitude.  Irish consumers will pay the price.  What will the Minister tell the fresh fish exporters of Duncannon, Kilmore and Killybegs when the fish is in a queue in the UK rotting in a trailer?  What will he tell the owners and staff of Kelly's hotel in Rosslare, the Talbot Hotel, Clayton Whites Hotel and Whitford House Hotel in Wexford town, the Riverside Park Hotel in Enniscorthy and all the other Wexford hotels when there is no more traffic coming from the UK tourists and the Government has failed to make an effort to replace those UK tourists by putting a daily direct ferry in place to mainland Europe for EU visitors to Ireland?  All of this can be avoided if this Government puts a daily service to mainland Europe in place in time and that time is now.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, I had a conversation about customs procedures which alarmed even me.  I was told a document would take ten minutes to complete but I can say from 30 years of practical knowledge that it takes more like 40 minutes, which means less than two documents per hour.  No one has mentioned the fact that the trade control and export system, TRACES, used by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which carries out sanitary and phytosanitary inspections, has not even been advised to hauliers.  They have been promised instruction video demonstrations but with less than four months to go until Brexit, they have received nothing.  There is an opportunity for this Government to be the angels of Brexit and the Government that saved Ireland from the chaos of the UK's making.  If it does not save us, it will be responsible for the demise of Ireland.  Who will want to do business on an island when they cannot get their product on or off the island on a competitive timeline, one which gives certainty of delivery times?  It will all be because the Government would not ensure that a daily shipping service to and from mainland Europe was in place.  It is time to wake up and smell the coffee. </p></speech>

When school bus capacity was reduced to 50% and parents were told that if they drove their children to school they could seek a refund of their free travel, was there ever a discussion about just hiring extra buses?  Private bus and coach operators could certainly do with the business.  The Federation of Transport Operators, FOTO, is only too willing to engage with the Government on this issue.  Many of us have received correspondence from the organisation regarding this issue.  It was shocking that so many children were left without places and that additional capacity was not brought on stream.</p>  <p>  I have a larger issue regarding a private operator.  A man in Carlow contacted me last week.  He had applied to operate a rural bus service around County Carlow.  He had done all the work, had applied for it and was told that he had the contract.  He did not have a bus in his name, because he was waiting to see if he would get the contract.  One morning last week, he received notification that he had the contract, but by that evening he was told that he did not have the contract because he did not have a bus in his name.  He did have other buses.  How could anyone from the Department have expected that man to have changed buses and got a bigger vehicle, if he was not going to get the contract?  I was wondering how it could happen that someone was told in the morning that he had the bus route, contracted from the Department, but that it was taken away from him by that evening.  What is more, when I rang the Department, the bus route was gone and had been given to someone else.  We need to look at these things and what we are doing.  We cannot forget that we need to support our rural areas.</p>  <p>  Why do we have rules for some sections of society and different rules for others?  Several constituents contacted me to say that they were no longer allowed to drive a bus because they had turned 70 years of age.  While we are all trying to protect those aged over 70 from Covid-19, this is not the reason those people cannot continue to drive.  I have repeatedly asked why an Irish citizen can serve as a public representative after the age of 70 in the D&aacute;il or the Seanad, but such a person is not allowed to drive a bus.  We must really look at this system.  </p>  <p>  I also want to talk about my home area of Carlow town.  We are in the process of working with the NTA on Carlow town's bus service.  Meetings are ongoing, but I would like a written reply to let me know when that service will be started.  Meetings are welcome, and I welcome that the service is supposed to be going ahead - and my understanding is that it is - but I would like some dates.  Will the Minister please respond to me regarding this issue?  </p>  <p>  We also have an excellent service in Carlow and Kilkenny, which is one of the best, the Ring-A-Link service.  </p></speech>

Under the auspices of EU projects, we have been told that there will be some electric buses.  I believe that the Ring-A-Link service might be in line for one of those buses.  Is capital funding available, and will an electric bus be furnished to the Ring-A-Link service in Carlow, Kilkenny and Tipperary?  Is there a subvention or a roadmap?  I need answers to all those questions.</p>  <p>  I always feel that Carlow, and Kilkenny and the rest of the south east, is forgotten.  We have always asked about the possibility of an extra bus, particularly one providing services from New Ross, St. Mullins, Tinnahinch and Borris.  Is there any way in these times of need that we can get a bus service in those areas?  My understanding is that payments are available through Covid-19 schemes.  I also understand, and I would like to have this in writing, that a bus is meant to start operating from Arklow to Carlow?  Will the Minister confirm that?  </p>  <p>  These are all issues we need to get information on and we must ensure that we give people, particularly in my area, these services and timing is crucial.  We have all been through the Covid-19 crisis and, as the Minister will be aware, transport is a major issue.  I would like some information on that.</p>  <p>  Others have raised the issue of taxi drivers, but I know many in my area who are under pressure.  They have mortgages, and feel they have been forgotten.  We need to help and support them.  I ask the Minister to do his best to see what we can do and provide as much proper transport as possible.  As I always say, things do not just revolve around Dublin; we must remember rural Carlow and Kilkenny, where we are always forgotten.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-23a.317" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1572" speakername="John Lahart" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300043#VV00500"><p>Following on from Deputy Murnane O'Connor's comments, I met taxi drivers and the Minister of State last week regarding those issues and following up on them.  Many pressing transport issues are facing Dublin, as the Minster will appreciate, but I will focus on a matter I raised during the climate action debate last week.  It concerns e-scooters.  There are far more important issues, but this is my e-scooter week and I have decided this is an opportunity to drive this issue home.  The Minister was very enthusiastic during that debate, when he said that we should get legislation for e-scooters over the line and let us do that.</p>  <p>  That attitude is not reflected in the responses to parliamentary questions, so we need to go back and look at that.  I did go away thinking at the time that I was the smaller element in the "let us do that" equation, compared to the Minister.  He has the report his predecessor had.  I cannot do anything with it.  I have done much work with the various providers, and I have seen many developments and much evolution.  We now have onboard helmets, some e-scooters now come with indicators and number plates and they are much more robust and durable.  Many come with scooter stands, and also have geolocation technology, which means they do not become litter on the street.  They are also speed governed and the technology, as the Minister knows, is so sophisticated that the scooters can now be speed governed to the point where it is possible to ride them at 15 mph or so along St. Stephen's Green, but coming to a pedestrianised area such as Grafton Street will cause the remotely governed speed to immediately drop off and a rider would have to dismount.  </p>  <p>  In the context of public transport now being only for essential purposes, there is a case for making e-scooters available in Dublin as they provide a great deal of mobility.  The UK, however, has taken the lead.  Some of the responses to parliamentary questions from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport state that it is not the right time and it is very challenging to do things during the Covid-19 crisis.  The UK, however, legislated for a trial period of one year, in several cities, these e-scooters are being rolled out and a significant appetite has been demonstrated in those British cities for this type of transport.  I want to do that here and so does the Minister.  Can he give us a timeline that will let us get this done?  </p></speech>

This is the model of hybrid remote working, where employees mostly work remotely but come into the office perhaps once a week, or a few times a month.  Companies and employees are still experimenting, and we do not know what the post-Covid-19 landscape will look like, but experience has shown that once employers adopt a "remote first" approach, as they have been forced to do during the pandemic, many employees only occasionally need to be in the office.  Hybrid remote working offers many people, who live in the capital for employment reasons, the opportunity to move out into our regions where they can enjoy a better quality of life and our rail infrastructure can be a key enabler to make that happen.</p>  <p>  Progress has been made in modernising our rail network to make the capital more accessible from our regional cities: Cork and Galway are now just over two and a half hours by rail to Dublin, while Limerick and Waterford are just over two hours.  I believe it is possible, however, with fairly boring continuous engineering improvements, to increase speeds so that all our regional cities are under two hours from Dublin.  Once the spine of our network is upgraded, we can look at a continuous programme of reopening lines and re-orienting our bus services to feed into this network, with a particular focus on funding Local Link to increase the accessibility of rural towns and villages.  Equally, we must improve connectivity within our regions, increasing the level of service between Galway and Waterford, through Clare, Limerick and large towns in south Tipperary, such as Cahir, Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir, and on the line in north Tipperary through Roscrea and Nenagh.  I am essentially talking about making our country much smaller to increase economic opportunities for people living across the State via the new hybrid working arrangements that many employers have introduced.</p>  <p>  Rail can also drive development within our cities and regions.  In Limerick, we have an opportunity to reopen lines.  I hope we can reopen the Limerick-Adare rail line in time for the prestigious Ryder Cup, which is to be held in Adare Manor on its 100th anniversary in 2027.  Simultaneously, we can reinstate the line further to Foynes, to enable the ambitious plans for expanding the port to drive the offshore renewable energy revolution.  We can establish a suburban rail network for Limerick, with new stations at Ballysimon, Moyross and Raheen, and expand capacity by doubling the track between Limerick and Limerick Junction and begin the work of planning a rail link to Shannon Airport.</p> <p>I met members of the Green Party in Westmeath last night, who urged me to work with the Minister on the issue of Killucan station.  I noted the remarks made earlier by Deputy Clarke but there are, of course, many other possibilities.</p> <p> Rail has the ability to be a huge driver of regional development.  By increasing the quality of our intercity rail network and opening new lines, we can take advantage of how the Covid-19 pandemic has changed the nature of work and revitalise our regions.</p></speech>

I salute Cahir garda&iacute; and in particular Sergeant Ray Moloney for an initiative he is going to have in Cahir day care centre next Sunday to encourage na daoine &oacute;ige, na daoine aosta and their families to understand the proper use of bikes and interaction with other vehicles and road users.</p>  <p>  The Minister knows Caoimhe Kavanagh of the famed bus and coach company based in Urlingford and Tipperary.  That company needs supports and practical talks.  I encourage the Minister to meet her.</p>  <p>  Other sectors have been left behind, including self-employed taxi drivers, thousands of whom we saw protesting on the streets.  There are also limousine drivers who are specialists.  Foreign dignitaries often travel in limousines when they swing into the back of Leinster House.  They are pristine vehicles, driven by exemplary drivers who are courteous to visitors and introduce them to Ireland.  Those people also need help because they get none and the taxi association does not represent them.  They are exempt from VAT but that is worth nothing to them because they get nothing else.  They want VRT breaks and other supports.  I am asking the Minister to meet representatives of those drivers, the National Transport Authority and some of us Deputies.  They are front-line workers who sell our country, meet our people and always look after them.</p>  <p>  Ring a Link was mentioned earlier.  It is a wonderful set-up and I salute the manager, Jackie Melia.  It was set up in south Tipperary, Kilkenny and Carlow and has proven it has the ability to do what it does.  I must declare that I am a board member.  Ring a Link has brought thousands of people on journeys.</p>  <p>  While school transport may not be the Minister's area of responsibility, I must bring the following point to his attention.  Some 50 students have contacted my office about the lack of school transport.  One 11-year-old schoolchild is going from Clogheen, under the famed Vee, to school in Mitchelstown every day.  He gets a Bus &Eacute;ireann bus from Clogheen at 7.50 a.m. to be brought to school in Mitchelstown.  He is sharing a bus with other passengers and there are implications for contact tracing if anything happens.  The real problem for the parents is with the transport option to get home in the evening.  These students finish school at 3.40 p.m. and the bus does not come until 5.40 p.m.  It is a stupid situation when coach and minibus operators have their vehicles parked up and the Government does not give them a bob.  Those buses are going rusty and many of those operators are self-employed.</p>  <p>  Some parents clock up distances of 21 km twice a day to bring students back and forth.  The Minister is the leader of the Green Party and wants to cut down on emissions and everything else.  He has to look at this in a holistic way with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Foley, and others in the Cabinet.  I ask the Minister to look at those issues.</p></speech>

The tests are seriously delayed in Kerry.  A young fellow who has organised a job in Cork but cannot drive there will lose the job.  A young farmer who wants to go to the farmers' course in Clonakilty but is waiting for months for a driving test cannot go to Clonakilty.  The same story applies to youngsters going to colleges.  They cannot drive because they cannot get their driving test.</p>  <p>  The public health team's decision that school buses can only operate at 50% capacity has created pandemonium and uproar all over Kerry, in Gneeveguilla, Rathmore, Killorglin, Cahirsiveen or wherever it may be.  People are stranded.  Many parents were not sure were the schools going to open on 1 September and had not paid for tickets.  Anyone who paid after that date is left standing at the side of the road, waiting for the new buses to come on.  Before the decision was made to limit buses to 50% capacity, the Government should have ensured that double the amount of buses were going to run.  That has not happened and children have been left on the side of the road in all the places I have mentioned.</p>  <p>  Deputy Murnane O'Connor mentioned the over 70s.  I have known about this rule for a long time.  It is hard to get drivers for school buses now.  The exclusion of the over 70s is not a State rule but was brought in by Bus &Eacute;ireann whereby when one reaches 70 years of age, one cannot drive a Bus &Eacute;ireann or school bus.  I will mention Tom O'Shea and Willie Sweeney from Kilgarvan who would drive a bus to any part of the world and are now left behind because of this stupid rule.</p></speech>

I am getting calls from frustrated and angry parents from Kinsale to Mizen Head.  Coaches and buses are available.  Drivers are available because they are not driving tourists around Ireland.  Why can those vehicles not be used to transport our children to school?</p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il promised changes when it was in opposition but the situation has got worse.  I hear of situations of children who have had tickets for bus transport in west Cork for three to four years but those tickets have been withdrawn due to a lottery system that was drawn up by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  The whole thing is a shambles.  We, as politicians, are at the front line, trying to clean up a mess that, in most cases, could be sorted out locally between the bus owners, parents and local politicians at no extra cost.</p>  <p>  I met representatives from Cork Airport last week and they urgently need to meet the Minister.  I am urging him not to stand idly by while airports go out of business.  I brought up rapid testing months ago with the then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, and I have brought it up with the current Government with a view to keeping the airports open.  We can surely do that in Ireland without losing our airlines and airports.  If we are to open the airports safely, rapid testing is a must.  The Government needs to withdraw all Government airport charges in Cork at this time. </p>  <p>  Taxi and limousine drivers are suffering extreme stress and anxiety during these Covid-19 times because their incomes have been wiped out.  Nonetheless, they have to keep their cars taxed, insured and licensed.  They are fearful of cancelling their insurance because they may find it difficult or impossible to get insurance again or a renewal could see their premiums increase.  Many drivers are over 66 years of age, working full time and paying income tax but, because of age discrimination, are unable to avail of the pandemic unemployment payment.  Significant numbers of drivers have been in the business for 40 years and, having paid exorbitant fees for their taxi plate under the old system, are still bearing a significant financial burden.  Regardless of the condition of a taxi, it must be taken off the road once it is ten years old and drivers have to upgrade their cars to keep their licences active.  In the current business climate, those cars are predominantly parked up.  In these difficult and exceptional times, could that limit be increased from ten to 15 years to ease the financial stress that exists at the moment?</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to speak but find it difficult not to despair at our inaction on climate change.  I am totally on the Minister's side, as I said yesterday.  We need to take urgent action.  We declared a climate emergency on 9 May 2019.  At the time, the then Taoiseach talked about that being symbolic and I am afraid that is what it has been.  We were led by young children and declared a climate emergency through motions tabled by the Opposition.</p>  <p>  I heard the Minister earlier and welcome the positive announcements about the western rail corridor.  I understood him to say that the report is about to be published, though he can correct me if I misinterpreted him.  The Minister will look at increasing capacity to allow commuter travel in Athenry and Oranmore.</p>  <p>  I look at Galway city and it is crying out for vision.  I am tired of the blame game.  The local authority states it is starved of funding.  The Government suggests that we have Monopoly money, billions to give out.  Park and ride has never been rolled out in Galway notwithstanding that it has been an objective in the city development plan since 2005.  One would imagine that some type of penalty would apply to the local authority for failing to act on its city development plan 15 years later.</p>  <p>  As I mentioned last night, I recently attended a meeting with the officials in the county council and when they were asked about park and ride, they said that they were looking at a number of options but it would depend on the outer bypass.  I have watched this cul-de-sac since 1999.  All the eggs of management and the majority of councillors were put into one basket, namely, a road that was going nowhere.</p> <p>All of the time we let the traffic build up in a way that is unsustainable.  There is no park-and-ride or comprehensive school transport system.  There is no connectivity with Connemara in any feasible or sustainable way with tickets that are affordable.  </p> <p> We have declared an emergency.  The Minister was in opposition when he knew and supported our position, which was that we are not talking about the challenge of climate change.  Rather, we are talking about a disaster and there is a tiny window of opportunity where we must take transformative action.  To take transformative action, we have to lead.</p> <p> On a practical level, where is the park-and-ride facility in Galway?  The Minister should get on to the council, set a date and roll it out.  Some 24,000 people signed a petition more than two years ago calling on the Minister to carry out a light rail feasibility study.  Can he please commit to such a study?  It fits in with the national development plan.  There is wonderful language in that plan on sustainability, growing the footprint of Galway city by more than 40% and increasing the population to 120,000 by 2040.  Let us do that in a sustainable way.  Let us work together and develop the city in a sustainable way but not at the expense of Connemara, Kilmaine, Shrule or other areas.  We must realise that development must be done in a sustainable way.</p> <p> Before I hand over to my colleague, I want to support him and the other speakers who have mentioned Shannon.  The airport in Galway closed and we accepted that as an inevitability at the time on the guarantee that the airport in Shannon would serve the region.  We have not served the staff there very well during this pandemic.</p></speech>

The most obvious multilateral framework is the European Union.  While we have been laggards in the implementation of EU directives, they have served a very useful purpose in Ireland.  I refer to the water framework directive, the birds directive and the habitats directive.  Equally, the European Union is coming together with regard to air travel, as well as travel more generally.</p>  <p>  What is the delay in adopting the European approach?  There is currently a nascent approach.  The Commission has made a recommendation and it is to be hoped it will be adopted by the Council.  Can we get a commitment that we are going to adopt and apply that as soon as it is rolled out?  We worked in splendid isolation through much of the summer.  We had much more restrictions on international travel than other European member states.  At the end of it all, we do not, unfortunately, appear to be a lot better off.  There was a lot of resentment in Ireland among people who could not take holidays. </p>  <p>  I do not expect the Minister had time to hear what was said at the Covid committee today, but an immunologist based in UCD, Professor Kirsten Schaeffer, who is also a consultant in St .Vincent's Hospital, said it does not matter where one goes on holidays.  The act of going on holidays does not matter; it is what one does on holidays that matters.  People should be going somewhere safe and should take the normal precautions that they take in Ireland with regard to physical distancing, cough etiquette, washing hands, etc.  If people do that, they are as safe in an area with a lower incidence level in Europe as they are by staying in Ireland.</p>  <p>  We were told for a long time that we could only travel to countries with a lower 14-day incidence rate than Ireland.  As our incidence rate has, unfortunately, risen, we have not adopted that policy.  We have not accepted that there are large swathes of Europe with a lower incidence rate than we have and that it is safe people to go to those places.  Can we get a commitment from the Government today that as soon as a common European policy, as proposed by the Commission, is adopted that Ireland will adopt that as many other countries in the EU will?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-23a.326" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1465" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="16:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300045#XX00300"><p>In the ten minutes I have, I will group into ten subjects the responses to what I have heard.  I will not have sufficient time to deal with any one issue, but I will reflect on what I have heard Deputies say.</p>  <p>  I will start with the contribution made by Deputy O'Rourke.  Aer Lingus workers are in real difficulty with regard to back pay and the temporary wage subsidy scheme.  I understand the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection said earlier this week that the Department is awaiting the relevant forms from Aer Lingus.  Aer Lingus has said it is waiting for clarification from the Department.  My understanding is that the relevant documentation is to be provided and I hope that deals with that immediate issue.</p>  <p>  Deputies McNamara, Smith, Collins and a number of others spoke about the critical issue of testing at airports.  We are an isolated island nation.  We have to maintain air connectivity and make things easy for people who have to travel for business or personal reasons.  For various reasons, we want to maintain our air connectivity.  Within that, the adoption of a common European approach is the best way of going about this because it allows for reciprocal arrangements.</p>  <p>  One Deputy said that Germany is looking for us to provide advanced testing for anyone flying into Germany or else testing on arrival and quarantining.  That European approach is the appropriate route for us to take to develop a stable and clear environment on what is a very difficult issue.  It is difficult because we have received different advices.  The health services gave us advice to the effect that they did not want testing at airports and that there were difficulties with that approach.</p>  <p>  The European Commission's proposal is the right one.  We have adopted it in accepting its mechanism for defining what a green list country is.  Normal procedures mean that people do not have to restrict their movements or isolate on arrival from countries on the list.  We expect to adopt the amber and red route mechanism that the European Commission has proposed.  There is a delay in that because we have to wait for the General Affairs Council meeting on 13 October where it has to be agreed at a European level.  At the moment it is a Commission proposal.  We are supportive of it, but we have to see whether other countries accept the proposal. </p>  <p>  In the interim period we have to see where we can get the testing capability.  There is a limit on testing capability across the world and we are trying to source what is required and make sure that if there is agreement in the EU on the Commission approach we will be able to adopt the red and amber mechanisms.  They are flexible.  There are choices within that.  We will have to await European co-operation on that.</p>  <p>  Deputy Mac Lochlainn, Cahill, Wynne, Crowe and a number of others raised the issue of Shannon Airport.  I would put Cork Airport in the same category.  Those two airports have acute problems.  The dramatic fall in air passenger transport does not just affect these airports or this country.  It has been a global phenomena.  In my mind, there is a critical and strategic imperative in retaining international air connectivity through Shannon and Cork.  In this crisis or any future scenario, we cannot allow a significant diminution in the regional and important international role of those two airports to happen.</p>  <p>  I believe Deputy Quinlivan said that Shannon Airport should be regrouped under the DAA.  I will be honest.  I met the unions based in the airport.  I felt that change would take two or three years and would not solve the underlying strategic issues.  We have to make strategic decisions on Shannon.  I am not sure that reconnecting it to the DAA would immediately assist in that.  We have to make sure that whatever supports or other measures we put in place Cork and Shannon airports survive and return to growth, and there cannot be a huge loss to the region from that.</p>  <p>  Another critical issue is school bus services and transport.  I receive regular correspondence about it.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn first raised the issue.  I am very aware of the personal relationships of people in Donegal who have told me about their issues.  We could go right around the country.  In a pandemic circumstances change and we do not have total control over what is happening.  We spent the summer preparing the school transport system in a way that was appropriate so that we could manage the buses safely and have a system in place.  With the increase in numbers a few days before the schools were due to reopen, the health advice was that there should be 50% capacity.  We had three or four days to act.  The Department of Education and Skills is still examining this.  We would need 1,600 buses and drivers.</p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>That availability within a matter of days was not possible.  The Department of Education and Skills is working now with the industry, as Deputy Cahill and number of other Deputies have said, to see if we can switch some of those bus services that are not being used in the coach and tourism industry at present and to see if they can be made available.  They were not available on the first day back in school by any means and there have been real difficulties, which we acknowledge, but the Government is working to the best of our ability to see if it is possible to provide that additional capacity to be able to meet both the new health guidelines and the needs of the students right across this country.</p> <p> With regard to the points raised by Deputies Boyd Barrett, McAuliffe and many others on the taxi industry, we are going to have to work similarly with that industry and sit down with it again.  I met the representative groups two weeks ago and intend to go back to them, while working with the National Transport Authority and with the Department, to see what additional measures can be put in place.  A whole series of existing measures has been taken but we need to see what additional measures are needed to respond to the proposals these groups are making.  We will come back to them to see if there are mechanisms through which we can support that industry.  I cannot commit to that here today because it will require work but we are committed to meeting the industry and to trying to ensure that those involved also will manage and survive through this incredibly difficult period.</p> <p> One of the most critical issues which did not get as much attention as it could have but one of the big structural changes that is coming to the transport sector from the Covid-19 pandemic, is the switch, as Deputies Michael Moynihan and Leddin referred to, to remote working.  It provides the opportunity for fundamental strategic change for the better for regional development and for our towns and villages in a new way and that is something which we must use to our benefit and advantage.  It is one of the few advantages coming out of this Covid-19 period.  To do that, in response to Deputies Clarke, O&rsquo;Connor and a number of others, we must review our bus services, our Local Link bus services and our town bus services.  Deputy Clarke referred to Mullingar bus service.  We need to change our thinking around bus services from being all about long-distance commuting into the cities and to start looking at bus services as a more local, rural, urban, village and town bus services, because it may be that the needs of these people in some of these towns will not be about getting out of the towns and up to the city and back.  It may well involve working in the town, working from home or in an enterprise hub and having local bus services would greatly help to cater for that.</p> <p> The same would apply to Crusheen railway station, or Killucan and or some of the other public transport services that are mentioned.  People know that my instinct in that regard is to invest in public transport, first and foremost.  That has to be our strategic response to create that better local environment.</p> <p> On Deputy Paul Murphy&rsquo;s point on the development of cycling, I fully agree with and commit to him that we will be delivering on the programme for Government commitments to resource cycling and resurfacing is part of that.  It is not an insignificant part but it is not the key element.  The key element is the reallocation of space.  That, together with funding which will be available, will require political commitment at a local council level and I hope that I can get his and the support of others in this regard.  We should be radical now in creating safe spaces on our roads to promote cycling.  </p> <p>To respond to Deputy Lahart, I commit similarly that those facilities can also be used for e-scooters and while I am told by the Department that there are all sorts of complexities regarding legislation, I commit to him that this issue will get a real priority and we will promote it because it is part of this new mobility and changing away from these long-distance commutes and looking at alternatives.</p> <p> Last but not least, with regard again to how we change the way we do things, Either Deputy Connolly or Deputy Leddin or Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire mentioned the need to be proactive with light rail when looking at Cork, Galway and Limerick.  That is critical.  I look at Dublin, of course, because it is my own home town but one of the things I have been concentrating more than anything else on in the first two months in office is working with the authorities in Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick.  If our balanced regional development is to work, we need to invest in those cities as a counterpoint to the country tipping off into the east coast, which is not good for Dublin in any case.  Was it Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire who said to advance a light rail in Cork, we could have a high-speed bus service or a really high quality bus corridor?  We could do that, in anticipation of us moving towards a light rail system, which we will.  We could do the same in Galway.  We do not need to wait for the northern road or any other road.  We need to build the public transport in Galway now.  We need to build both the cycling and rail infrastructure.  We had a debate earlier about the twin tracking of the Athenry line.  If we do not do that, the housing will be on a continuing sprawl on a long-term basis and we are back then to everybody driving and commuting, in and out, and getting caught in traffic, with Parkmore Industrial Estate getting blocked up.  It will not work.  We use this time of change to make change and I really appreciate the contributions from every Deputy here in that regard.</p></speech>

While I agree that the vast majority of the Bill's provisions amount to a tidying-up exercise, the decision not to have pre-legislative scrutiny should not have been taken.  Pre-legislative scrutiny would have been a very good way of ensuring accountability and transparency and would have reassured me and my colleagues that that is the simple purpose of the Bill.</p>  <p>  I mention Jadotville, which was also mentioned by a number of Deputies in the debate last week.  I was due to speak on this Bill last week, which I believe would have been 59 years to the day since day two of the siege of Jadotville in 1961.  As many Deputies have done, and we raised this issue with the Taoiseach and the previous Minister for Defence, I ask the Minister to re-examine that event.  This is a time when we need true heroes and people to look up to.  On this occasion, those heroes happen to be all men, and I have no difficulty with that, but I ask him to do the right thing.  One hundred and fifty-five Irish soldiers who were defending themselves against 3,500 better armed forces, many of them mercenaries, were caught up in a nightmare scenario where they acquitted themselves beyond belief.  While a number of them were wounded, nobody was killed.  I ask the Minister to honour what the commandant asked for at the time, which was to give these men medals for bravery.  He named the soldiers who deserved those medals, and they have never been honoured.  I have no idea what the difficulty is with that.  I may be an innocent human being in this world but it seems to me that at a time when we are crying out for heroes and people are begging us to do the right thing, this is one way to do that.</p> <p>It is in the power of the Minister to implement Commandant Pat Quinlan&rsquo;s recommendations regarding the soldiers.  I had the privilege of knowing some of them.  I will not list them.  One of them died just three years ago in Galway.  I have read the books and I have watched the movie.  I recently read <i>The Same Age as the State</i>by M&aacute;ire Mhac an tSaoi.  She has one version of what happened.  I have read other versions also.  A number of soldiers have not been honoured.  The parents of some of them were collecting the children's allowance at the time in question.  The young men went out and did what they had to do.  I understand that the defence tactics used in the siege of Jadotville have become standard textbook procedure in the German Army and other armies.  I will leave that for now and ask the Minister to do the right thing for the soldiers.<br/><br/>I will mention the circumstances in Lesbos towards the end of my contribution.  We certainly cannot talk about the Defence (Amendment) Bill without considering what has been happening in Greece and the belated action of the EU.  The EU finally announced today it is going to do something but, of course, the emphasis is on strengthening the borders and not on examining the root causes of the conflict and what is leading people to leave their homes and families.  People do not just get up and leave for the sake of it; they do so because of horror, war and violence.  That should be recognised, particularly by the Irish, who have left these shores for hundreds of years.<br/><br/>I will leave aside the subject of the delegation of operational control for a moment and revert to it later.  I understand the re-enlisting of suitably qualified people is now not part of the Bill.  The Minister might correct me if I am incorrect on that.  It is noteworthy that we have a need to re-enlist because we allowed for the development of circumstances in which we have run down all aspects of our Defence Forces.  Commandant Conor King warned in September 2019 that the loss of expertise was having a direct impact on the safety, operational performance and well-being of Defence Forces personnel.  I do not believe much has changed since except for the very limited recommendations on the commission.<br/><br/>The White Paper of 2015 recommended a review of HR policies, including retirement policies, and age profiles.  According to the former Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe, in 2019, a review of mandatory retirement ages in the Defence Forces was to be undertaken.  It was never undertaken.  The Minister might address that in his concluding speech.<br/><br/>The tidying up in respect of not enlisting minors is very welcome.  I absolutely could not go against that.  The gender-neutral language is also very welcome.  We are taking out the words &quot;minor&quot; and &quot;his&quot; and including gender-neutral language.  Again, it is interesting and significant that we are doing so against a background in which only eight of the 75 inducted into the Defence forces in the year up to 28 July 2020 were female.  Five of the 44 recruited into the Army, three of the 28 recruited into the Naval Service and none of those recruited into the Air Corps were female.  As of 31 July 2020, there were 483 women in the Army, by comparison with 6,304 men.  There are 65 women in the Naval Service, by comparison with 838 men.  There are 37 women in the Air Corps, by comparison with 685 men.  It is important to put the gender-neutral language in context.<br/><br/>I have no difficulty with the extension of time to bring forward an appeal for a summary court-martial. <br/><br/>For me, these are the tidying-up exercises.  I shall now address the main section, which inserts a new section, 17A, to permit the delegation by the Minister for Defence of a limited degree of control and authority over a Defence Forces contingent, referred to as &quot;operational control&quot;.  The Minister tells us this is simply to underpin current practices regarding day-to-day operational control of contingents of the Permanent Defence Force.  It is regarded, therefore, as a tidying-up exercise but perhaps if the pre-legislative scrutiny had not been bypassed, we would have found out the <i>modus operandi</i>today.  There was delegation without legislation or safeguards.  What problems emerged?  What analysis was done in this regard to this <i>ad hoc</i>delegation of power?  How many times was operational control delegated in this manner?  What analysis of risk was done regarding our policy of neutrality?  I would like those questions answered because we have sent soldiers to Mali as part of a very questionable, French-led, neocolonial approach.  There are many other examples.  If the Minister is asking us to pass tidying-up legislation, there is an onus on him to have an open and transparent approach.  Have all the facts come out?  How many times did the Minister delegate?  In what way?  What problems emerged?  What were the safeguards?  Did anything else emerge?<br/><br/>There is a little line at the end of the explanatory information on the Bill that states, interestingly, that there will be no cost to the Exchequer.  This is ironic in a context in which our Defence Forces are the lowest paid of all public servants.  Defence Forces strength is at its lowest in 50 years.  All these facts and figures have been quoted <i>ad nauseam</i>by various Deputies and I am not going into them again except to say it is difficult to consider legislation such as this without commenting on the reality on the ground.<br/><br/>With regard to what is happening in Lesbos, I am simply horrified by the lack of action by the European Union, including this country.  We can rush into action to pass legislation when it suits without mentioning the substantive problems on the ground.  My difficulty with the section the Minister is inserting is that it is too open-ended.  Operational control is ceded, albeit on a limited basis, for a certain purpose but there is no information so I cannot make a judgment.  I want to support this Bill as tidying-up legislation but, in the absence of knowledge, I have a difficulty with that.  When the power is delegated, in what capacity will the forces be used?  Will they be helping out NATO?  Will they be helping out a future European army?  Will they be used in PESCO activities?  I am aware we are involved in one such activity in an observational capacity.  Every time we mention a European army, we are told we are hysterical and paranoid and that this has nothing to do with what the EU is about.  I refer the Minister to the document produced by MEP Deirdre Clune, former MEP Brian Hayes, who went on to greater things in the golf club, MEP Sean Kelly and former MEP Mairead McGuinness, who has gone on to greater things.  Page 13 states, &quot;Can anyone really say for sure that we are now a truly neutral country?&quot;  They are looking at having a progressive Irish security and defence policy at EU level.  The entire paper is an attempt to loosen what has already been loosened beyond belief &ndash; the concept of neutrality.  They are loosening it up even more.  I mentioned this to the Minister previously, and I believe he has his own views on that.  He might enlighten us again as to what his views were on that paper and whether they have changed in the meantime.<br/><br/>We talk about there being no cost to the Exchequer but we are contributing a huge amount of money.  Again, there is no transparency in that regard.  There is no way that I, as a Deputy, mother and woman, can find out exactly what we are spending to enhance our military capacity in Europe while some of our soldiers here are in receipt of State subsidies under various schemes.</p> <p>We have no problem increasing our money and our financial contribution to Europe with no transparency around it.  My greatest difficulty is with that section.  Perhaps the Minister could help me with my difficulty by clarifying what I have asked.  How many times has that power been delegated in the past and for what purposes?  What analysis has been conducted and why the need for it now as opposed to previously?</p> <p>Finally, I cannot stand here without raising Lesbos again and our failure to do anything.  The announcement today on the belated or promised action by the EU is troubling.  The emphasis is on strengthening our borders and sending migrants back.  If a person is a true refugee, however, we will let him or her in.  This is the type of appalling language that is used.  I do not think that is the Minister's language, actually.  I do not think that is his way of doing things.</p> <p> It is time we led through our new role in the UN and, indeed, I saw one of the Minister's colleagues commenting in the paper on Sunday on our role in the UN and he talked about our independence, empathy and vision.  If anything, our strongest asset as a tiny country is our independence and, in the most positive way, we will stand up for our neutrality in the best way possible to allow us to be a shining light for peace in the world and not peace enforcement, which is exactly what happened in Katanga in 1961.  It was an absolute catastrophe with regard to UN peacekeeping.  It became peace enforcement on behalf of the rich mine owners and the white people.  It is now almost 60 years later and we are using all of that language again, that is, "peace enforcement", as opposed to asking what are the best ways to bring peace to the world.  Clearly, one of the best ways is to get rid of poverty and inequality, to allow people to stay in their own countries, to recognise the role of our very rich countries in allowing situations to develop where refugees and migrants run out of their countries which is something they do not want at all.  We copper-fastened that by doing a despicable deal with Turkey.  I have never agreed with that.  It was not done in my name or the people I represent, nor was the situation where we prevailed on Greece to hold 13,000 people.  Depending on which report one reads it could be 15,000 people, with 4,000 children and hundreds of unaccompanied minors.  Can the Minister please clarify what we are doing about that as a neutral, strong independent country and as a proud and temporary member of the UN Security Council?</p></speech>

However, current members of the Defence Forces have a different opinion of what they deem is necessary.  The level of pay is so bad that members of the Defence Forces are forced to apply for the working family payment.  The fact that the State supplements wages through the working family payment is an acknowledgement by it that they are underpaid.  There are also those within the Defence Forces who earn a couple of euro over the qualifying threshold.  We are talking about the cost of a loaf of bread or a pint of milk.  They do not get any assistance.  These families are forced to make tough financial choices between food on the table, paying the rent, mortgage or whatever it might be and back to school costs.  Every run-of-the-mill expense that we have as civilians is fraught with fear and anxiety because of lack of money.  This is not acceptable in a modern day defence force.</p><p>Our Defence Forces are the working poor because of years of Government neglect.  I was talking to a constituent who is a father of five and has served 22 years in the Defence Forces.  The reality of the situation for him and his family is that for him to survive he must sign up to serve overseas as a peacekeeper on a regular basis.  He has done this seven times.  This father is missing so much time with wife and five children.  This is time he will never get back.  What is often forgotten in this regard is that in his absence his wife is basically rearing the children on our own until her husband returns.  This proud man also disclosed to me today that he has since had to apply for the defence forces stress fund since his most recent tour abroad to survive.  This man has served 22 years.  He has gone abroad as a peacekeeper seven times and must come back and apply for the stress fund.  That is just not good enough.</p><p>This is like <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>for me because I am a proud son of a Defence Forces veteran.  My father served 25 years both here and abroad.  I recall when we were younger my father had to often work two additional jobs on top of his Army duties for us and the family to survive.  Circumstances have not changed.  This was contrary to Army regulations back then and I am sure it is now.  My father, who is a good, honest man, was breaking Army regulations, something he did not do lightly but had to in order to survive.</p><p>As I said earlier, members of the Defence Forces are still the working poor of today and it is just not good enough.  I want to put this into the context of what is going on at the moment.  Next week, all Deputies will receive a 2% pay raise.  This is unwarranted and undeserved and it is totally out of sync with what is happening in society right now.  We in the Sinn F&eacute;in party will return this increase to the Exchequer.  In fact, I found this bizarre when I looked into it.  I was elected ten months ago for the first time in the by-election.  Since then, this is my third time returning money to the Exchequer.  That is three increases in ten months I have returned to the Exchequer.  I am not putting myself up on a pedestal and saying I am great.  In the context that Deputies are getting a raise three times in ten months when Army veterans are struggling to pay their bills, it is just not good enough.  It goes to show how out of touch the Government is.</p><p>The Defence Forces on the front line when it comes to the battle against Covid-19.  While I acknowledge and thank them for their selflessness in all the work they have done, I also say this in the knowledge that a round of applause and my thanks and acknowledgement will not pay the bills at the end of the month and keep the wolves from the door.  </p><p>As the previous speaker mentioned, we recently learned that the surviving soldiers of Jadotville will not be awarded the medals for bravery recommended by their commanding officer almost 60 years ago.  There was no hero's welcome for those who fought in Jadotville.  They were portrayed by some as a national embarrassment and instead of receiving full recognition for their courage, the competence they showed and their bravery, they were isolated, ignored and forgotten.  This must be rectified and those medals need to be awarded.  The requests of the veterans are minute in comparison to the service they gave this State.</p><p>On the subject of medals, in 2016, a medal was issued to commemorate the 1916 Easter Rising.  This beautiful medal was issued to serving members but retired members did not receive one.  I am going to read a letter into the record that I received from Paddy Hyland from Clondalkin who served in the Reserve Defence Force for more than 45 years.  He states:</p> <blockquote> 	Hi Mark,<br /><br />I was a member of the [Reserve Defence Forces, which is the old FCA] from 1965/2010.  I first served with the 11th [signatory] corps.  I then enlisted in the military police until my retirement in 2010.  Over the years I have received a medal for 7 years service, 12 years, 21 years.  After I retired a medal was struck, to honour the present serving members of the Reserve Defence Forces...  It would be my honour to receive such a medal.  Many thanks Mark.<br /><br />Yours sincerely,<br /><br />Pat Hyland </blockquote>  <p>That is not a big ask for a man who has served 45 years in this State.  Paddy, and others like him, deserve these and the previous medals I spoke about in recognition of the service they have provided.</p><p>In conclusion, the Bill is a tidying-up exercise and will have no real impact on the daily lived experiences of current and former members of the Defence Forces.  The Defence Forces have been failed by successive Governments for too long and the time for talking is over.  It is high time that members of the Defence Forces get the pay and conditions they deserve.  The buck stops with the Minister and the Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-23a.336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="17:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300050#DDD00100"><p>I add my voice in support of the Bill and I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the topic.  I represent a constituency that is still proud to have an operational Army barracks.  Sarsfield Barracks, which the Minister has visited many times, is situated within the heart of Limerick city.  I am delighted to say the personnel based there contribute enormously and favourably to the vibrancy of my home city.</p>  <p>  Members of the Defence Forces have represented the people of Ireland with distinction whenever and wherever they have served abroad.  They are respected by members of other armed forces and have made a courageous contribution to all their missions.  One needs only think of the humanitarian mission undertaken by the Naval Service in the Mediterranean in recent years.  It is estimated that our Naval Service contributed to rescuing more than 18,000 migrants from the sea.  Those individuals are a credit to us.  I mention this to highlight the good work the Defence Forces do.  Equally honourable contributions have been made by the land- and air-based strands of our Defence Forces.  This is a group of women and men who have sacrificed many of the comforts the rest of us take for granted in the service of the people of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Bill is positive, but it does not address the key concerns we deal with every day regarding the well-being of members of the Defence Forces and their families.  Their dedication and sacrifice are not matched by the pay they receive.  In recent years Government cuts have led to a decline in Defence Forces numbers and a decline in morale among serving members.  I believe this is due to a lack of appropriate pay and conditions.  The State invests in the training of recruits and yet due to the lack of competitive pay, many members depart for the private sector.  Last year 139 members of the Naval Service left.  Many Defence Forces members must resort to sleeping in their cars because they cannot afford to pay rent.  These concerns are demonstrated when we consider that the Naval Service and Air Corps are operating at 80% of their recommended staffing levels.  Members of the Defence Forces need and deserve to be given fair wages.  It is extraordinary that Defence Forces pay is among the lowest of all our public servants.</p>  <p>  The programme for Government commits to creating a commission on the Defence Forces that would be then followed by the creation of a pay-review body.  As I understand the commission on the Defence Forces has not yet been established, how long will they have to wait for that pay-review body to be set up and more importantly to report back?</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in believes that a pay review should be conducted in earnest.  We must stop the drain of talent from our Defence Forces.  We must fairly compensate those brave women and men who serve us with honour and play a vital role in the fight against the arrival of narcotics into our State.  They protect our people at times of national crisis and disaster and they must be paid fairly for this.</p>  <p>  The Government must start listening to the concerns of Defence Forces members.  We must allow their representatives to engage in collective bargaining with the proviso that they not be allowed to strike.  We recommended this previously and were blocked back then by previous governments.  As I said, Defence Forces personnel are among the worst-paid workers in the public service with many of them relying on the working family payment to make ends meet.  Members see a long-term career in the Defence Forces as unsustainable and unviable.  In order to provide for their families, they are leaving the forces in droves, often paying to do so themselves.</p>  <p>  The Government must start listening to their concerns.  It must recognise that members of the Defence Forces are employees and entitled to the same protections as all other workers.  This needs to be legislated for.  Sinn F&eacute;in introduced a Bill in 2017 to do this.  I moved amendments to the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill, but unfortunately they were not accepted.  We also introduced the Organisation of Working Time (Workers Rights and Bogus Self-Employment) (Amendment) Bill 2019.  That Bill, if enacted, would have extended workers' rights to members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces.  These moves, at the time, would have been particularly important.</p>  <p>  As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle mentioned, last year we heard from a retired senior officer of the Defence Forces that the Government is treating them with contempt and disdain.  It is simply not good enough.  This is particularly relevant to many people in my constituency, based in Sarsfield Barracks.  To serve in the Defence Forces is an honourable career, but it is not an attractive one due to the pay and conditions.  Why should families need to seek social welfare assistance to get by?</p>  <p>  I offer my support to these servants of the State.  I offer my support to the Bill, but more must be done and it must be done soon.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-23a.337" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1606" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="17:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300050#DDD00200"><p>I think this is my first opportunity to congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I wish her very well in her post in the years ahead.</p>  <p>  I am glad to have the opportunity to make a few points on the Bill.  Obviously it is to be welcomed in the sense that, as the Minister said, it deals with some housekeeping matters relating to the operational command issue which makes sense, the extension of courts martial where necessary provided they are looked for within the initial period, and the recruitment of former members to try to deal with the very low numbers we have.  As many Members have said on the previous day and today, there are obviously reasons we are losing Naval Service men and women to the Army because of better conditions and terms.  We are losing many Army technical personnel to the private sector.  We are very good in here at times when appropriate debates come up like this one on the Defence Forces to pay lip service and cash in on the need to say a few words in the D&aacute;il and praise members of our Defence Forces for the great work they do at home and abroad.  They are out in all weather and work in all conditions without complaint.  Of course, that is what we expect, but they happily do it.</p>  <p>  My constituency has Finner Camp and the area has a long tradition of people serving their country in the Fourth Western Brigade which once existed and which I hope will exist again following the independent commission's consideration of the brigade structure.  We must acknowledge there are reasons we are not attracting people and there are reasons we cannot keep the people.  Clearly, we have national pay agreements and I know the programme for Government very specifically states we do not want to venture outside those pay agreements.  It seems obvious to me that the existing pay agreements do not cater adequately for our Defence Forces.  There have been previous reviews and White Papers, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle alluded to earlier.  I do not know how many reports we need.  As so often with programmes for Government, manifestoes, policy documents and so on, we seem to be laying out yet another process where we give a commitment to deal with something once that process is complete.  However, some things do not need a report by PwC, KPMG, an international review group or anybody else.  Terms, conditions, salaries and so on are not what they should be.  The UK has its permanent pay review group for all its armed forces.  I do not know why we do not skip the independent commission portion relating to pay and move on to come up with an appropriate structure commensurate with the commitment and work these people have.</p>  <p>  Deputy Berry has mentioned in the House previously - I bow to his first-hand experience of military life - that there was a commitment to a 10% increase in allowances across all the military and that did not occur.  I know the Minister is very aware of this.  Most recently in July he suggested we might need some emergency provisions for fair remuneration commensurate with the work of our Defence Forces members.  I hope that is still possible.  I agree with his view as articulated then.  While I appreciate that the independent commission, according to the programme for Government, is to be set up by the end of the year, we need to move on things with pay much quicker than that and we can do so.  All it needs is the political will.</p>  <p>  Obviously, we will need to find the money.  If resources need to be taken from elsewhere - precious resources - to give our military personnel a fair day's pay for the work they are doing, that is what we should do.  I ask the Minister to comment on that.  The chronology is that a permanent pay review body is to be established after the independent commission and the independent commission is to take a year.  If we had a 1981-82 scenario, we could have three general elections and three governments in that period.</p>  <p>  Army families are living in most constituencies, albeit there might not be a base there, and we will hear it at first-hand through our constituency offices from people we know, friends and family of people who are serving the real hardship which, as other Members have pointed out, require social supports to make ends meet.</p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p> The winding down of the 4th Western Brigade means personnel are leaving Carrick-on-Shannon, Leitrim, Sligo town or Lifford and heading to Finner Camp, collecting their gear and then travelling to Dublin to do their duty.  It makes no sense.  I expect that when the brigade structures are looked at, west of the Shannon at least, there will be political support, across all parties and none, for the re-establishment of the 4th Western Brigade.  Given the uncertainty we face as we look to the future, with Brexit and so on, that is something useful we could do.</p> <p> The recruitment of former members is a very good thing to do.  It applies to people who have either served their full term, based on the five-year terms they do at a time, or people who had purchased their way out for &euro;300 or whatever the fee is.  Those people would all be eligible for return.  I ask that the Department review the status of everybody who was boarded out, in military speak.  For the benefit of us civilians, these are people who were forced to retire for health-related reasons, whether physical or mental.  I know of people in that situation who have since recovered.  They have military expertise, were totally committed to military life and completed many courses and so on which added value to the Defence Forces.  There may be people among those who were boarded out who are of the appropriate age and with the appropriate experience and whose reasons for being boarded out have become obsolete.  We should examine whether some of them might be capable of doing duties such as communications, training or something else that would not require the physical output expected of new recruits and active soldiers.  We may find some numbers of people very willing to come back and who could be a great asset to the State.  I ask that such a review be considered.</p> <p> According to social media reports in the UK, Hilary Meredith, of Hilary Meredith Solicitors, claims to be representing a number of former military personnel in cases she is bringing on their behalf in regard to the use of Lariam, which is the drug that was prescribed to regular or listed soldiers to prevent malaria.  As I understand it, this solicitor is saying that the Ministry of Defence in the UK has acknowledged to the people she represents that it provided no choice other than Lariam to soldiers and did not advise them of its side effects.  A number of her clients have had offers of settlement, through her, from the Ministry of Defence.  While the situation now is that soldiers serving abroad have the opportunity to choose between a number of different medications other than Lariam, that choice did not exist for a significant period of time for many soldiers and some have since complained of side effects and have gone through some misery as a consequence of taking this medication.</p> <p> Many of us in Army constituencies are familiar with the Irish soldiers who have suffered the same side effects.  Is the Government aware of what the Ministry of Defence in the UK has done?  Is the Minister considering introducing a redress scheme that would offer the appropriate supports to people who have had side effects and suffered injury and health issues because they took Lariam and were given no other option but to do so?  It was a case of this is what one takes if one is serving overseas to protect against malaria.  They were not advised of any side effects which they might experience.  Does the Minister agree it would be prudent to put such a redress scheme in place rather than waiting until such time, perhaps a number of years down the road, when many hundreds of thousands of euro have been spent in legal fees and there has been a great deal of suffering by the relevant families?  If we had such a scheme to cater for those people who have suffered, it would be prudent from an Exchequer perspective but, more than that, it would be the right and fair thing to do for those families who have suffered.  It has been reported in the UK - I do not know whether it is true - that officers were not required to take Lariam.  They were provided with a different form of antimalarial medication which, it seems, did not expose them to the same side effects as Lariam.</p> <p> In light of these reports, I ask that the Minister examine the issue.  People in his Department can check the details.  As I said, a firm called Hilary Meredith Solicitors in the UK is reporting that the Ministry of Defence has accepted the difficulties experienced by the clients it represents as a consequence of taking Lariam.  On that basis, it might be helpful to pre-empt further suffering on the part of already long-suffering Defence Forces personnel and save hundreds of thousands of euro in legal fees for both the State and the families concerned by putting together an appropriate redress scheme to cater for those who were unfortunate enough to suffer for following the correct advice.  That advice was to take this tablet, there being no other option, and they would not get malaria.  Unfortunately, as we know, the medication is alleged to have come with a number of side effects.</p> <p> I hope the Minister can take some of the issues I have raised on board.  I also hope he does not mind me using my time on Second Stage of the Bill to raise a number of issues that are not included in its provisions.  I intend to support the Bill as a good housekeeping exercise that needed to be done.  I conclude by asking again that a review be undertaken to assess the situation of all of those personnel who were boarded out but who may still have a lot to offer to the Defence Forces.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-23a.339" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1603" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="17:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300051#EEE00200"><p>I am sharing time with Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I want to put on record my acknowledgement that the Minister has remained in the House for the totality of the debate.  I commend him on that because it does not often happen.  I know it is difficult to do with the pressures of time under which he is working.</p>  <p>  An tUachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann, Mr. Higgins, has said that serving men and women have a right to expect an income that provides for themselves and their families.  Several speakers have pointed out that, sadly, many members of the Defence Forces with families are relying on social welfare assistance through the working family payment.  We must ensure that no member of the Defence Forces is in a position where he or she has to rely on social welfare assistance to meet his or her day-to-day needs.  The existing situation is a far cry from where we should be in terms of a minimum wage, never mind adequate pay for the work members of the Defence Forces do.  As a former Minister, I discussed this issue with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, at Cabinet on a number of occasions in the past.  He is well aware of my particular view on it.  It is deeply disappointing that personnel are leaving the Defence Forces due to poor pay and conditions, many of whom would rather remain within the forces.  The issue is not just to do with pay but also allowances and conditions.  I acknowledge the announcement the Minister made last week in regard to personnel who are travelling abroad on UN work and have to self-isolate for 14 days in advance of their deployment.  It is a small but very significant and positive step.</p>  <p>  Part of the challenge we face as a consequence of the issue with pay and conditions is that we have fallen far short of the figure of 9,500 which should be the established strength of the Defence Forces.  That is really putting pressure on personnel in the many roles they undertake.  Coming from a midlands county, I have seen at first hand how we have had to rely on the Defence Forces during severe flooding.  We were damn glad to have them available to us and to make use of their field ambulances to take people out of marooned situations and transport them to hospital.  We all saw that type of work being done by the Defence Forces throughout the country during Storm Ophelia.</p> <p>On a daily basis they patrol our territorial waters, which are nine times bigger than the island we reside on.  It is impossible to do this even with the fleet they have, not to mention that some of those ships are tied up in Cork Harbour.</p> <p> We are going to have additional challenges such as the one the Minister is facing at the moment in Brexit.  That brings into focus again the operational capacity, particularly in Dundalk barracks, Finner Camp and Custume Barracks in Athlone.  We need to look at the capacity of those three barracks to deal with the challenges we could potentially be facing post-Brexit at the end of the year.  While it is Government policy to ensure we do not have any type of a border - and we are all determined about that and supportive of it - we need to have a contingency in place.  That contingency will have to ensure sufficient resources, capacity and capability are available in those three barracks in particular.</p> <p> When the 4th Western Brigade was abolished in 2012, the then Minister, former Deputy Alan Shatter, gave a commitment to the late Deputy Nicky McFadden that 1,000 personnel would be maintained in Custume Barracks, Athlone.  It is imperative that that commitment is maintained insofar as is humanly possible.  I accept that numbers have fallen across the board but particularly in the context of Brexit we need to have that capacity there.  Colleagues have mentioned in the past, as have I, the practice of personnel from Dundalk, Finner and Custume Barracks travelling in and then getting in vehicles and travelling to Dublin to carry our their duty is completely unsustainable and is an issue we really need to address.  That practice is demoralising for our Defence Forces.</p> <p> On of the huge successes of the Defence Forces has been the operation of the air ambulance at Custume Barracks which became operational back in 2012, if I recall correctly.  I have noticed recently that overflights do not seem to be as frequent as they used to be for some reason.  I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health on this.  It has been referred on to the National Ambulance Service and I will probably get a reply this side of Christmas.  There is a lot of talk locally about the operation of the air ambulance and I would like the Minister to clarify whether the facility and service in Athlone are fully operational and available to the National Ambulance Service seven days per week.</p> <p> An issue related to the air ambulance service, which I have taken up with the Minister and his predecessors, is the ability to provide a night-time air ambulance service.  I am aware that a night-time air ambulance service would require specifically designated landing sites and those sites need to be lit up.  I am aware also that at the time of the establishment of the service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in counties Roscommon and Longford identified landing sites throughout both counties suitable for air ambulances operating at night.  These were a number of GAA pitches which had plenty of light.  Individuals who would turn on the lighting and ensure the facilities were open were designated.  This issue needs to be looked at again, particularly for the communities in west County Roscommon, east County Mayo and north-east County Galway which have a very inferior ambulance service.  They are essentially dependent on a single ambulance based in Loughglynn.  That service is totally inadequate to meeting the needs of a very large geographic area in the middle of Connacht.  It is important we have a properly resourced road ambulance service.  We should consider the extension of the air ambulance service to night-time operations.</p> <p> During the previous debate on this Bill, my neighbour, Deputy Joe Flaherty, mentioned the siege of Jadotville and a number of Deputies also referred to it.  I was thinking during the contribution last week that it is a long time since former Deputy Dinny McGinley and I were sitting on the Government benches raising the issue of the need to acknowledge the role played by each and every one of the individuals present at the siege of Jadotville.  I commend the work of the previous Government, in particular the former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, who was determined to ensure those personnel were given the acknowledgement they deserved.  The last piece in this jigsaw is the provision of individual medals for bravery to the eight living members of the Defence Forces who served at Jadotville and had been recommended for distinguished service medals.  I earnestly encourage and ask the Minister to acknowledge those eight individuals and ensure they receive those medals.</p> <p> The final issue I will raise relates to the role Defence Forces personnel are playing in contact tracing.  If the Minister cannot provide me with a response tonight, I would appreciate it if he could revert to me with one.  During the lockdown and subsequently, Defence Forces personnel played a very valuable role in contact tracing.  My understanding, however, is that those Defence Forces personnel have returned to their former roles and are not currently providing that service.  I raise this specific issue because we in the west have a particular problem with speech and language therapists.  Three quarters of speech and language therapists in counties Roscommon and Galway are currently involved in contact tracing.  Prior to the lockdown, there was a four-year waiting list for speech and language therapy in counties Roscommon and Galway.  At present, 1,049 children in these two counties are waiting for access to speech and language therapy and three quarters of our speech and language therapists are involved in contact tracing.  That is not a good use of resources.  I would appreciate it if, as an interim measure pending the employment of the new contract tracers the HSE is currently recruiting, the Minister could assist by ensuring the redeployment of some Defence Forces personnel to contact tracing.  We could then release speech and language therapists to do the job they should be doing, namely, working with children and young people across Roscommon and Galway.  Will the Minister explore the feasibility of that and address this particular problem which is wholly and grossly unacceptable?</p> <p> I commend the Bill.  I and my colleague, Deputy Berry, will support it and the Minister in his capacity as Minister with responsibility for defence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-23a.341" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1508" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="18:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300053#GGG00100"><p>I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Bill, which I support.  It is important that we put it into law as soon as possible.  We must make sure our troops are protected.  I note that under the Bill a captain from another jurisdiction, by agreement, can give an instruction.  That is okay but we must make sure we keep our unique identity.  Irish troops have gone all over the world.  They have carved out an unusual record because they are recognised everywhere they go as peacekeepers.  We need to make sure we keep this focus as peacekeepers.</p>  <p>  The Minister has heard all evening that we do not know how Brexit will go.  We all hope for the best but it is not looking good at present.  We need to make sure the numbers are there in the Army because we do not know what we will face over the next six months.  We must make sure the resources it will need are there.  We do not know.  Numbers have been depleted over a number of years and there has been a lot of discontent.  This could be our hour of need, particularly with the way the Brits are going on at present.  We have to make sure we have the resources and the numbers.  Athlone and Finner Camp are very close to the Border and are accessible.</p>  <p>  A difficult decision was taken a number of years ago.  Promises were made on the 4th Western Brigade but unfortunately nothing seems to have developed.  Athlone is in the middle of Ireland and resources need to be put in there.  The current and legacy issues need to be resolved and the promises and assurances made on numbers should be adhered to.  I cannot understand - perhaps the Minister will be able to explain it to me - why we see Army vehicles bringing personnel from one part of the country to another even though there is a barracks closer to them.  I cannot for the life of me understand the criss-crossing of the country when we have personnel in various areas.  We must also recognise the work that has been done by the Defence Forces at times of flooding with pumps used and people who are in trouble rescued. </p>  <p>  With regard to the air ambulance, I remember sitting down in 2016 with the Government when there was an agreement on doing a review of the air ambulance service.  The experts recommended that at least two air ambulances would be required.  Every club with a football pitch in the country, with the support of the sports capital grant, has made a good job of making sure there are no wires overhead.  Given the instruments on board an air ambulance, I cannot understand how we do not have co-ordinates that can be punched in to make sure they can be flown at night.  With regard to the golden hour after a stroke and heart attacks, in parts of Roscommon, east Galway, Mayo and elsewhere in the country there is a deficit in how quickly an ambulance can get to people.  This hour is crucial to make sure somebody's life is saved.</p>  <p>  Three or four months ago, I listened with interest to a discussion on the problems with staffing the air ambulance.  I was aware, as was the former Minister of State with responsibility for defence, of people who had more flying hours than most people in the country who had left the Air Corps and sought to return after a number of years.  They had a serious amount of experience but their attempts to get back in to the Air Corps went on and on.  On the one hand, we were saying we had a shortage but, on the other, we were not bringing people in or putting through the paperwork.  Allegedly, paperwork was lost three or four times.  We need to make sure that we are proactive and have the number of people we need to fly the air ambulances.</p>  <p>  Wages and conditions are vital.  These personnel do not have the luxury many other groups have of being able to go out on strike.  They have a representative body.  We need to make sure they are treated right, can earn a genuine living and are not struggling to rear families.  We must realise these people make huge sacrifices.  They leave Ireland for six months to represent the country in other places.</p>  <p>  I concur with Deputy Naughten on the point he made about contact tracing.  If there is a lull whereby a number of people in the Defence Forces could do another job to help out their country at a time of need, I do not think they would have any problem doing this and we need to look at these issues.  On the way here today, I received a phone call with regard to a youngster who was tested a week ago but a result has not been received.  The father of this person is self-employed and is about to lose a job because he is self-isolating.  Self-employed people do not often have the choices that others do, particularly those in the building game.  A brickie who has promised to do a job cannot be left for a full week.  Last Wednesday, the child was tested but the results are not yet back today.  The family is doing the right thing for the country by making sure they are in isolation but the results are not being given.  This is why it would help if we thought outside the box.  There may be opportunities in contact tracing.</p>  <p>  In general, I support the Bill and I will not talk about it all night.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-23a.342" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1457" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="18:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300053#GGG00200"><p>I hope I will be able to answer some of the questions that have been raised, even those that are not directly relevant to the legislation but this is an opportunity to address some Defence Forces issues.</p>  <p>  I thank all Members of the House who spoke for their constructive contributions and comments during the course of the debate.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to bring the Bill before the House.  As I stated in my opening remarks, although it is a relatively short Bill, it addresses some important issues.  Before commenting on the Bill itself, I will comment on a number of other issues.</p>  <p>  I recognise the continued and ongoing contribution of the Defence Forces in the Covid-19 emergency, which has been referred to by some speakers.  As always, members of the Defence Forces have stood up to the plate at a time of national crisis.  There has been a sustained and dedicated response to the challenges we have faced in each of the services, land, air and sea, supported by the Department of Defence and other arms of the State.</p> <p>The Air Corps has been active in repatriating our personnel in association with our partners in specific missions, along with the transport of Covid-19 tests to Germany.  I would also like to recognise the emergency deployment of PPE, personal protective equipment, by the Air Corps to Beirut following the explosion and humanitarian disaster there.</p> <p> This shows the effectiveness of the cross-Government response to such crises where a targeted and rapid response is required.  It also shows how the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Defence are linked by a policy perspective and I am given the privilege of providing leadership in both Departments.  It allows for rapid responses to catastrophes, such as the one in Beirut.  In that instance, we were able to use our intelligence from our peacekeepers in UNIFIL, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, with the diplomatic network of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in providing humanitarian assistance.</p> <p> The Naval Service has played its part in support of Covid-19 testing with the deployment of vessels in support of testing facilities.  The Army has played a substantive role in setting up Covid-19 test centres, supporting the HSE through the storage and distribution of PPE, as well as support for its testing facilities.  It has also assisted in the fit-out of other HSE facilities, patient transport and the ongoing operation of the Aviva Stadium testing facility.  The Defence Forces are available to the HSE if needed for whatever reason.  It is about being the last resource of the State which can be used in cases of emergency.</p> <p> On re-enlistment, the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020 allowed for the acceleration of the enactment of section 4 of this Bill.  As I said in my opening statement, I will be moving an amendment on Committee Stage to delete section 4.  However, I will take this opportunity to update the House regarding the scheme for the re-enlistment of formerly enlisted persons.</p> <p> At present, the Permanent Defence Force has shortages of personnel in several specialised posts such as technicians, fitters, chefs, communications and IT specialists, as well as naval staff and avionics experts.  In some cases, it can take up to four years to train individuals to the standard required to fill these positions.  Last April, the former Minister of State with responsibility for defence, Deputy Kehoe, launched a scheme to re-enlist former Permanent Defence Force enlisted personnel who have the skills and expertise required to fill identified of vacancies which currently exist.  The scheme will allow for initial re-enlistment for a minimum of six months and up to three years.  The duration of the term of re-enlistment offered will be dependent on the vacancies which exist and the preference of the individual.</p> <p> This is just one of many actions being pursued to address the skills shortages in the Permanent Defence Force.  Those who re-enlist will do so at the rank and salary point on which they left.  They will be required to meet a range of eligibility criteria as outlined in the terms and conditions which were agreed with the representative association, PDFORRA.  The restriction of the scheme to suitably qualified and trained individuals, provides a fair and balanced approach which will allow existing members to continue to advance their careers through internal training, development and promotion.  Personnel recommended and approved for re-enlistment also have to successfully meet medical and security clearance requirements.</p> <p> While a total of 647 applications have been received since the launch of the scheme, unfortunately, many of these proved ineligible due to age and other criteria.  Some Members have suggested that there has been no interest in the re-enlistment scheme.  This is simply not the case.  The Chief of Staff must recommend individual personnel for re-enlistment.  So far, I have approved the re-enlistment of 24 personnel on foot of recommendations by the Chief of Staff.  I am advised that further recommendations for my consideration are imminent.  Attestations for a first batch of ten re-enlisting personnel took place on 15 September, with attestations for a second group planned for later this month and further re-enlistments planned for later this year. </p> <p> A scheme to recommission former Permanent Defence Force officers already exists.  Expressions of interest are also invited from those with specialist skills who wish to be recommissioned.  Some 38 applications have been received under this scheme and 16 went forward for further assessment with corps directors.  Since the launch of this scheme last October, five officers have been recommissioned into the Air Corps and a further batch of former officers has now been submitted by the Chief of Staff for my consideration.</p> <p> On the proposed amendment to section 17A of the Defence Act 1954, the Office of the Attorney General has provided extensive advice as to what was required from a legal perspective to address the issue.  This advice is reflected in the text.  As I stated in my opening statement, this amendment will not alter the current command structure in the Defence Forces.  The delegation in no way undermines overall control of the contingent by the Irish authorities.  It provides a clear statutory basis and legal certainty for the current delegation of operational control in overseas missions.  It reinforces what already happens in practice but puts a legal basis under that, as advised by the Attorney General.  There was significant consultation across the Defence Forces on this issue before the arrangements were finalised.</p> <p> With regard to sections 3 and 7, I am particularly pleased that this Bill will give full effect to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict.</p> <p> I am also happy to progress the technical amendments to the Defence Act 1954 provided for in sections 5 and 6.</p> <p> On apprenticeships, I can confirm that there continue to be apprentice opportunities in the Permanent Defence Force, principally in the Air Corps as apprentice aircraft technicians.  This programme offers successful candidates the opportunity of becoming an effective member of the Air Corps, as well as the opportunity to pursue the career for which he or she is selected.  The age limit for enlistment as an apprentice is between 18 and 23 years, which has been the case for some time.  It should be noted that on recruitment, an apprentice becomes a member of the Defence Forces, subject to military law and liable for military duties.  As such, in accordance with the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, any such person cannot be a minor and, therefore, must be at least 18 years of age.</p> <p> The Defence Forces recruitment process is subject to continuous monitoring and appraisal to ensure that it remains fit for purpose.  Recruitment plans for 2021 have not yet been finalised but will be informed by a review of recent campaigns.</p> <p> Deputy Berry, as a former member of the Defence Forces, had much to say on the Bill.  On his comments on the Reserve Defence Force, this is an issue on which I intend to focus.  Whether we will be able to achieve some of the measures he called for, I am not sure.  I certainly want them to be considered seriously.  If they can be introduced in time for amendments on later Stages, I am open to that.  If not, there may be other ways of doing it.</p> <p> I am open to members of the Reserve Defence Force being able to serve overseas.  There may be some concerns about this among some members of the Permanent Defence Force.  It is an issue I would like to explore with them.  If we are to make the Reserve Defence Force attractive, particularly to skilled people who can add significantly in terms of a collective approach working with Permanent Defence Force personnel, we must offer the opportunities to serve and to put such skills to use.</p> <p>If we are serious about a singular approach towards Permanent Defence Force personnel working with Reserve personnel, we must have a process that allows them to operate efficiently together.  It is not about taking away opportunities from Permanent Defence Force personnel; it is about complementary work.  In specialised skill sets - IT, cybersecurity and a number of other areas - there is a really interesting opportunity to explore and develop with the Reserve Defence Force.  I hope the commission will be able to look at that, and I will talk a little about the commission in a moment.  We will look at this but I would like to speak to the representative bodies about it to ensure we are all pulling in the same direction on making the Reserve Defence Force a much more attractive option.  Our Reserve is not at the strength at which we want it to be.  To make it more attractive we need to think differently about its role and its importance, likewise ceremonial issues abroad and so on.  There is no reason we should not think about and look at not only potential re-enlistment in the Reserve but also the transition Deputy Berry raised, whereby somebody finishing a career in the Permanent Defence Force may want to serve a role in the Reserve.  That may suit the person's career choice or lifestyle.</p> <p> As for some of the non-legislative issues, I am more than aware of the pressures the Naval Service is under, such as the shortage of certain specialties and the pressures that have resulted in a number of ships being tied up when they should be out to sea.  We are working with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to try to agree a sensible package of proposals that can respond to that pressure in a way that is conscious of public sector pay deals and so on.  I hope we will be able to bring that process to a conclusion in the not-too-distant future.</p> <p> I hope the Department has responded to the issue of quarantine that was raised, from both an allowance and a tax perspective, to the satisfaction of the many people involved.  I said very early on to the representative bodies that in my view this issue should have been solved long before now.  If one is required to quarantine or self-isolate away from one's family, in a barracks somewhere, before one goes overseas, the mission effectively starts two weeks early and the allowances should reflect that, in my view.  I pay particular tribute to the new Secretary General of the Department, who has been very involved in trying to get this issue resolved.</p> <p> As for the issue of medical support, I would like to have a timeline for the House on that but I will just say we are committed to the programme for Government commitment.  I was very involved in putting this issue into the programme for Government.  It is not acceptable to me that there are different levels of medical support in the Defence Forces depending on whether one is an officer or administrative personnel.  We want to make sure there is adequate and equal medical support for every member of the Irish Defence Forces.  People who put their lives or health at risk serving the State should have consistent medical support across the Defence Forces as a whole.  This cannot be resolved overnight, and I ask people to bear with me in finding a way of resolving it.  It may be resolved over a phased basis but we are committed to doing it.  It is in the programme for Government and we will try to get on with it.</p> <p> In response to Deputy Berry's comments, I will make a point about the Curragh generally.  I spent some time in the Curragh a few weeks ago with members of the Defence Forces, the Chief of Staff and his team, and my team in the Department of Defence.  There is work to do.  There is too much dereliction in the Curragh, which needs to be resolved, but again, it cannot be done overnight.  We are committing to a very significant capital expenditure programme across the Department of Defence.  Only two days ago I welcomed a &euro;45 million investment in three new PC-12 aircraft into the Defence Forces.  We are also planning for new ships in the future and investing in barracks in various parts of the country.  However, I can understand the importance of investing in the Curragh, given its scale and size and link to morale within the Army.  I am very cognisant of that and we will put together a plan in that regard.  A plan has been already put together for elements of the investment that is needed in the Curragh, but I am committed to a more comprehensive plan than that.</p> <p> There is a lot to do, but one of the things I am quite taken by in this Second Stage debate on defence is that the majority, though not all, of the people who have spoken have spoken about the Defence Forces as a career in a very negative light.  If there is one thing I am committed to doing as Minister for Defence, it is changing that perception.  A career in the Defence Forces is a good one for people to choose.  We need to ensure we test salary structures, promotion opportunities and so on.  That is why we are putting in place a commission to test all that and to benchmark internationally how we support our Defence Forces and how we can do it better.  Serving one's country should be seen as a privilege.  My job and the job of Government is to ensure that privilege is rewarded appropriately from the perspective of income, work conditions and legislation.  We are trying to do some of that with this Bill.</p> <p> Looking at what is coming down the line as we try to address some of the challenges that have been raised in this debate, the Department is, as we speak, talking to another key Department about trying to address the pressures in the Naval Service.  We are planning to ensure the Defence Forces get appropriate representation and have a real and clear voice in the context of the upcoming round of pay talks.  The Department is, as we speak, trying to finalise draft terms of reference and the appropriate people to be on a commission on the Defence Forces, consistent with the programme for Government, to get that commission up and running two months before we committed to doing so, by the end of the year.  I hope we will be in a position by the end of October to do that early, which again gives a signal of the determination, commitment and enthusiasm within my team, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces to get on with this commission work.</p> <p> The Department is also, as we speak, assessing the pace of implementation of the defence White Paper, which has an awful lot in it that has not yet been delivered.  Linked to that and to my other responsibilities in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, we are also talking about the kinds of peacekeeping missions we need to be preparing for next year, the year after and in three or four years' time, and how we continue to build Ireland's reputation internationally as a standard-setter in conflict management, post-conflict management, peacekeeping, peace enforcement and all the other things around which Ireland has built a reputation within UN circles, particularly in the context of Ireland taking its place on the UN Security Council in January.</p> <p> There are a lot of positive things happening for and with the Defence Forces now, and so they should be happening, but we as a collective, as a Parliament, have to start talking up careers in the Defence Forces, rather than constantly looking for the negative, if we want people to join and be part of them.  Of course I need to answer all questions, and there are negatives that need to be fixed, but there are also a lot of positives.  If we want bright, skilled young men and women, women in particular, joining our Air Corps, our Army, our Naval Service and our Reserve, we have to start reflecting the fact that this is an attractive option.</p> <p>I hope that much of what I have outlined tonight will reinforce in people's minds that we are trying to bring about the change and modernisation in the Defence Forces that will ensure those careers are exciting and well-rewarded and that they will be encouraged in a way that will allow us to respond to the gap we have in terms of shortages in our Defence Forces, which needs a response.  I thank all Members and I look forward to the remaining Stages of this Bill, in which we will focus on the detail of the Bill.</p></speech>

The Defence (Amendment) Bill before the D&aacute;il today is uncontroversial and in a way is full of formality rather than substance.  Thousands of members of the Defence Forces have served this country bravely at home and abroad in numerous conflicts and even during Covid-19, and yet the Government is more concerned with formality when it comes to the Defence Forces rather than substance.  There is a long list of serious grievances that the Defence Forces have and for which the Government have shown scant regard or concern.  In a week when the Government has hired an army of special advisers to help make decisions and given itself an ill-deserved pay rise, members of our Defence Forces are still waiting on the Government to honour commitments from July 2019.  The then Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, said in July 2019 that it would not be fair to restore pay to our troops because it would mean they were being singled out for special treatment above others in public service.  The opposite is the case.  The Government is singling out the Defence Forces for special treatment but it is the wrong type of treatment.</p>  <p>  Operational capacity is extremely important and most citizens in the country would not be aware that right now the Defence Forces number approximately 8,374 members, at least 1,000 shy of the 9,500 that are needed.  The figure is getting worse as there is an ongoing exodus of Defence Forces service members every year.  Some 882 service members left the Defence Forces in 2019 and various surveys estimate that anywhere between 70% and 85% of Defence Forces members are thinking about leaving or wish to leave.  If one was ever to look at a reflection of how a group of people think of their job, the most obvious reflection is whether they want to stay or go.  I listened to the Minister's words about the idea that we need to talk this up and make it an attractive career to people across the country.  The kernel of it is whether it is attractive to people who are working in the Defence Forces now.  If it is not attractive to them, it is virtually impossible to make it attractive to young people around the country.  The first thing to do is to fix the Defence Forces from the inside.  At present, there are 1,126 positions within the Defence Forces which are unfilled.  There are 620 junior management vacancies in the Defence Forces and eight out of 15 high-level, implementation plan projects are behind schedule.  Under the tenure of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael our Defence Forces have fallen into a pitiful state.  If a Russian plane was to fly over Ireland tonight, we would have to politely ask our friends in England to spare a plane to chase that Russian plane out of Irish air space.  The Defence Forces have been left in a weakened state in other parts of the world, such as the Congo and Lebanon.  Recently, I made representations on behalf of two soldiers in the Congo who were unable to get back to Ireland.  They were in an area of heightened tension, had only sidearms to protect themselves and were not in a compound but an apartment.  They were finding it difficult to make their way back to Ireland.  By any estimation, that shows a poor regard for their welfare and well-being.</p>  <p>  I will touch on pay, allowances and supports.  The main driver behind the exodus from the Defence Forces is not any decline in patriotism but the unacceptable conditions and pay that Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael expect our Defence Forces to handle.  Neither of those parties nor anybody in Government would accept such pay and conditions for themselves.  The problem with the technical pay agreement that exists is that a deal was concluded worth &euro;10 million, from which a 10% increase was meant to be given in military allowances to personnel but 14 months later the Government is still sitting on its hands.  The sum of &euro;10 million is less than the bare minimum of what the Government should be paying but it still will not pay it.  Yet, if one adds up the numbers of special advisers the Government has, it adds up to roughly &euro;5.4 million on annual wages of about 60 special advisers in this State.</p>  <p>  Since 2008, our troops have been fighting for restoration of pay.  Why do they have to fight to have their pay restored?  This is not for a pay increase but merely the restoration of pay.  The denial of that restoration is a disservice to our services.  Speaking with Defence Forces stationed in Syria, Aont&uacute; was shocked to learn our troops are taxed at the higher rate of taxation, notwithstanding the bravery of the service they are in.  Several troops have not seen their family for up to six months and there is a probability that could be increased by another three months.  Around the world, most Governments refuse to tax their troops at the higher rates as a token of appreciation for their services in such dangerous and perilous environments.  Not so the Irish Government, which taxes money paid by the UN at the higher rate of taxation in addition to the already appalling rates of pay our Defence Forces suffer as a whole.  The Government does not hesitate to call in our Defence Forces in times of crisis.</p>  <p>  I have been, as I am sure the Minister has, at marches and demonstrations by ex-service members and their families outside these Houses and one point they make on a regular basis is that much lip service is paid to the Defence Forces in this State and people queue up in the political sphere to almost virtue signal about how much they support and how much respect they have for the men and women who fight and serve us in our Defence Forces.  Yet, there is a chasm between that lip service and the action necessary.  Any ten-year-old would know that actions speak louder than words.  I would hate that the Government would damn itself with false words on these really important issues such as pay, capacity and conditions.</p>  <p>  Next year will be the 60th anniversary of the siege of Jadotville, where 158 members of the Irish Defence Forces fought off 3,000 mercenaries in the Congo in 1961.  They were eventually forced to surrender but their bravery and the tactics under Commander Pat Quinlan is studied in military colleges around the world as one of the best uses of perimeter defence in battle.  When they returned home, the Government and the Defence Forces refused to acknowledge that battle.  They were derided in many quarters for having surrendered.  For the benefit of their careers, they did not mention Jadotville.  They were only awarded service medals in 2017, 56 years afterwards.  However, Commander Quinlan recommended several troops for medals for bravery, some of whom were as young as 15.  Parents were collecting children's allowance for some of the participants of that battle.  Successive Governments have refused to take up Commander Quinlan's recommendation and award the medals of bravery.  Apparently, the bravery is good enough to be studied in military colleges around the world but not good enough to be recognised and rewarded by the Irish Government.</p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p> I will make two small points in the time I have left.  I attended a protest outside the Chinese embassy today concerning the treatment of the Uighur people.  I do not believe that the Government is using its voice strongly enough to oppose the horrendous things happening in that part of the world.  People are being forced into thought camps, there is forced abortion and sterilisation and people are going missing.  It is very important that we do not just speak through the UN on this issue, but that we raise our voice regarding human rights.  Human rights are universal, and not for particular countries.  They are for all countries.</p> <p> I spoke to the Minister about this next issue previously in private.  Richard O'Halloran has been in China for some time and away from his family.  It is important that he is returned to Ireland and to his family.  It is a shocking situation and my heart would be broken if I were separated from my family for the length of time that Mr. O'Halloran has been.  He has done nothing wrong whatsoever.  I know the Minister has been working in the background on this issue, and I commend him on that.  I think, however, that there may be a need to change the strategy on this matter to see if we can get some result.</p></speech>

I listened with great intensity to the remarks made yesterday by the Minister regarding this Bill and the importance of Ireland bringing this legislation into being in the context of the transposition of the EU's fifth anti-money laundering directive.  It is a shame that there were delays in transposing the fourth directive, but we can remedy that.  The importance of this legislation defines where the State stands in the context of tackling organised crime and international terrorism.  Unfortunately, we have a sad history in this State of dealing with terrorism and that threat has not gone away.</p>  <p>  Looking at what this legislation provides for and allows to be done, the important thing is to cut off finance from organised crime and terrorism, not just in this State but across the EU and beyond.  Many threats are posed to the State by Brexit, but the one thing we must retain is a close working relationship between the police authorities in this jurisdiction and their colleagues in Northern Ireland and across the UK.  The extremely successful work done on a European level must also be continued.</p>  <p>  In recent months, great success has been achieved by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, working with European colleagues, to smash an online scam, worth more than &euro;24 million, which was operating out of Ireland.  We have seen the EncroChat used by Europe's most notorious gangsters, some of whom are Irish passport holders, broken up by a dedicated effort, led by Europol, but including a contribution by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na working here and in Europol's head office.</p>  <p>  One thing we must look at in the context of this directive is modernising the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's legislative tool base for addressing organised crime and the money that goes into funding it.  The legislation before us will make it possible to target anonymous prepaid bank cards, existing luxury properties, virtual currencies and the high-end art trade.  It will also allow us to ensure due diligence is carried out before business relationships are entered into.  All of this will help to combat money-laundering activities in Ireland and allow us to work with police authorities and governments across the EU to ensure that there are benefits throughout the Union as well.</p>  <p>  This legislation will also allow us to look at who is targeted.  We all know the absolute misery poured onto the streets of the capital city and everywhere else in the country by organised criminal groups such as the Kinahan cartel.  Such groups are able to move money seamlessly from bases in Dublin to Spain, the Netherlands and England.  There has been such good work done in bringing so many members of that cartel to book and ensuring that they answer for the crimes they have committed in this State and across the EU.  I have referred to the misery they have caused to so many families through debt, destruction and murder and, more importantly, through the vicious drugs they pump onto our streets.</p>  <p>  We must also look to target terrorist groups.  Even in recent weeks, nine members of the New IRA army council were sentenced to lengthy prison terms in Northern Ireland because of the work of and co-operation between the authorities in this jurisdiction and their colleagues in Northern Ireland.  It is that kind of work, those sentences and ensuring that the funds that pay for terrorist atrocities and associated manoeuvres are restricted that are important.</p>  <p>  I welcome this legislation.  I appreciate the way it is being expedited and the manner in which the Minister of State and his colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy McEntee, are taking account of the serious nature of what is at stake.  I implore the entire House, when we support this legislation, to look at what it is about and recognise that money laundering is an active threat.</p></speech>

We were in the middle of a meeting of the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party.</p>  <p>  I welcome this Bill, which drives home the need for transparency when it comes to the ever-changing world of money laundering and terrorist financing.  The fifth anti-money laundering directive, which the Bill transposes into Irish law, is very important.  In the wake of terrorist attacks and the revelations resulting from the publication of the Panama Papers in 2016, it was understood that it was necessary for several measures to be put in place to increase the level of financial transparency and ensure that our legislation keeps pace with the technological changes in our world.  We must not be seen to be asleep at the wheel in this regard.  Politicians are too often seen as being behind the curve of societal change and are too often accused that the legislation they pass does not reflect reality.  I am, therefore, thrilled to see the Government acting on this issue.</p>  <p>  I will highlight two aspects of this Bill, namely, the need for co-ordination among financial intelligence units across the EU and the need to adapt our anti-money laundering practices to changing patterns in consumer behaviour.  I refer to the prevention of risks associated with the use of virtual currencies for terrorist financing and limiting the use of prepaid cards.  These actions are of the utmost importance to our economy.  While prepaid cards provided by Apple and Google may seem like a nice gift, we must think about the more sinister uses of such cards.</p>  <p>  While the days of physical shopfronts are still with us, we must recognise the changing nature of customer spending patterns and adjust our legislation accordingly.  Given the popularity of prepaid cards, and the anonymous nature of many of them, fraud experts are increasingly concerned about the potential for abuse, from petty scams to that of money laundering by drug lords and terrorists.  The global prepaid market is anticipated to reach &euro;3.5 trillion in value by 2022, and there is no sign of this trend stopping.  Lowering the value limits for carrying out simplified due diligence on e-money instruments is key, and the new limit of &euro;150 is very welcome in this regard.</p>  <p>  Co-ordination is key and this Bill will enhance the powers of EU financial intelligence units and facilitate increasing transparency regarding who really owns companies and trusts by establishing beneficial ownership registers.  It is critical to ensure that the relevant unit in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the necessary resources and skills to not only track transactions within the country, but to co-ordinate successfully with our EU partners.</p>  <p>  The reforms of the beneficial ownership register for legal entities such as companies will enhance public scrutiny and contribute to preventing the misuse of legal entities for money laundering and terrorist financing purposes.  The national registers of beneficial ownership information will be interconnected directly to facilitate co-operation and exchange of information between member states.  Improvements will be put in place to ensure that the verification mechanisms of beneficial ownership information collected by the registers is accurate and reliable across those registers.  It is said that information is power, so ensuring a transparent set-up with easily accessible information across member states is going to be extremely important.</p></speech>

We cannot leave inconsistencies and weaknesses open for criminals because criminality is constantly evolving and we need to ensure that our capacity to fight it also evolves.  In the past while, there have been cases of online fraud and new revenue streams for criminals.  We must ensure that banks and our legal and policing frameworks are able to deal with this.</p><p>The football field rave that we saw recently shows the epidemic level of the drugs scourge, leaving aside the breaches of pandemic restrictions and those difficulties.  We must deal with the wanton criminality and drug dealing.  This is one of the ultimate cash businesses that still remains.  We need to ensure that we have forensic computing and accounting capacity and that all legal loopholes are closed.  I have a particular difficulty with the fact that the national drugs strategy falls under a junior Ministry in the Department of Health.  To a degree, I think we need a whole-of-Government response to the wider problem of drugs, including addiction services and so on, but also dealing with criminal gangs.  That response is vital and we need the teeth and capacity to deal with them.</p><p>I am glad when we see actions on the part of the Criminal Assets Bureau because even when that is at a localised level, it has an incredible impact.  I want to quickly go through some recent news stories.  The <i>Dundalk Democrat</i>, on 18 September, reported:</p> <blockquote> 	The Criminal Assets Bureau conducted a search operation in County Louth this morning.<br /><br />Four residential addresses were searched during the course of the operation conducted by Criminal Assets Bureau personnel assisted by the Emergency Response Unit, the Regional Armed Response Unit, Louth Divisional personnel and the Customs Dog Unit.<br /><br />During the course of this morning's search, &euro;57,507 was frozen in two bank accounts and &euro;4,770 in cash was seized.  30,000 in cash, believed to be the proceeds of crime, had already been seized as part of this ongoing investigation prior to this morning's search operation. </blockquote>  <p>This type of operation is vital and teaches a lesson to criminals.  We need more of it to happen.  People were arrested after the seizure of &euro;245,000 worth of cocaine at Dublin Airport.  That shows the size of the problem.</p><p>We have also talked about money mules.  This Monday, the <i>Evening Herald </i>reported: </p> <blockquote> 	A young criminal involved in the deadly Drogheda feud is one of 32 people who have been arrested for being so-called money mules.   </blockquote>  <p>The detective superintendent who was leading Operation Ransom is reported to have said:</p> <blockquote> 	It's an easy crime for garda&iacute; to solve because the mules use their own personal bank accounts.<br /><br />There's a potential conviction for people under the money laundering and terrorism financing legislation and it carries a huge prison sentence. </blockquote>  <p>The article also states, &quot;Money mules can face a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison.&quot;  We need to get that message out to people, ensure that all these lessons are learned and that the State has the capacity to deal with all these new problems.</p></speech>

There is a historical context to the Bill and its predecessor, and it is important that we draw attention to this.  There was delay on the part of the State in implementing the fourth anti-money laundering directive and that had a consequence.  Ireland was fined &euro;2 million, but it was also significant that we delayed.  Ireland and Romania were the last two countries in the EU to transpose the directive.  Both nations were responsible for EU law not being ensured at all times.  The State's failure was described at the time as posing a risk to the integrity of the functioning of the EU financial system, making it vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing and affecting investors and citizens.  It is vital that we act expeditiously to close compliance gaps.  We must make sure there is no delay.  Much of what happens in this area is reactive anyway and that is all the more reason to make sure that we act promptly.</p>  <p>  Moving to consider the Bill, the law is, in many instances, playing catch-up with criminality and terrorist financing.  The movement of money is not now solely restricted to concealing or redirecting hard cash but is much more sophisticated and we must, in many ways, try to get as far ahead of it as possible.  Cryptocurrency is something that many of us will never come into contact with but it is fair to be rightly sceptical of it.  It is an intangible form of currency but has a high value to a certain cohort of people.  The proposed legislation seeks to put regulation on cryptocurrency.  This is a welcome step.  Why should cryptocurrency be subject to a lower standard of checks and balances than any other recognised currency or item of value?</p>  <p>  Beneficial ownership of companies is another important element.  The Social Democrats have, since our foundation, advocated for allowing free and open access to searches on the Company Registration Office, the Land Registry and the Central Register of Beneficial Ownership of Companies.  In mid-2019, I asked the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, about the State's obligation under the fifth anti-money laundering directive to establish such a register by January 2020.  The central register was to be operated by the Company Registration Office and was scheduled to begin accepting filings from 22 June 2019.  When I asked, I was informed that details were not available regarding the number of beneficial owners that had been identified at that stage, or the number that would ultimately be identified.  That was in mid-2019.  Can the Minister update the House on those points if he has not already done so?</p>  <p>  There are things that have cropped up over time.  For example, I have tabled parliamentary questions about the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, as it relates to cases which might be taken, because some people would be obviously excluded from ownership or purchase of assets under section 172(3).  I asked that question in February 2019 and only two cases had arisen in the ten-year period since the legislation was enacted.  One was closed without any prosecution and the other had gone to the Garda.  The Committee of Public Accounts dealt with the matter and there was a gap in the definition of "beneficial owner".  That is the kind of thing that we need to be able to see readily.  If I remember rightly, a director of a company was not necessarily the owner and was not precluded under the definition in the Act.  We need to be able to see the information for there to be adequate scrutiny.  That is an example of a real case, rather than talking about these matters academically.</p>  <p>  Money mules have been referred to and on Monday night, RT&Eacute; and Virgin Media reported on figures from Banking and Payments Federation Ireland suggesting that more than &euro;12 million had been channelled through Irish bank accounts as part of a complex scam that, essentially, targeted young people.  Those young people were perhaps naive and did not understand the consequences and impact of their participation in those transactions.  So far in 2020, there have been approximately 1,000 instances of money mule transactions, totalling some &euro;12 million, and 98% of the bank accounts involved are linked to people between the ages of 18 and 24.  The survey was useful, in that it showed that people were using their own bank accounts, as has already been referred to.  The Garda finds that easy to detect because those involved are in plain sight.  Those people are acting as money mules, and we do not want young people to have their lives destroyed by having criminal convictions.</p>  <p>It was very useful that there was media attention on that.<br/><br/>I want to deviate slightly to raise the matter of Wirecard, a German financial services provider and payments processor that collapsed in June after revealing that almost &euro;2 billion previously reported as cash did not exist.  The debate we are having today is focused on holding financial institutions to account and protecting customers from being used for criminal gain or being scammed outright.  I mention Wirecard in the context of the hugely popular and convenient services that Revolut offers, including contactless payments, bill splitting and instant electronic fund transfers.  A lot of people find it very useful and more and more people are using it.  Revolut is authorised by in the UK by the Financial Conduct Authority under the electronic money regulations 2011 and is passporting its services into Ireland on a freedom of services basis.  Can the Minister of State provide some clarity on the way this arrangement will work post Brexit?  It is not immediately clear what will happen.  It may well have been taken care of in legislation already.  We are due to deal with some legislation in the context of Brexit in the near future.  If it is not dealt with in that, the Minister might deal with it in another way.<br/><br/>Section 5 of the Bill relates to the services I have referenced and attempts to amend section 33 of the 2010 Act.  It is described as a technical amendment.  I want to tease out something regarding the diligence of the prescribed person.  Section 5 (<i>a</i>)(ii) proposes the inclusion of the words &quot;at any time where the designated person is obliged by virtue of any enactment or rule of law, including the European Union (Administrative Cooperation in the Field of Taxation) Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 549 of 2012), to contact a customer for the purposes of reviewing any relevant information relating to the beneficial owner connected with the customer&quot; in the 2010 Act.  The amendments continue in that manner through the sub-paragraph.  It appears that many things are being taken at face value.  Uploaded photographs of identification are accepted to open accounts.  The onus rests on the designated person's own risk-based approach.  Will the Act be prescriptive in regard to the types of documentation that can be used to verify accounts?  To my knowledge, it is not that obvious at the moment.  It may be just a detail, but it may cause some problems if that is not properly defined.<br/><br/>I want to ask about a regulatory impact assessment.  We are required to transpose this directive into law and it is only right and proper that we do that, but doing that has to mean something.  A regulatory impact assessment would, for example, give us some understanding of how that would impact on the enforcement of what we are putting into law and whether we have sufficient means of enforcement or upskilling of the people who are required to enforce this piece of legislation.<br/><br/>When the Minister of State is wrapping up, he might come back to the question of what additional resources have been or will be put in place.  He might outline what those requirements are understood to be and how they were considered.  We often pass legislation and it is in place in theory, but this needs to work in practice.  For that to happen, the legislation cannot just be policy or law.  Something further is required to make sure the law is there in a meaningful way.  It must not just be on the Statute Book; we need to ensure it can be properly enforced.</p></speech>

It is good to see him there.</p><p>It is a pleasure and an honour to greet Deputy Browne as Minister of State.  I am delighted he is sitting in the front benches of Government to lead proceedings.  I wholeheartedly support this important Bill.  It strengthens and offers protection against money laundering.  The Bill gives effect to the criminal justice provisions of the fifth EU money laundering directive and deals with new forms of money laundering, including virtual currencies.</p><p>I note that the Irish State was recently fined &euro;2 million by the European Court of Justice for not transposing the fourth EU directive.  It is vital that we pass this Bill without too much delay so that we do not expose the State to further financial penalties.</p><p>Earlier this week, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na gave a very timely warning that money laundering is alive and well in Ireland.  We have long known about drug mules, but we now have a new phraseology around money mules, many of whom are very young people, including teenagers, who are very vulnerable and are laundering virtual currency for major criminals.  There is a need to beef up the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, section of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is an important arm of the Garda and is helping to take down large criminal gangs and strip them of their ill-gotten wealth.</p><p>  About four years ago during the tenure of the then Minister, Frances Fitzgerald MEP, the term &quot;mini-CAB&quot; was bandied about.  This became a second tier of CAB and targeted smaller criminals operating at a more local level.  Its work is excellent, but more can and should be done.  Of course, this will require the Department of Justice and Equality to better resource CAB.</p><p>There is one in every village and housing estate in Ireland.  We all know the guy who has no visible source of income, but lives a very impressive and lavish lifestyle in a luxury house, with several foreign holidays a year and a brand new fancy car.  He lives way beyond his means.  The neighbours whisper about him.  They describe cars pulling up late at night, a revolving door of visitors and small packages passed through hands.  His lifestyle and actions need to be investigated.  CAB must have the capacity to delve deeper into this guy's lifestyle and, more importantly, his source of income.  We owe it to the very decent people of Ireland to take down the village drug dealer, that is, the guy who operates in our local housing estates and villages.</p><p>We have an unprecedented number of people in every county vying for social housing for their families.  Some of these people have been on housing waiting lists for upwards of ten years.  The wait and uncertainty that brings is very cruel and every housing applicant understandably believes his or her circumstances carry a higher need than others.  For as long as I can remember, housing applicants have been Garda vetted.  The process takes time and can be very frustrating, but it is an essential component in knowing more about an individual and family who is moving into an area, and knowing that they are of good standing and not engaged in criminality.  It offers a lot of comfort and reassurance to the existing tenants of the council.</p><p>At some point, we need to consider some form of retrospective Garda vetting.  An individual may get the keys to a house on the basis of having an unblemished record, but what if he or she turns to criminality such as dealing drugs in an estate or becoming a loan shark in a community of vulnerable families?  If a person goes down this route, he or she has in a way nullified and obliterated the clean record he or she once had.  Such a person's entitlement to housing should be reviewed.  In many cases, such people should be made to hand back their keys.  Why should a criminal hold on to his or her council house and deny a decent family the right to a home?  Why should a criminal be allowed to hold residency on a nice street?  His or her presence on a nice street is malignant.  Getting more kids hooked on drugs is his or her business model.  Such people should be evicted and left to their own devices.  </p><p>As we progress through the decade of centenaries, it is vital that the Government considers fully outlawing the wearing of paramilitary uniforms by dissidents on our streets.  Our country has one Army and one Army only.  It wears the national uniform of our Defence Forces with pride and dignity.  The men and women who wear sunglasses, black berets, green jumpers and combat boots on our streets dishonour our Permanent Defence Force.</p> <p>They dishonour people like Lyra McKee and the many people who have been victims of republican paramilitarism.  I hope the legislation progresses without any delay and that the Minister of State and his departmental staff will also look at the other mechanisms required to dismantle criminality further and to stand up for the decent people of Ireland.</p></speech>

At the outset I will speak in plain English.  There has been much debate on this tonight.  I want to speak to the people outside of this House and explain to them exactly what this Bill is about.  We welcome it.  This Bill is about safeguarding the financial transactions to and from high-risk third countries and sets new limits for the use of anonymous prepaid cards, which obviously is an no-brainer.  We are aware that there are many prepaid cards and there is no control over them.</p>  <p>  Money laundering was mentioned.  Anything that sorts, quells and crushes it has to be welcomed.  Bringing new and existing bodies under the existing legislation will enhance due diligence and improve the banking system.  I want to emphasise the responsibilities of our banks and financial institutions in protecting all of our money as they also have a duty of care.  I welcome the stringent measures and the tightening of the security in that.</p>  <p>  I welcome the provision on the issuing of ministerial guidance regarding prominent public functions in respect of politically exposed persons.  Many people are exposed and are in the public domain and there is a threat there.  We are talking here about the ring-fencing of security for people.</p>  <p>  Another matter mentioned, which was also mentioned on the &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme on Monday and which is one of the main points I wish to raise on this legislation, is money mules, because some people, more so parents, may not be aware of this.  From the information that we have received, more than &euro;1.6 million has been scammed out of Irish accounts alone.  It is not that we have mules who are operating for illegal organisations but our own citizens are being scammed out of money.  I want to flag up with the banks again that they have an onus and a duty to keep an eye on these matters.  I also want to flag up for parents to keep an eye on their own children&rsquo;s accounts because the implications of this could be life changing.  Unfortunately, when young people think that there is a quick buck to be made, it sounds and actually is too good to be true.  It is true to say that that money is being laundered and these young people must remember that this is for criminal activity.  It involves sex trafficking, prostitution, drug money and all other sorts of illegal activity.  If parents allow their children to be involved in that, they are going to be in deep trouble.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Bill and I look forward to it moving on to the next Stage when it will come back for discussion.  I commend the Government on bringing it forward.</p></speech>

Many of us who are active in our communities will be aware of the amount of drug intimidation that is going on, and it is happening daily in many communities throughout the State.  What normally happens is that it normally involves vulnerable people, or maybe their sons or grandchildren, who are possibly on the edge of criminality and are involved in drugs or whatever else.  I have heard cases of people having to sell their homes as a result of that.  It is the nature of how the drugs scene has changed.  The nature of the global and technologically advanced world in which we live in is that criminals are becoming increasingly advanced and sophisticated in their tactics for moving and hiding their money.  We must rise to meet that challenge by staying one step ahead of them in our laws and approach.  Everybody would agree that we need to resource properly those who are tackling this.  People will mention in this debate the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, and the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, and that we would allow them to be proactive in their fight against these gangs.</p>  <p>  One of the criticisms that many people have, particularly in the drugs task forces, and which has been echoed many times down the years to various Ministers with responsibility for justice is that CAB needs to start focusing on those who are in the middle management and who are torturing communities.  We hear of the Kinahans and of the other big drug barons and so on.  What people want to see is those who have no visible means of income, who are displaying their wealth every day, who do not work and have never worked a day in their life but yet are buying up businesses, restaurants, garages and many companies in our communities.  Businesses are being bought and run in many of our communities by gangs, both Irish and international.  We probably have people going into many of these companies completely unaware that they are facilitating the laundering of the illegal proceeds of drugs.</p>  <p>  What do we need to be doing?  We need to be doing things differently.  We need to allow the Garda to identify and shut down these businesses and to seize the assets and money which fund further illegal activity.  We need to be much more strident and reactive in respect of those funds that are recovered as these need to be reinvested back in the communities which are affected by the daily use of drugs supplied by the drug barons.  We must act much more quickly.</p>  <p>  I will give an example of this.  There has been a house in my constituency where it was supposed to have been repossessed by CAB.  The person in question was involved in criminality all his life and is now dead.  The house was supposed to have been repossessed by the State.  This has been going on for years and at the same time people have to live beside this house which has no electricity.  Generators are going day and night in the place.  It is decent people who are living alongside this.  We need to be much more proactive and act more quickly in this.</p>  <p>  Other people have mentioned the mules and so on but I stress that we must do more to keep these criminals in check to counter their increasingly advanced tactics before they dominate more communities and ruin more lives.</p></speech>

Law and order are significant priorities for me and my constituents and I very much look forward to engaging with him over the coming years in that regard.</p>  <p>  From the outset I am very happy with the legislation that is before us.  It is long overdue and I will certainly support its passage through the D&aacute;il.  I have seven points to make which I will try to keep as brief as possible so that others can get to speak.  My first point is the only negative one I have which is on the delay.  I know that it has been mentioned before but it is a pity that it has taken so long to get this legislation to the floor of the D&aacute;il.  I totally accept that the Minister of State has just recently assumed his role, so this is not a slight against him in any shape or form, but it does reflect very poorly on the country and unnecessarily damages our international reputation.  The European Union was quite decent with us and gave us plenty of time to enact this legislation, and it is a pity that we are now eight months behind its enactment timeline.</p>  <p>  A central component of this legislation is the deterrent factor.  We should ask ourselves how many crimes have been committed in the past eight months that were not deterred.  How many of the crimes that were committed in the past eight months cannot now be penalised because we cannot apply the law retrospectively?  I fully agree that there is collective Cabinet responsibility and it is up to the Government to drive the legislative programme, but I am also of the view that there is a collective responsibility on all Deputies in the D&aacute;il, be they a member of a party or a member of an Independent grouping, to stick to the timelines and advance legislation, especially important legislation like this which has an international deadline.  From a Regional Group perspective, we will certainly be supporting any such legislation and will play our part in that regard.</p>  <p>  My next point is that I certainly agree with the content of this legislation.</p> <p>Any measures that are brought in to tighten up procedures in respect of cryptocurrency or money laundering through expensive works of art and any restrictions that can be placed on drug trafficking, human trafficking and the likes are to be welcomed.  I believe, however, that we will be back here before the end of the Thirty-third D&aacute;il because we will need to amend and update this legislation.  As technology advances and there is greater sophistication from a terrorist and organised crime perspective, we need to ensure that our enforcement agencies have all the necessary powers to combat and deter this type of activity.</p> <p> The third point I want to make is that it is not enough to have only legislative powers.  We also need to resource our people, particularly the enforcement agencies.  If we task, we must resource.  I join the vast majority of Deputies in the Chamber in commending the actions of the Criminal Assets Bureau, in particular over the past ten years, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, and a lesser-known entity, J2, the military intelligence service, which has been operating in this space also.  The J2 in particular is finding it very difficult to retain its people and that level of expertise, so if there is anything the Minister can do at the Cabinet table to improve retention in the Defence Forces, it would be greatly appreciated.</p> <p> The fourth point I want to make is that in this country we are especially susceptible to organised crime and the financing of terrorism for a number of reasons.  First is our massive financial services industry, which employs up to 40,000 people, and at least &euro;2 trillion is being managed through international funds through this country.  That makes us very vulnerable but it also places a huge obligation on us to make sure that any money that is pushed through these pathways is done for legitimate purposes only.</p> <p> The second reason we are vulnerable is because of domestic terrorism.  We still have a number of armed elements on both sides of this island who are engaged in terrorism.  They are not on ceasefire.  We probably have the greatest terrorism issue in the European Union here on this island, and we should not forget about that.  As recently as last Friday night a viable, live, improvised explosive device was found in Galway, so it has not gone away.  Somebody paid for that detonator.  Somebody paid for those explosives.  Somebody paid for the bomb maker's labour.  As the former four-star general in the US and former Secretary of State, Colin Powell, said, money to a terrorist is like oxygen.  If the supply of money is cut off, it cuts off the supply of oxygen.  I very much support this Bill from that perspective.</p> <p> The third reason we are vulnerable is because of international terrorism.  The perception, rightly or wrongly, is that Ireland is a soft spot for terrorism.  One can come to Dublin, train, look after the logistics and financing, and then launch attacks on mainland UK and continental Europe.  That is an area on which we have to focus also.</p> <p> The fifth point I want to make is about improvement.  We are unique in this Parliament in that we do not have a special committee.  Most sovereign republics would have a defence, intelligence and security committee.  Any country which takes its sovereignty and security seriously would have such a committee.  We have a foreign affairs and defence committee but we do not have a committee that covers intelligence and security.  Parliamentary oversight of these agencies is very important in western democracies to ensure that they are properly resourced.  Many of these agencies are uniform services.  They do not have the luxury of the same number of voices that civilian agencies have, so it is very important that they have an opportunity and a platform to voice their concerns in respect of resourcing, staffing and premises.  If there was one constructive suggestion I would make it is that we should consider setting up a defence, intelligence and security committee.  All of the testimony would not have to be in open forum.  It could be in closed session, if required.  I very much recommend that for either this D&aacute;il or the next D&aacute;il, we would look at setting up a defence, intelligence and security committee.</p> <p> Sixth, the National Security Analysis Centre is an agency that was established last year under the Department of the Taoiseach.  Dermot Woods is the civil servant in charge.  We have not heard a whole lot about it.  It was set up to integrate and co-ordinate all the information coming from the various intelligence agencies in the country, be it military, police, Revenue or customs and excise.  The Minister might mention that when replying or, subsequently, by way of a written reply.  Where are we with the National Security Analysis Centre?  Does it have a premises?  How many staff does it have?  Is it effective?  Has it been consulted on the drafting of this legislation?</p> <p> My final point is on the national security strategy, which was to be devised by the National Security Analysis Centre.  There was public consultation up to 31 December last year but since then nothing has happened.  We have not heard anything.  If the Minister would update the House when replying or by way of written reply subsequently, it would be very much appreciated.</p> <p> We completely support the Minister in his role.  Organised crime and law and order are massive issues across regional and rural Ireland and in coastal communities.  The Minister can be assured of the full support of the Regional Group in respect of any measures he takes that will curtail these type of activities.  Any expertise I have is at the Minister's disposal should he choose to avail of it.</p></speech>

At the start of the week we had the latest revelations of shady practices within the global financial system involving many top global institutions.  The so-called FinCEN Files of approximately 2,500 leaked documents involving about $2 trillion of transactions have revealed how some of the world's biggest banks have allowed criminals to move dirty money around the world.  They also showed how Russian oligarchs have used banks to avoid sanctions that were supposed to stop them bringing money into the West.  It is the latest in a string of leaks over the past five years that have exposed secret deals, money laundering and financial crime.  We have had the Lux Leaks, the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers in addition to a whole host of other leaks, all of which have revealed massive tax avoidance and evasion, money laundering as well as other criminal activities.</p><p>On Sunday, <i>The Irish Times</i>noted that a network of bank accounts was used over a number of years to move an enormous amount of capital out of Russia into the West.  The banks involved included one near Moscow that had a cousin of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, as one of its directors.  As <i>The Irish Times</i>pointed out, some of the bank accounts that made up the network were in the name of British shell companies provided by a company services group located in Dublin.  For most people that sounds unusual.  Ireland is about the farthest European country from Russia, yet we have this article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, and Ireland is mentioned also.</p><p>According to new research from Trinity College professors James Stewart and Cillian Doyle, between 2005 and 2017 there were 106 Irish registered shell companies connected to some of Russia's largest state-owned and private companies which raised gross funds of approximately &euro;118 billion, making Ireland one of the main jurisdictions for the raising of these funds.  In terms of net debt flows, Ireland was the second highest EU jurisdiction, just behind Luxembourg.  These type of shell companies have raised enormous sums of money for different companies which have been alleged to have engaged in serious wrongdoing.  Some of them have been subject to economic sanction.  Some have been identified as having engaged in insider trading and market manipulation, while several recently collapsed Russian banks were accused of creating fictitious loans, defrauding customers and then requiring bailouts.</p><p>What is common to all these Irish shell companies is that they all availed of the section 110 tax concession, meaning their effective rate of tax was zero or near zero, and they generally use complex, anonymous trustee ownership structures.  The Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing) (Amendment) Bill looks to bring greater transparency.  Specifically, we need greater transparency around beneficial ownership of company assets.  In other words, it helps us demonstrate who owns what.  The problem, however, is that it allows trustees to be listed as beneficial owners even when they are often acting as an intermediary for the ultimate beneficial owner and therefore they provide a layer of secrecy that criminals can seek to exploit.  That is my biggest concern about it.</p></speech>

I support any means by which they can be apprehended, slowed down and got out of the scene, and I support taking their funds from them.</p>  <p>  One of the biggest issues we all have to deal with today concerns drugs and the amounts of money involved.  The slaughter we hear about in this city day after day is all drug-related.  We, as elected representatives, must support any laws to stop that.</p>  <p>  I have a small bit of a grudge about something I know is also affecting other Deputies and their families.  The banks now consider Deputies and, indeed, councillors to be politically exposed and they ask them to sign documents in that regard.  I resent being targeted in that fashion.  I have the same couple of accounts for God knows how many years.  Surely with all the modern equipment the bank now has, it would be able to notice any unusual transaction and notify the Garda, Criminal Assets Bureau or other relevant authority.  It would be entitled to do so.  That would be sufficient.  It is unfair on all politicians that they are asked to sign a document that considers them to be politically exposed.  I do not consider myself to be in this category because I make up my own mind.</p></speech>

The onset of cryptocurrency brings money laundering to a new level.  Ireland must not be a tax haven for criminals and terrorists.  If we do not get this type of updated legislation through the D&aacute;il, Ireland's financial system will be used for money laundering and terrorist financing.</p>  <p>  We need to be mindful of certain circumstances.  For example, funds were illegally taken from a customer's account in a prominent Irish bank by way of a scam.  Had it not been for the media pressure on the banking institution, there would have been no reimbursement.  In that case, was the bank liable?  We can see that the criminals in this world are so far advanced that they always seem to be one or two steps ahead in respect of how to launder money.</p>  <p>  I learned a new term today.  Criminals are now targeting 16, 17 and 18-year-olds and paying them a certain amount to lodge money in their accounts, up to a limit of &euro;5,000 if it is a bank or &euro;3,000 if it is a credit union, and to take it out in the form of a cheque a week later.  The people targeted are called "mules".  I learned this only today.</p>  <p>  Criminals are determining every way to buy various properties with cash.  They are washing their money in this system.  In the past two to three years, CAB has intervened and caught many companies involved.  The bureau seizes assets, be they associated with car trading or otherwise, but the criminals go to another county and open up again.  We have to get this legislation right, not only to protect this State now but also to protect the next generation.  We must not allow what is happening.  We need to send a clear message that we are going to get this legislation right and that everything in it will stop all the criminal activity, which is terrorism.  I support any measure in the Bill in this regard.  I support it 100%.</p></speech>

It is behind time.  I acknowledge there was an election and a long delay in forming a Government.  We are eight months behind time and, once again, we are being fined by the EU authorities.  If we are in the EU, we have to play our part but we are being fined regularly by its authorities over many issues.  On this matter of criminal justice, in respect of which every citizen of the State needs protection, it ill-behoves us to foot-drag and not play our part.  We are very good Europeans in many ways.  When it comes to signing statutory instruments for the fishermen, we crucify them.  The Taoiseach could not even wait for the appointment of a Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, albeit the third in a month, to sign the statutory instruments.  He rushed to sign them and I would say he had not even read them.  This is what happens.  The severe penalties imposed on the fishermen because of the statutory instruments are scandalous.  One can go to court, defend one's good name and have penalty points annulled but they stay on one's licence.  Did you ever hear the beat of it in your life?  A person may be cleared of the offence for which he was charged and for which he received penalty points but he cannot remove the penalty points from his licence.  We were so quick to allow this but we are so slow to deal with important legislation such as that before the House.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State is new and I wish him well.  I have no issue with him whatsoever, and I had no issue with his father before him.  I respect the Minister of State.  He is a legal brain and is qualified, much more than I am, but the situation is scandalous.  Night after night and day after day, we hear about atrocities in Dublin and Drogheda.  They are spreading down to Mullingar and we fear they will spread to Clonmel because of the activities of drug gangs.</p>  <p>  We hear the horrible term "mule".  When I was growing up, a mule was a cross between a jennet and an ass.  "Mule" is a horrible term.  We had drug mules and now we have money mules.  It is disgusting.  Young teenagers, perhaps barely in secondary school and perhaps with learning difficulties or on the spectrum, are being used in a horrible, disgusting fashion.  As soon as they reach the legal age to open a bank account, they do so.  We saw a survey that indicated 98% of money mules were youths with bank accounts.  They have a serious criminal record for the rest of their lives.  They probably do not get away with being assigned a juvenile liaison officer or anyone like that.  They receive a horrible criminal record.  They get a fairly good reward for being the mule who carries the funding into the bank account and transfers it out again.  They like this; it is manna, a quick buck.  They get into the way of life and it becomes so hard to change it.  They get in deeper and deeper and it becomes so difficult to get out of it.  It is so difficult for people in the community, including parents, Garda liaison officers and therapists, to talk them out of their activity because it is lucrative and there is a big buzz with high octane levels.  They get sucked in and carry on with their activity.</p>  <p>  I support this legislation but, like Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, I have an issue over persons who are regarded as exposed, such as politicians.  I, like all Deputies, am one of those - I certainly accept that - but my wife and each of my eight children, including my 14-year-old daughter, and my son in law, who is not related to me as such although we are on very good terms, thank God, and he is a great man to have around the house to help us with issues, are not.  They all get registered letters from my bank stating they are exposed persons.  It has gone from the sublime to the ridiculous.</p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>My child has no way of earning money.  She has passed the leaving certificate now and is going on to college.  The expense will be on us to keep her there.  God bless her, she has achieved what she wanted to and got her place.  It was a very anxious year last year.  The present year with the exams was anxious and now the students do not know what they will have.  Will they have lectures or will they have study?  It is unfair on them.  </p> <p> However, she is an exposed person and that is ridiculous.  When I got onto my bank I got no hop.  When I got onto my legal adviser I was told to comply.  I have no notion of complying for my children, especially ones who are not involved in my business or my political scene or anything else.  Some of them are married and imithe and are setting up their own clann and family.  We must be mindful of that.  </p> <p> I am talking to the drafters of this legislation, who I am often critical of, but it is a step too far.  It is ridiculous.  Why should they inquire about my children?  As Deputy Healy-Rae said, the banks are under this legislation now and they notice more than anybody if there are big money movements involving an account holder, be it me or anybody else.  I am all up for that because that is the way it should be.  </p> <p> I have eight children.  My wife and I are blessed with them, thank God.  That they be all exposed persons and classified to get registered letters is kind of intimidating.  The system has gone mad.  It should not be happening.  I am sorry I do not have the amendment down on this but the Minister needs to look at it and say, "Come on a minute here".  Why would a bank put a family under stress with these letters?  We did not know what was happening.  They were registered letters.  Any time there is a serious enough event one would sign for them and whatever but that needs to be changed in the legislation.</p> <p> We need the legislation to tackle who it should, that is, the heinous, dastardly people who are involved in drugs and financial crime, in drug and people trafficking, in child labour, you name it.  Whatever comes up, they do not mind.  They see lots of money and quick ways of getting it.  We are lagging behind with this legislation.  However, under the existing legislation I got all those letters one day from the fear an phoist isteach an doras.  We got the letters so that is ridiculous.  I do not want to say any more about it but I want to see that changed because it is not right as far as I am concerned.  I am a political person and, of course, my wife is, as are some people who are involved with me.  Other family members, however, should not be.  It is not right.</p> <p> We were fined &euro;2 million recently.  I will be putting in a D&aacute;il question because I would love to know how often and by how many millions we are being fined by our European friends.  We used to get much support from them but now we are on the paying end of it.  I saw that after the most recent crunch talks we were going to be net contributors.  We are the fifth highest contributor in the whole EU.  That is bad enough without paying all these fines as well.</p> <p> As I said, it is not right to have these drug barons do what they like.  As regards ordinary, small drug criminals and many of these mules that I am talking about, the person may be male or female.  I hate calling them that term but that is what they are called.  I call whoever got sucked into that a vulnerable person.  He or she may then get involved in moving drugs.  In my own county, in Clonmel and other towns, children as young as seven are distributing drugs for family gangs that are out of control and controlling the drug trade in the town.  I spoke about it here before.</p> <p> I will support the garda&iacute; 100%. I will support superintendent Willie Leahy and his team, sergeant Kieran O'Regan, garda Clare Murphy and many others on the community side of it.  They have really come to the fore through Covid-19.  If the Minister saw the Dickensian station they are expected to work in he would not believe it.  I will not compare them to animals but one would not expect to put anybody in it in this day and age.  It is not a suitable premises for any workplace, let alone members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are the front line, and it is a thin line between anarchy and peace and the public.  They need the public's support at all times.</p> <p> We need robust legislation and I salute the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, and support the excellent work it has done.  It gives me a sense of pride when I see a bus with CAB and, perhaps, the customs and, possibly, the Garda dog and drugs teams and they unearth huge amounts of drugs.  It was referred to earlier.  One was referred to in Drogheda.  They are literally seizing and, more importantly, freezing bank accounts and finding wagons of cash in that number of houses.  Often, these are domestic houses and then there are warehouses in which we see the opulence; cars and watches and so forth.  This must be stamped out.  We are behind the curve in stamping it out but I support the CAB in what it does.  That needs to be done and we must support it and take solace in that.  The Garda must take solace in that as well as regards getting these thugs off the streets.</p> <p>  These young and vulnerable people, the so-called mules, get involved as well.  Their families do their best but they are sucked into this.  Then we see they are living in housing estates; they are on the street and they are giving a terribly bad name to the whole community and people know about it.  They are feared by some and revered by other young people because of their money and what they can do.  It is a difficult area to deal with.</p> <p> However, the housing authorities and housing legislation must be strengthened to come up with ways of dealing with this.  As was said earlier by an Teachta Crowe, I believe, Garda vetting is there for everything.  I have people now who are involved in the community and might be involved in five different organisations.  They must get separate Garda vetting for all of them.  It is madness.  When we have Garda vetting for a house, some people are slipping through the cracks.  There is also a relocation policy in a city not too far from me and people ended up in our towns in County Tipperary.  We were not told about them.  Where was the Garda vetting?  Worse than that, if a person gets a clear Garda vetting, is housed in a family home and then gets involved in the drug business or all this dirty, murky business, there should be a review of the Garda vetting.  They are not in as a good tenant.  The council and social workers are slow to act and it is not easy.  </p> <p> I see it in Clonmel in a housing estate.  I do not see it, I am sorry.  However, people are on to me on a regular basis.  There is a constant flow of people in and out over the wall.  If the residents open their mouths they get abused and get all kinds of missiles thrown into their garden.  That is from a particular grouping of people who we all talk about here.  We give them ethnic status as well and they cannot be touched.  It is shocking.  We need this regulation to be more robust and even-handed to take those vagabonds, gangsters and fraudsters off our streets because it is a thin line where they will take control.</p> <p> It is that lacuna we have now with the children out of school and much time on their hands.  We saw that party, and I will not be criticising na daoine &oacute;ga.  Mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh s&iacute;.  I have spent time dealing with issues in Clonmel and antisocial behaviour.  It is not really antisocial behaviour; it is gangs of people with nothing to do because all the sports were stood down.  All their activities, whether it be arts work, music, scoil rince n&oacute; ruda&iacute; mar sin, they were all closed up so people had nothing else to do.  There is an old saying, and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will probably agree with me.  The devil finds work for idle hands, and that is what happened.  They did not have the work or recreation or those outlets.</p> <p> I appeal to parents of teenagers, and I am one myself, to know and care and wonder where their young people are because we do not want them turning into this terrible term of money mules.  It is shocking and it is a simple transaction.  The money goes into one's account and it has gone out an hour later.  However, it is a diversion and they are easily traced, which is a good thing.  As I said, Deputy Murphy referred to a survey where 98% of the people involved here where young people between 17 or 18 and 24.  It is a vital time because there are a lot of pressures on those people. </p> <p> I support the legislation, certainly, but I am concerned and I appeal to the Minister to examine the situation I outlined.  Deputy Healy-Rae did likewise because common sense could be applied.  It is a scarce commodity in this modern world.  As I said, however, we need common sense.  We also need to ensure that legislation is prepared and put through the House in time.  In this case, we must and should have it in time.  We are behind the curve all the time in catching up with these criminals with this cryptocurrency.  I have not even referred to it but we saw it all this week throughout the world with big financial institutions.  Some &euro;40 billion went through them here in Ireland.  We pride ourselves on the financial headquarters and companies we have here.  However, we are open and ripe for picking.  Our children, however, na daoine &oacute;ga, are ripe for picking and it is the wrong kind of picking.  It must be stamped out, so this legislation must go through swiftly.  I ask the Minister to try and address the questions I have put to him.</p></speech>

Five people submitted their names to speak tonight and have not bothered to turn up.</p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the impact the Bill will have across the State.  It was interesting to read the Bill and what it attempts to achieve.  As with everything in society, money makes the world go around and that is certainly true for those who use illicit funds to support their activities.  Along with other legislation that preceded it, the Bill aims to make the activities of illegal organisations more difficult.  For that reason I support the Bill.  The reasons have been outlined by many Members tonight about what is actually happening with targeting individuals involved in criminal activities such as drug dealing.  We need to look further than that with this Bill.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides for several possibilities in managing and looking at transactions from particular countries that might attract attention, which is appropriate.  It also defines more closely who a politically exposed person is and the need to maintain a register of them.  In the Irish context I thought these politically exposed people were individuals who might abuse their office to hide money, as we are well used to here in Ireland.  However, it seems that it is more to highlight individuals who, perhaps through their job, have a role in detecting money laundering or being targeted by money launderers to be in that role.  There may be a need for a second register of political people who might deal in money laundering themselves as well, which would be no harm.</p>  <p>  Interestingly what caught my attention was the introduction to the Bill by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, which did a great job on this Bill as it does all the time.  It stated that the Bill softens the requirement to examine the background and purpose of a transaction, by qualifying that this only needs to be done as far as is reasonably possible.  This led me to wonder why this would be the case.</p>  <p>  I looked at what happens with this and who launders funds.  The financial system, of course, must be protected at all costs.  There is no doubt, possibly, that the financial institutions do not actually launder funds themselves or set up funds for laundering, possibly, but they are all laundered through banks and financial institutions.  The crux of the issue is that the banks and financial institutions allow for the money laundering and facilitate it.  Everything that it does they do.  Therefore, the banks must have knowledge of where the money laundering is happening and how it is happening, but it is not done to them.</p>  <p>  The amounts of money involved are staggering which gets to the crux of the issue of why the banks are not touched in this regard.  The amounts are mind boggling.  The US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network showed that in 2017, $2 trillion - I do not even know how many zeros are in $2 trillion - in suspicious transactions are reported globally by banks.  Its files show that important institutions such as Deutsche Bank and HSBC Holdings plc, which we know well here, continue to facilitate suspicious transactions despite having been fined for doing that.  The value of the fines is insignificant compared with the amount of money they get access to and can move through their transactions.</p>  <p>  As an interesting aside, Deutsche Bank is also the main banker for the President of America.  That may give some indication about how reputable Deutsche Bank is.  It has been reported that $1.3 trillion of that $2 trillion has been moved through Deutsche Bank, which is very significant.</p>  <p>  Surely the way to tackle money laundering is centrally based in the banking system, but there seems to be little appetite to move against them and target the banking system.  There have been no prosecutions within institutions.  Sadly that does not surprise me because official Ireland places banks at a high level well above citizens and, of course, only citizens commit crimes, not institutions and financial organisations.  We need to get to the heart of that and change that responsibility.  We need to make the banks responsible for their actions.</p>  <p>  They are not innocent bystanders in this.  It is not that somebody happens to lodge $1 billion or &euro;1 billion in an account and the bank does not know anything about it.  The banks know where the money comes from, but they choose not to tell.  The financial system, the government system and the whole system choose to turn a blind eye.  We will target the drug dealers and the people who are hassling youngsters and getting them to do transactions through their accounts.  They will get publicity over prosecutions for that.  Meanwhile the banks will continue what they are doing in facilitating money laundering on a mass scale that would make our eyes water.  Sadly Dublin is probably a very important cog in that wheel to allow that to happen in Irish financial transactions.  That is possibly why we will never question it seriously and look at what causes the problems.</p>  <p>  If we are serious about this, we need to tackle the banks and make them responsible for it.  The fact that there have been no prosecutions under any regulations for financial irregularities in this country shows where we place this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2020-09-23a.379" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1618" speakername="James Browne" time="19:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2020092300064#SSS00200"><p>I thank all the Deputies for their very constructive contributions to this very important debate and for the support they have shown for the Bill.  I pay particular thanks to the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and all State agencies that are involved in fighting money laundering and terrorist financing.  They do a very difficult job very well in the face of very well resourced and well organised national and international criminals.</p>  <p>  As I stated earlier, this is an important area of law.  The reports arising from the FinCEN files in recent days demonstrate how important these measures against money laundering are.  Ongoing development and improvement are necessary in this area.  I echo Deputy Howlin's comments on this; the job will never be finished.  As new ways of laundering money are found, we need to keep pace.  Part of that is ensuring we incorporate European Union and FATF measures into domestic law, as we are doing here.  Many aspects of the directive and this Bill reflect the supranational risk assessments done by the European Commission in recent years.  This has particularly informed proposals relating to virtual assets and beneficial ownership matters.</p>  <p>  Looking forward, the Commission has raised the possibility of moving from the directive-based regime to a more harmonised regulation-based one with direct effect.  There will undoubtedly be challenges in achieving this across the disparate legal and regulatory structures across the Union.  In the interim, there is a focus on administrative co-operation between regulatory bodies.  The Bill includes several measures to facilitate this co-operation, notably in the amendments to sections 68A to 68D.  Co-operation has also been enhanced by the regulations we adopted last year in SI 578/2019.</p>  <p>  As I mentioned in my opening speech, Directive 2019/1153 further strengthens the framework by speeding up the access to information for law enforcement authorities and by enhancing the exchange of financial information between law enforcement authorities and financial intelligence units.  This is due for transposition by August 2021.</p>  <p>  Deputies Howlin and Conway-Walsh mentioned the financial sector.  There is a strong focus on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism issues from both the Central Bank of Ireland and the European Banking Authority, with the latter having recently concluded a consultation on risk factors.  New provisions on information sharing and dissemination will also improve co-operation among supervisors.</p>  <p>  Deputy Conway-Walsh asked about sanctions for violations of the Bill by those in the financial services industry.  The first thing to note is that these may be criminal offences and can be prosecuted as such by the Garda.  The Central Bank also has strong administrative sanction powers in respect of regulated firms.  It can impose a fine of up to the greater of &euro;10 million or 10% of a firm's turnover, and can potentially suspend its authorisation to conduct business.  Individuals can face fines of up to &euro;1 million and be disqualified from managing a firm.</p>  <p>  Deputy Howlin asked about resources within the Garda to target economic crime, as did many other Deputies this evening.  I acknowledge the very significant successes achieved by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in recent years, particularly the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Criminal Assets Bureau in their work targeting organised crime gangs and groups.</p> <p>A recent example of this was Operation Omena, under which the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, working with colleagues in Finland and with the support of Europol and Eurojust, successfully took action against a group involved in cyber fraud and money laundering.  CAB has been central to many recent significant operations to combat organised criminal activity.  Deputy Howlin will be aware that as part of Operation Coronation, on 17 June, more than 170 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from Limerick, Clare and Tipperary divisions, supported by CAB, carried out 67 searches of dwellings, businesses and land in those counties.  Significant evidence to support the investigation, including financial accounts and property documentation, was recovered.<br/><br/>Deputy Howlin noted that significant resources are assigned to the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and CAB.  The former has a dedicated money laundering investigation unit.  To further build skills across the force, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na training college and University College Dublin offer an accredited postgraduate certificate in fraud and e-crime investigation to some 44 garda&iacute; per annum drawn from all Garda divisions and from specialist units.<br/><br/>Several Deputies asked about the timing of the transposition of the directive.  Ireland takes its EU obligations very seriously and we are progressing this Bill as a priority.  However, this is a complex area which spans not only multiple Departments but many sectors of the economy.  Different bodies are involved in regulating the different designated persons, from the Central Bank in respect of financial services firms to the professional bodies for accounting, legal services and more.  There was a need to engage in appropriate consultation and consideration and to ensure the legislation is robust enough to underpin criminal and regulatory sanctions.  It needs to be effective and enforceable.  It also needs to be communicated through designated persons to enable people to properly comply with their obligations.  The non-criminal justice aspects of the directive are also complex, with beneficial ownership being particularly challenging from both a legal and an administrative perspective.  Officials have been in contact with the European Commission throughout the process and have advised it of the publication of the Bill and the priority the Government places on its progress.  The Commission has also been advised in detail of the individual measures Ireland is putting in place in this area.<br/><br/>Deputies Howlin, Daly and Kelly referred to money mules.  As Deputies Howlin, Buckley, Cathal Crowe and others noted, it is vital to emphasise that a person who acts as a mule may be convicted of a money laundering offence and face a maximum sentence of 14 years.  Such a conviction can affect visa applications, the ability to work in the financial sector and the ability to access financial products in the future.  Whatever the temptations for those in a financially precarious position, the reality is that many mules ultimately receive no payment and may instead be defrauded themselves or coerced into future transactions or criminal activity.  This is an area of particular focus for the anti-money laundering steering committee, the Garda and the financial institutions concerned.  For any young person thinking that this might be a way to make a few easy euro, they should be aware that having a criminal conviction with the terms &quot;money laundering&quot; and &quot;terrorist financing&quot; in that conviction could destroy any potential future career.  I ask anybody, before they enter into such activity, to think seriously about the potential outcome for their long-term future.<br/><br/>Deputies Richmond and Buckley mentioned co-operation between the Government and police forces in the UK, throughout Europe and internationally.  They are correct that this is an important aspect of dealing with this type of activity.  We are talking about criminals who are very organised and are operating at an international level, and we must be the same.  We have to be organised, resourced and operating at an international level to stop them.<br/><br/>Several Deputies referred to the misery caused by the activities referred to in this Bill.  This is a point that must be hammered home.  Behind all this money, whether it is laundered for criminals or used to finance terrorism, is absolute and pure misery.  It is misery in the socioeconomic sense and also misery in terms of the physical impact it has on people, including serious harm and, in some cases, death.  The amount of damage being done to our society through this money is unbelievable.  Not only is there no easy money to be made but what money is made is secured on the back of very serious damage to society right across the board.  Some of what is going on is shocking.<br/><br/>Questions were raised in regard to the register of beneficial ownership.  That will be a matter for the Minister for Finance to address further.<br/><br/>Deputy Catherine Murphy raised the issue of prepaid payment cards.  We are not banning all such cards but simply introducing some restrictions on the anonymity aspects.  For example, certain prepaid cards for purchasing items or gifts will require customer verification.  The Department is working very closely with all stakeholders on the impact and implementation of this Bill.  While legislative provisions are important, they are of little benefit if they are not implemented.  We will work with all Departments and State agencies to ensure the implementation of these provisions.<br/><br/>Deputy Mattie McGrath raised the issue of the application of the provisions to family members.  There is no scope or possibility to derogate from the requirements or to exclude family members.  That is a crucial part of the Bill.  While we all believe our family members would not be involved in anything like this, it is an important aspect of this issue and one on which the State needs to be able to keep an eye.<br/><br/>In regard to virtual currencies, they are clearly an important and evolving area of activity.  The directive covers custodian wallet providers and services providing exchange between virtual and fiat currencies.  This is reflected in the Bill but it will be necessary to go further in due course.  Policing the conversion from fiat to virtual and <i>vice versa</i>will ultimately not be sufficient, as outlined in the latest Financial Action Task Force, FATF, recommendations.  The priority in respect of this Bill has been the transposition of the directive.  It may be possible to incorporate some of the current developments on virtual currencies into it.  If not, they will be implemented in the future.  This is a fast-moving area of law and a fast-changing area of criminal activity but we are determined to keep up with developments.<br/><br/>I thank Deputies for supporting the Bill and I look forward to working with them as it progresses through the Oireachtas.</p></speech>
