Perhaps she might be able to tell us a little about that report, what stage it is at and when it will be published.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300003#A00400"><p>I thank Deputy Kerrane for raising this issue.  In line with the commitment in the programme for Government , the Government established a child maintenance review group to examine certain issues in relation to child maintenance in Ireland.  The group's terms of reference were to consider and make recommendations on: the current treatment of child maintenance payments in my Department; the current provisions regarding liable relatives managed by my Department; and the establishment of a child maintenance agency in Ireland.  As part of its work, the group conducted a public consultation process.  Submissions were received from members of the public, as well as Members of the Oireachtas, NGOs and professional bodies.  The group also examined the international position where there are a variety of different approaches taken to these matters.</p>  <p>  The group's report was submitted to me in April.  I am giving the report the careful consideration that such an important and complex issue deserves.  Given that it relates to issues which are beyond the scope of the social welfare system, I am also consulting Government colleagues.  Once the report has been fully considered, my intention is to bring it to Government before the end of this year, at which time a decision regarding a publication date will be made.</p>  <p>  As lone parents continue to be a group with a high risk of poverty, I was pleased to provide a number of measures in budget 2023 which will be of benefit to them.  Recipients of one-parent family payment and jobseeker's transitional payment will be amongst those who receive a double weekly payment in October and a 100% Christmas bonus in December.  Lone parents will also receive a double payment of child benefit in November.  Approximately half of the people who receive the &euro;500 cost-of-living lump sum payment which will be made to recipients of the working family payment in November will be lone parents.</p>  <p>  I have also provided for a &euro;40 increase in the weekly income thresholds for the working family payment from January.  Lone parents will also benefit from the increase of &euro;12 in the weekly rate of working-age payments in January.  The rate of increase for a qualified child will increase to &euro;42 and &euro;50 per week in respect of a qualified child aged under or over 12, respectively.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300003#A00500"><p>As the Minister stated, lone-parent families are in deep poverty.  They show very high levels across the board, from at risk of poverty to risk of deprivation, living in deprivation and experiencing deprivation.  The consistent poverty rate remains far too high.  It is much higher than it should be in any case.</p>  <p>  The Minister will also know lone parent organisations, both One Family and Single Parents Acting for the Rights of Kids, SPARK, have voiced deep disappointment in respect of the budget.  Many of the measures the Minister outlined, including those relating to child benefit and the working family payment, are not specific to lone-parent families.  Aside from the weekly increase they, along with all other social welfare recipients, will receive from January, there was nothing targeted at them in the context of the level of poverty they experience.</p>  <p>  I am disappointed that the Minister has had the report since April, that we still have not seen it and that we will not now see it until perhaps the end of the year at the earliest.  Is there any chance for movement on that, particularly in view of the fact that the organisations are obviously waiting for this report?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300003#A00600"><p>Lone parents will get considerable support as part of the social welfare package that we announced only two weeks ago.  For example, a lone parent with two children will get two double payments of the one-parent family payment - that will be &euro;416 - before Christmas.  If they are a working family, they will get the &euro;500 working family payment.  They will get an extra &euro;280 on child benefit.  They will get a &euro;12 increase in the one-parent family payment from 1 January.  That is an extra &euro;624 over a full year.  That is an extra &euro;1,820 going into their pockets as a result of this budget.  Over a year, that works out as an extra &euro;35 per week.</p>  <p>  I am aware that Deputy Kerrane has a strong interest in this area regarding child maintenance review.  The Deputy has raised it with me on a number of occasions.  In fairness to the group, which was chaired by Judge Catherine Murphy, it took 18 months or so to look at this matter.  They went through all the issues in great detail and they invited submissions from all the stakeholders.  It is clear from their report that they gave a lot of consideration to all of the different issues.  There are many issues here, both in the social protection space and also in that relating to the Department of Justice.  The group looked at all of those issues and it gave them detailed consideration.  I have given the report detailed consideration over the past few months.  I will act on the report.  I want to do that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300003#A00700"><p>The report is done.  The Minister has had since April to consider it.  I believe that she will move on it.  I welcome that.  However, it would be good if we all, especially the organisations involved, could see the report because up until now - and certainly up until the group was established in 2020 - there has not been that sense of urgency around child maintenance and the establishment of a child maintenance service can only be positive.  When maintenance is paid, all evidence shows that it can play a role in lifting children in lone-parent families out of poverty.  That, in itself, should be enough to move swiftly in respect of this matter.  The latter is something that SPARK and One Family are seeking.  I mention One Family because it is celebrating 50 years in existence today.  I commend One Family and SPARK on the work they do.  However, like me, they are anxious to see this report.  Now that the report is complete and the good work has been done, it can only be of benefit that report be published sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

She is formidable.  She is a thorough lady.  That conversation has been useful to me.  I have spoken with my colleagues, the Ministers for Justice and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputies McEntee and O'Gorman, because there are issues at play in respect of both of their Departments.  I can say honestly that it is not my intention to delay this, but the Deputy will appreciate there are major issues involved.  I want to get it right.  That is most important.  I must also consult with my Government colleagues.</p>  <p>  I know the situation.  We talked about this previously.  There is nothing worse than somebody who should be paying maintenance paying a week, missing a week, paying another week and then missing five or six weeks.  It is a mess.  It is terrible for the person who is depending on that money.  I want to help here.  I want to see how we can improve it.  In fairness, it has been a busy couple of months between pensions, budgets, auto-enrolment and the cost of living, but I am dealing with it now.</p></speech>

There have been rumours and concerns floating around over the past couple of months.  The Minister might use this opportunity this morning to clarify the Government's position in that regard.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300003#A01100"><p>I thank Deputy Berry for raising this.  As Minister, I recognise and value the good work carried out by volunteers.  I have been clear to the Citizens Information Board that it is important that the voluntary ethos of the citizens information service should be protected and the skills of its volunteers should be utilised to the maximum extent possible.</p> <p>The Citizens Information Board, CIB, has publicly acknowledged the centrality of volunteers in delivering and supporting CIB-funded services and considers their continued contribution to be vital in ensuring the citizens information service remains an independent trusted source of information, advice and advocacy.  Having said this, it is also important to recognise and protect the statutory independence of the Citizens Information Board and the separation between it and the eight independent regional citizens information service companies that it funds and that operate the national network of citizen information centres on its behalf.</p> <p> Section 7(1) of the Comhairle Act charges the CIB with the provision of independent information, advice and advocacy services.  This is to ensure that individuals receive impartial advice and access to accurate and comprehensive information relating to social services.  This statutory independence is also to ensure that government cannot unduly influence the information or advice offered by CIB nor dictate how it should provide services.</p> <p> Similarly, each citizens information service company is a separate company in its own right.  These are the eight regional companies.  They are governed by a voluntary board of directors.  They are subject to meeting service standards set by the CIB.  These eight companies are responsible for decisions on the delivery of services in their own regions.  Any operational changes or decisions are, therefore, a matter for the Citizens Information Board and the independent boards.  As Minister I cannot direct them regarding operational decisions.</p></speech>

I agree entirely that it is an excellent service.  It is independent, valued and, crucially, it is accessible.  I use it myself.  I refer many constituents to the service and I presume every Deputy in the House does the same.  I have the Newbridge office on speed dial if I want to run something by it on a complex case.  I take the point on the importance of the autonomy of the service.  There was a press release about five weeks ago from the board in which it mentioned it would set up an independent review.  Do we know anything about this independent review?  Who is running it?  When will it be started and finished?  Does the Minister have any information to enlighten us?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300004#B00300"><p>I thank Deputy Berry.  I was just going to tell him about this but I ran out of time.  I met the chairperson and CEO of the CIB to seek further information.  Following the meeting the CIB initiated an independent review of its volunteer strategy.  This independent review will consult current and past volunteers and other important stakeholders.  It is expected that it will be concluded in the coming months.  Its recommendations will directly inform the CIB's new three-year strategy from 2023 to 2025.</p>  <p>  My background is in the credit union sector.  Nobody values the community and voluntary ethos more than I do.  This is why, on foot of concerns raised with me by Deputies, I met the CEO and the chair.  I recognise the good work carried out by the volunteers.  I have been very clear to the CIB that people who have given up their time through the years deserve to be treated with respect.  This is the very least they deserve.  Following my meeting with it, the EIB has confirmed the terms of reference for the independent review.  It will engage with internal and external stakeholders, including current and past volunteers.  I have also appointed a new member to the board of the CIB who is also a member of Volunteer Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1587" speakername="Cathal Berry" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300004#B00400"><p>That is good to hear.  I appreciate the update.  My view, which is shared by most Deputies, is that the citizens information service is excellent not in spite of the volunteers but because of them.  Many of them have a wealth of knowledge from their careers, be that in tax or social welfare.  They also have a crucial accessibility function.  I welcome the review and I look forward to reading its findings.  I recommend making the maximum use of this crucial cohort of volunteers as much as possible.  They are half-men and women and half-encyclopaedia.  They really have an encyclopaedic knowledge of the services and we should maintain, maximise and optimise their use.</p></speech>

The CIB has assured me the contribution of volunteers continues to be highly valued.  The role of the volunteer is still seen as central to the delivery of the service.  Volunteers have been returning on a phased basis since mid-2022.  The CIB advises me that to date 120 volunteers have returned to support the delivery of the citizens information centres throughout the country.  There are some volunteers who have not come back since Covid.  It is important that we make sure there are services for people.  The most important thing is that there is someone to answer their questions.  There are eight regional citizen information service companies.  They are all independent.  Some seem to be getting on with their work without any issue.  There seem to be problems with others.  The CIB is engaging with the eight regional companies on the continued return of volunteers.  I want to see this happen.  I will be keeping a close eye on this.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

These are very important in the midst of the cost-of-living crisis.  I presume demand will increase and I am sure the Department expects demand to increase further as we come into the winter period.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300004#B00800"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this.  Additional needs payments are intended to assist people with essential once-off exceptional expenditure that a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  In 2022 to the end of September almost 66,000 applications for additional needs payments were processed and awarded.  This is an increase of just under 60% on 2021 figures.  This rise in the number of applications reflects in part the positive measures the Department has implemented, including two major advertising campaigns to increase awareness of the payments.</p>  <p>  In the region of 63% of all applications are being finalised within four weeks.  As part of the decision process there is a need to verify household income and expenditure and assess whether the expenditure in respect of which the additional needs payment is requested is essential.  Where an application is complete and accompanied by the required documentation it is generally processed in a matter of days.  However, when an application is not finalised within this timeframe the delay is generally due to additional information or documentation being requested from the person to support the application.  It is important to note that where my officials are aware that a client has an urgent or immediate need every effort is made to ensure the person in question receives a prompt service, usually on the same day.</p>  <p>  The Department has taken a number of steps to increase service capacity, including the introduction of a national community welfare service freephone line.  This means clients do not have to attend an office in person to make a claim.  It has rostered staff to ensure there is a full-time community welfare officer present in all of our 50 offices nationwide.  It has established a back office support team to take on the more routine administrative tasks associated with claim processing.  This means front-line staff can be freed up and it allows community welfare officers to deal directly with customers and their claims.  In addition, the Department is well advanced on the development of an online claim option.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300004#B00900"><p>I am glad to hear the online option is been progressed.  This will be important.  It is something I have raised with the Minister previously.  It would be welcome because it may allow a person to ensure every bit of information is uploaded and provided before an application is submitted.  There would then not be an over and back between the Department and the applicant.  In September I was alarmed when I was advised that at that point 95% of applications were being processed within five to eight weeks.  That is far too long.  It is welcome to hear that 63% of applications are being processed within four weeks.  Obviously the times have improved and I welcome this but we are still looking at another 37% that are not processed within four weeks.  Four weeks is a long time to wait if people have a bill or need to replace something in their homes.</p>  <p>  I have raised with the Minister many times the issue of community welfare officers.  I understand they are in Intreo centres which can be a number of miles away from people living in rural areas.  Recently the local family resource centre raised with me the issue of domestic violence survivors.  People in these situations are very vulnerable with regard to getting to an Intreo centre and do not have the option of walking into a local service to see a community welfare officer as they were able to previously.</p></speech>

Only a few months ago, the Deputy asked me about the fall-off in these payments.  At that stage, she said we were not doing enough to promote the payments and that not enough people knew about.  It is sort of the opposite now.  The Deputy is telling me that too many people are applying and that we cannot keep up.  Just to be clear, I want people who need these payments to get them because that is what they are there for.  Earlier this year, I made a number of changes to try to simplify the process and make it easier for people.  We set up a national helpline phone number.  We developed new income guidelines aligned with those of the working family payment and put them on our website.  We got rid of the 30-hour rule and ran two major public awareness campaigns.  There were radio and social media adverts constantly airing to raise awareness and get the message out, which I am sure the Deputy heard.  That campaign and those changes have had the effect we wanted.  More people are aware of the payment and more are applying.  That is what we are here to do; we are here to help.</p></speech>

What I wanted to see was the ramping up of those supports to ensure that people knew they were there in order to access them.  Of course, if numbers were low earlier in the year, such as in February and March when they were between 4,000 or 5,000, there was concern.  The Department did all that work on advertising and campaigning.  That is what I wanted to see and that is welcome, but when ramping things up, demand will obviously increase, and we need to make sure people are not waiting up to 8 weeks for a payment, which they were in September.  People have waited two months.  Some 95% of applications in September were finalised between five to eight weeks.  That is my issue.  It is a fair issue to raise because if the Minister is encouraging people to apply for a payment, which I have asked her to do and I have no issue with, people must get that support in a timely manner.  These are supposed to be emergency payments and it is fair of me to raise this with her.  I put forward the idea of putting the process online not to complain about the fall-off, but to ensure people had every opportunity to access the support.</p>  <p>  A comprehensive review was undertaken in 2021 of all services and activities delivered by the Department's network of local offices, which came as news to me.  Will that review be published?</p></speech>

Where additional information is needed, we know it holds things up a bit.  It is taxpayers' money.  We just cannot throw it out there.  We must have some checks and balances.  If they were dragging their heels, you would not see the huge increase in awarded payments that we have seen.  If additional staffing resources are needed, my Department will not be found wanting.  During the pandemic, we moved staff around to meet demand when there are pressures in certain areas.  We have community welfare officers in 51 Intreo centres across the country.  They can talk to people over the phone, meet people in the local branch, and they can even arrange to meet people in their own home by appointment if that is needed.  As stated, we are looking at setting up the online system so people can apply directly for an additional needs payment.  In fairness to the staff and community welfare officers in the Department of Social Protection, they certainly did not let us down during the pandemic and they are not going to let us down now either, because they want to help people and that is what they are here for.</p></speech>

In line with the programme for Government commitment, the Government established a child maintenance review group to examine certain issues on child maintenance in Ireland.  The group's terms of reference were to consider and make recommendations on the current treatment of child maintenance payments in my Department; the current provisions regarding liable relatives managed by my Department; and the establishment of a child maintenance agency in Ireland.  As part of its work, the group conducted a public consultation process.  Submissions were received from members of the public, as well as Members of the Oireachtas, NGOs and professional bodies.  The group also examined the international position where there are a variety of different approaches taken to these matters.</p>  <p>  The group's report was submitted to me in April.  I am giving the report the careful consideration such an important and complex issue deserves.  Given that it relates to issues beyond the scope of the social welfare system, I am also consulting Government colleagues.  Once the report has been fully considered, I intend to bring it to Government before the end of this year, at which time a decision regarding a publication date will be made.</p>  <p>  As lone parents continue to be a group at a high risk of poverty, I was pleased to provide a number of measures in budget 2023 that will be of benefit to them.  Recipients of one-parent family payment and jobseeker's transitional payment will be among those who receive a double weekly-payment in October and a 100% Christmas bonus in December.  Lone parents will also receive a double payment of child benefit in November.  Approximately half the people who receive the &euro;500 cost-of-living lump sum payment, which will be made to recipients of the working family payment in November, will be lone parents.</p>  <p>  I have also provided a &euro;40 increase in the weekly income thresholds for the working family payment from January.  Lone parents will also benefit from the increase of &euro;12 in the weekly rate of working-age payments in January.  The rate for a qualified child will increase to &euro;42 and &euro;50 per week in respect of a qualified child aged under or over 12 years, respectively.  These rates will have increased by &euro;6 for under-12s and &euro;10 for over-12s in the past three budgets.</p></speech>

The Minister says the review will not be published until possibly the end of the year or maybe early next year.  Has she made provision within her Department's budget for the implementation of any recommendations that may come from that review?  Most lone parents were hoping recognition would have been given to the fact that the payment of maintenance payments can be erratic.</p>  <p>  The Economic and Social Research Institute, ERSI, and the Vincentians have said that when you strip out all the one-off payments, which are welcome and which no one will refuse, the social welfare rates are below inflation and people will find themselves struggling further next year even though money has been pumped into the system.</p></speech>

It concluded that this will substantially cushion real incomes across society  The ESRI has said it will make a difference and that what we have done in the budget will help households deal with the inflationary pressures.</p>  <p>  On the child maintenance review, I have met with and spoken to the chair and she has gone through the review in detail.  I found our conversation very useful.  I have spoken to my colleagues, the Ministers for Justice and Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, because there are issues relating to both of their Departments.  I will have further discussions with them in the coming days and will bring a report to Government in the next few weeks.</p></speech>

I again ask if she has  made provision in her budget from the point of view of the recommendations coming out of this review.  I do not know whether payments will be costed, whether a one-stop shop will be set up or whatever comes out of this review.</p>  <p>  I read an article that said once-off payments are welcome and have an impact but that the basic welfare rate has not kept up with inflation and this will have an impact on people with them having less money in March or April of next year.  The Vincentians also said in their report that lone parents with a child in primary or secondary will be short by &euro;78.59 in respect of the adequate levels of income next year.</p></speech>

We need to take things in their totality.  There is a lump sum and there are increases.  All of those taken together will clearly protect the most vulnerable households from inflationary pressures over the coming year.  We have to take the whole lot together.</p>  <p>  Deputy Kerrane also raised the issue of child maintenance reviews.  We want to make progress on this because most of the people who are affected by child maintenance, or the lack thereof, are women.  We know that.  I genuinely want to move this on.  There have been a lot of things in the past couple of months, such as pensions, budgets, auto-enrolment and the cost of living.  It is now my priority to deal with this issue.  I want to get it right.  We have examined models in other countries.  While on the surface something might appear to be the right solution, when one starts to dig in a bit there are things that might not work well here.  Ultimately, when a maintenance order has been made, if one parent is supposed to pay the other for the upkeep of the child, we want to make sure that the money gets to that parent every week.</p></speech>

On average, it takes 31 days to issue a PPS number following an application.  Some 90% of applications are processed within two months.  While the Department is working to reduce processing times, the time to process a PPS number has to be considered in the context of the increase in the number of applications for PPS numbers received so far in 2022, the care that must be taken to ensure PPS numbers are only issued to people who can properly validate their identity and the arrangements of the Department has in place to process PPS numbers in the case of emergency.</p>  <p>  Apart from the PPS numbers automatically allocated as a result of birth registration, my Department processed over 179,000 applications to the end of September this year, an increase of more than 130,000, or 170%, on the same period in 2021.  My Department has already allocated more PPS numbers in the first nine months of this year than were allocated in total last year.  Separate to the arrival of Ukrainian refugees, my Department has also seen an increase of over 40,000 applications from people arriving in Ireland to take up employment, reflecting the strong economic recovery as we exit the Covid pandemic.</p>  <p>  While the PPS number application process is relatively straightforward, delays can occur where incomplete applications are submitted or there are problems with the quality of the documents provided.  When this occurs, the applicant is contacted by my Department to help progress the application.  The Department has also established arrangements with other public bodies, employer groups and representative bodies to expedite applications in cases of urgency.  </p>  <p>  Given the significant increase in application volumes, the Department has trained additional staff on PPS number work and resources have been supplemented by overtime.  This reallocation of resources does, however, need to be managed, taking account of other work pressures including a recent increase in applications for additional needs payments.  As a result, my Department sought and received an increased staff allocation of 289 as part of the Estimates process and is already in the process of recruiting these staff.</p></speech>

I accept the difficulties that have been experienced by the Department over the past six or seven months, in particular in respect of the crisis in Ukraine.  I commend the workers in the Department who have been operating in very difficult circumstances.</p>  <p>  An Irish citizen who worked in the UAE came home to get a job.  We are asking people to come back and contribute to our society.  He is from the North and sought a PPS number on his return to Ireland.  He had to wait three months, even though he was told there was a six-week delay.  He was out of work for those three months as a result.  I appreciate that there are extreme difficulties in the Department and acknowledge that there has been extra overtime and that people are being trained.  I hope the delay will be resolved very soon.</p></speech>

An important message to send out today is that people who are applying should take their time.  If they rush the application and get it wrong, that can delay the process significantly.  People should take the time to scan the form carefully and fill it out in its entirety.  In terms of the additional documents and supporting information that need to go with an application, people should make sure they have ticked all the boxes and checklists because there are delays when people submit incomplete applications.  If an incomplete application is sent in, the Department will send the person an email.  Very often the email is not spotted.  I advise people to check their inboxes and other folders because there may be a notification from the Department that they need to revert to it with clearer or additional information.</p></speech>

I want to be absolutely clear that the Department continues to provide access to local community welfare officers in our public offices across the country and will continue to do so.  Community welfare staff also attend local clinics and are available to attend at other locations including the client's home, if necessary.  In addition, staffing levels have been maintained in the community welfare service nationwide in recent years, even during times when demands on the service decreased significantly.  This reflects my commitment to continue to support the delivery of locally based services to citizens.</p>  <p>  There are currently more than 400 staff working in the community welfare service throughout the country, with a permanent community welfare officer presence available at all times during working hours in over 50 of the Department's public offices.  These staff have processed and paid 66,000 additional needs payments to the end of September, an increase of about 60% on 2021 levels, as well as managing applications for other supplementary welfare allowance schemes.</p>  <p>  My Department has introduced a number of measures this year with the aim of increasing the capacity of the service and modernising and improving how it operates.  These include the introduction of a national community welfare service freephone line, meaning clients do not have to attend the office in person to make a claim, the rostering of staff to ensure there is a full-time community welfare officer present in over 50 offices nationwide and the establishment of a back-office support team to take on the more routine administrative tasks associated with claim processing, freeing up front-line community welfare officers to meet customers and process their claims.  In addition, the Department is well advanced in the development of an online claims option.  These changes mean that the community welfare service is in a stronger position than it would otherwise have been to respond to the significant 60% increase in service demand.  For example, 75% of calls to the national freephone line are dealt with and the claim decided without the client ever having to attend a public office.</p> <p>The Department is also taking steps to allocate additional staff to the community welfare service function having received an increased staffing allocation during the Estimates process.  I expect recruitment for these posts to begin shortly.  It is the Department's plan to allocate an additional 80 staff to this service.</p></speech>

I do not think anybody who has been in a constituency office of any party over the past while will not consider that as an absolute necessity.  What is the timeline?  I am not taking away from the considerable work that has been done by community welfare officers and those working in administration in the back office but, the fact is that there is a considerable backlog.  In fairness, some of that is down to our being in a cost-of-living crisis.  People are under severe pressure.  The advertising campaign that has been carried out has had a considerable impact.  We have dealt with a considerable number of people who have been putting in genuine claims.  I will be honest.  Occasionally one comes across people and one is fairly sure they should not be making these claims.  We generally try to deal with them at our office in order that they do not clog up the social protection offices.</p></speech>

I thank the community welfare officers and acknowledge the work done by them.  The ones I know are certainly going above and beyond in trying to meet the needs of people who are in a very desperate situation.  I welcome the measures that the Minister has outlined but I wish to know how long the recruitment process will be because I am concerned that might take weeks or even months.  What are the target times?  Will we be in a situation by Christmas in which the time is much reduced?  How quickly will the online system be up and running?  Will the Minister explain a bit more about people not having to go into the office?  It is not the easiest thing in the world for people to try to gather bank statements.  It can take quite a long time, especially for people who have literacy issues and are extremely marginalised.  My real concern is about how they can access this as smoothly and as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

These staff will be at all grades and will increase the capacity of the community welfare officers to focus on making decisions on complex applications and meeting with claimants locally, as required.  We have approval and it is going ahead.  A process has to be got through but resources will be increased in that area as quickly as possible.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has heard me say many times that this is the State safety net.  We want people to have access to this money but we want to put checks in place, which the Deputy can understand, because not every application will qualify.  Many applications are coming in.  We have made a number of changes to try to simplify the process and make it easier for people to access the additional needs payment and we have the national helpline phone number.  We also developed the new income guidelines aligned with those for the working family payment, which we put up on our website, while still ensuring that the local community welfare office has discretion.  We got rid of the 30-hour rule.  We also ran two major public awareness campaigns with radio adverts and much social media, which I know the Deputy has welcomed.</p>  <p>  The campaign has worked.  More people are aware that this available to help them out and there are more people applying for it.  We have approved more than 66,000 applications to the end of September.  That is a 60% increase on the same period last year.  There is a massive increase by any yardstick.  In fairness, the community welfare officers throughout the country are doing a great job to help people and we all know that.  They help people out when they need it.</p></speech>

What target times are we looking at for processing the claims?  We all get that considerable is being done and that is the reason more staff are being sought but Louth County Council informed us that it takes approximately six weeks for applications for white goods and floors.  That can hold up people on the housing list in moving on and create a difficulty when looking for those.  The properties that are being vacated should become available, because they're like hen's teeth at present with the housing crisis.  Anything that can be done should be done.</p></speech>

The message that needs to go out today is that people should not wait until the very last moment before contacting the community welfare officer.  They should also know that there will be some length of time to wait.  What I have been finding an awful lot, even before the most immediate pressures, is that people cannot afford to get to hospital appointments.  If one is in Mayo and one has to try to get transport to one's hospital appointment, there is no public transport.  That is a real need.  That can wipe out somebody's whole income for the week, if they are on a social welfare payment.  I ask for as much flexibility as possible around those payments in order that people can get to vital hospital appointments and get the money that they need.</p></speech>

The Deputy was right when she said that people should not wait until the last minute to go to the community welfare officer.  If they think there will be a problem, they should put in their application as to what it would be.  The average is four weeks but an urgent need will be dealt with straight away.</p>  <p>  I was at an event last week to celebrate 30 years of the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS.  I was talking to some of the MABS people who said that there is a good relationship between MABS and the community welfare officers.  When MABS said that it needs the help, it usually gets the payments straight away.  There are other ways to approach this as well and if some people who have particular difficulties are concerned, they should go to the local MABS office.</p>  <p>  Deputy Kerrane asked me about a review in 2021 and I wished to answer but I ran out of time.  As is the case with any large customer service organisation, the Department is constantly reviewing and refining its operational procedures and management structures.  As part of this ongoing process, the Department made some changes to how it organised the processing of the Intreo claims centre in 2021, to take account of remote working and blended working developments and to ensure that staff workloads could be balanced.  It also made some changes to management reporting lines.</p>  <p>  The review did not involve any changes to Intreo centre locations or services available to the public at Intreo centres.  As is normal practice, these changes were discussed with staff unions and have been in place since January 2022.  Ongoing regular reviews of internal structure and processes are normal in any operational environment.  These routine operational reviews do not involve any change to customer benefits or entitlements but represent normal business process change and refinement.  It is not the practice to publish internal reviews.</p></speech>

In addition to providing valuable occupational experience and training as a stepping-stone to employment for people who are unemployed, schemes such as CE also provide important, and in many cases essential, services to their local communities.</p>  <p>  Given the strong labour market performance the number of unemployed people dependent on social welfare payments continues to fall.  While this is very welcome it also means that the number of candidates available to CE schemes also falls.  This creates an obvious challenge.  Having said that, it is not an insurmountable one and working together with CE sponsors we can, and have, devised changes that will help the schemes to continue to support their local communities.</p>  <p>  For example, following engagement with scheme sponsors the Minister and I announced a number of reforms and enhancements to CE last December and again in June of this year.  These changes included a provision to allow CE participants who reach 60 years of age to remain on CE until they reach state pension age.  We also updated the baseline year for CE to enable other placements to be extended.  More recently, as part of budget 2023, we announced an increase of &euro;5 per week or just over 22% in the weekly CE allowance.  This increase is in addition to the increase in the core social welfare payments of &euro;12 per week and this means the minimum payment on CE will amount to &euro;247.50 per week.  This is the lowest rate of payment and people with children or other dependants receive additional payments and these are also increasing as part of our budget measures.  We also changed the candidate referral process.  Schemes have been given new flexibility to allow them directly to recruit eligible candidates to fill 30% of places but are also mandated to accept and place at least 60% of people referred by Intreo.  This is to ensure that places do not go unfilled when there are candidates available from the live register.  Schemes have also been granted flexibility to extend individual placements and to retain existing participants in cases where no replacement is immediately available.</p></speech>

CE schemes are designed to help those in long-term unemployment, who are disadvantaged or who find it impossible to get mainstream work to have a job in their local communities.  They provide childcare help, elderly care and drug rehabilitation services.  The &euro;5 extra for CE scheme workers in the budget was a modest increase and as a result it is difficult to find people to participate in the scheme.  I have raised this both in the D&aacute;il and at my party's recent think-in, held in Mullingar.  These programmes not only benefit participants but also the community by providing essential services.  However, the scheme does not pay enough for providing such great work within the community.  I can only say it is not fit for purpose.  I advocate for this to be changed.  Fianna F&aacute;il has always been a strong supporter and advocate of CE schemes and one of the first ones started in my own area.  However, the &euro;5 increase in the budget was absolutely unacceptable.</p></speech>

It has been a while since there was an increase in the top-up for CE.  While we would all like to have more than &euro;5 going on it that is what we got this year.  We all would have preferred more.</p>  <p>  I disagree vehemently with the assertion that CE is not fit for purpose.  It is one of the most impactful and useful schemes for both individuals and communities across the country.  Of all the schemes the Government supports, it is one of the best.  It manages to perform two important functions.  It gives people who are quite far from the labour market another option in life and opens up pathways to people who would not otherwise have a way into that market.  At the same time, it provides, as the Deputy has acknowledged, essential and important community services.  On the fundamentals of CE, it is one of the best schemes we have.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge there are issues with it.  I acknowledge we are having difficulties getting participants onto it.  I would like to see better supports for CE participants in the future as well.</p></speech>

We can look at the rural social scheme and the eligibility for T&uacute;s being extended to persons in receipt of disability payments.  There is the new flexibility to allow CE schemes to recruit eligible candidates directly to fill 30% of places.  However, we must be practical.  The reason communities cannot get people on CE schemes is because CE does not pay them, first of all.  If you have to travel 15 or 20 miles to where that scheme is you are losing money, though I do not even know that it is about losing money.  I am not saying the scheme is not a great one, because it is.  However, why are people not participating in it?  Why are they not getting more money?  The reason is it just does not work out for them.  They are doing this extra work that they love.  I compliment everyone involved in the scheme.  I know so many in my own community who do so much work.</p></speech>

I agree with the Minister of State that we would all like to see more money being made available for the participants.  I have two questions for him.  Has any consideration been given to facilitating those who are at pension age also carrying on with the scheme?  Many people over 66 years would like to and are able to but cannot.  Is extra emphasis being put on encouraging people with refugee status to get on the courses?  Due to the great work the Government has done we are approaching full employment and that is why it is difficult to get participants for these schemes in many areas.</p></speech>

It can be everything from drug addiction services right through to many pieces of work in the community.  We need to review CE with a view to strengthening it.  I welcome what has been said previously.  We need to look at the pension age question Deputy Stanton has raised.  Beyond that, for us to make this entirely sustainable we need to deal with the issue of CE supervisors' pay and conditions.  We all know that is an ongoing issue and we need a whole-of-Government response to deal with that.</p></speech>

We are being very practical about CE.  There was a review published at the end of last year but we are not stopping at that.  We are trying to increase the flow in, to retain the people we have and to stop the flow out as well.  We have taken policy measures in each of those three areas.  As for broadening the pool of people, plans are at an advanced stage for a new pilot scheme to extend CE eligibility to people who are qualified adults on a jobseeker claim.</p>  <p>  On the pension age question, we are looking at everything we can to broaden the pool and retain people but that is one of the suggestions we are slower to consider, to be honest.  The qualifying age for refugees is I think 18 years so there are broader qualifying criteria for them as well.  In short, we are looking at everything we can to broaden the pool and get more people in as well as stemming the flow out.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the CE supervisors question.  My officials had exploratory meetings with union reps in September.  There is an agreement to have another meeting in the near future as well.</p></speech>

Is this something the Minister has considered?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.82" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="09:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300008#F01700"><p>I propose to take Question Nos. 8, 29, 46 and 89 together as they all relate to the same thing.  Child benefit is a universal monthly payment made to families with children up to the age of 16 years.  The payment continues to be paid in respect of children who are in full-time education until their 18th birthday, whether that is post-primary, post leaving certificate or third level.  Payment up to age 18 years is also made in respect of children who have a disability.  Estimated expenditure on the scheme will be approximately &euro;2.1 billion in 2022.</p>  <p>  In budget 2023 I secured a significant social welfare package of over &euro;2.1 billion.  As part of that, one of my priorities was to provide support for families and children.  People who are in receipt of child benefit will receive a cost-of-living double payment on 1 November 2022 and that will be made to approximately 638,000 families in respect of over 1.2 million children at an estimated cost of &euro;170.4 million.</p> <p>Although the current arrangements for extending child benefit to the age of 18 were primarily intended to cover situations where a child is in full-time post-primary education, they are not limited in this way but are available for children aged up to 18 in full-time education, including those in third level education.  The suggestion to extend the age limit, but in so doing exclude those in further or higher education from what is generally a universal payment, may therefore presents difficulties.  In addition, the cost consequences of any such extension would need to be considered.</p> <p> Separately, I emphasise that for those on social welfare payments, an increase for a qualified child will be paid up to the age of 22 or up to the end of the academic year in which he or she reaches 22.  This approach ensures targeted assistance that is directly linked to household income and thereby supports low-income families with older children participating in full-time education.</p> <p> Families on low incomes may be able to avail of a number of social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including the increase for a qualified child, primary social welfare payments, the working family payment for low-paid employees with children, and the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.  These schemes provide targeted assistance that is directly linked to household income and thereby support low-income families with older children participating in full-time education.  In addition, there are budget measures specifically for families with children, such as the double child benefit payment and the &euro;500 lump sum payment to recipients of the working family payment.  Low-income families will also benefit from other budget measures, such as the &euro;12 increase in the weekly personal rate for recipients of the working age payment.</p> <p> In July, the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance was increased by &euro;100 for each eligible child under the scheme.  This year, the amount paid for each qualified child aged four to 11 years is &euro;260.  The rate payable for each eligible child aged 12 and over is &euro;385.  Approximately 151,000 families, with more than 262,000 children, have benefited from this measure.  Budget 2023 also provides a &euro;40 weekly increase in the working family payment income limits for families of all sizes from January, at a cost of approximately &euro;16.8 million in 2023.  I have also provided for a &euro;500 lump sum payment to all families in receipt of the payment in November 2022, at an estimated cost of &euro;23 million.  I have provided for a &euro;2 increase in the qualified child payment to &euro;42 per week for children aged under 12 and by &euro;2 to &euro;50 per week for children over 12.  These increases will take effect from January at an estimated cost of &euro;30.4 million.</p> <p> Child benefit delivers a standard rate of &euro;140 a month for each child in a family.  Similarly, the targeted payments mentioned above are paid in respect of each qualifying child.  The income limit associated with the working family payment increases with increasing family size.  In the case of twins, child benefit is paid at 1.5 times the normal monthly rate for each child.  For triplets and other multiple births, child benefit is paid at double the normal monthly rate for each child.</p> <p> There are many supports in the budget for families and children, including the double payment of child benefit in November; the autumn cost-of-living double payment paid to recipients of a range of schemes in October, including one-parent family payment and jobseeker's transitional payment recipients; the Christmas bonus double payment to recipients of a range of schemes, including the one-parent family payment; the &euro;500 cost-of-living lump sum payment to all families in receipt of the working family payment; and a &euro;400 lump sum payment to all fuel allowance recipients.  There is much in this, which is not to mention what the Minister, Deputy Harris, announced in his package.</p></speech>

People are grateful for them and they have gone down positively in my community.  I thank her for that level of investment.  It was interesting to hear the Minister talk about 16 years of age being the cut-off point for child benefit, with an extension once people are still in full-time education.  Was 16 years of age set at a time when many people chose to leave school at 16?  I started college at 17.  I was part of a generation from which many went to college.  Now, people are often 18 or 19 when they go to college.  Transition year is done much more frequently or people may have started school when they were five or six, so they may now be in full-time post-primary education at 18.  There is a gap where we are not supporting parents through that transition.  If people then go to college, they may be entitled to the Student Universal Support Ireland grant.  There are probably only six months in which those children and young people who are 18 are not getting that child benefit.  Could that be looked at, costed or modelled with a view to exploring the idea?</p></speech>

I lend my support to Deputy Higgins's proposal, which I think is merited.  While I note the significant range of measures that the Minister has announced in this budget and the information that she has provided to the House, there is a gap.  It is a small gap which affects less than half of leaving certificate students and their families, but it should be borne in mind.  As Deputy Higgins said, this scheme was probably designed when fourth year was not done in all schools and children perhaps started school a little earlier.  I highlight the welcome support for 1.2 million children whose parents will receive a double payment.  The Minister is talking about an expansionary budget in her Department which will benefit more than 639,000 families in just one area and it should be welcomed, particularly with the backdrop of the cost-of-living crisis.</p></speech>

There is a wide range of positive supports.  When people reach 16, they need to confirm that they are in full-time education to be eligible.  Clearly, full-time secondary school education is the threshold to be eligible.  They continue to be in that situation, with the same costs, throughout the leaving certificate cycle, whether they are 16, 17, 18 or even 19.  They are similar costs and will not differ.  Many do not have the opportunity to work and would be so focused on the leaving certificate that they would not want to be earning or in employment.  Has the Minister looked at the number of people who would just have turned 18 or are almost 19 who are still in the leaving certificate cycle?  What costs would be involved in supporting them?  It would be a practical measure to support families.  Household costs have not really changed throughout.</p></speech>

For those people who are in receipt of social welfare payments, an increase for a qualified child will be paid up to the age of 22 or until the end of the academic year in which they reach 22.  This approach ensures targeted assistance that is directly linked to household income and thereby supports low-income families with older children participating in full-time education.  I take the Deputies' points.  Keeping a child in full-time education is expensive.  Budgets are also about choices.  We are providing &euro;2.2 billion in supports, between the various lump-sum payments and the changes which will take effect from January.  It represents the largest social protection budget in the history of the State, but even with that, we cannot do everything that we want to.  There are other things that we would like to do, but at the end of the day, the Government has to cut its cloth to measure.  I prioritised the double payment of child benefit in the budget, which will support 639,000 families with 1.2 million children.  That measure alone will cost &euro;170 million, which demonstrates the scale of the calls for any changes to child benefit.  I hear the point about somebody who is older than 18 and still in full-time second level education.</p> <p>However, if we expanded the child benefits currently in place it would have cost implications into the future.  In budget 2023 it was decided to target low-income families on a long-term basis through providing for the increases in the personal rates of payment and increases for the qualified child as well as increases in the working family payment income threshold.  The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, announced a comprehensive package in the budget to reduce the cost of third level education.  The income limit for the student contribution 50% grant has been increased to &euro;62,000 and student maintenance grants will increase in January.  There is a &euro;30 million increase in funding to increase capacity for apprenticeships in 2023.  When these changes are seen in the round there is a good deal of support to help both working families and those who are not in receipt of social welfare payments.  However my job as Minister for Social Protection is to target those who are least well off in our society.  Looking at the whole package that we put together it is a very comprehensive budget package.</p></speech>

This really was a cost-of-living budget.  It was about targeting help towards people who most need it and also providing universal assistance.  Every family throughout the country is struggling with the increase in the cost of living.  It was good to hear the Minister talk about those low-income families who received the targeted support of the qualified child payment up to the age of 23 while in full-time education.  A universal support measure could be to assist people during those few months when they may have an 18-year-old still in second level education.  In particular I am thinking of the squeezed middle which would benefit from that.  Will the Minister undertake some level of costings to see whether this may be possible to include in next year&rsquo;s budget?</p></speech>

I agree with the Minister on it.  Not every household is on social welfare.  There are those that are just beyond the threshold.  They also feel the burden of costs.  Choices must be made.  You have to cut your cloth according to measure but to do that you must measure.  Has the Minister measured how many people would be involved if this support was made available?  Has she examined what the cost would be?  It is hugely important.  One cannot make an informed decision without having the figures available.  We are really looking at a small number of people.  Has the Minister actually measured that and put a figure on it?  It would support many households where people have just turned 18 years of age and who have not yet done the leaving certificate.</p></speech>

If they are over 18 years of and are still in second level education, it would be hard to find the data and it could take some time.  I am not sure where we would obtain it because people themselves have to declare that their children are still in full-time education at the age of 16.  I am always willing to look at other ways in which we can help people so I would say to each of the Deputies that I am of course happy to look at these things.  I continue to look at different ways in which we can improve the supports we give to people.  I am conscious that there are people who receive no support other than the child benefit support.  That is why in this budget the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, included the 25% reduction in childcare costs.  A single person on &euro;40,000 will be &euro;800 better off per year as a result of the income tax changes while a couple will be &euro;1,600 better off following the budget changes.  Next September there will be free schoolbooks in primary school.  There is free transport at the moment.  There is a good deal in this budget to support working families.  That is a positive thing.  I continue to review all the schemes we have to see whether we can make them better.  Each year there are more and more welcome changes and I will continue to do that.  To answer the Deputies who have raised this issue with me, I will look at it, and I thank them for raising it.</p></speech>

This is the largest social protection package in the history of the State.  Recognising that the autumn and winter period is the most expensive time of the year for many households, rather than waiting until the new year, &euro;1.1 billion of this package has been targeted to provide for a wide range of lump-sum payments which will be paid out in the coming months.  These payments are in addition to a wide range of increases that will come into effect from January.  My Department is currently putting in place the necessary IT systems and administrative processes to administer the various lump-sum payments.  The cost-of-living supports recently announced will be paid on the following dates: the autumn cost-of-living double-week payment to most weekly social protection schemes will be paid during the week commencing 17 October 2023.  That is next week.  The double payment of child benefit to support families with children will be paid alongside the regular child benefit that is due to be paid on 1 November.  Families who receive child benefit will get a double payment on 1 November.  </p>  <p>  The following cost-of-living measures will be paid during the week commencing 14 November.  There will be a &euro;400 lump-sum fuel allowance payment to all households receiving the fuel allowance; a &euro;200 lump-sum payment for pensioners and people with a disability receiving the living alone allowance; a &euro;500 lump-sum payment to all families in receipt of the working family payment and a &euro;500 lump-sum payment to those on disability allowance, blind pension and invalidity pension; and a &euro;500 lump-sum payment will be paid to those in receipt of the carer&rsquo;s support grant during the week commencing 21 November 2022.  In addition a 100% Christmas bonus will be paid to long-term social welfare recipients during the week beginning 5 December 2022.</p>  <p>  In addition to these measures in 2022 I announced a series of measures as part of budget 2023 which take effect in January.  These include a &euro;12 increase which will be provided on weekly payments with additional increases to those people with qualified adults; an increase in the income thresholds on working family payment by &euro;40 across the board.  This will benefit working families on the payment by up to &euro;24 per week.  </p>  <p>  There is a significant increase in the income threshold for people over 70.  From 1 January 2023 it will be &euro;500 for a single person and &euro;1,000 for a couple.  That means a single person can earn up to &euro;500 a week and a couple can earn &euro;1,000 per week.  In addition I am improving the standard fuel allowance means test for the scheme, for those under 70, by raising the means limit from &euro;120 to &euro;200 above the contributory pension rate.  This means people will be able to earn &euro;200 above the contributory pension rate from 1 January 2023 and it will not be taken into account when assessing the fuel allowance. </p> <p>This is something that has been brought up with me during the year and I changed it.  That is an improvement.</p> <p> I am raising the qualified child payment rate for children under 12 by &euro;2, raising it to &euro;42, and by &euro;2 for children over 12 as well, bringing that rate up to &euro;50 per week.  Over the past three budgets, we have now increased the under-12 rate by &euro;6 and over-12 rate by &euro;10.</p> <p> I also announced that we will amend these rules so parents can qualify for domiciliary care allowance when babies do not leave hospital but would otherwise have qualified for the payments.  There was a situation where the child had to be at home before people could qualify for the domiciliary care allowance.  For some people, having a child in hospital is a very difficult time and there is a lot of extra expense.  Even if the child has never been able to come home, unfortunately, we will let them qualify for the domiciliary care allowance.</p> <p> I am increasing the rate of payment for the domiciliary care allowance, which is monthly, from &euro;309.50 to &euro;330.  I am also increasing the earnings disregard on disability allowance to &euro;165 per week to allow those people with disabilities who can work to earn more and retain their social welfare payment.  That is a very important measure because there are some people for whom it might be helpful to work part time.  This is means they can still keep their payment and do some work.  I would encourage them to look at that if they can.  </p> <p> The Government also announced a range of other measures to support households throughout the winter period, in particular three further energy credits, totalling &euro;600, which will be paid to all households, with the first of these being paid before the end of the year.</p></speech>

It has been an absolutely historic budget.  As the Minister said, it has been the largest ever package to get money back into people&rsquo;s pockets.  That has been welcomed by an awful lot of people.  The Minister has done a great job of supporting people on low incomes who need help, support and intervention the most.  She has also catered for the squeezed middle who were once considered to have decent jobs and wages and are now finding that they are struggling to make ends meet.  This budget and the welfare announcements that the Minister made in respect of the &euro;2.1 billion achieve that.</p>  <p>  A couple of constituents have been in touch with me about getting letters now asking for a review of their circumstances before they receive any payments.  This might be something that happens every couple of years, I am not sure.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify if it is in relation to this in particular.</p>  <p>  I also wish to acknowledge the changes the Minister made around the fuel allowance eligibility criteria with the half-rate for carers and the disability payments not being taken into account for the means test.  Those are issues I raised with the Minister in this Chamber and it fantastic to see her taking on board so much of the feedback she gets here and making it happen.  That is what changes people&rsquo;s circumstances at home.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.103" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1515" speakername="David Stanton" time="10:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300011#J00300"><p>The Minister did well on the budget.  What she did will make a huge difference to many people.</p>  <p>  I have two points.  First, is the Minister doing anything to ensure that people know what they are entitled to with the changes that have come in?  Some of the changes are quite complicated, people may have to apply and may not know that.  Are there information leaflets being given out to people or whatever?</p>  <p>  Second, it strikes me that many people will be getting a lot of cash.  Will the Minister ensure that people will be made aware that they can lodge to their bank account through the post office rather than carrying a lot of cash home?  It is one thing that strikes me.  It is great to see people getting all this money, but if they have it in cash, especially older people, vulnerable people or people with disabilities, it can lead them being vulnerable to robbery and so forth.  Perhaps they can lodge it at the post office or in their bank account through the post office.  Some people do not realise that they can do that and will travel to the bank, which may be far away, not knowing they can do it through the post office.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.104" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="10:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300011#J00400"><p>On the issue of cash, for those who will collect it in their post office, I would tell them to lodge it in their bank account or go to their credit union and put it in there.  The credit union is the place to put it.  They can take it out when they need it.  It is the best way they can manage it.  I know from working in a credit union that many a person got extra money and the sensible people went in, put in the credit union and took it out when they needed it.  Most credit unions have ATMs as well.  That is where they should go with it.</p>  <p>  On the means test, the Deputy is right that I do listen here.  There are a load of things raised with me during the year, so I was glad I was about to take some of those views on board from across the House and make the difference.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy talked about the review.  There are continual reviews always taking place.  We review payments because people&rsquo;s circumstances change and we need to have the up-to-date information.  We have limited resources and we want to target them at those most in need.  If people&rsquo;s circumstances change and they win the lotto, they need to make social protection aware of the changed circumstances.  There are reviews ongoing all the time.  That is part of our control measures as well - to make sure that when people are receiving the allowances, they are entitled to them and need them.  That is part of social welfare and it is important that we carry out those checks and balances.</p></speech>

As I said, a constituent of mine has been in touch on this.  She is working two seasonal part-time jobs and she is a lone parent.  In situations such as hers and in all situations, we absolutely have to have control measures and means-testing.  However, I hope that our means test will not be mean enough to discourage people from going out, working and bettering their lives and circumstances.</p>  <p>  I thank the Minister for all that she has done.  The increased payments and lump sums will be very welcome this winter.  I agree with Deputy Stanton when it comes to information campaigns.  I would love to know how we are reaching out to people who may not have been eligible for the likes of fuel allowance who are likely now to become eligible to make sure that they are getting the information that the entitlement changed and they should apply for it.  I am doing much work with my senior citizens groups in Lucan and Clondalkin to make sure that word gets out there.  I would love to get an update on what the Department is doing nationwide.</p></speech>

On the expanded fuel allowance, we hope to target an additional 81,000 homes with the changes to the means test for the over-70s.  Just in case people are wondering, we have to change our systems to do that and we are putting together an application form, which we hope to have ready at the end of the year or early next year.  However, they will get it from 1 January.  If they do not get the money immediately, it will backdated to 1 January.</p>  <p>  We are doing everything we can.  The staff in social protection have done tremendous work over the past number of years.  We had the pandemic and now the cost-of-living crisis.  There are many payments that we need to get out before the end of the year.  We want to do them in a way that people get them and there are no hiccups.  We have to be careful that our IT systems and programmes are written properly so that they are secure and safe.  It is a process that needs attention.  </p>  <p>We will inform people.

This supports both pensioners and those of working age and includes a proportionate increase for qualified adults.  This is the largest social welfare package in the history of the State.</p>  <p>  The rate increase is accompanied by a wide range of additional measures and lump sum payments this year to social welfare customers.  Taken together, for many household types, the combination effectively matches or exceeds inflation.</p> <p>For example, a pensioner living alone will receive more than &euro;1,600 in additional payments and energy credits in the next 12 months compared with the 12 months that have just passed.  That is equivalent to an increase of approximately &euro;31 per week.  To take another example, a person with a disability living alone will benefit by approximately &euro;1,850, an increase of approximately 14%, which is worth &euro;36 per week.  In general, most welfare recipients, taking into account the one-off measures, energy credits and underlying rate increase, will be better off by approximately 10% in the next 12 months compared with the 12 months just passed.  Year on year, they are better off by 10%.</p> <p> Combining one-off measures with underlying rate increases is a prudent targeted approach.  In its post-budget analysis, the ESRI stated that welfare increases in 2022 and 2023, together with one-off measures, are large enough to leave the lowest-income households better off, on average, than they would have been had welfare payments risen in line with inflation this year and next.  I am satisfied that the total social welfare budget package for 2023 has been designed to protect the most vulnerable in society.  As we have done to date, the Government will continue to monitor the situation closely and will respond again when necessary.</p></speech>

We need and should be moving towards providing certainty to social welfare recipients to go to the MESL.</p></speech>

For example, the latest MESL annual update shows the differences in the cost of meeting household needs in urban and rural areas.  For a start, differentiating social welfare payment rates based on location would be problematic.  For these reasons, while not used for benchmarking, the work of the Vincentian MESL Research Centre at the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, and previously the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, has been and will continue to be a valuable input into the policy-making process.  We have taken on board a good number of its recommendations.</p></speech>

Unusually for a community facility, it is located in two private houses that it rents.  The property was converted some years ago, so it is purpose-built in that sense.  It is unusual, however, in terms of the rent that the provider is paying, unlike many other community facilities.  It has an overspill into a local GAA club at the moment to try to provide an afterschool service.  I will expand on this in the next round.</p></reply>

Although the scheme has only been in place since 15 September, initial analysis shows there has been a significant growth in capacity, with particular capacity growth for cohorts where it is needed, such as baby rooms and toddler rooms.  To meet the cost of this capacity growth, I recently announced that the original allocation of core funding will be increased to &euro;259 million for year 1 of the scheme.  In addition, the full value of the core funding will be increased by &euro;28 million, to &euro;287 million, in year 2 of the scheme.  Funding earmarked for the scheme in year 2 will be informed by the emerging data from year 1 and may focus on promoting further capacity expansion.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department secured &euro;70 million under the revised national development plan for the building blocks capital programme, which is being designed to meet current and long-term early learning and childcare infrastructure needs.  This programme has three pillars.  The first is a &euro;10 million modernisation grant to improve energy efficiency standards while also supporting the continuous improvement of the physical environment of services. The second pillar, which is probably the major one, is a &euro;45 million capacity grant to address capacity gaps to fund an expansion in existing services and invest in the development of new services where most needed.  Finally, there is a &euro;15 million innovation grant to pilot a range of innovative initiatives such as outdoor early learning and childcare services.  Pillar 1, the modernisation grant, will open for applications later this year.  Pillars 2 and 3 will be open for applications from next year on.</p>  <p>  As regards the Village Childcare and Community Services in particular, if it wishes to undertake modernisation of its buildings, it can seek a modernisation grant under the scheme which will be open from this year.  The more substantial capacity expansion funding will be available from next year to it and all other services.  </p></speech>

The modernisation grant would be fine but, at the same time, it is sort of like when one is renting a house - one is putting work into something one will never own.  I am interested in the second pillar, however, comprising &euro;45 million in funding.  That might be relevant to the provider.  Will that funding be available from 2023?  How does a provider go about accessing it?  It is often the case when people come to a Deputy regarding a wish to expand or open a facility that one does not know where to start or to whom the person should speak.  The service in question is already operating under the community model and does incredible work.  It has expanded onto the grounds of the local GAA club - in fairness to James Stephens GAA Club, it has give the provider the use of its facilities - because it had around 100 kids waiting for a place in afterschool care.  It was able to facilitate a significant number of those kids because of the expansion.  It collects the children from school.  It is a unique and valuable service and it is really valuable.  The crux of my question is whether there is a way for it to apply for funding to get a vacant building?</p></speech>

The best thing the provider could do is to engage with the Kilkenny County Childcare Committee with regard to making an application under that scheme.  I understand what the Deputy is saying.  Many community providers do not own their facility.  Many community facilities are located in rented accommodation.  I certainly will bear that in mind in designing the scheme for the capacity expansion grant, which is the larger grant scheme.  I hope to open that later next year and funding will be then available.  Previously, the Department had not done significant capital investment.  It had a couple of million each year but now we have far more in the national development plan, NDP, which is positive, and we have to build up our capacity to get that money out to services.  We will be getting many applications in, judging which are the best applications and targeting, particularly to the areas where we need expanded capacity.</p></speech>

That is invaluable for parents.  I often wish I could have availed of that service at times.  One never knows at what time one will be leaving the D&aacute;il, however, so it is definitely not going to be suitable for me.  It is such a great service that it offers for people.  It is brilliant for the kids as well because there are lots of activities, as well as a bit of help with homework, and food is provided.  It is ticking all the boxes.</p>  <p>  I note the Minister stated that the scheme will be available from late 2023, possibly into 2024.  Will it realistically be a scheme to which people can apply to purchase a building or is it more aimed at upgrading works?  I am trying to find out because the provider has two houses at the moment and operates from the grounds of a GAA club and has such a level of demand that it could provide services for far more children if it had the space to do so.  Can it apply to the scheme for funding to get a vacant building?  Is that the right fund for the provider?</p></speech>

We are still working on the criteria for it but it is certainly my desire that we want and need new capacity and we want services to expand.</p>  <p>  It is interesting that the core funding that we brought in has already started to deliver expanded capacity and our focus in our debates here was very much about better wages for staff but it is also about increasing the capacity.  I will be answering a couple of questions later on during which I will address that issue.</p>  <p>  One more point on the capacity issue is in respect of the planning laws where we need to make planning regulations which are linked so that when 75 units of housing are built, a childcare facility is built.  That is there at the moment but it is not delivering in many places.  I have been engaging with local authorities to try to get the on-the-ground experience and we will also be engaging with housing to tighten up those regulations so that they deliver.</p></speech>

This marked an important milestone in the process to strengthen the rights of people with disabilities in Ireland and has gathered momentum since Ireland became a signatory to the convention in 2007.  Ireland&rsquo;s approach to meeting the obligations of the UNCRPD is one of continuous advancements each year moving forward on key reforms to strengthen consistently and uphold obligations and the rights arising from the convention.  I recognise the importance of the optional protocol to the UNCRPD.  As the Deputies will be aware, the optional protocol is an international treaty which establishes procedures on the strengthening of the implementation and monitoring of the convention.  Ratification of the optional protocol is a commitment in the programme for Government and the timeline for ratification was intended to follow the conclusion of the State&rsquo;s first review period before the UN committee.  Due to the delays at UN level, I understand that Ireland&rsquo;s appearance before the UN committee will now be delayed possibly for some time.  In light of this, both the senior Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, and myself have indicated that we are open to earlier ratification, contingent on the State being in a position to meet its obligations thereunder.  This reflects the State&rsquo;s longstanding approach to entering into binding international obligations in good faith and at a point where the State is in a position to meet its obligations.  </p>  <p>  As Minister of State with responsibility for disability, I want to ensure that we are in a position to uphold all of our commitments under the UNCRPD once the optional protocol is ratified.  In that regard, the commencement of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 is required before ratification can occur and for closer alignment with the convention.  It is intended that the important legal reform will be in place once the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill is passed into law.  This Bill has completed Committee Stage and we look forward to working with all Members to pass this legislation as expeditiously as possible.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the passage of the Bill, my Department is in the process of scoping what other requirements there might be before ratification can occur.  If any further requirements for ratification are identified, these will be addressed as a matter of priority.</p>  <p>  Addressing Deputy Smith directly, the basis of her question is on the scoping that is going on, which is to ensure that all Departments are in a position to ensure that the optional protocol can be enacted as quickly as possible.  This is why the scoping is going on at the moment.</p></speech>

I do not know what the Minister of State&rsquo;s view is on this and I am aware that she was not the Minister of State back in 2015 when the UN treaty was ratified, but I find it extraordinary that after seven years, we are still at the point of scoping and of looking at what else needs to be done.  If the Minister of State finds it extraordinary or unacceptable, please say so.  She is the Minister of State for the Department and if she does not say so, we are going to assume that she thinks that this is okay.</p>  <p>  Somebody, for example, who was perhaps seven years of age in 2015, is now 14 and suffers from severe disabilities and is not getting the attention that he or she needs from the State and does not have the right to go outside of the State to make a complaint.  That is what a member of the UN committee on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said.  I mentioned this the other night in my contribution on the rights of people with disabilities.  Mr. Markus Schefer said at the Joint Committee on Disability Matters here that not ratifying the optional protocol has the optics that the Government does not really have confidence in its own system.  The Minister of State has more or less said that now in a different way.  Mr. Schefer maintained and told the Oireachtas Committee on Disability Matters in 2021 that the Government needs to move on and ratify the protocol.  He did not say that the delay was with the UN.  I do not understand why the Government is putting this delay back on the UN committee.</p></speech>

The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act and the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill are very good examples of why we are doing this.  This Act was passed in 2015.  I was not here at that time but I still do not understand why that Act was not implemented and in the seven years since, wardship, which is entirely in breach of the principles of the UNCRPD, has continued to exist and people have continued to be wards of court.  We know that if we signed up to the UN optional protocol, we would be immediately found in breach of the convention because wardship is so against the UNCRPD, so we are working to resolve the breaches in those key pieces of legislation, where we are in breach.</p>  <p>  That is why we have been working very hard to get the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill through.  It is going on Report Stage in the Seanad now.  Remember, by doing that, we are actually making lives better for people with disabilities.  Because we are looking to get ourselves into compliance, something like wardship is finally going to be abolished.</p></speech>

One of the issues which came from that meeting and continues to come from many of the meetings we have in this committee is that people talk about doing something into the future, or that there is a pipeline of things to be done.  As somebody said this morning, that pipeline seems to get diverted and it seems to go into the ether.  The feeling is that we are not implementing the optional protocol on the basis that the services that we are delivering are not fit for purpose for the particular protocol and that we have to get our ducks in line first before we do that.  From what I heard this morning, I also understand there is a pull between mental health and disabilities in respect of funding and as to who is responsible for what.  At the end of the day we have 1,300 people plus living in long-term residential care under 65 years of age who should not be there.</p>  <p>  We have other issues such as wardship, as the Minister mentioned.  I understand that legislation and things have to be teed up but it is taking a hell of a long time.  People are getting frustrated and believe that perhaps the Government is hiding behind this legislation that is not in place.  Could we get reassurance on that point, please?</p></speech>

That is why myself and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, have put a great deal of focus on the assisted decision-making capacity legislation in respect of such legislation which falls directly within the remit of our Department.  We were accused then of rushing this legislation on one side when we brought it to the D&aacute;il.  We slowed things down because people raised issues and we have addressed some of those in respect of amendments here and in the Seanad also.  We have also found that some of the issues in that legislation are linked to mental health, which the Deputy raised, and the legislative solutions fall in different Departments.</p> <p>That is why we are referring back to the scoping exercise that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, was talking about.  Not all of the solutions to this lie in our Department.  We have to work with colleagues in other Departments to make sure they are putting the same priority into amending legislation that will allow us to be fully UNCRPD-compliant and advance our signing up to the optional protocol.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.138" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1486" speakername="Br&iacute;d Smith" time="10:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300014#M00200"><p>I am looking back on the record of the debate around this and see it has been going on since 2015.  When former Deputy Finian McGrath was Minister of State, he made the same commitment in 2018 that the Minister is making here today.  That is four years ago.  Four years might not seem a long time to a Deputy or a Minister, but it is a long time in the life of somebody who has to live with a crippling and often crucifyingly painful disability, and who is not getting the services that the State should be obliged to give them.  They have no redress and no recourse to come back on the State or the Department if they suffer, but the Minister and previous Ministers have told us that they are working hard on it and have promised they are going to deliver on it.  Seven years on from 2015, it still has not moved forward.  I find that unacceptable.  The people who need access to this optional protocol, who need the mechanism to be able to call the State to account, must find it excruciating.  Both the Minister and the Minister of State sit there patiently and say they are overburdened with Civil Service work and that they have to get the Bill passed.  There needs to be a feeling of urgency around this issue, once and for all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.139" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="10:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300014#M00300"><p>There is urgency.  We have prioritised the advancement of one really important piece of legislation that will allow us to move towards full compliance with the UNCRPD, namely, the assisted decision-making legislation.  I absolutely share the Deputy&rsquo;s frustration.  As I said, I still do not fully understand how a law that was passed in 2015 has never been fully enacted.  The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and I are looking to bring forward the solution, which is this amending legislation which will make the relevant changes, simplify the processes, allow the decision support service to be established and allow us to have a situation where people who have some limitations with their capacity are supported to make decisions, rather than that incredibly Victorian notion of wardship, where basically all decisions, big or small, about such a person's life are put in the hands of a High Court judge.  By making that change, not only are we legally compliant but we are making lives better for the thousands of people who are in wardship and will want those supports.</p></speech>

Effectively, the appeals board dealing with the primary medical certificate resigned.  The criteria by which the board members would judge somebody to be entitled to a primary medical certificate were deemed to be unfit for purpose and they resigned as they could not work with them.  That happened a year ago but we still do not have an appeals mechanism and we still have the same criteria.  People have come into my office who have been refused medical certificates and who I know need them, but they have no recourse.  They do not want to know about legislation; they want that put in place.  Putting the optional protocol in place will be the stick that will make the Government implement rights for people with disabilities, rather than waiting to have it right first.  It will not be got right without a stick, and that stick is the optional protocol.</p></speech>

It is why I am chairing the transport committee, which operates right across all of the various Departments, to find those solutions.  The Deputy is right that it is unacceptable that the board has not been put in place.  It is unacceptable that the legislation takes such a narrow view that it cannot be worked within.  We are hoping to have a board put in place as quickly as possible but also that the legislation will be amended to take into account that it is no longer just about a limb or half a limb, or a leg or half a leg.  That is no longer acceptable as the view of a person with a disability.  We have to look at all of the other factors concerning people with a disability and be far more inclusive when we are setting the criteria.  That is what I expect to come out of the consultation that is taking place at this time within all the Departments.  It is not just for the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and is also for the Departments of Health, Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Transport; it is cross-Government and cross-Department.  This is exactly the scoping piece that we talked about.  It needs to be sorted out as soon as possible because these are the barriers that are in front of people.  I do not find that acceptable and I am trying to find a solution.</p></speech>

This involves a number of Departments working collaboratively, in particular my own Department and that of the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee.  In that Department, many positive steps have been taken in the fight against domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, including the launch of Zero Tolerance, the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and the push to establish a new agency under the remit of the Department of Justice to tackle such forms of violence.</p>  <p>  My Department established a comprehensive tri-party memorandum of understanding, MoU, with Tusla and the Department of Justice.  This MoU and related documents outline the various engagements, at all levels up to and including ministerial and CEO level, between the three bodies to help us to ensure the continued operation of DSGBV services through Tusla during this transition.  With significant support from my Department and Tusla, the Department of Justice has engaged in an ambitious programme aiming to: first, establish a statutory DSGBV agency by January 2024 that will be under the remit of the Department of Justice; second, manage the transition to the new agency of the DSGBV services that are currently provided by Tusla; and third, progress the recommendations of the interdepartmental group on the provision of accommodation for victims of DSGBV during the transitional period and in advance of the establishment of the proposed agency.  My Department and its officials are very much engaged in this process.</p>  <p>  In terms of funding, the recent budget had many competing priorities within my Department.  I specifically secured an additional &euro;37 million for Tusla and am currently preparing the performance statement for the Tusla business plan for 2023.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, secured an additional &euro;7 million for Tusla that is specifically for DSGBV services.  It is a very significant amount of investment and there is also the Zero Tolerance strategy setting out how we are going to move to this agency and also move to a wider range of measures to tackle DSGBV in the country.</p></speech>

I referenced this in my reply to the budget speech, in particular in regard to what exactly was the extra funding.  It is &euro;7 million, which is very welcome.  Is there a breakdown of the funding between refuge space and additional income for refuges such as, for example, the Amber refuge in Kilkenny, which I regularly mention and which the Minister, Deputy McEntee, visited a month ago.  I always reference two parts to this, first, counselling and how important that is, and, second, the Zero Tolerance strategy, which is vital to all of this.  We are never going to get to the end of why these situations keep happening unless, as a society, we look at this and adopt that kind of approach.</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, the Government has made the decision that these services will move out of Tusla to the new agency.  In advance of that, the Department of Justice has responsibility for that part of Tusla's operation and that is done through a memorandum of understanding.  The Minister, Deputy McEntee, was very successful in securing &euro;7 million to support those services.  My understanding is that this is current funding, although I am open to correction.  She is also working on a capital programme and, in particular, on better activating the capital assistance scheme, CAS, in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and making it easier for services to be able to access that.</p>  <p>We have found that it takes too long for a DSGBV NGO or an approved housing body to draw down that funding and deliver the new refuge service.  A great deal of work has been done to simplify the process.  The Minister for Justice has set out a plan for the much-needed development of new refuge spaces around the country.</p></speech>

Housing is the reason so many people stay in toxic relationships and keep living with domestic violence.  Finding housing is difficult, particularly now.  Where can people go?  Even if they find somewhere to rent, which is nearly impossible, there can be other difficulties.  For example, someone's name could be on a property, which is a complex issue.  Getting accommodation depends on who they meet on the day and whether they are open to hearing the people's cases.  It is good that this responsibility will rest with the Department of Justice - that is the correct Department for it - and that there will only be one agency.</p>  <p>  I will briefly mention a fund provided by Safe Ireland that I only became aware of last year.  It allows women to access many services, for example, if they need a fill of oil after finally finding somewhere to live.  It is a community welfare-type payment.  There is great demand for it and it has been successful.  The Minister may not have an answer for me now, but could administering a similar fund be considered?</p></speech>

She listens to them and works to support their actions, expertise and knowledge on the ground.</p>  <p>  Regarding the pressure on refuges, it is worth highlighting two measures, namely, the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill, which we debated yesterday and will debate again today, and the new five days of paid domestic violence leave, which is an important support that recognises that the victims of DSGBV are also likely to fall into poverty.  The paid leave provides them with some income support when they are moving or receiving services needed as a result of the violence they have experienced.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Justice is examining how we can change laws to ensure that the victim remains in the house and it is the perpetrator who leaves.  That is a priority for her.</p></speech>

Forgive me if I am emotional, but also quite professional, on this matter.  I have followed it at every level so far.  I am asking my question in the hope that the Government has learned from the Ombudsman's report in 2017, which referred to a lost opportunity, and that we have learned from the cross-party recommendations, the OAK consultation process and many other documents.</p></reply>

On Tuesday, I brought the Bill providing for the payment scheme to the Government and obtained approval for its publication and presentation to the Houses later this month.</p>  <p>  The scheme will provide financial payments and an enhanced medical card to eligible survivors in acknowledgement of suffering experienced while resident in mother and baby and county home institutions.  Recognising the impact that mother and baby institutions had on much of Irish society, the scheme will be one of the largest of its kind in terms of the numbers expected to benefit.  Some 34,000 survivors will be eligible for financial payments and 19,000 will be eligible for enhanced medical cards under the scheme.  The scheme's overall value will be &euro;800 million.  All mothers who spent time in an institution and all children who spent six months or more in an institution will be eligible for a payment, with the amount increasing based on their length of stay.  There will be an additional work-related payment for women who were resident in certain institutions for more than three months, while an enhanced medical card will be available to everyone who was resident in a mother and baby or county home institution for six months or more.</p>  <p>  Recognising the importance of delivering this scheme for survivors, I hope to bring the Bill through both Houses swiftly.  Subject to the legislation being passed and enacted and the administrative structures being established, the scheme will open for applications.</p>  <p>  I will discuss two changes of significance in the Bill.  We have banded the various payments so that an individual who was in an institution for five years and one month and another individual who was there for five years and 11 months will receive different payments in recognition of the longer time.  Importantly, absences from an institution of less than 180 days will be discounted, recognising that those absences were often due to illnesses as a result of the stay in that particular institution.</p></speech>

I welcome the change to the bands as well as the changes regarding the absences.  However, the Minister is persisting with a scheme that maintains the imbalance of power and the division and is coldly and calculatedly directed at reducing costs.  The Minister is excluding the babies who were resident for less than six months, which is at odds with the committee's report and what was recommended by the experts - 34 clinicians who work in the area of childhood trauma - who contacted him.  Childhood trauma, which includes separation from primary caregivers and being exported to multiple caregivers in an institutional setting, has the greatest impact early in childhood.  Thus, to state that young children who might have been in mother and baby homes for a period of two to three months early in life are less impacted by those who spent longer there is not scientifically correct.  Indeed, the opposite is true.</p></speech>

We examined the residential institutions redress scheme, under which individuals had to appear before a committee to give evidence and face cross-examination.  Everyone understands that that was a retraumatising process.</p>  <p>  We have designed this scheme based on the length of time in an institution.  A person will receive the relevant payment according to his or her length of time in the institution.  This means that all an applicant needs to do is prove the amount of time spent in the institution.  There will be no calling in, no questioning and no retraumatisation.  This is the best way forward in trying to design a scheme that provides individuals with payments quickly - recognising the age of many people - and does not result in a retraumatisation.  That is why we have gone with a scheme based on time spent within institutions.</p></speech>

The Minister is persisting with a cold, calculated scheme that is based on reducing costs.  He is excluding all of those who were boarded out.  He is excluding the thousands who spent less than six months in an institution.  He is ignoring scientific evidence, the OAK consultation and the UN's concerns about the systematic racism experienced by those who are not white and who spent longer in institutions and suffered more.  He is ignoring what the Ombudsman told us in 2017, namely, to learn from the debacle that was the Magdalen redress scheme.  Ignoring that is an opportunity lost.  Given that there will be a waiver system under this Bill, the Minister is failing to learn from the redress scheme that he referenced, which also had a waiver system.  On every level, there is an utter failure to learn.  What is horrible and unacceptable about all of this is that the Minister is persisting with a language of equality and justice that bears no connection to the scheme that he is proposing.</p></speech>

In recent weeks, it has been great to see many people coming forward to register their interest in receiving information on their time in mother and baby institutions and their adoptions.  It is fantastic that those records have been made available.</p>  <p>  I have been contacted by someone who spent less than six months in an institution.

A broad statement was made that boarded out people were being excluded, so it is important to clarify that anyone who was in an institution and was subsequently boarded out can fit within the remit of the scheme.</p>  <p>  On the suggestion that this will be an exclusionary scheme, I have worked at all points to broaden it.  Consider the original recommendations from the commission in respect of the scheme that it proposed - no one included after 1974 and no one included if he or she were accompanied in the institution.  Those recommendations would have applied to approximately 6,500 people.</p> <p>The interdepartmental group used an overall timeline of six months.  This would have included approximately 19,000 people.  What I am bringing forward will include 34,000 people in the payment scheme.  This payment scheme is one part of the State's response.</p> <p> Deputy Higgins addressed other aspects in the context of information and tracing, the Institutional Burials Act 2022, free access to counselling and the records and memorials centre.  The State is bringing forward a wide range of responses to individuals who spent time in mother and baby and county institutions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.167" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="11:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300016#O00700"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 and 110 together.</p>  <p>  Foster care is the preferred option in Ireland for children who cannot live with their parents or guardians.  Approximately 89% of children in care are currently being cared for by foster carers, enabling them to live in a safe, secure and stable home environment.  Foster carers are paid at a rate of &euro;325 per week for a child under 12, and &euro;352 per week for a child over 12 and under 18.  In certain circumstances, where the necessary criteria are met, enhanced and additional payments may be made.  In addition to the foster care allowance, foster carers receive several targeted supports to ensure they continue to function as a recognised and valued part of the alternative care system.  Key elements of this support include a link social worker, access to training and support group meetings and the allocation of a social worker for each child in care.  Respite care for children may be arranged if it is part of their care plan.</p>  <p>  The foster care allowance is one element of the support that Tusla provides to carers when they offer a home and care to children, some of whom may have additional, and sometimes significant, needs.  I am aware that the basic rates of the foster care payment have not been increased since 2009, and I am acutely aware of the disappointment of foster carers that no increase was granted in the recent budget.  I met the chief executive of Tusla in the aftermath of the budget and discussed the issue of supports to foster carers.  I recognise that foster carers, like many others, are experiencing cost-of-living pressures and Tusla.  I want to respond to this situation in a positive and meaningful way.</p>  <p>  Following this engagement, it has been agreed that a single additional and once-off cost-of-living payment is to be paid in respect of each child in foster care.  The payment is to be made at the current foster care allowance rate of &euro;325 for a child aged under 12 and &euro;352 for a child aged over 12 and under 18 years.  It is the intention of Tusla and my Department that the payment should issue before the end of 2022 to all applicable cohorts of foster carers, including foster carers working with private providers.  I hope that this once-off payment will go some way to alleviating the financial pressures foster carers are currently facing.  I will continue to engage with Tusla in the coming months to improve the supports available to foster carers, and I will make every effort in future budgets to address the issue of an increase to the rates of the foster care allowance.</p>  <p>  Separately, on Friday, 30 September 2022, the Tusla board considered a major improvement plan for foster care covering a wide range of issues.  During the consultation that preceded this plan, foster carers highlighted their frustration at the fact they are obliged to wait six months after the placement of the foster child until they are eligible to receive child benefit payments.  Foster carers also highlighted that as a cohort they are excluded from claiming the back-to-school and footwear allowances from the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  In addition, I am aware that foster carers highlighted their concerns in respect of access to the contributory State pension.  I am committed to working with Tusla on the issues raised in that review and in the consultations, including with foster carers, that contributed to its development.  I have also received a formal written request to meet with the Irish Foster Care Association.  I will meet its representatives before the end of this month and I am also open to meeting representatives of other organisations representing foster carers.</p></speech>

This is welcome.  It is not, however, an answer to the question I asked regarding foster carers not receiving a pay increase in 13 years.  Foster carers do some of the most important yet toughest work in their own homes, day in and day out.  They do not sign off at the end of the day.  They take on and support children who are in the most vulnerable state.  Foster carers work tirelessly to build them back up, to provide them with a stable and warm home that, most importantly, offers them love.  Many foster carers are also parents and have families.  They also try to work with the families of foster children to try to reunite them and to try to build bridges and repair harm.  This is often harm that has come down through the generations.  No child should have to be placed in foster care, but this is the reality.  When it happens, when it has to happen, it is the foster carers, sometimes in the middle of the night, and with no notice, who step in to give a child a warm home, food on the table and a loving embrace.  The Minister did not answer my question regarding why foster carers have not had an increase in 13 years.</p></speech>

In fairness, I welcome what the Minister said.  It is accepted that there has been a failure to deal with the issues being faced by foster parents.  Deputy Gould and many other Deputies have, over many years, spoken about the Trojan work done by foster parents with kids who are sometimes coming from incredibly difficult situations.  I welcome this once-off payment.  We do need to look at the basic rates of payment, the problem in regard to waiting for six months on child benefit payments, foster parents not being able to get the back-to-school allowance and the issue with accessing the contributory State pension.  In fairness, the Minister has gone through all the issues that had been brought to me by foster parents.  I am glad he has said he is seeking meetings with representatives of the foster carers.  I will talk to him about this aspect afterwards.  There is also sometimes an issue around differential payments in the context of those paid by Tusla and those paid by third-party companies or agencies.  These are several of the issues that need to be dealt with as soon as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.170" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="11:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300016#O01000"><p>I, my Department and Tusla recognise the essential importance of the work foster carers do.  Deputy Gould is right in saying that we would prefer it if children were not in care, but the truly amazing statistic that 89% of children in care are in foster care rather than in residential situations is extremely important.  It is also important that we continue to properly acknowledge this work done by foster carers.  The fact that we have not increased the basic allowance for 13 years is not a proper acknowledgement, and this is why it is something I am working to achieve.</p>  <p>  I do not wish to look at this issue in isolation, however.  I refer to the importance of the documents brought forward by Tusla.  We know the numbers of foster carers have been static and are declining.  At the same time, the number of children in need of care is increasing.  Therefore, if we are to continue to maintain and even to grow the number of foster carers we have, then we need to take co-ordinated action.  Increasing the rate of the foster care allowance on its own is not enough.  Everybody accepts that point.  This is why it is important that Tusla has brought to me this suite of measures, some of which are in the direct control of my Department, and some of which I will need to engage on with other Ministers, including the Ministers for Social Protection and Education, Deputies Humphreys and Foley, in order that we can bring forward this more comprehensive response.</p>  <p>  In the interim, and recognising the real cost-of-living pressures everyone is facing now, including foster parents, we have brought forward this proposal for an additional week's payment of the basic rate as a recognition that cost-of-living pressures are being faced by foster carers now.  It is also recognised, though, that this is the first part of a wider response to strengthening and, hopefully, growing the number of foster carers.</p></speech>

He spoke on Newstalk recently and said that he wished he had offered foster carers an increase in the budget.  Now, though, the Minister seemed to be going back on that statement.  We are seeking a commitment from him for an increase in the allowance paid to foster carers.  There has been a great deal of talk from Ministers after the fact saying this is something the Government should have done, and it is something the Government should have done.  There is a cost-of-living crisis.  In that context, we welcome the payment before Christmas, but there is a need to go further in this regard.  We will support a range of measures to support foster carers.  Some 4,000 people have opened their homes to more than 5,000 children in foster care.</p> <p>The Minister made the point we need more foster carers now, unfortunately, to deal with more children who are going into foster care.  One of the barriers here is the supports for the families that are doing that.  Will the Minister give a commitment?  The last increase was in 2009.  I am asking Deputy O'Gorman, as Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, if he will give that commitment today.</p></speech>

We all will be aware of the particular impositions on families that foster in the sense that they cannot necessarily avail of regular work situations.  They are on the hook, for want of a better term, of maintaining that family connection for the child.  They also have those access visits.  They can involve considerable lengths of time and distances which is obviously an added costs in relation to fuel etc.</p>  <p>  We want more people to engage in the necessary societal good that is provided by fostering but we need to look after those who foster.  We need to foster them.  We must do that, first and foremost, through payments and conditions and deal with all those particular issues that have been discussed.</p></speech>

What I can say is that securing an increase in the rate of the foster carer's allowance will be a priority for me going into the next budget.</p></speech>

If we can achieve them, all of them can provide benefits to foster carers as well.</p>  <p>  We have to look at the response to foster carers in terms of the suite of alternative care policies that Tusla is bringing forward right now on foster carers, on residential care and on aftercare and all the measures that my Department takes, that Tusla takes and, indeed, that the Government takes in response to each of these parts of the care system.  These parts are separate but also interlinked, particularly the aftercare element, as children, or young people as they are then, leave foster care and look to live independent lives as well, and that is another part that I want to be able to resource going forward.</p>  <p>  As I say, a key focus of mine will be to increase the foster carer's allowance.</p></speech>

This new funding model supports the delivery of early learning and childcare for the public good and for quality and affordability for children, parents and families.</p>  <p>  Together for Better brings together three major programmes, the Early Childhood Care and Education, ECCE, programme, including the access and inclusion model, AIM, the national childcare scheme and the new core funding scheme.</p>  <p>  I am delighted that to date, 91% or over 4,000 providers have signed up to Together for Better.  Of these, 972 are based in Dublin.  This is a tremendous level of uptake and will make a positive impact for parents and children using these services through investment in quality and in affordability with more funding for staff and a commitment not to increase fees.</p>  <p>  Stakeholder engagement has been a key part of the development of the new funding model from the beginning.  The expert group tasked with reviewing the existing model and developing the new model undertook a widespread programme of stakeholder consultation and engagement.  Over two years they heard from parents, providers, the workforce, the public and other stakeholders, all of which is documented and published.</p>  <p>  Since core funding was announced last year as part of budget 2022, my Department has hosted eight meetings of the early learning and childcare stakeholder forum, and several core funding specific meetings with the forum, provider representatives and the joint labour committee.  In particular, during August and September, there were frequent meetings with provider representative groups in preparation for the commencement of core funding.</p>  <p>  Representations received from individual providers on core funding have been shared with the relevant officials.  I have also met with and visited a number of early learning and childcare services in Dublin, and beyond.</p>  <p>  While a large majority of providers have embraced core funding, some have raised concerns about the impact of the changes.  The rationale for the change in approach is to allow for a fairer distribution of supports for graduate staff and I have been unequivocal that no service will lose out on funding this year compared to last year.  Of course, there is also the safety net of the sustainability supports that are available for the small number of services which may experience financial difficulties.</p></speech>

The core funding scheme, Together for Better, which, as the Minister stated, started last month, is a significant move in the right direction.  I believe it is the first important step in revolutionising the childcare sector and how we treat and value childcare providers.</p>  <p>  I am really pleased to hear that update that over 4,000 childcare providers have already signed up, a quarter of which are in Dublin.  As a result, these providers will see an increase in funding to early learning and childcare services to support improvements when it comes to staff wages along with that commitment to parents when it comes to freezing of fees.</p>  <p>  Almost three quarters of those working in the sector will see their wages rise, with the wages of half of all employees in the sector expected to rise by 10% or more and the wages of 20% of employees expected to raise by 20% or more.  That is so important and it is fantastic to see.</p>  <p>  However, I would like to raise a concern that has come my way.  Some staff feel that with the new wage deal, long service is not being recognised and there is no payscale that is incremental.  I wonder if this is something that the Minister could look at.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister's comments in relation to Dublin childcare providers in the area and having engaged so successfully with them.  I might just take this opportunity to remind the Minister of an outstanding invitation to come out to visit Junior Genius in my constituency, which is doing pioneering work when it comes to children's mental health, something in which we really need to invest.</p></speech>

I had a couple of statistics ready for Deputy Richmond in terms of his constituency.  For Deputy Higgins's own interest, in south Dublin, where her constituency is, we have an 87% take up of core funding.  It is a little less than the national average but still a very strong take up.</p>  <p>  As I was saying to Deputy Funchion earlier, when we introduced core funding we saw it very much as supporting the wages of childcare professionals.  Deputy Higgins set out how 73% of childcare professionals, or 25,000 childcare professionals, will see pay increases because of the pay agreement this Government brought in.  However, another key extra bonus of core funding is an increase in capacity.  We are seeing capacity increase from what it was in 2019.  We are seeing it where we really need it, that is, in the baby rooms and in the toddler rooms, the under ones and the under threes, respectively, where we had a real under supply.  That is because they are more expensive and core funding is giving services more money to support the higher ratios of staff in those rooms.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.187" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1566" speakername="Emer Higgins" time="11:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300017#P01600"><p>I welcome that we are able to increase capacity.  The baby rooms and the toddler rooms, as the Minister says, are where the new need is arising and coming on stream.</p>  <p>  We have an under supply of childcare in many areas within my constituency.  Newcastle is a prime example of that where many parents are not able to get their children into childcare providers and, therefore, cannot go back to work or must make alternative arrangements.</p>  <p>  As the Minister said, this funding was also there to help support people who want to make a career in childcare.  It is so important that we make careers in childcare attractive because that is a strong workforce that we absolutely need.  That is particularly true in Dublin which, I am sure the Minister will appreciate, is an expensive place for those childcare workers to live.</p>  <p>  Childcare workers provide an essential service that we could not do without and that deserves recognition.  I thank the Minister and the Department for providing that recognition through this core funding model.</p></speech>

Under the employment regulation order, we have a payscale set in terms of qualifications at present rather than longevity of service.  The basic rate is &euro;13 per hour.  If one is a graduate, if one is a manager or if one is a graduate manager, there are six different payscales.</p> <p>The money we have for the second year will allow us to make some changes.  For example, people must have three years' post-graduate experience to get the graduate uplift.  We are looking to reduce this in the second year through the additional investment.  A long-term increment is something that can be looked at in the future.  I have always said I want to grow funding.  It is not something we will be able to do in the first or second year but we have a mechanism now to support childcare workers and the services in which they work.  This is something we can look to develop.</p></speech>

The operational challenges brought about by responding to the conflict are significant.  Our country has never experienced an influx of displaced persons such as the one that we have seen over recent months.</p>  <p>  My Department is focused on the immediate, short-term accommodation needs of those who have fled here.  To date, more than 53,000 people have arrived in Ireland.  Approximately 41,500 of these have been referred to the Department seeking accommodation from the State.  Overseeing provision of accommodation on this scale during this timeframe for all those who require it remains very challenging.  Due to the urgent need to source accommodation, a broad range of accommodation types have been contracted.  The priority is to place people fleeing the conflict in safe and secure accommodation.  The Government is committed to delivering a humanitarian response to welcome people seeking protection in Ireland as part of the European Union's overall response.  The scale of response to this crisis has been unprecedented and the Irish people have displayed an incredible level of generosity in their support and pledges of accommodation.</p>  <p>  I can advise the Deputy that as of the week ending 2 October 2022, the recognition payment was being paid in respect of 2,870 properties accommodating 6,148 beneficiaries of temporary protection.  Of these approximately 4,500 have come through the pledge process.  We were also very clear that people accommodating Ukrainians who did not go through the official pledge process would also be supported.  It has been left as open as possible.  There are 4,500 people accommodated through the pledge process.  This is more than 10% of the overall population of Ukrainians accommodated here.  It is a great support to our Department's accommodation efforts.</p></speech>

We lose sight of this at times.  Of course we are right to expect a Government response but this has only been in place since February and there has been an incredible influx of people.  It is fair to say that structures created to deal with much smaller numbers of people were overwhelmed.  The Minister acknowledged that Irish people have shown an incredible level of generosity and they absolutely have.  We have opened our hearts and communities.  Many people offered to open their doors.  It is fair to say there was a level of frustration from people who pledged accommodation.  Some were contacted repeatedly with the same questions and others were contacted and then left out in the cold.  Is this something we need to look at?  Is there more to be unlocked?  Unfortunately the end of this crisis is not in sight just yet.</p></speech>

It is happening miles from us so sometimes we forget that this is the scale of what we are doing.  There are 1.2 million people in Poland, 800,000 people in Romania and Hungary and 450,000 people in Czechia.  I was recently speaking to the Commissioner from Czechia.  It is having a huge impact in Ireland.  Ireland's numbers compared to some of these countries are small, at 53,000 at this stage, but we are a smaller country and we have an ongoing housing crisis and it has put us under real pressure.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is right about the operation of the pledge process.  It was not perfect.  It was far from perfect at the start.  Right now 4,500 people are being accommodated in properties throughout the country, which is more than 10% of the Ukranian population here.  This is a very important support for the State's efforts to meet the needs of Ukrainians.</p></speech>

It is a huge commitment for people to open their doors and give this type of shelter to a family.  It has to be acknowledged.  There is a recognition payment but it has to be acknowledged through more than money.  The Minister referenced that it is the job of the Department to respond to the short-term needs.  Pledged accommodation is not a long-term solution.  For somebody to have this generosity over four, five or six months is some undertaking.  I do not think we can expect it over a five-year period.  Are we beginning to plan for long-term solutions as well as short-term solutions?  Unfortunately we do not see an end in sight to the conflict.  We must also acknowledge that many of those who have travelled here from Ukraine have their children in school here and they may have begun to work.  This is all very welcome.  They may not be going home.  Are we beginning to put plans in place for this?</p></speech>

I accept that the policy of the Department is to assist them all.  What happened in Killarney is entirely unacceptable.  Will the Minister set up an independent advocacy service for Ukrainian people who have serious complaints about the way they are being treated?  When I sent a complaint to the Department, without prejudice, seeking an independent inquiry by the Department, the service provider and the local authority went to the women and their children and told them they should not have gone to a public representative and that we had no role in dealing with the issue.  People have been shouted at and intimidated.  They have been punished for coming to me.  One of the complaints was that a service provider employee threatened that people would be sent back to Ukraine if they did not withdraw their complaints.  This is totally unacceptable.  We need an independent advocacy service so that Ukrainian women and children will be properly and appropriately listened to and serious complaints will be independently investigated.  What happened in County Louth is unacceptable.  The Department has not got back to me.  I know it was not the Minister personally.  The Department has not come back to me with an answer on how it will deal with the complaint.  This happened more than six weeks ago.</p></speech>

I am happy to speak to Deputy O'Dowd after Question Time about this issue.  We will look to get a resolution.</p>  <p>  The point made by Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh is important with regard to looking to the medium and long term and the level of supports that will be needed for the Ukrainian community here.  This will be a key element in the next Cabinet subcommittee meeting that will discuss putting in place medium- to long-term plans.  Many European countries are also doing the same in recognition that the war is ongoing and attacks on civilian targets continue and have got worse, as we have seen in recent weeks.  Ireland and all European countries need to recognise the humanitarian consequences for all our countries will be for a longer period of time and we need to prepare for this.</p></speech>

Since coming into office I have prioritised the expansion of types of family leave in line with Government policy and European legislation.  The Parent's Leave and Benefit Act 2019 provides working parents with an entitlement to seven weeks of paid parental leave for each relevant parent, to be taken in the first two years after the birth or adoptive placement of a child.</p> <p>The intention of that leave is to enable parents to spend time with their child in the earliest years.  When this Government took office, the leave amounted to two weeks per parent per year.  That has now been increased by five weeks, bringing it to seven weeks.  I have done this in conjunction with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.  Having talked to some of my friends who are at that stage of life, I know it is a measure that is making a real difference.  In addition, the legislation has been corrected to address an anomaly whereby male same-sex adopting parents could not avail of paid adoptive leave.</p> <p> As the Deputy mentioned, the work life balance Bill was before the D&aacute;il yesterday and will resume today.  Under the Bill, parents and carers will have the right to request flexible working, in line with Article 9 of the EU directive, and five days unpaid leave per year for medical care purposes will be introduced.  The Bill will also extend the current entitlement to breast-feeding or lactation breaks, under the Maternity Protection Acts, from six months to two years.  This is a significant measure.  As so many women take up their full entitlement of maternity leave, which they are right to do, they do not get to avail of the right of breast-feeding breaks.  The fact that the cut-off point will no longer be six months and will increase to two years will be of significance benefit to women returning to work after giving birth.  On Committee Stage, we will bring in five days' paid domestic violence leave.  This is important legislation for which there is strong support across the House and I look forward to introducing these measures.</p></speech>

The timeframe of the question is interesting in that it covers the past ten years.  My oldest child is now ten years old.  I was teaching at the time of his birth and remember well that I had three days' leave, and by the time I had the second fella, it had been extended to two weeks' leave.  It moved away from the perception that what dad was doing after the birth of a child was going to a pub.  Those days off were not of benefit to me.  They were a huge benefit to my wife and infant, who had arrived at the house.  Much of the early routine was established during the longer two-week period, and now the length of the leave has been extended again.  It is hugely important for things that can be overwhelming such as the first nappy, which was quite an experience, and for mums settling into a breast-feeding routine and getting through the period of chronic lack of sleep in the first few weeks.  All these measures are so important and welcome.</p></speech>

That is why parents' leave is not transferable, and I know there was some criticism of this at the time, but that is how it has to be.  There are seven weeks for the mother and seven weeks for the father.  If he does not take up the leave, that is fine, but it will not be transferred.  It is there to support fathers and families to do those things, which I believe is the right approach.</p>  <p>  As to the importance of breast-feeding, our colleague, Senator Pauline O'Reilly, tabled a motion in the Seanad yesterday on medical and other supports in that regard.  This measure is a practical support to encourage mothers to be able to do that and to ensure work places recognise the importance of this and provide the additional time.</p></speech>

What we are doing in terms of domestic violence leave is also extremely important.  These measures are underpinned by a thriving economy, but the economy works for society; it is not the other way around.  We are seeing that reflected in some of the changes made by the Government.  I mentioned the well-being framework, which is an important way of reviewing our economy and its place in facilitating society.  These measures are hugely beneficial, many of which are small and will only reach a small percentage of the population.  However, for the percentage of the population that these measures, such as the domestic violence leave, reach it will be hugely significant and important to them, and I hope we continue to make progress in this regard.</p></speech>

This is an action I can take in my Department to support victims, recognising their risk of falling into poverty as a result of being a victim of DSGBV.</p>  <p>  On family leave being good for the economy, it is also good for society and that is what we are trying to do.  We are trying to support families in those early days when there are many pressures.  Another initiative we are working on is the pilot on baby bundles, which I will roll out later this year.  I admit it is a small pilot programme but it is to start that process and put in place a range of basic but important items at the start of a child's life, as well as linking the new family, who receive this gift from the State, to those important services and supports.  This programme will be very beneficial.  I look forward to rolling out the pilot and hope to see a positive evaluation emerging from it.</p></speech>

It has been the subject of a Supreme Court ruling and its deficiencies have led to the resignation of the entire board of appeals.</p></reply>

The disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme is the responsibility of the Minister for Finance and is administered by the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.  It provides relief from vehicle registration tax and VAT on the purchase of adapted car, as well as an exemption from motor tax and an annual fuel grant.  The scheme is open to severely and permanently disabled persons as a driver or as a passenger as well as certain charitable organisations.</p>  <p>  In response to concerns raised on access to the scheme and the relevant qualifying criteria, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, committed to undertaking a comprehensive review of the scheme.  Legislative and budgetary responsibility for the scheme continues to lie with the Department of Finance, which will be able to address granular queries on the current status and operation of the scheme and any dedicated review thereof.</p>  <p>  Consideration of the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme has taken place in the context of action 104 of the national disability inclusion strategy.  The NDIS transport working group, which was established in 2020 to advance action 104, has a specific objective derived from the make work pay report of 2017 to coordinate actions across Government on transport and mobility supports for people with disabilities and to enhance the options for transport to work or employment for people with disabilities.  Action 104 commits that a review of existing Government-funded transport and mobility schemes will be conducted with a view to developing proposals for the development of a co-ordinated plan for delivery of transport supports for persons with disabilities.</p>  <p>  Following engagement last year between the Ministers, Deputies O'Gorman and Donohoe, it was decided the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme would be included in the transport working group's holistic review and development of next-steps proposals as part of its work.  The disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme was discussed by the transport working group in its most recent meeting in September 2022.</p></speech>

The Minister for  Finance did not act at the behest of concerns that were raised, because concerns have been raised about this scheme for years.  The Minister acted as a result of a Supreme Court ruling that essentially forced the Government to introduce emergency legislation.  Unfortunately, the emergency legislation ring-fenced the existing criteria, which are far too strict.  They set out that in order to avail of this grant a person has to have lost a limb.  There is nothing more frustrating than talking to people who cannot leave their house due to their disability or their in ability to access a car and are being told by a Department that they are not disabled enough to receive support.  I ask the Minister of State, who is committed to these issues, to ensure this is prioritised, in the first instance, by the Department of Health.</p> <p>I do not believe that the Department of Finance will act unilaterally on this matter.  It will only act if it is forced to.</p></speech>

My Department is completely committed to ensuring that people with disabilities have access to transport, whether through the disabled drivers scheme, local transport or ensuring that Bus &Eacute;ireann makes provisions for services for people with disabilities in its bus system.  However, I have to be fair in terms of the working group.  The Department of Finance attended the meeting and its representatives were very forthcoming on what it will cost and how we consider restructuring because it is restrictive.  The current restrictive scheme, related to primary medical certificates, costs &euro;64 million on an annual basis.  That does not include other forms of transport which include disabilities.  They cost hundreds of millions of euro.  We are carrying out a complete review.</p>  <p>  I agree the scheme is far too restrictive and does not take into consideration children with behavioural issues or people who have Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis.  Such people have all their limbs, but may be excluded from the scheme.  That is the purpose of the working group.</p></speech>

The entire board resigned <i>en masse</i>almost a year ago.  My understanding is that it has proven very difficult for the Department to find others to sit on the board, precisely because they are being put into an impossible situation.  They are adjudicating on heartbreaking appeals and the criteria set down means they have no flexibility in awarding payments.  What is the update in respect of reinstating the board of appeal, considering more than 670 people are awaiting the outcome of appeals?</p><p>My next question relates to the budget.  No additional funding for the scheme was announced in the budget.  That would lead me to fear that there is no real ambition in the Department of Finance to expand the criteria of the scheme.  Will provision be made for emergency additional funding to be provided if the criteria are expanded?</p></speech>

If I was in the Deputy's position, I would table a Priority Question to the Minister for Finance, who could answer that question.</p>  <p>  Regarding the board of appeal, the Deputy is correct in saying that it is very difficult to fill the board because GPs have recognised that it is far too restrictive.  To be fair to the nine CHOs where the first assessment has been completed, they are fully operational.  They are getting through the assessment of needs process.  It is only at an appeal level that we do not have a board.  It is to be hoped the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, will be able to make a recommendation for five people who could go on it.</p></speech>

It is, of course, a core element of Government policy on sexual, domestic and gender-based, violence.  I would like to obtain information on the scheme.  I would also like categorically draw a line in this House under the rather tone deaf and objectionable remarks made by IBEC last week on certification being sought for such leave.  I am certain the Government will put its foot down on that.</p></reply>

Since its formation, the Government has made it clear that tackling domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is a key priority.  I am conscious of the risk of poverty that those fleeing domestic violence face.  The programme for Government contained a commitment to investigate the feasibility of providing paid leave and social protection supports for victims of domestic violence.  The Government has approved the drafting of Committee Stage amendments to the Work Life Balance and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill to provide for a form of domestic violence leave.  The amendment will amend the Parental Leave Act 1998 and provide for five days paid leave for victims of domestic violence.  The provisions will be guided by the recommendations of the report on domestic violence leave, but will not include a requirement for proof.  It is to hoped that will address the concern raised by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Once they meet their statutory obligations, employers are free to provide a more extensive and entitlement to employees.  Employers in the State and private sectors have already brought in provisions on this.  In line with the recommendations of the domestic violence leave report, the Department will also commission templates and other supports for individual employers to develop their domestic violence workplace policies intended to foster a culture of openness and support for employees who may be experiencing domestic violence.  This is important because I engaged with trade unions, sexual and gender-based violence, SGBV, groups and employers on this issue.</p>  <p>  There are some concerns around employers because of the sensitivity of this issue.  I do not believe it is enough that we should bring in proof of requirement, and that is why we will not be doing so.  However, we need to support employers, from the very big to the very small, in how they implement this leave and, more generally, how they support an employee who is a victim of domestic violence.  That is why we will work on a range of policies.  My Department will develop template policies which can be used to support employers, so that an employer without a large HR department will be supported in terms of addressing this leave and the wider supports for victims. </p></speech>

I very much appreciate him outlining the detail on domestic violence leave.  The five days is very welcome.  This measure has been introduced at an appropriate time, given the unfortunate rise in the number of cases of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence across the State.  Some rather alarming figures were provided to me by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na recently.  Women, in particular, but not exclusively, who are in fear of their safety, have been isolated from the families and are under immense pressure financially deserve the support of the State in amount any measure we can introduce to assist them in getting through a very difficult time.</p>  <p>  I was conscious of the Minister's remark that encapsulating support within the Department of Social Protection is critical.  The Government, which the Minister is part of and which I am a supportive member of, cannot take just one step.  It has brought in multiple steps which are equally important, such as rent support for individuals who have tried to extract themselves from horrible situations.</p></speech>

What we are doing with this paid leave is significant.  We will be the second EU country to bring in paid domestic violence leave and one of a handful internationally.  We are very much on the cusp in terms of our response.  It part of a recognition of the general zero tolerance approach the Government is taking to this issue.</p>  <p>  Due to the fact it is new, the legislation will build in a review after two years to examine the take-up, whether any issues have arisen and whether we should increase the five days of leave.  It is important to have such a review because it is new and innovative.  We have to have an understanding of how works and the opportunity to make changes and tweaks to the system.  It is something the SGBV groups have welcomed across the country.  Trade unions have pushed this in individual firms and the State sector, and it is something they have strongly welcomed.</p></speech>

As the Minister outlined, it is critical that employers and unions are brought in to work with small companies that may not have HR department on what supports they can offer their valued employees.  The step being taken by Government is showing the sort of compassion required in these circumstances.  As part of the overall strategy across all Departments the Minister and I have mentioned, it is a step that will be meaningful to individual victims and, most important, build on the other supports that may be introduced in the near future.</p></speech>

That is why we are bringing forward the policy development element.  We will commission independent work on the development of those policies.</p><p>There is some nervousness.  Some of the groups representing some small employers flagged nervousness with us regarding the sensitivity of these issues.  Ireland is a small country.  People who know the victim may also know the perpetrator.  People are wondering about the legal position <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the perpetrator once they know such information.  To try to address those issues and provide meaningful support to all businesses, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, we will introduce policies on addressing the application of the new leave provisions and the wider response, in particular supporting their employees to remain in work and recover, following the abuse that they suffered.</p></speech>

His decision not to engage an international expert to review the report on mother and baby homes has been met with widespread anger across that community.  Will he make a comment on the fact that this report will remain the official report of the State, despite its outrageous conclusion and misleading slant on the testimonies given?

That is why I went to some length to secure the audio recordings of those who did so when those testimonies were believed to be lost or deleted.  I know many of the witnesses describe their personal experiences to the confidential committee and they did so feeling that their words would form part of the historical record.  That did not happen.  Their testimonies were abbreviated, truncated and, sometimes, combined.  I will seek to address that in the initiative I am bringing forward either to allow the recordings from the confidential committee or to allow survivors to come forward to give a new account and testimony of their time in these institutions but also to allow survivors who did not appear before the confidential committee ensure that their words form part of the historical record and a key element of the records of the memorial centre that the Government will also bring forward.</p></speech>

I send solidarity and support to these students and their families.  I wish to acknowledge the work done by the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, and all of the student unions.  Students are weary and they are at their wits' end.  This is not a decision they have taken lightly.  They have been forced into it by the Government's abject failure to stand up for students.  Students are very much under pressure.  Too many are sleeping in cars or on sofas or commuting exhausting journeys because there simply is not enough accommodation; PhD researchers are pushed to the brink of their finances without a living wage or decent conditions and Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants are in dire need of reform.</p>  <p>  The student housing crisis should shame the Government.  The whole calamity in this regard is that the number of students who need accommodation is entirely predictable.  It is not good enough for Ministers to act surprised every September.  Indeed, it is apt that the walkout today was at 11:11 a.m. because the T&aacute;naiste's party has been in government for 11 years and the problem has got worse after each of those years.</p>  <p>  Despite all of the handwringing of Government Deputies, this year's budget is the third consecutive budget from this Government without an allocation for student accommodation.  The Fine Gael Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has passed the buck to the Fianna F&aacute;il Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage - a Minister who has not even met student representatives to discuss the crisis.  Someone needs to take responsibility.  Students are paying the price each and every day.</p>  <p>  Let me tell the T&aacute;naiste what the Government's failure to deliver student accommodation means for ordinary students.  One student told me that being unable to secure accommodation has meant the student must commute two and a half hours each way.  This student's mental health has suffered immensely due to anxiety.  Another student told us of a six-hour commute each day to reach UCD from Offaly and that students knows of lads travelling from Longford daily.  The student is in final year but cannot face it and will defer.  A PhD researcher said that, out of the &euro;1,500 per month stipend, &euro;1,000 each month goes towards accommodation and that researcher is left eating beans on toast at every meal.  The researcher's mental health has been severely impacted and they are considering quitting their programme and leaving the country.</p>  <p>  The housing crisis the Government has caused is devastating people's lives and is impacting on student education.  However, it does not have to be this way.  We need capital investment to unlock the 3,000 student college-owned beds that the Government has allowed to sit on the shelf.  This must happen without delay.  Sinn F&eacute;in allocated &euro;81 million in additional capital investment to get these shovel-ready projects on site and under construction.  Will the T&aacute;naiste commit to allocating the necessary investment?</p>  <p>  Students and parents must be recognised as renters like any other and, yet, they are being unfairly excluded from the rent tax rebate.  Will the T&aacute;naiste find a way to include them in the rent tax credit?  PhD researchers are also excluded because they are denied worker's status.  Will the T&aacute;naiste end this unfairness and include them in this rebate?  Students have been failed for far too long on the watch  of the T&aacute;naiste's Government.  Will he end this unfairness and tackle the student crisis, once and for all, to let the students of this country get on with their education and careers?</p>  <p>  Too many people are being excluded.  When I talk to universities and colleges, they tell me about the hundreds of students who are on their accommodation waiting lists.  That does not even include the students who have not even left their homes or have decided to defer until next year.  This is totally wrong on many levels.  Students need the support of this Government.</p></speech>

We understand that.  We get that.  Students want their voices heard and, by protesting today, they are making sure that their voices are heard.  They will be heard in this House and by this Government.</p>  <p>  I will give the Deputy a few examples of what we have announced only in the past few weeks, such as a reduction in college fees by &euro;1,000 this year and by &euro;500 on a permanent basis from next year and we intend to build on that in the years ahead.  There will be a one-off increase in the student grant before Christmas which will put more money back in students' pockets; a 10% to 14% increase in the student grant from January and eligibility for the student grant is being widened in order that approximately 15,000 students, who do not currently qualify for a grant, will qualify for one next year.</p>  <p>  We have also reduced the cost of public transport for students by up to 50% and more purpose-built student accommodation will be built in the next months and years.  The four things we are doing to help students with the cost of living are cutting the student fee, increasing the student grant, reducing the cost of public transport and building more purpose-built student accommodation, which is desperately needed, as the Deputy rightly points out.</p>  <p>  It is worth saying that we have more students in Ireland now than ever before.  That is very positive.  This generation of school leavers is more likely to receive third level education and further and higher education than any generation that has gone before it.  It is also more likely to be in employment and, as we know from migration statistics, more Irish citizens return every year than leave.  That has been the case for a number of years.</p>  <p>  Like all sectors of society, students are very much suffering when it comes to the impact of the housing crisis and very high rents.  We absolutely acknowledge that.</p>  <p>  With regard to the question that the Deputy raised on student accommodation, the Minister, Deputy Harris, taking the lead on this.  He has the authority of the Government to do so in co-operation, of course, with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien.  Hundreds of student accommodation places are under construction at present of which 600 alone are located not too far away from the Deputy in the University of Galway.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Harris, is putting together a financial package to help unlock student accommodation developments, where permission is granted but they cannot proceed, because they are not financially viable.  He is putting together financial aid for universities, including technological universities, to unlock those developments and get them under construction within the next year.  That will really help by providing more purpose-built student accommodation on campus.  It must be done at affordable rates, because much of the student accommodation that exists, especially in this city, is extremely expensive.</p>  <p>  The rent tax credit, as the Deputy is aware, is a credit of &euro;500 per year per renter not per tenancy.  If three or four people are sharing house, it will be up to &euro;2,000.  It applies to students where they are income tax payers but we acknowledge that in many cases, students do not earn enough to pay income tax and their parents are paying the rent for them.  Therefore the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is examining whether it is possible to extend the rent tax credit to parents who pay student fees on behalf of their children.  We hope we can do that.  Sometimes these things are easier promised than done but we hope we can do that and we should be in a position to confirm whether we can do it by next Tuesday, when the finance Bill comes to Cabinet.</p></speech>

The Minister, Deputy Harris, will be in the D&aacute;il to answer questions next week and I hope he will acknowledge that, because parents paying for students' rent should be entitled to the credit.  Rent is rent at the end of the day.</p> <p>What is disappointing is we can predict accurately, based on the number of babies born today, how many students are going to need accommodation in 19 or 20 years' time.  There must be an acknowledgement of the failure there and we must learn from it.  It is inevitable there must be a capital investment to make the 3,000-plus beds financially viable and that needs to be done sooner rather than later.  This Government is very good at looking at things but I ask for immediate action on behalf of the students who are out protesting today.  I acknowledge the great work they have done to stand up for themselves but we in this House must also stand up for them and hear what they are saying.  Their families are under pressure and they are under pressure and it must stop.</p></speech>

If we rewound to 20 years ago, when neither my party nor that of the Deputy was in government, and projected ahead, I doubt we would have projected the population of the country would be 5.2 million, as it is now.  I doubt we would have projected we would have extended the opportunity of higher and further education to so many as we do now.  I am thankful to say more people are accessing higher and further education than was ever the case before.  They are doing so from a wider and more diverse range of backgrounds, especially non-traditional ones, than was ever the case before.  Those are really good things but they have resulted in a shortage of student accommodation.  We acknowledge that and that we must deal with it.  One of the ways we are going to deal with that is by providing financial aid to universities and technological universities to unlock some of those purpose-built student accommodation developments so they can go ahead.  The Minister, Deputy Harris, is working on that as we speak.</p></speech>

We have seen it in the report from Threshold launched today, which was unequivocal.  It outlined that the most pressing issue facing those renting in the private sector in Ireland is the termination of their tenancy.  The fear of termination of tenancy, of eviction, is the biggest fear confronting renters.  With over 10,000 people on the homeless list we know just how serious that fear is.  Of course, the second fear of renters is of rent increases.  Rents have increased by almost 80% in the past decade and risen by 90% in Dublin.  Renters are worried they will lose their home through eviction.  We need to see urgent action from the Government on this.</p><p>Threshold has recommended the removal of no-fault eviction from the Residential Tenancies Acts.  Twelve months ago, the Labour Party put forward in this Chamber the Residential Tenancies (Tenants' Rights) Bill which would have created, among other things, far greater security of tenure for renters by restricting the situations in which a tenant can be evicted, along with providing for better quality-of-life measures for tenants.  Had the Government taken on our Bill this time last year, families who rent would have been guaranteed a safe home this winter but so many renters now do not have that security.  I am conscious that my constituency has more than double the national average of households in private rental accommodation.  This is a very serious issue.  President Michael D. Higgins was right to call the housing situation &quot;a disaster&quot;.</p><p>No single section of society is insulated from this disaster.  It spans age cohorts.  In my constituency I have supported pensioners facing eviction due to unaffordable spiralling rents.  Losing your home late in life is unquestionably appalling for somebody facing into older age.  It is a social, economic and public health issue but it is a particularly terrible situation for daoine &oacute;ga na h&Eacute;ireann.  Our youngest generation are facing a future where they have no certainty or security about where they are going to be able to live.  My own office has taken to trawling <i>daft.ie </i>and private advertisements to assist students who are thinking of dropping out of third level education because they cannot find anywhere to live.  It is devastating to have to tell students and their parents there is simply nowhere available.  I commend the Union of Students in Ireland on co-ordinating a student walkout this morning at 11.11 a.m.  One of its key points of protest is the abject lack of accommodation for those attending further or higher education.  The Government must listen to these students.  The market has failed to deliver on accommodation for those renting and seeking to rent to attend college.</p><p>Will the Government impose an immediate and temporary eviction ban for this winter?  It can be done within the terms of our Constitution if it is carried out in a way that is proportionate.  There are precedents for doing so.  Will the T&aacute;naiste concede this needs to be done now?</p></speech>

I am thankful that we are able to provide emergency accommodation for almost everyone who needs it.  We do not see, or at least we very rarely see, families having to sleep on the streets or sleep in cars, as is often the case in other countries.  Nobody wants us to end up in that situation.  With a few exceptions, which are often very difficult and complex cases, we are able to provide emergency accommodation to everyone but that is not where we want to be.  We do not want to be providing emergency accommodation for over 10,000 people, which is what we are doing now.  The experts and people who work at the coalface tell me it is being driven by three things.  One is indeed landlords giving people notices to terminate as they sell up and leave the market.  There is a real difficulty securing housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancies and that is why we have increased the HAP limits quite considerably.  There has been a significant increase in the last couple of months of families from overseas - non-Irish families - presenting for emergency accommodation.  In general, they are not entitled to social housing in Ireland but we provide them with emergency accommodation on a humanitarian basis, as we should.  Those are the three factors driving the increase in homelessness according to the experts and the people working at the coalface and in the field.</p>  <p>  As for what we can do to help, the rent credit will help some people with their rents.  It is &euro;500 per person, so for a couple it is &euro;1,000 and for three people renting it is &euro;1,500.  In many cases it will be the best part of a month's rent to help people with that.  I advise people who face the possibility of losing their home to engage with the prevention services as soon as possible.  That could be through the Government services or NGOs like Threshold and Focus Ireland because prevention works and we need to resource those areas a little better.</p>  <p>  A no-fault eviction ban over the winter period is being weighed up by the Government.  I certainly have no ideological objection to that.  We introduced it when I was Taoiseach during the last Government, although that was during the Covid crisis when there were restrictions on movement and the circumstances were different.  We have to weigh up the pros and cons.  The obvious advantage is fewer people losing their homes over the winter period.  The obvious disadvantage is when it ends, we may see a glut of homelessness occurring at that time which is harder to deal with.  It may indeed accelerate the number of landlords leaving the sector and might result in a higher level of homelessness next year.  Nobody wants to do anything that helps a problem get a bit better for a few months only to make it much worse in a year's time.  We have to weigh it up.  As the Taoiseach said, it cannot be the only response and must be part of a wider response.</p></speech>

I ask that the Government take up the renters' rights Bill we put forward this time last year because it addresses broader issues around security of tenure and the quality of living conditions for renters.  We were glad the Government did not oppose the Bill at that time but we would like to see further progress made on it.</p>  <p>  It is useful and welcome to hear the Government is also considering the introduction of a winter eviction ban.  It is an urgently needed measure.  We see it done in other countries.  The T&aacute;naiste mentioned other countries but in France there is a winter truce that begins on 1 November and remains in place until 1 April.  During that period landlords have no right to evict tenants, even with a court order, and gas and electricity supplies cannot be cut off.  We can learn from other countries where we can see radical measures have been taken to give tenants security, especially through the tough winter months ahead.  How bad do we need to see things getting before we see emergency measures adopted here?  Again, I reference the proportionate response needed now with the housing emergency and indeed the housing disaster.</p></speech>

Anyone who has walked the streets of Paris or Marseilles will see the kind of homelessness problem that exists there and how much worse it has got in the past ten or 20 years.  I acknowledge the Deputy does not think there is any quick fix to these things and nor do I.  A number of measures are required and there are many in place already.  Let us not forget all new tenancies are now tenancies of unlimited duration and any tenant who is being served a notice to terminate has a period of up to six months, in some cases, to find a new place to live.</p> <p>I acknowledge how difficult that can be in some cases.<br/><br/>I hear the same issues about students struggling to find accommodation in my constituency office.  Deputy Bacik said she often checks <i>daft.ie</i>.  It is a good website, though it is only one website.  I checked <i>digs.ie </i>this morning.  It has a large number of digs available, which is an option for some people.  Student accommodation services in the universities have lists of rooms available, running to the hundreds in many cases.</p></speech>

Deloitte fulfilled the task it was given.  It set out figures and predictions on patient flow and the requirement for 300 new and replacement beds up to 2036.  I wholeheartedly welcome today's event, with the turning of the sod for a new 96-bed block in Limerick.  This is long overdue but will take time to install and commission.  In the meantime, University Hospital Limerick is in crisis.  The chaos must be brought under control.  Patient safety is already undermined.  This serious and dangerous situation must be addressed as a matter of urgency.  The emergency department in Limerick is dysfunctional.  We have delayed admission followed by delayed action and intervention, a lack of co-ordination within the hospital, a lack of internal communication and a lack of information for worried family members.  There is a general air of confusion.  This is leading to demonstrable neglect of patients.</p>  <p>  To leave patients in pain, waiting for hours on end on chairs and trolleys, is degrading, insulting and, obviously, dangerous.  I have received numerous accounts of sick people from north Tipperary not being treated with dignity and respect.  I hear disturbing stories about patients who have not received proper care and attention.  It is inevitable that litigation against the hospital is increasing.  Staff at the hospital are committed and diligent.  They have become overwhelmed in this chaos.  They are helpless.</p>  <p>  UHL has a serious problem with bed capacity, staffing levels and management structures.  Some months ago, I informed the Taoiseach in this House that these problems would not be resolved unless a dedicated team of professionals was deployed to Limerick.  The Taoiseach agreed to my request.  I understand their work is completed.  Will their recommendations be made public?  That group must have the freedom to insist on and implement organisational changes.  Further special funding must be allocated to the hospital for a sufficient bed complement with enhanced staffing levels.</p>  <p>  The immediate crisis cannot be ignored.   UHL serves a population of 400,000 people from across north Tipperary, Limerick and Clare.  The hospital cannot cope with the numbers depending on the emergency department or the hospital itself.  Admissions are restricted.  Ambulances are left idling outside the hospital as paramedics have nowhere to take their patients when they arrive.  Staff at UHL are under unbearable pressure.  They are stressed, careworn and exhausted.  Ambulance personnel have told me that patients are telling them that there are aware of the serious problems and delays in Limerick and are asking to be taken to an alternative hospital.  This is an appalling indictment of the service currently being delivered at that hospital.</p></speech>

I appreciate that University Hospital Limerick is not just a hospital for Limerick, but for a whole region, including north Tipperary, Clare and the wider County Limerick.  This morning, there were 21 patients on trolleys in Limerick.  Eleven had been on trolleys for more than nine hours.  That is a bad situation and is not acceptable at all.  However, it is not the worst that it has been.  We do see some evidence of some improvement in Limerick in the last few weeks.  I acknowledge that and recognise the staff and management who have made some changes to make that happen over the last few weeks.  I know that is no consolation to anyone who has had to wait on a hospital trolley for a bed.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy mentioned, the HSE's performance management and improvement unit led an intensive engagement with the UHL team throughout the summer in response to concerns about conditions in the hospital and the findings of the HIQA report following its unannounced inspection of the emergency department in March.  We accept that additional beds must be part of the solution.  Some 150 additional beds have been provided in UHL since 2020, over the last two years, with 24 in the dedicated haematology and oncology unit, 14 single beds in a single-bed block, and an additional 60-bed block which opened in 2021.  As Deputy Lowry mentioned, work has begun on an additional 96 beds in a new inpatient block at University Hospital Limerick.  I believe the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, is breaking ground on that development today.  The extra 96 beds for the hospital is a lot.  It is a small hospital and will have an additional 96 beds in four storeys over the emergency department and renal dialysis unit.  It will cost about &euro;90 million.  It will take two years to build and three months after that to commission.</p>  <p>  We have to work with the hospital to do everything we can to improve the situation in the meantime.  That is what the engagement with the performance management unit is all about.  It does not just involve work with UHL but with other hospitals in the group and with community services to make sure that we avoid admissions and improve patient flow, so that people get through the hospital quicker and do not have to wait days to get a scan, when that scan might be enough to get them discharged.  Regular, frequent assessment of patients reduces the number of long-stay patients waiting for a nursing home.</p></speech>

At present, 58,000 people in the mid-west region are on waiting lists.  UHL does not have the capacity or capability to complete these assessments.  The option to upgrade and increase the services provided at Nenagh and Ennis hospitals is an obvious way to ease this pressure.  I wish to acknowledge, in this House, and compliment the management and staff at Nenagh General Hospital for its workload, throughput and efficiency.  Further investment, expansion and development of services on this site is a realistic solution and should be looked at.  It is also obvious that the mid-west region needs an elective hospital to serve the needs of its huge population.  Will the T&aacute;naiste please inform me whether the Government or Department has made a decision on the need for such a new hospital in the mid-west region?  Has a location or site been identified?  What is the timescale for the delivery of such a project?</p></speech>

It is open for consideration.  I do not think it is a bad idea at all.  I am realistic about it because I know how long it takes, believe me, to get a hospital through design and planning and then built.  Realistically, it would take six years.  In the meantime, the mid-west region has a new private hospital that will soon be under construction quite soon.  That might be useful to us for public patients to access through the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  We also have Nenagh General Hospital, St. John's Hospital, Ennis General Hospital and Croom Orthopaedic Hospital.  As Deputy Lowry knows, there has been investment in Croom to provide 24 more beds.  The solution for the mid-west might be extended and better use of the existing hospitals in Ennis, Nenagh and Croom, and the use of the private hospital, rather than putting everything into an elective hospital which we might not see until the end of this decade.</p></speech>

This cost has multiplied considerably in rural communities, especially since the introduction of carbon tax.  Owning and running a car for young people, in particular, has become the same as owning their own home.  It is not an option in rural communities.  The expectation when carbon tax was forced on the people was that we would get a better warmer homes scheme, but we did not.  People have been waiting in the cold for retrofitting for two years.  We expected better grants for solar panels, but we did not get that either.  When I met west Cork hoteliers and supermarket owners recently, they told me that applying for a solar grant is so complicated that they will not bother with it.  Instead, they will pay out of their own pockets to install it.</p>  <p>  What should the young and all other people in west Cork expect to get from our carbon tax payments, since we pay the most?  One would expect a proper public transport service.  In two and a half years of this Government, I have seen no delivery of a transport service in west Cork.  Connecting Ireland remains "Disconnecting Ireland" in west Cork.  There are proposals for new services, but that is kicking the can down the road.  Due to the NTA's disconnected mindset, public transport is leaving public transport users, including young people, at the roadside since services are not allowed to expand.</p> <p>Bus &Eacute;ireann runs daily services in many communities.  However, a bus might leave at 7 a.m. and not return until 6 p.m.  Many of Bus &Eacute;ireann's great staff are annoyed that I do not give their services a mention.  However the management of Bus &Eacute;ireann never speak to me about its plans for expansion in west Cork, if it has any at all.</p> <p> There was no movement on transport in west Cork in decades until West Cork Connect came along.  This private company delivers return services every two hours from Skibbereen, Clonakilty and Bandon to Cork daily.  It also delivers services from Bantry, Dunmanway and Ballineen to Cork and back.  West Cork Connect applied to the NTA to provide on-the-hour return services on these routes every hour.  That application was refused.  On the Friday before last, the company carried 1,000 college students and everyday travellers to and from west Cork on that day.  However, it had to people at certain bus stops as it will not overcrowd its buses.  West Cork Connect offered to do the State&rsquo;s work for it by providing a service every hour on the hour.  It did not seek a brown cent from the State for doing so, but it has been refused a licence.</p> <p> In addition, a service to and from Goleen was offered several times daily by the same private operator.  This was also refused by the NTA.  Why was that the case?  It was not going to cost the State a cent?  All the company wants is a licence.  People young and old in west Cork pay the most in carbon taxes and get the least in return.  Our young people deserve the same opportunities as their counterparts in Dublin, Kildare or Wicklow.  They deserve access to the same public transport services, every hour on the hour, whether they live in Drimoleague, Dunmanway, Clonakilty, Baltimore to Skibbereen.  These opportunities must be explored and implemented immediately.  If this does not happen, it will be an injustice to the great students from Skibbereen Community School, who are here today, and from every school throughout west Cork who have tried to support sustainability in their communities.  In the not-so-distant future, the T&aacute;naiste will become Taoiseach again.  Will he inquire into the NTA's and the Department of Transport's refusal to develop a fair and proper transport system in west Cork designed to deliver a cleaner future for our young people?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.250" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1474" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300024#W00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  We should acknowledge at the outset that roughly half of carbon tax is paid by businesses and the other half by individuals.  It varies a good deal from one individual to another.  It is not just a rural-urban matter.  It depends on how big your house is and how you heat it, whether you drive and what type of car you drive.  There are many things people can do to reduce their carbon tax liability, regardless of whether they live in urban or rural areas.  I acknowledge that a greater burden is going to fall on rural households than on urban households because of the need to travel by car and the fact that houses in rural areas generally are larger than would be the case in urban areas.</p>  <p>  When it comes to solar panels, it is important to bear in mind the changes that have been made recently.  In the past few weeks, The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, changed the planning rules to allow people in almost every part of the country to put solar panels on their roofs without planning permission.  That is a big change.  The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, announced changes to the solar panel grants for businesses.  Those changes will make it much easier for them to avail of those grants.  I encourage businesses to apply for the grants.  There are 20 different schemes available to businesses to give them advice on how to reduce their energy consumption and move to renewables.  I would like to see more uptake of that.  Because of the high cost of electricity, gas and oil at the moment, the return on investment from solar panels is pretty good.  People can make their money back within a few years.  That makes it a very good investment.</p>  <p>  On rural transport, I agree with much of what the Deputy said.  We need to improve public transport in rural areas.  There are new services available throughout the country.  We have a budget to do more and we have plans to do more.  The Minister for Transport and the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, will take the opportunity to expand on that in the House.  We also need to invest in more electric vehicle charging points across the country.  Electric vehicles have much greater range now, which makes them far more viable than in the past.  However, we are not where we ought to be in regard to the charging infrastructure that is needed.  We need to press ahead in that regard.  We use carbon tax receipts to do that type of thing.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned a specific private operator who did not get a licence from the NTA.  It would not be appropriate for me to get into that.  I do not know the answer to the question for a start.  Licences are not issued by the Government; they are issued by the NTA, which is an independent regulator.  However I appreciate that the Deputy has raised the question here and I will ask my office to make some inquiries as to why that licence was refused.  I am sure there is a reason but I honestly do not know what it was.</p></speech>

There is a massive difference.  There has to be.  However, we have a serious crisis on public transport west Cork.  It is astonishing that for some reason the NTA refused the offer of an on-the hour service from West Cork Connect, thus leaving adults and students on the roadside due to overcrowding.  The erratic decision-making of the Minister for Transport is damaging the new routes being set up, as each month he announces 20% - this could rise to 50% - off public transport.  That may be a positive announcement, but he is mainly applying this reduction to city transport users.  I have worked very closely with West Cork Connect to get a new route encompassing Kinsale, Belgooly, Riverstreet and Ballinhassig, a first-time bus service for some people, licensed.  This private bus operator, while having the vehicle, staff and licence, is afraid to invest because the Minister for Transport could wipe his business out when he announces the next reduction aimed at some, but not all, operators.  The people of west Cork have been left behind for far too long when it comes to public transport.  The T&aacute;naiste has to stand up to the Minister for Transport in order to ensure that when all these positive reductions in public transport fares for passengers are announced, all rural and urban private and public bus users will benefit and that public, mainly Bus &Eacute;ireann, and private transport companies will work together to deliver for the people of west Cork who remain disconnected in the context of rural transport.</p></speech>

That is not his function.  The NTA does so on the basis of the law, regulations and certain criteria.  I do not know why it refused that licence.  From what the Deputy tells me, there is not an alternative service available.  Sometimes it will refuse an application if an existing Bus &Eacute;ireann service is available.  The Deputy has indicated that there is not such a service.  I will certainly get my office to make inquiries with the NTA as to why the licence was refused.</p></speech>

I again emphasise that the Government has powers to do so, powers which have already been used previously by Fianna F&aacute;il, under the Fuels (Control of Supplies) Acts of 1971 and 1982.  As we see a growing energy security and energy cost crisis this winter and in view of the fact that revenues from Corrib increased almost fourfold last year, why will the Government not consider, even on a short-term basis, taking Corrib into public ownership?</p></speech>

Even is we were to nationalise Corrib for two, three, four or ten years, we would have to compensate the owners at a cost of many billions of euro.  I would rather spend those many billions of euro helping people to reduce their bills than compensating a private company.  That is the reason.  What we propose to do, which makes more sense to me, is impose a windfall profit tax on fossil fuel producers.  There are not many of them in Ireland.  In that way, instead of spending billions of euro buying the company and compensating it and its shareholders, we can raise billions of euro that we can then use to reduce people's bills.</p></speech>

We are helping by increasing the student grant and making more people eligible for it, reducing the cost of student fees, reducing the cost of public transport and, crucially, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, is intervening to unlock some of the purpose-built student accommodation projects that have been delayed.  There are 600 or 700 under way already - there is one in Galway, for example - but there are many in the pipeline that need be unlocked.  The Minister is acting to do exactly that.</p></speech>

The protest is part of the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, national walkout.  There are similar turnouts across the country.  To be honest, students do not accept that the Government did anything significant for them in the budget.  They are absolutely furious at the extent of fees, student poverty and the student accommodation crisis.  They are insulted by the &euro;500 given to some PhD students when researchers are working for less than a minimum wage and paying enormous fees.  The list goes on.  Something needs to be done in addition to what was done in the budget.  The Government needs to get rid of the student contribution fee, address the student accommodation crisis and help PhD and postgraduate students.</p></speech>

I understand that they are being affected by the cost-of-living crisis, as are most people in our society.  What was done in the budget was significant and should not be dismissed in the way the Deputy has dismissed it.  What was done will be worth hundreds of euro to some students and thousands to others.  There is a &euro;1,000 reduction in the student fee and &euro;500 next year.  We intend to build on that in the years ahead.  More students will qualify for the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant.  There will be a 10% increase - 14% in some cases - in the new year.  Some 15,000 more students will qualify for the grant.  There will be a 50% reduction in public transport fares.  Major efforts are under way by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to get more purpose-built student accommodation on the campuses of our third level institutions.  That is significant, but it is not the end of it.  It is not our only response &ndash; there will be more.  To dismiss it as nothing is not fair.</p></speech>

Last Wednesday, another patient, a 48-year-old mother of two, was rushed at midnight down to Cork hospital.  She was chased by her husband in the car behind, who was wondering if she was going to survive.  Her stenting operating took five and a half hours to complete, which is three and a half hours outside the clinical timeframe.  How much longer will Government stand over this ludicrous transfer policy within the south-east region?  How much longer are we going to stand over endangering hospital and ambulance personnel and patients in this race down to Cork?  Beyond that, I ask the T&aacute;naiste, as a doctor and as our future Taoiseach, how much longer is he going to continue to defend the policy to deny the south-east region a 24-7 cardiac care service?  It is the only region in the country to be denied such a service.</p></speech>

In addition, the modular emergency department and outpatient facility are scheduled to be equipped and commissioned in the first quarter of next year.

Recruiting people to work 24-7, nights and weekends, not just for a few years but for their entire careers, is a real challenge.  However, it is something we will try to do.  We will try to extend the hours of operation of those services.  The Deputy can rest assured that we will do all that we can to achieve that.</p></speech>

My motto is mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh siad.  In that vein, I would like to welcome students from Skibbereen Community School who are in the Gallery with Deputy Michael Collins and other colleagues.  Students, especially those from rural areas, are suffering greatly.  Very little happened in the budget for them.  We accept the payments announced.  However, the travel and accommodation costs and tuition fees are having an impact on families.  Those who are lucky to get SUSI grants have some help.  However, there are those without help.  Those in the squeezed middle are again being caught.  They do not get allowances because their income is over the limit of the SUSI grant.  Students need our support.  They are the future of this country, and they have had to come out today and protest.  The T&aacute;naiste has been in government for 11 years.  He is going to leave some legacy behind him.  As I said, mol an &oacute;ige agus tiocfaidh siad.  The Government should support students and not just say that it hears the.  The Government should do something positive for them because they are our future.</p></speech>

It is a very fine town.  I had a chance to visit it a couple months ago.  They are most welcome on their visit to Dublin.</p>  <p>  What are we doing to help students?  There is a &euro;1,000 reduction in the student fee, and a permanent reduction of &euro;500 will kick in from next year.  Bear in mind that student fees in Northern Ireland are &euro;5,000 a year.  Just contrast that, for example, with what we are doing here.  This is the first reduction in 27 years.  The student grant is being increased by 10%, and there will be a one-off payment before Christmas.  We are making the SUSI grant available to more people.  As a result, 15,000 more students will qualify for it next year.  We made a change in the adjacency rates.  The Deputy, who represents a rural constituency, will understand how important that is in the context of giving people bigger grants if they have to travel longer distances.  There is a 50% reduction in public transport fees, as well as more investment in purpose-built student accommodation.  There are not small interventions; they are significant.  They will make a difference in people&rsquo;s lives.  However, this is not the end of our response.  There will be more, provided the country can afford to pay for it.</p></speech>

I am not a doctor, but the T&aacute;naiste is.  There is a large cohort of people who never visit GPs during the year.  By contrast, there is the treatment benefit scheme whereby people have annual access to dental, optical, aural and, I am told, non-surgical hair replacement treatment.  Would there be a medical benefit to everybody seeing a doctor at least once a year?  Would there be a medical benefit to primary students being able to see a dentist, if not once a year then every second year, because the waiting list is huge for the HSE screening service?  It is the idea of early intervention, where we could detect what is wrong with people from a dental point of view or medically, through a GP visit, and treat them before it costs a lot more to do so, both in terms of money and human suffering.</p></speech>

As a doctor, the jury is out on the idea of an annual checkup, quite frankly.  Sometimes annual checkups pick up illnesses and abnormalities that would not be picked up until later.  Sometimes early intervention can result in better outcomes, but it can also result in a large number of unnecessary investigations.  The Deputy will know of people who have been for a health check and were sent off for any number of tests, all of which came back normal.  Not only does that increase anxiety, it sometimes results in the waste or misuse of resources.  That always has to be borne in mind.  What we have agreed in the budget in an expansion of GP care without fees to more people.  Government will be keen to engage with the Irish Medical Organisation on how we can realise that over the next couple of years.</p></speech>

As the T&aacute;naiste is aware, 16 nursing homes have closed since January.  We need to get people out of hospital and into step-down facilities and there is an urgent need for that additional support to be given.  There has been a significant increase in costs in the past two years, along with the current increases in energy costs, salaries and wages.  There is a need for engagement to occur.  Could a timeline be put on that?</p></speech>

I am afraid that I do not have a timeline on it.  I will ask the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, or the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, to revert to the Deputy in that regard.  The Government acknowledges, however, that the cost of running a nursing home has increased, whether that is staff costs, energy costs or regulatory costs, and that needs be reflected in the payments they receive from the Government.  That is what we intend to do.  It is true that about a dozen nursing homes have closed recently, but a similar number have opened and it is important to bear that in mind as well.</p></speech>

Based on a meeting of the housing committee last week, I believe wording is in progress within the Department.  I note the contribution of Home for Good to the debate and its provision of legal clarity at a session of the housing committee last year.  I understand the Department is also working on wording for a referendum on the public ownership of water.  Both referendums are Green Party policy and I am sure other parties hold those policy positions.  With these in mind, I would be grateful if the T&aacute;naiste could provide an update on the status of these referendums and, if they have been considered, that both referendums would take place at the same time, and when that might be.</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware, keeping Irish Water in public ownership is very much there in the law.  I am not sure who is proposing to privatise it.  I have not heard anyone suggest that.  As regards housing, the Housing Commission is doing very good work on the wording of that amendment and has just completed a public consultation.  Approximately 2,000 people participated in that, which is quite a lot.  We will have to see what the wording is before we can proceed with the referendum.  One thing I will always say about the Constitution is that we need to bear in mind that any time we write something into the Constitution, power leaves this place and goes to the Supreme Court.  It is all down to the wording and how it might be interpreted.  Ultimately, any time you put anything into the Constitution, elected representatives - the people here in this Chamber - who can be removed cede power to the Supreme Court, to judges who are not elected and cannot be removed.  I am not saying we should not do it - I campaigned for many a constitutional amendment - but we should always bear that in mind.</p></speech>

I understand that complaints relate to supplies from the Vartry water supply plant, which serves customers in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, Dublin city and north Wicklow.  Irish Water has assured the public that the water supply is safe and properly treated.  It says the smell is harmless, however, and it is investigating the issue.

Since BusConnects in Lucan, we have new local routes, but they are not reliable.  In Lucan, we have the L51 and L52 routes, as well as the 175 route from Citywest to UCD.  These are Go-Ahead routes, and all problem routes.  When these buses do not arrive, that has consequences.  People are left stranded and stuck.  I have been told by older people in Lucan that they are not going out at night any more because they have been left standing at a bus stop, alone in the darkness, waiting for a bus that does not come.  I have been told by students that they have to rely on public transport to get to college and they are missing lectures because the 175 bus does not show up.  This is making us wonder whether the Go-Ahead service is named wrong, because it certainly does not go and it is certainly not ahead.  These experiences are backed up by NTA fines.  It is the experience of my constituents that Go-Ahead does not have the capacity or resources to fulfil its contractual obligations.  What can be done?</p></speech>

That is one of the reasons people take public transport - they can avoid the traffic and have some reliability in terms of when they leave and when they arrive.  We have a lot of real-time passenger information to help passengers in that regard.  I hear what the Deputy says, however, about the particular Go-Ahead services in her constituency.  I do not have any information on that to hand but I will inform the Minister, Deputy Ryan, this afternoon that it was raised here and perhaps he or the NTA can get back to Deputy Higgins directly.</p></speech>

As he has additional needs, he cannot get a place in his local school in his community.  That means he cannot access the Irishtown and Ringsend Primary Care Centre and needs to get taxis.  Se&aacute;n needs two extractions and two fillings and, for sensory reasons, he needs to be put asleep while that is being done.  The HSE treatment will cover his two extractions while he is asleep but it will not do the two fillings at the same time.  That means Se&aacute;n has to be woken up after the extractions and then put asleep again to do the two fillings.  This will cost his family &euro;2,000 because the HSE will not cover both procedures being done at the same time.  How does that make sense?  Will it be allowed to continue within the HSE?

The possibility of twindemic between Covid and flu has the potential to overwhelm emergency departments and hospitals.  At the moment, there are 500 people on trolleys in emergency departments, including a number of family members of mine whose experience was criminal - criminal that people who have worked all their lives are treated that way.  People in the HSE should be in prison for the treatment of some of the people who are seen in emergency departments.  It is not the staff who are at fault but the HSE and the Government in terms of how people are treated in emergency departments.  The Government announced the winter plan this week.  I think it is a by-word for crisis management.  Does the T&aacute;naiste have confidence in that plan and the health system to treat people decently?</p></speech>

I refer to civilian Garda staff, of whom there are 4,500, and those county council workers who work in water services.  It is proposed that county council workers are to be switched over under the control of Irish Water and that civilian Garda staff be switched from the Civil Service into the public sector.  Both groups of workers are greatly concerned about their terms and conditions and promotional prospects.  Civilian Garda staff took jobs in the Civil Service, which allows them to switch between different Departments and offices, be it Revenue, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or whatever.  This movement will be completely restricted now and their terms and conditions will be changed.  The same applies to workers in water services.  These workers have contacted me.  They are concerned that there is not nearly enough consultation taking place.  They want their union to be fully involved in negotiations if these proposed changes are to go ahead.  I urge the T&aacute;naiste to ensure that proper negotiations take place with both sets of these workers.</p></speech>

I appreciate that it is one that is causing some concern for local authority and Garda staff.  We are trying to make reforms in these areas by making Irish Water a stand-alone utility and semi-State company and by bringing civilian Garda staff and garda&iacute; together into a single service.  That makes sense from a public interest point of view.  The workers in question are very well represented by their unions.  I am sure that proper negotiations and engagement will take place before any changes are made.</p></speech>

The briefing was hosted by Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh and me in the audiovisual room.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to join me in welcoming the children, the parents, and the coaching staff of the High Five Boxing Academy for children with additional needs to the Gallery.  This initiative is supported by the Irish Athletic Boxing Association and includes all children, regardless of their abilities.  It was started by Pat Dingle of Drimnagh Boxing Club and has been continued on by Paddy Jennings, from Palmerstown in my area, and is in boxing clubs right across Ireland now.  The initiative ensures that children of all abilities are part of boxing, not apart from boxing.  The academy only has a couple of asks of the T&aacute;naiste.  These are to raise awareness for the club where we would like to see the initiative spread right across the country.  The Minister of State with responsibility for sport, Deputy Chambers, joined us at the briefing and mentioned that consideration could be given to providing funding through the dormant accounts fund.  If the T&aacute;naiste to lend his support in that regard, it would be really welcome.</p></speech>

It has always been good at including people from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, but also people who may be disadvantaged in other ways.  I am a strong supporter of the sport.  We have a great club in Mulhuddart in my constituency.  I would certainly be happy to lend my support to the call for moneys to be provided from the dormant accounts fund, subject, of course, to the approval of the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers.</p></speech>

We have the lowest number of garda&iacute; per head of population, at one per 668 people.  We have a joint policing committee meeting tonight in Ratoath, which is the largest town in Ireland without a Garda station.  This is testament to a lack of investment.  There has been an increase in crime and in the number of unsolved crimes.  There was a target to recruit 800 garda&iacute; this year, but only 24 have been recruited.  Since 2016, there has been an increase of just two garda&iacute; per every 100,000 people.  There is a chronic shortage of resources in the county.  What is the Government going to do to address that?</p></speech>

Those garda&iacute; will obviously be distributed across the country in accordance with what the Garda Commissioner considers right.  We have never had more garda&iacute; or a better-funded Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na service.  I appreciate that this is also against the backdrop of an increasing population, which we have to take into account.  I do not have the information in front of me on the exact resources for Meath but I will ask the Minister for Justice to provide it to the Deputy&rsquo;s office.</p></speech>

This is a reminder, as we grapple with the housing crisis, that we also have very poor occupancy rates.  It is not just high vacancy; it is also that 92% of people in my age bracket are in accommodation that is substantially in excess of their needs.  We have not made right-sizing a serious policy issue in order to help people make the necessary changes.  It creates accommodation with no carbon impact.  Refurbishment, which is the other option, has 25% of the carbon impact.  As we tackle the housing crisis, we need to take right-sizing and vacancy much more seriously and ensure that authorities drive forward the relevant policies.  We must also make changes in our tax system, means tests and the planning system to facilitate this.</p></speech>

We need to build a great deal more homes.  We will probably build approximately 25,000 to 28,000 houses this year.  That is nowhere near enough when we think about what we need.  However, by building homes, we increase emissions.  We cannot build homes without using concrete, timber and steel or without roads and emissions.  It is one of the trade-offs we have to accept that in order to solve the housing crisis, we will see an increase in emissions from at least the residential part of construction.  There are sustainable ways we can mitigate against that, however.  We can do so by bringing vacant homes back into use, which does increase emissions but not by as much, as the Deputy has pointed out.  There is also the better use of our existing housing stock.  That means right-sizing.  We need to encourage people to right-size.  In many cases, this will involve downsizing, but they will need places into which they can downsize.  There are just not enough of those, particularly in our cities.</p></speech>

Prior to going to hospital, this lady was receiving 8.5 hours home help a week with no cover at weekends.  She was ready to be discharged two and a half weeks later.  It was recommended by the hospital that she would require additional home support from the HSE.  The family was told that this support was not available due to a shortage of home support.  I am now advised by the HSE that the additional home support was not available.  More worrying than that, I was told that two home support workers who had been looking after her prior to her admission to hospital had been redeployed to work with other patients.  This 96-year-old lady is still in Bantry hospital but she is going to be sent home with only two and a half hours of home support per week.  It defies belief that a 96-year-old lady would have her home help removed at the point of being discharged from hospital.  Is it a new HSE policy whereby if an elderly person is admitted to hospital, his or her home help will be removed and, as a result, he or she will not be able to go home?  This is scandalous treatment of a 96-year-old woman and I sincerely ask the T&aacute;naiste to investigate this matter because something stinks to high heaven here.  This 96-year-old woman deserves the respect of the State, and it is being refused to her.</p></speech>

This issue also arose in recent newspaper accounts of IBEC&rsquo;s submission on domestic violence leave.  The Joint Committee on Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth discussed domestic violence leave in reference to Deputy O'Reilly's legislation.  It was agreed that given the serious and intimate nature of domestic violence, seeking evidence of such access to leave would be highly inappropriate and potentially traumatising.  There was also consensus that no one would fraudulently claim such leave.  </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, IBEC decided to go down the road of suggesting victims of gender-based violence would need proof "to avoid any potential abuse of domestic violence leave".  Not only this, it suggested that the Department conduct economic impact analysis to find out &ldquo;whether the cost to employers will exceed any benefit&rdquo;.  That is really disappointing commentary.  It subsequently tried to roll back on this position, but its sentiments and objections are clear and, frankly, disgusting.  It claims to want to support victims of domestic violence while, at the same time, opposing their right to apply for leave after they have been attacked, in many cases in their own home.  We are long overdue a statutory right to leave for those experiencing gender-based violence or any form of domestic or partner abuse.  Despite resistance from bodies such as that, this leave will be created. </p>  <p>  Yesterday, the Minister indicated he will introduce a form of domestic violence leave on Committee Stage.  While this is most welcome, it is clearly an unhelpful and unprofessional way to produce legislation.  The legislation, when first published, should have contained all these elements, but it now appears as though leave in response to domestic and gender-based violence is an afterthought.  Moreover, it is now virtually impossible for Opposition or backbench Deputies to make meaningful amendments to that section because we will be operating in a void.  The only thing we have to go on is speculation based on the Minister's statements yesterday and a press release.  Will it be ten days or five days?  Will employers be able to seek evidence of abuse and violence?  What would that even look like?  Not only is this poor legislation-making, it is poor legislation giving rise to an incredibly serious and prevalent issue.</p>  <p>  Survivors and victims of gender-based violence deserve more than off-the-cuff law-making and need more than speculation about their potential entitlements.  There are many welcome aspects of this legislation but major issues remain.  My colleague, Deputy Cairns, will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage to make it more inclusive in order that it will respond to the needs of vulnerable people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.312" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1562" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="13:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300028#EE00400"><p>The Bill will introduce significant changes to workers&rsquo; rights.  I commend the Minister and his colleagues on their work in developing it and fulfilling a number of key commitments made during the formation of the Government.</p>  <p>  The most significant aspect of the Bill, as I touched on earlier, is the introduction of paid domestic violence leave, the impact of which be overstated.  It is a leap forward for our country that will put us at the forefront of this type of legislation, with just one other European country, which the Minister mentioned.  Indeed, ours will be one of the few countries in the wider world to have introduced paid domestic violence leave and this is something of which we should all be proud.  It shows the compassion that is required when supporting victims of domestic violence.</p>  <p>  As with any progressive and new action, we must ensure its implementation will not hinder the good it has set out to achieve.  It is vital that an individual&rsquo;s application for, and the processes involved in, paid domestic violence leave be addressed with the utmost sensitivity and compassion.  Therefore, I welcome the decision by the Minister not to require any documentary evidence of domestic violence when a person is seeking paid domestic violence leave.  This removes an important barrier to the application process and removes any uncertainty created by IBEC&rsquo;s recent questionable and tone-deaf comments on the matter.</p>  <p>  It is the tragic nature of domestic violence that much of it is done in a way that cannot be documented, through fear, coercion, psychological abuse, financial abuse and myriad other forms of non-physical domestic violence that can, on the surface, constitute invisible forms of abuse.  It is important, therefore, that the system put in place following the passage of the Bill into law be kept under review and be flexible to change in order that it may serve the people who will rely on it, and I commend the Minister on his comments regarding the two-year review period.  Of course, I appreciate that, from time to time, the best of intentions can still result in issues and I am sure he would intervene prior to that should an issue arise where it can be resolved.  I am confident, given the level of thought that has been put into this measure in a number of Departments, that we can get it right.</p>  <p>  I believe this aspect of the Bill should be viewed in the wider context of changes happening within legislation on domestic violence outside of the Minister's remit.  Indeed, the Minister for Justice has delivered on several significant items of policy and legislation relating to this issue.  I am thinking in particular of the publication of the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, which focuses on prevention, protection and prosecution.  The strategy lays the groundwork for progress and sets us on a path to becoming a more aware society.  For generations in this country, we closed our eyes to the scourge of domestic violence and closed our hearts to the suffering of people in all walks of life and of all ages.  The painful truth is many victims suffered in silence and, at its ugliest, became the victims of stigma and community gossip. </p>  <p>  Thankfully, our society has come a long way since that era of silence.  Increasingly, people are willing to speak out and when they do, they find a supportive community that will walk this journey with them.  However, many remain locked in seemingly hopeless suffering.  It is our job as legislators to ensure that every support and resource will be given to victims of domestic violence in order that when they need help, they can access it in a safe and efficient manner.  It is also the job of every man, woman and child in Ireland to create a warmer, more inclusive society.  We still have a long way to go before we stamp out domestic violence in all its forms from our communities, but it is a task on which we cannot relent.  Last year, Women&rsquo;s Aid reported that just under 27,000 contacts with women had been made, or 73 contacts per day.  This underscores the importance of tackling this issue, which is ripping lives apart.  I highlight also the important changes to sentencing and laws with regard to non-fatal strangulation and stalking, introduced by the Minister for Justice.  These advancements are most welcome and again underscore the need for a cross-Government approach to this matter.</p>  <p>  Of course, the Bill contains several other important developments in the rights of workers that will increase the inclusivity of workplaces.  Most notably, rights relating to breastfeeding breaks will be increased from six months to two years, an important change that will remove a barrier for many women with infants when they consider how to return to work and feed their child.  Extending these rights to two years will expand the ability of mothers to find a work-life balance that works for them and their family and will assist us in improving the rather sad breastfeeding statistics.</p> <p>Of course, the Bill contains several other important developments which will allow for workers to request time off to care for family members or loved ones with a medical condition.  I also welcome the fact that a flexible appeals system will be developed for use in the event of an employer rejecting such a request.</p> <p> I highlight the aspects of this Bill which relate to working from home.  Allowing for flexible working arrangements again reflects and recognises the nuances of an individual&rsquo;s life and the many pressures we all face, both professionally and personally.  As with issues relating to domestic violence, working from home policies should be taken on a cross-departmental basis.  At a time of rising costs in everyday life, working from home can help people save on the cost, for example, of travel and fuel.  It allows for parents to reduce childcare costs and allows for people to spend more of their free time how they want and not commuting.  I also note that the development of digital hubs in towns and villages across Ireland will play a vital role in the successful application of flexible working, including the significant progress being made by National Broadband Ireland in connecting the homes of hundreds of people to high-speed reliable broadband to aid the aims of this Bill and broader strategy.</p> <p> At its core, I believe this Bill reflects the changing nature of work and recognises the nuances of people&rsquo;s everyday lives.  The Government is often accused and criticised for being slow to react to issues facing people or of implementing one-size-fits-all policies.  I believe that this Bill is proactive legislation that will make a real difference to people and one that delicately and sensitively addresses the complexity of people's personal lives.</p></speech>

It has given the whole nation a lift.  That team did not qualify for the World Cup by chance.  It is the result of hard work, dedication and professionalism.  I heard Vera Pauw say they are standing on the shoulders of previous generations of footballers, which is true.  Those previous generations include players such as Olivia O'Toole, our record goal scorer, and the squad who five years ago threatened to go on strike to achieve equality.  It is important to note that the foundations for the team's victory the night before last was a result of their commitment and determination.  It is also a credit to Mr. Jonathan Hill, the CEO of the FAI.  Senior management in the FAI also deserves great credit.  The new regime in the FAI has in many ways embraced women's football.  That is important.</p>  <p>  I also congratulate Ballinteer St. John's on winning the senior camogie final last Sunday.  That team did not get there by chance either but did so as a result of hard work, commitment and a great management team.  I acknowledge that.</p></speech>

Sport affects our emotional, physical and mental health.  We have for decades under-invested in sports and sports facilities.  We need to ensure those sports facilities are invested in.  The &euro;35 million the Government has allocated for the energy costs clubs will face is important and welcome.  However, that payment needs to be rolled out as a matter of urgency.  Clubs such as Cambridge FC do not have the space they need to train and improve their players.  There is a lack of facilities in neighbourhoods such as Kevin Street.  There are no recreational facilities for the public to access in that area.  Such facilities are very limited.  The technological university property is up for sale and that is something we should be considering in order to ensure a proper publicly accessible recreation centre in the community.</p></speech>

However, people should be aware that the Government - and this is a consistent feature of this Government's approach - is doing the bare minimum of what it is legally required to do under an EU directive on work-life balance.  That is what the Government is doing.  It is looking for a clap on the back for doing what it is legally required to do under the EU directive and for which it has decided not to go any further, even though it could, than the minimum required.  Unfortunately, the Government does not deserve congratulations or a clap on the back.  The only ones who are really applauding are the employers' IBEC represents because the Government is following what IBEC wanted to happen with this Bill.  Representatives of IBEC told the relevant Oireachtas committee, "It is vital that the transposition exercise goes no further than necessary in transposing the minimum requirements of the directive."  That is why we have the minimal Bill we have.  It contains no more than the minimum required by the EU directive.  That is why the medical care leave provided for looking after sick children or relatives in the Bill is entirely unpaid and is only for five days per year, regardless of how unwell somebody is.  Contrast that with People Before Profit's proposal two and a half years ago for unlimited paid care leave on full wages as part of statutory, employer-paid sick pay.  Contrast it too with the arrangements in Germany, where ten days' children's sick pay per parent per year is provided at up to 100% of wages.  During the pandemic, that was increased to 20 days.  This Bill falls far short of that.</p>  <p>  The Bill fails to introduce even a minimum social welfare payment for employees taking medical care leave.  As with parental leave currently, medical care leave will be entirely unpaid.  Everyone knows that means it will overwhelmingly be taken up by women rather than men.  So much for work-life balance.  So much for gender equality.  It also means it will not be an option for very many low-paid workers who cannot afford to lose any of their income.  That includes the majority of lone parents.  The Bill, in a miserly, penny-pinching way, discriminates against lone parents by failing to allocate them an additional five days' leave to account for the absent parent.  Single parents just get their five days' leave and do not get another five days.  It is children who are ultimately discriminated against as a consequence.  It is yet another way the State discriminates against the children of lone parents.</p>  <p>  The Bill continues the Government's kowtowing to employers throughout the provisions on the so-called right to request flexible working.  A fair bit of attention was paid to the right to request remote working proposed by the Minister and T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar.  That was really about the right to refuse remote working.  A better name for this provision is the right of employers to refuse flexible working.  It is exactly the same situation as the right to request and the right for an employer to refuse.  It is even more stacked in favour of the employers than the right to refuse remote working proposed by the Minister's colleague from Fine Gael.</p>  <p>  Unlike with remote working, this right is limited to employees with certain caring responsibilities.  Of course it should be available to those with caring responsibilities but there is no reason to limit it to them.  All workers should have a real right to flexible and remote working arrangements unless there is a good and genuine reason why that cannot be reasonably facilitated.  Surely that is precisely at the heart of what work-life balance is supposed to be about.</p>  <p>  Under section 6, employers are to "provide a notice in writing informing the employee that the request has been refused and the reasons for the refusal".  However, there is no limitation on what those reasons can be and there is no facility for a substantive appeal against a refusal.</p> <p>The only appeal that can be made is on procedural grounds if the employer does not respond to a request quickly enough.  Grounds for an employer to postpone access to flexible working are at least listed but are so broad that, once again, it is <i>carte blanche</i>for bosses to do as they please.  They include the wonderful phrase &ldquo;any other relevant matters&rdquo;, which ICTU correctly describes as a highly problematic catch-all ground.  Clearly, again, it is simply a right to ask and then a right for the boss to say &ldquo;No, I am not going to facilitate flexible working.&rdquo;  Perhaps the lack of any appeal against a boss&rsquo;s decision is because it is mainly women workers who are envisaged as applying for flexible working and they should be grateful for whatever they can get, just like the survivors of the mother and baby homes.<br/><br/>I also noticed that the Bill in its current form does not include domestic violence leave.  Obviously, I welcome that the Minister has said it will be legislated for through amendments on Committee Stage, although it is telling that we do not have that at this stage.  We will be watching this very closely, particularly given IBEC&rsquo;s outrageous demand that victims of domestic violence be forced to somehow prove this to their employer in order to avail of the leave.  We will be watching to see what pressure it manages to successfully apply on the Government to concede to its, in reality, complete opposition to domestic violence leave.  We will be pushing and fighting for proper recognition.</p></speech>

I am proud to stand over it.  I am proud to stand over those new things that we have brought during the lifetime of this Government.  We spoke about some of them earlier, for example, the extension of parental leave being one of those important things and it is now out to seven weeks, which is very significant for people, the right to request remote working and the introduction of sick leave for the first time.  These are all very important and substantial steps forward on the right to work in our economy and society.</p>  <p>  This Bill adds momentum to that.  In brief, it includes three measures: the right to request flexible working arrangements for caring purposes; the right to leave for medical purposes for carers and employees with children up to the age of 12; and the extension of the entitlement to breastfeeding and lactation breaks from six months to two years.  We spoke earlier about how important this is and how, very often, that six months was used up by women taking maternity leave.  This now extends the right.  I want to acknowledge the work that was undertaken over a long period, but this week in particular, by our colleague, Senator Pauline O'Reilly, who had Private Members&rsquo; business on breastfeeding just this week in the Seanad.</p>  <p>  I note that at the launch of this Bill, the Minister said he intends to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage to provide domestic violence leave for employees, with reports suggesting it could be up to five days.  I echo Deputy Farrell's view that the comments from IBEC regarding this were tone deaf.  I reject some of the criticism from Deputy Gannon.  It is important that this happens.  I know there is a legislative process that has to happen but people will be given a good line of sight on these amendments on Committee Stage.  We have a committee procedure for good reason.  It is right to bring it forward rather than wait around for stand-alone legislation and it is right that we act on it.</p>  <p>  This legislation moves towards making Ireland a fairer place and makes moves in terms of valuing people who work in caring roles.  We know that very often falls predominantly on women and we should be careful that it is not left exclusively as the preserve of women.  Men have to step up and make sure they contribute in caring roles, and brothers, sons, husbands and dads should step up to the plate in that regard.  This Bill allows that to happen and it allows that flexibility for each of us to step into those caring roles.</p>  <p>  I would like to acknowledge there has been a huge increase in the number of women entering the workforce just in the last two years, in fact, far more than we see elsewhere across the EU.  I know a lot of that can be attributed to that move towards flexible and remote working and working from home, but it also has a lot to do with our pandemic response, for example, measures like the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, where we made sure that work teams were held together.  We know a lot of the workplaces affected were predominantly female workplaces.  Those labour force interventions were important and prevented a scarring effect which meant we then saw a bounce-back in the economy.</p>  <p>  As a balancing footnote in terms of remote and flexible working, many of us have seen a bleed from one sphere into the other, and a lot of that has to do with the pervasiveness of technology.  We all have a smartphone in our pocket and the work email follows us home.  A very good friend of mine works in a tech company and can work from home without a problem.  He started going back into the office just because he can close the door on it at 5.30 p.m. or 6 p.m. and he can go home and be with his family properly.  Something we have incorporated into the programme for Government is that right to disconnect and perhaps it is something we can look at on Committee Stage of this Bill.  As we begin to think of work-life balance, yes, we want to give people the option to participate in the labour force more and in a manner that suits them, but we also need to make sure that when people go home, they get to be at home, which is very important.</p>  <p>  Although I am repeating what I said earlier on oral questions, the Minister will know this is a hobby horse of mine, namely, the well-being framework and how this Government is acting to expand that definition of what we are.  We are not an economy; we are a society.  The economy should work for society, rather than the other way round.  When we are looking at how our society and economy are performing, we have to look much further than GDP.  We have to look at other elements like work-life balance, and that is one of the things that is explicitly treated in the framework that is under preparation at the moment.  There are other things, such as how equipped we feel to engage in civil society and how accessible we feel our local democratic structures to be.  All of the movement in this Bill and the other pieces of work this Government is doing is all about expanding that conception of what it is we are doing as a society, taking a broader view on it and making sure we do not just treat people as economic units but as people.  This Bill is taking significant steps in the correct direction on that.  I thank the Minister for his work on it.</p></speech>

In regard to this specific legislation, a considerable amount of work needs to be done.  If we are talking about dealing with the issue of domestic violence, we would prefer ten days rather than five.  Sinn F&eacute;in had a previous Bill which contained the idea that people would not need to have proof of abuse, which can create significant difficulties.  Within that Bill there was also protection for employers if the leave was not used for the intended purpose.  I believe there is a piece of work that we have to do across the board.</p>  <p>  I want to take this opportunity to deal with an issue that has come to my attention a number of times.  I have had meetings with Revenue and with politicians, North and South, and I believe it needs a Government response.  The issue is the difficulty of remote working for cross-Border workers.  I will give the example of a woman who is resident in the North but working in the South, who is not able to avail of remote working and who has to be at work.</p> <p>This is because there are, among other issues, tax and insurance implications for the company.  We need to be able to facilitate people.  I do not have to explain to anyone here how remote working facilitates people and is necessary, particularly at a time like this when there are added costs to commuting and we are in a cost-of-living crisis.  This is an issue across Europe and attempts are being made to deal with it, but those could take a number of years.  We know the difficulties we have had with our nearest neighbour in dealing with particular outworkings of Brexit, but we have heard that the mood music is better now, so we need to consider a bilateral arrangement that would facilitate cross-Border workers.</p></speech>

There are increasing concerns that unbalanced work-life relationships can result in reduced health and performance outcomes for individuals, families and organisations.  This has been exacerbated by the pandemic, when it was necessary to fuse work life with home life due to the sudden work-from-home requirements.</p><p>I am a working man, a big family man and, as an avid runner and chairman of the Louth county board, a big sports man.  There are many facets of my life that are important to me.  This Bill recognises the rights of humans to lives that include work, recreation, family and recuperation.</p><p>I wish to speak about the importance of work-life balance for parents and carers, especially considering that respite services ground to a halt during Covid.  Work-life balance for this cohort is not just a health issue, but a human rights one.  This is badly needed legislation.</p><p>Ireland's birth rate increased by over 16% to 16,131 in the first quarter of this year in comparison with the same period in 2021.  Additionally, Family Carers Ireland, in its biennial state of caring report, reported that 1,484 carers were caring for a total of 1,984 people across a range of caring situations &ndash; parents caring for a child with an illness or disability, those caring for an adult, carers of older people and those caring for multiple people.  Carers do a fantastic job and, as I have often stated in the House, they save the State a fortune.  We must do more to provide additional flexibility so as to ensure that parents and carers can be supported in balancing their working and family lives.</p><p>I congratulate the Minister and his team on the work done to date.  There are a few points I wish to raise about the Bill.  Under section 5 on carer's leave, a new section 13A seeks to amend the Parental Leave Act 1998 to entitle certain employees to leave for medical care purposes, providing for five days of unpaid carer's leave per employee per 12 consecutive months, with no notice period required.  I agree with the principle of a person having unquestionable access to medical leave and, as such, I agree with the amendment.  I acknowledge as well that the employee can, if income is a necessity, take statutory <i>force majeure</i>leave during which he or she is entitled to be paid.</p><p>A new section 13B will be inserted in the 1998 Act to provide for the right to request flexible working arrangements for caring purposes.  This is applicable to employees with children up to the age of 12 years and carers as defined under the directive.  I agree with this change, which will set limitations on eligibility, but for the most part, the flexibility will significantly assist the carer's work-life balance.</p><p>The Bill also amends the Maternity Protection Act 1994 to extend the current entitlement to breastfeeding-lactation breaks from six months to two years post partum.  Ireland has a long-held stigma against breastfeeding, which often involves shaming the mother.  However, this amendment has major implications for the inclusion not only of a mother's human rights, but also those of the child.  Breastfeeding protects babies against certain infections and other conditions in early childhood.  There is evidence that shows that the longer a mother breastfeeds, the greater the protection for the mother, the baby and society.  Therefore, this extension is welcome and will potentially have additional positive impacts on our healthcare system.</p><p>While I agree with this change, it exempts employers from providing facilities in the workplace to facilitate breastfeeding if the provision of such facilities would give rise to considerable costs.  This seems almost backward but I acknowledge that there is a clause whereby, when facilities are not made available, employees' working hours must be reduced without loss of pay to facilitate breastfeeding.  This will certainly enhance the work-life balance of the mother.</p><p>In line with Government policy that this leave entitlement apply to all pregnant employees, section 15 amends the Maternity Protection Act to provide for transgender males who have obtained gender recognition certificates as males and who subsequently give birth to have an entitlement to maternity leave and breastfeeding breaks.  I agree with the key principle underlying the legislation, in that a person must not be disadvantaged due to non-identification to their assigned-at-birth or biological gender.  It is clear to see that social norms and norms around gender conformity are shifting towards the acceptance of a non-binary view of gender identity.  This amendment is a positive move forward and I hope it will enhance the work-life balance of transgender employees.</p><p>Section 16 rectifies a number of anomalies in the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 stemming from amendments made to it by the Family Leave and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2021.  This section provides for situations in which adopters are male as well as female, which is only right and just.  I support this inclusive step towards enhancing the work-life balance of male and female adoptive parents.</p><p>Additional amendments incorporate provisions for the introduction of domestic violence leave.  The Government must put supports in place for employers to assist them in developing domestic violence workplace policies in order to complement the leave and better support employees experiencing domestic violence.  The level of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in Ireland is disturbingly high.  There have been a number of widely publicised violent attacks on women.  Since 2020, the level of domestic violence has increased, with Covid-19 impacting women's safety further.  Numerous terrified women have come to my clinic and, with the assistance of Women's Aid in Dundalk, we were thankfully able to help them.  However, employers need to be able to do more.  Therefore, I wholeheartedly agree with this amendment.</p><p>Overall, the Government has made significant strides in enhancing the inclusion of all in Ireland.  In the budget, we have delivered significant funding to the improvement of women's healthcare.  Today, with the Bill's amendments, Members hope to make an improvement to the work-life balance of parents and carers.  We must ensure that parents and carers have the capacity and supports to live whole, fulfilling and safe lives.  This must incorporate work, recreation, family and recuperation and I hope that the amendments announced within the Bill will make a significant impact for the better.</p></speech>

Across the country, people were angered that the Government would consider doing this.  It shows that there is an increasing detachment of the D&aacute;il bubble from the ordinary people of Ireland.  Most people I spoke to were horrified to think that, after decades of women struggling, campaigning and fighting for equality, the political elites would, with the stroke of a pen, seek to delete references to women from legislation.</p>  <p>  It is not an isolated action.  The HSE produced documents recently that removed the word "woman" from information on cervical cancer and replaced it with "people with a cervix".  This language caused confusion among people who were in a difficult health situation and damaged the clear messaging around CervicalCheck.  It was also grossly insulting to many women to be called a "person with a cervix".  Women have a right to their identity.  Identity is an important issue for many people.  I cannot understand how deleting or erasing the identity of millions of women from legislation, the health service or even schools could be dressed up as inclusivity.  It is the opposite of inclusivity.  It is happening in the education system, too.  Recently, I spoke to a teacher who had attended an in-service day with the Department of Education.  The Department's representatives told him that he should not use the words "mother" and "father" in school.  The website of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, offers advice to teachers on how to address pupils.  On that website is a link to another where advice is given to teachers not to call classes to attention with the phrase "boys and girls" because it would not be seen as inclusive.</p> <p>When did excluding identities, such as woman, mother, father and boys and girls, come to be seen as inclusive?  The HSE has started to use the word "chest-feeding".  When many ordinary citizens see this, they are aghast.  They honestly do not believe this is the language used by the political bubble and establishment in this State.  People honestly do not believe it.  I told them and I showed them and they still could not believe it.  This is incredible.</p> <p> During the summer, there was the famous "Liveline" show.  I do not know if the Minister heard it.  It was broadcast in June and was concerned with these issues.  "Liveline" is one of those shows that allows real people access to the airwaves.  We are mostly listening to people in this bubble here or those who are a part of the media spectrum.  These were real people on that show who for the first time had an option to articulate their views on this issue.  They did so very respectfully.  Yet, this caused a significant backlash.  Many women contacted me after that broadcast and told me that it was foolish for the Government to underestimate the depth of feeling that exists regarding ordinary women having their identity deleted throughout the State system.  The right to be called a woman or to be referred to as female is important to them.  They are proud of the fact that they are women and mothers and grandmothers.  They feel the language of the Government is choosing to dehumanise them.</p> <p> It is incredible that these few islands of a different perspective in our vast array of media again elicited a big pushback from the establishment, as if this should not have happened and these voices should not have been heard in our society.  This is wrong.  Many women now have a great fear in respect of feeling their rights to single-sex spaces in prisons, toilets and changing rooms are under threat.  They also feel that the right of women and children to safe spaces is also under threat.</p> <p> Do not get me wrong.  We must protect all our citizens.  All citizens of this Republic are equal and to be valued.  No one should be discriminated against in any way whatsoever.  Everybody should be treated with respect.  Currently, however, this country is an outlier even in Western society in our approach to gender dysphoria and the trans community.  The HSE is currently still sending children to the Tavistock Centre in England, an organisation about which the damning Cass report was written.  A large number of people are also now suing this centre in connection with the damage done to children in this regard.  We must ensure we base our policies on science.  Ideology cannot be allowed to trump the issue of science in this State.</p> <p> In a range of areas, undoubtedly, ideology is now trumping science.  Here is the thing.  There has been no consultation with people at all on these radical changes.  There has been no debate.  It has been highly undemocratic, and those who seek to engage feel they are being hammered from on high and called all the names under the sun.  When Graham Linehan, of "Father Ted" fame, spoke about these issues on RT&Eacute;'s "Prime Time" show, Labour Youth was at the gates of RT&Eacute; protesting-----</p></speech>

Therefore, this legislation comes with that provenance now in most people's minds, if the truth is told.</p>  <p>  Regarding that debate, I spoke to several Deputies from Fine Gael concerning this aspect.  They said they agreed with Graham Linehan and other views on this subject but that they were too afraid to talk about these issues openly.  I spoke to other Members of the Oireachtas from Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael and they also energetically agreed, but were afraid to speak on these issues.  We have a situation where people are being treated atrociously if they speak up.  JK Rowling has received endless rape and death threats because she has spoken up.  It was right that the world rallied around Salman Rushdie when he received death threats.  Many people who stood with him in that situation, however, were silent when it came to the case of JK Rowling.  </p>  <p>  We need a rational and respectful debate on this issue.  For this to happen, though, people will need to have licence to have the ability to speak up on this issue.  Censorship is really damaging to democracy and this is what is happening here.  Democracy is about the competition of ideas.  We should allow for those ideas to compete with each other respectfully and then allow citizens to choose what is the best path for this country to take.  </p></speech>

We all have the opportunity to do so in this Chamber as well.  I believe all our colleagues do this.</p>  <p>  I am thrilled to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate today.  This Bill contains many exciting and progressive measures that I welcome wholeheartedly.  They will have a very positive impact on society in general and on our approach to work-life balance, as well the culture within organisations.  This legislation includes several important provisions that will make a significant contribution to supporting workers with caring responsibilities and women returning to work after maternity leave.  </p>  <p>  The introduction of leave for medical care purposes and the right to request flexible working for carers and parents are important components of this legislation and these measures are concerned with ensuring Ireland&rsquo;s adaption of the EU's work-life balance directive.  For the first time, leave for medical care purposes will allow a parent or a carer to take up to five days of unpaid carers&rsquo; leave each year.  Employees with children aged up to 12 and carers will also be given the right to request flexible working arrangements for caring purposes.  These are positive first steps and I believe they will spark many important conversations in the workplace about balance and flexibility.  This is what we need if we are to have a cultural step change.  </p>  <p>  Any parent will tell you, however, that caring for a child does not simply stop at age 12 and I know many parents of teenagers who would also welcome a workplace discussion around flexible arrangements for them.  Designated miscarriage leave is something that I and my party colleagues, Deputy Carroll MacNeill and Senator Seery Kearney, have called for on several occasions.  As I have outlined before here, there are many reasons miscarriage leave is necessary and why it would be a worthwhile and progressive step for us to take.  I sincerely hope this is coming down the tracks.</p>  <p>  I also particularly welcome the provisions around breastfeeding in this Bill.  The extension of the entitlement to breastfeeding breaks up to two years is part of a long-standing Government commitment and it will have important benefits for not just public health but also in assisting in breaking down the stigma that still exists today around breastfeeding in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Since its formation, this Government has made clear that tackling domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is a priority for us.  I especially commend the work the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, is doing in this area.  The Minister intends to introduce legislative provisions providing for a form of domestic violence leave.  I very much welcome that the Government has approved the Minister&rsquo;s recommendations concerning this issue.  Its introduction will make Ireland one of the first countries in Europe to adopt domestic violence paid leave.  This sends a strong message that domestic violence is a crime that will not be tolerated and will not go unpunished and that victims will be supported. </p>  <p>  The domestic violence leave report makes two key recommendations.  The first is that a form of domestic violence leave be introduced, while the second is that supports for employers be put in place to assist them in developing domestic violence workplace policies to support employees.  We know from recent high-profile cases around domestic abuse that workplace awareness and support can play an important role in supporting victims of domestic abuse to get support.  Therefore, the importance of this measure cannot be understated.  </p>  <p>  I am aware that the Department has been conducting an examination of the issues surrounding the provision of leave for Members of the Oireachtas.  This is something we must examine.  It is a matter we must get right if we are to see the number of women in this Chamber change.  Maternity leave for councillors is something we just recently discussed in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage.  As I said then, one of the most important things we can do to attract women into local politics is to make sure that council chambers are welcoming spaces for women and the same goes for this Chamber.</p> <p>Right now, young women thinking about starting a family feel they do not fit into politics partly because they would not have access to maternity leave, something that should be a basic human right.  It is critical that we rectify the lack of maternity leave both in local and national politics.  In today's world, it should not be a progressive move; it should just happen.</p> <p> This is such a positive Bill.  I am delighted to see all of the measures contained in it finally coming to fruition to make the workplace a more equitable place for parents, for carers and for the most vulnerable in society.</p></speech>

That all sounds nice and dandy and reasonable.</p>  <p>  In the first instance, I always say that in my experience as an employer, both in my family business but also of staff working for me in the Oireachtas, we try and look after our staff.  My staff are mainly female.  They are excellent staff.</p></speech>

I accept that totally.  I would be nowhere without them.</p>  <p>  I have five daughters and, God bless her, one wife.  We have three sons.  Now we have six beautiful granddaughters and three wonderful little buachaill&iacute; &oacute;ga - grandsons.  It is a good mixture and a good blend.  I get plenty of sound advice along the way and I am grateful for that.  I thank God, for their health and for their support.</p>  <p>  The Bill also amends the Maternity Protection Act 1994 to extend the entitlement to breastfeeding breaks to two years after the birth of the child.  It also seeks to ensure that a transgender male who has, in accordance with the Gender Recognition Act 2015, obtained a gender recognition certificate and subsequently becomes pregnant, falls within the scope of the Maternity Protection Act 1994.</p>  <p>  The Bill also amends the Adoptive Leave Act 1995 to correct anomalies arising from the amendments made under the Family Leave and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2021.  The Bill also makes necessary consequential amendments to the Redundancy Payments Act 1967, the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977, the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 and the Workplace Relations Act 2015.</p>  <p>  As an employer and having listened to employers, I make the point that these legislative measures are wide-ranging and quite technical.  Although well intentioned, they can be problematic for employers, especially ordinary small SMEs.  It is fine for the public service because there is lots of staff.  I am not knocking the public service but there are staff there appointed in roles to understand and bed-in this legislation and get training on it etc.  In a small business employing a couple of people, however, the time or energy is not there.  They put every bit of time and energy into trying to motivate their business and trying to get business, deliver the business if it is a service and do the business and receive their remuneration and maintain their work-life balance as well.</p>  <p>  We have not, until recent years, taken account of the impact of the legislation.  There is not enough of pre-legislative scrutiny in many areas.  We are always having issues about that but there certainly is no real impact analysis.  Perhaps it should be enshrined in all legislation that we will revisit it after six months, 12 months or two years to see how it is bedding in, what are the impacts it has had, what are the unforeseen consequences which may be many, and where are the shortcomings.  I was interested yesterday after a well-attended briefing in the audiovisual room on the mental health situation, where there was a good document published, to hear the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad tell that crowded audiovisual room that they have a piece of legislation and it is coming up for review after eight months.  That is the first time I have seen that.  It is very important.  Especially in mental health but in any legislation, we should have an impact assessment.  If I make a decision at work or in business, it always has some impact, either on customers or maybe on some of the employees.  One must always be ready to reassess that, to see can you ameliorate it if there is a difficulty and try to have the best vision of it going forward and, above all, that the staff are s&aacute;sta.  The person who is happy in work and happy with what he or she has to do will achieve much more in a day's work and so will the company.</p>  <p>  As I say, the Bill provides the right to request flexible working arrangements for caring purposes for parents and carers.  That is most important.  Most employers are flexible insofar as they can.  In some instances, it is not possible.  I note it is for caring purposes.  I wear the Carers Association's badge i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.  It is a wonderful organisation.  Apart from the organisation as it is only trying to manage and advocate, I have not an exact figure for the number of carers up and down the length and breadth of this country but it is quite a large and shocking number.  In a survey a year and a half ago, I noted the number of child carers.  These were children who should be taobh amuigh faoin sp&eacute;ir ag s&uacute;gradh, ag imirt and doing what children should do.  These children should be out playing and taking part in leisure activities such as sport, rince n&oacute; aon rud, for instance, swimming.  To think that they might have to be in a situation of caring for their parents, a parent and maybe a sibling, certainly something imaginative needs to be done there.</p>  <p>  The carers were very disappointed in the budget.  While they got the once-off payment, they are not automatically linked to the fuel allowance.  Caring is demanding and time consuming.  Indeed, it drains people.  They get the respite grant if they are approved carers to get a break once a year.  They seldom get breaks because it is 24/7.  Some people can be very challenging with serious illnesses.  That is an area employers should try to work with, but the Government must do more to support the carers.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides a right to leave for medical care purposes, both for employees with children up to the age of 12 and carers.  It provides an extension of the current entitlement to breastfeeding lactation breaks for six months or two years.  Regularly - I am sure it is the same in most Deputies' offices - my grandchildren get colds or flu.  One of them, little Orlaith, was sick during the night.  Bh&iacute; s&iacute; tinn.  Granny is stepping in this morning, doing a great job today until 3 p.m.  Her mother will work from home for the rest of the day, as well as minding the child.  Rearing children of any age is not easy.  You should not think you have them reared when they come to nine or ten, or up to 12.  Often the difficulties only start at that age.  I have them ranging in age, from almost 40 down to 20.  I have lived experience there.  I am not recounting a history of my own family; I am only saying every family is the same.  It is much more difficult for single-parent families or for families that do not have the extended family of uncles or aunts, or, indeed, a seanm&aacute;thair or seanathair.  It is challenging.  It must be awfully challenging when people are abroad in a different country and trying to bring up children in a community that is different and has different ideas and values and different ways of life than we have in Ireland.</p> <p>It is very important that we are aware of all this.</p> <p> Many aspects of the legislation are welcome but there are some aspects that I do not welcome.  Amendments will be introduced on Committee Stage to provide for a form of paid domestic violence leave.  This is very important.  Domestic violence is an appalling situation and its victims must be supported.  The perpetrators must be brought to justice but they also need treatment because there is something seriously amiss or wrong.  It is a heinous crime.  We must have restorative justice so people learn the mistakes of their ways.  They should not just be locked away but they should go back out to society and hopefully be retrained and advised on culture and what is expected.  There is no place in society for domestic violence.</p> <p> In recent weeks I have been very concerned to find out that we are so short on numbers in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Garda&iacute; cannot do everything.  No police force can work without the support of the people.  When the economic crash occurred Templemore in my county was closed.  It was reopened in a blaze of glory and I attended one or two of the passing out parades.  Some great people have passed out and graduated with distinction.  They have gone to various parts of the country.  In recent years we have not been able to fill the places.  At present there are only 24 trainees in Templemore.  The Government announced 800 new places last year but they were not filled.  It has announced 800 for this year but it cannot get people.  There is something seriously wrong if we cannot attract young people, and older people given that the age limit was increased.  This was a good move to get people with life experience.  We have a big problem.  Garda&iacute; are the first line if there is domestic violence.</p> <p> We saw recent issues where 999 calls were cancelled.  This should not be happening.  There are people out there who make these calls frivolously.  They are not well and they waste time.  It is only a small minority.  A huge number of calls were cancelled and there has been no proper explanation as to what happened.  This is very worrying.  It will be of great concern if we cannot fill places in the Garda.  We will have to look at the terms and conditions of their employment and their pension rights.  It has become a very dangerous and challenging job.  These are issues for another day.</p> <p> We cannot keep passing legislation and expect the Garda and other agencies to enforce it where necessary if they do not have the manpower.  This is why we have so many issues in this country with a lack of regulation.  The regulators are toothless and there are not enough of them.  They are brushed by and stood on by big business and corporate Ireland.  It is very hard to train them.  It is easy for people to arrive at my business with briefcases and sit down and speak to a small employer.  Corporate businesses employing thousands and multibillion euro businesses do not pay.  A company that started in this country and operates all over the world was fined $101 million.  It is a multibillion euro company.  It was fined by the state of New Jersey and rightly so.  Here we do not have the wherewithal or the tools of the trade to deal with such companies.</p> <p> I have noticed in recent times, certainly over the past eight years, that we have passed a lot of legislation, much of which I oppose.  It is my duty to act for the people I represent.  There is a huge push and clamour around some of this legislation.  There is the whole area of deleting the words "mn&aacute;" and "woman" in legislation.</p></speech>

There was a big furore during the summer fanned by the media and some of the organisations that champion this cause.  We have many NGOs and they cost &euro;5.5 billion a year.  Some of this money was redirected.  We have a lot of good NGOs, do not get me wrong, but I question the number of them.  I found out from the response to a parliamentary question asked by my colleague Deputy Nolan that there are 36,000 of them.</p>  <p>  The Minister has said changing the word "woman" is not in the Bill but we have a woman being described as a person with a cervix.  Ordinary people come to me and email me.  They have contacted me because they are aghast at the way we are going.  They are aghast at some the legislation we are passing.  They are fundamentally opposed to it.  They are proud to be women and known as women and live a normal life.  They feel we are going way over the threshold in an almighty rush to change the image of our country and turn it inside out.  I go back to the family unit.  There are different kinds of family unit now.  The family unit is so important for nurturing children and helping to support from the cradle to the grave.  I have issues and we will table amendments, if we can do so, to seek more clarification.</p>  <p>  I agree with Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n there is a silent cohort of people out there busy with their lives, rearing their families, doing their best and contributing.  They feel a lot of this legislation is not even relevant to them.  They are wondering where it is going, who is driving it and where it is coming from.  I say make haste slowly and stall the horses for the moment, go back and re-evaluate.  Do not have a select few NGOs dictating what legislation comes to the House.  Worse than this, if anybody dares put up their head, as they have on programmes on RT&Eacute; or elsewhere, they are shot down.  Where is the freedom of speech?  We fought so much to value our freedom and fundamental rights.</p>  <p>  We have a problem that I have raised over the past three weeks with the lack of numbers in the Garda and problems with people being intimidated in their homes.  It is happening in my county.  I am speaking about Tiobraid &Aacute;rann theas and Clonmel and surrounding parishes.  People are afraid to speak the name of the perpetrator.  This is not a democracy.  This is not cherishing our people equally.  Everybody is innocent until proven guilty.  We will not look at the situation of the revolving door circus with free legal aid being provided 50, 60 or 120 times.  Everybody is entitled to legal aid-----</p></speech>

Then they see the other side and legislation that has been passed which is not being enforced.  Worse, and no disrespect to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who I am told is an eminent barrister in her other life, is free legal aid and the whole circus.  Legislation on tagging was passed by the House and it seems to have got lost.  I am not saying to tag everybody but serial convicted persons who offend again should be tagged.  Legislation was passed by the House but it seems to have fallen between the cracks.  The Garda is not using it.  I understand it is private companies that do it.  It is not working.  Look at the legislation we have and the failures in it.  Make haste slowly with regard to this new territory and the speed we are doing it at.  I for one will be monitoring this with my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group.  Everybody should be entitled to have their voices heard respectfully and with dignity.  This is also the case with the people when they see things changing.</p>  <p>  I heard a Deputy refer to teachers being told what to teach in school and what is not on the curriculum.  This needs to be seriously examined.  There is pressure on people who have decided to homeschool their children.  They are good people.  They are being put under pressure and brought before the courts because they will not allow all kind of access to their homes.  The family home is sacrosanct unless there is something weird going on there.  This has gone way too far and I say it must stop.  People are entitled to homeschool their children.  They do not agree with the practices changing in the schools at an enormous rate.  They are concerned.  They are being hauled before the courts.  That is what is being done.</p></speech>

I pay tribute to the Minister regarding his role and for leading so strongly in respect of this matter.  He has had two momentous years, plus a couple of months, in the House.  He is responsible for much landmark legislation and, as a member of the Government, I am proud to stand behind him in the context of this ground-breaking legislation.  It certainly reflects us in a positive light across the globe.  I commend him and his officials on their work in respect of this important legislation.</p>  <p>  The Government has always prioritised the issue of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, and thanks to this ground-breaking legislation, Ireland would become one of the first countries in Europe to introduce a right to paid leave for victims of domestic violence.  I welcome the Minister's intention to introduce legislative provisions that will provide for a form of domestic violence leave by way of amendment on Committee Stage, which is hugely welcome.  It provides answers to many issues we have.  There is an awful lot of fear and intimidation in too many family homes up and down and across the length and breadth of the country.  It is time we take landmark decisions like this and reach out to people who are living in fear, people who are browbeaten and bet down.  We need to stand shoulder to shoulder with them.  This is the first of a number of major steps we need to take to move us in the right direction.</p>  <p>  I am conscious of the risk of poverty to those fleeing domestic violence.  The programme for Government rightly contains a commitment to investigate the provision of paid leave and social protection for victims of domestic violence, which is welcome.  For too long the issue of domestic violence has been brushed under the carpet and hidden by many family members.  It is right that we challenge this issue, bring it to the fore and seek to address what has been a scourge on our communities and society.  It has shattered the lives of many people and left lasting legacies in many family homes.</p>  <p>  The Department has conducted research on domestic violence leave, including at international level, identifying best practice and developing a suitable model to roll out in Ireland.  I commend his officials on this important work.  The measures in this regard are most welcome.  The Department has also engaged in a targeted consultation process with relevant stakeholders and social partners to examine how a leave scheme should operate to address the needs of victims most effectively.  This has included consultation with the monitoring committee of the second national strategy on domestic sexual and gender-based violence, employer groups and trade unions.  Stakeholders of the national equality strategy committees have also been consulted with.  I am conscious there may have been negative publicity in recent weeks in respect of employers and employer groups on whether they would embrace this legislation.  I have been contacted by many employers who are supportive of any victims and staff members who comes to them.  Hand on heart, I know many employers in my constituency who have gone the extra mile and, even without the legislation, have taken the necessary steps to protect their staff.  They value them as staff members but also as members of their community.  They know the scourge and trauma that has been wreaked on so many families because of domestic violence.  That is a message a number of employers, be they small employers or family businesses, have asked me to articulate on the floor of the House, which I am happy to do.</p>  <p>  The Minister also intends to introduce amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage that would include legislative provision for a form of domestic violence leave.  They will be hugely welcomed and it will be a landmark day when we see that happen.  Work has begun on securing a partner to develop the necessary supports for employers in developing their workplace domestic-violence policies, with a view to rolling these out in 2023.  From my engagement with employers, both small and large, I know this is very welcome.  It is time we take domestic violence, its implications and the problems and trauma it wreaks across this country out of the dark corners, and that we address them in public, in this House and in the Seanad.  It is also important that it should be part of any workplace manual.  People need to know that domestic violence is not acceptable nor is it acceptable that it is not discussed in the workplace.  It should be front and centre of any legal document, any contract staff have with their employer.  People's rights as employees, in the unfortunate event that they become victims of domestic violence, need to be protected.</p>  <p>  As already stated, I am a great advocate of the Minister's work and of his Department.  I am impressed by the volume of work he gets through in his office.  This is important legislation for the Government.  We are particularly proud of it because it shows Ireland in a positive light.  It shows us as a progressive society that can lead from the front and show other European countries how they should deal with what has been a scourge on society for countless decades and centuries.  I commend the Minister on his work.  I guarantee him my fulsome support and I look forward to the culmination of this legislation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1605" speakername="Marian Harkin" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300035#MM00200"><p>I am pleased to see this legislation before the House because I worked on the directive for many years in the European Parliament, not just in its final stages when it was a draft document, in committee and in the Parliament itself, but in trying to ensure it got on the Statute Book in the first place.  When I was first elected to the Parliament, Kathy Sinnott and I founded the carers interest group and that was one of its first recommendations the group made.  I remained as chair of the group for between ten and 15 years, co-chairing some of the time.  This was one of our main priorities.</p>  <p>  In the European Parliament, as the Minister knows, there is no government or opposition so the Commission comes forward with proposals.  I want to put it on the record that we worked with some excellent people from the Commission in trying to get this proposal to a point where it became legislation.  Sometimes Members of this House and people elsewhere talk about members of the Commission as faceless bureaucrats.  We met the best of people, ordinary people, those who have care responsibilities and individuals who have lives like the rest of us.  They understood this.  It was a long process because, with the crash in 2008, all social legislation was put to one side, which was a disaster for Europe.  I understand people's concerns in that regard, but when we were able to recover a little bit, especially in my final term from 2014 to 2019, social Europe was much more to the fore and this was one of the directives that was meant to reflect that.</p>  <p>  As I said, many people helped to bring this legislation to where it is today.  It was one of the final directives we passed in the European Parliament in the April or May before I left.  I am pleased about where it is at and pleased with whatever small role I played since its inception, which was a long time ago.</p>  <p>  This is a broad-based directive.  Not all directives are as broad based.  As we have 27 member states with 27 difference systems of maternity leave, paternity leave, carers leave and other kinds of leave, it has to work with and not against these systems.  Some countries, for example, have better maternity leave provisions than others.  We often look to the Nordic countries and what they have in place.  In truth, however, when it comes to these issues, Ireland is most certainly not behind the door.  In fact, our carers leave system, whereby a person can take up to two years off work and receive carer's benefit, is seen as a flagship example in the EU and globally.</p>  <p>Many countries do not have that.<br/><br/>The system is not perfect.  For example, carer's benefit should bear some relationship to whatever salary a person is on.  Obviously, that could not be open-ended.  Perhaps it could be based on a median wage or something like that.  If it is not paid well enough, most people will not take it.  For something to be meaningful, real and available, there has to be a certain level of benefit.<br/><br/>It is worth noting that we are well ahead of the posse.  We may ask why we need this aspect, and other aspects of the Bill, something I will return to.  It is because we need something to bridge the gap.  Not everybody wants to take two years.  One cannot take carer's benefit for less than 13 weeks.  Not everybody wants or needs to take that much time off.  They might want to take shorter amounts of leave.  To some extent, as I said, the Bill helps to bridge this gap.<br/><br/>I have heard people question the Bill.  In my view, it is important.  It reflects the reality of many people's lives.  It is far from perfect, but it will help to ease some burdens here and there.  As I said, there are gaps, which I will mention, but it is going in the right direction.  Many people are congratulating us on what we are doing, but we are a little bit late.  It is to be hoped it will be on the Statute Book fairly quickly.<br/><br/>I will table a number of amendments for Committee Stage.  The Bill refers to five days unpaid leave for a significant medical issue.  That term is quite vague and open to interpretation.  I do not know whether the Minister can tie that down any further.  I do not know who will be the judge of that.  All legislation should be as tightly worded as possible.  The Bill also stipulates that leave cannot be taken for less than one day.  I do know not know if there could be some flexibility in respect of half-days.  Sometimes that is all that is needed.  Perhaps it is not possible, but the Minister might think about that.  On the provision regarding five days within the year, does that refer to a calendar year from when the first day's leave is taken?  Could it be a rolling year?  In certain professions, the length of sick leave a person can take can be rolled over for years.<br/><br/>The five carer's leave days provided for in the Bill are unpaid, meaning that the carer in question will have to assume a financial penalty.  If a carer has to take an unpaid day off and perhaps needs to pay &euro;60 for a certificate, that means that the person has not only lost a day's pay but is also out of pocket.  Some companies have already said they will pay, but others will not or cannot.  It is not a question of organisations being bad employers; rather, sometimes businesses cannot afford it.  This is good, but it is not the perfect solution that everybody is saying it is because people are taking the leave at their own cost.<br/><br/>When we dealt with this at European level, in the Parliament we tried to say that the leave should be paid, but we could not get agreement with the European Council because some member states supported it while others did not.  That, of course, would not prevent any country, in this case Ireland, from trying to ensure the leave is paid.  I would be interested in hearing about the Minister's discussions with employers' organisations, what they said about this and the possibilities of paid leave.  A review could be part of the Bill.<br/><br/>The Bill gives the right to request flexible working, but that is it.  The employer can refuse.  I note there are various protections and steps that need to be taken by an employer.  It is a process, rather than someone saying they would like the time.  Even at that, things are far from certain for many people.  It is an employee's right to challenge a decision, but he or she has to go to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  We know there are long delays of up to 12 months.  There is a sense that justice delayed is justice denied.  To be fair, it is a further safety net.  If people really feel their employer's decision is unjust they can go to the WRC.  Would there be any possibility of some other system that would not take as long?  That does not have to be put in place immediately.  I am just throwing that out there.<br/><br/>The directive refers to flexible working arrangements being for a reasonable duration, but the Bill does not clarify what a reasonable duration might be.  That is left open to interpretation.  I understand that the Minister is trying to be as flexible as possible, but sometimes that means people lose out.  I do not know if anything stronger could be put into the Bill.<br/><br/>I am concerned that the Bill requires an employee to provide to his or her employer information on the employee's relationship to the person for whom medical leave is sought and, which is of concern, the nature of the personal care or support required by the person in respect of whom the leave for medical care purposes is sought.  Is there an issue around the general data protection regulation and sharing information with a third party?  This is often sensitive information.  By virtue of the person's relationship with the individual for whom he or she needs to get time off to care for, it is very easy to identify that person.<br/><br/>The Bill specifies the persons for whom flexible working or carer's leave can be applied for.  They are a person of whom the employee is a parent or adoptive parent, the spouse or civil partner of the employee, a person to whom the employee is <i>in</i><i>loco parentis</i>, the cohabitant, parent or grandparent or brother or sister of the employee and a person other than one specified in any of those paragraphs in the Bill who lives in the same household as the employee.  That is broad, but the definition excludes applications in respect of care provided to non-relatives or relatives, such as uncles, aunts or cousins, who do not live in the same household.  This is particularly important as the Irish family evolves.  The family of choice, as we might call it, is much more common, in particular for the LGBTQIA+ community.  It may also be at odds with the pending referendum on Article 41 of the Constitution to extend the definition of family.  That needs to be taken into consideration.<br/><br/>The extension of breastfeeding breaks is important.  It normalises it.  It is a normal and natural thing, and that is how it should be.<br/><br/>I am very happy to hear what the Minister for Justice had to say about domestic violence leave.  In truth, it needs to be introduced as soon as possible, not just the leave but the development of workplace policies to support victims.</p> <p>I will bring forward some amendments on this, but it gives me some comfort to know the Minister is determined we will not be waiting any length of time for this, because we cannot wait.</p> <p> My last comment is on the need to ensure maternity and paternity leave for all politicians in this House and for councillors, which was referred to by one or two of my colleagues.  Earlier I spoke of normalising breastfeeding.  This would simply normalise women's involvement in politics.  It will not do it completely but it will go a long way towards doing so.  It is interesting that we look up when a child comes in here because we do not often see children in this place.  One of the first times we saw a child in this Chamber was recently.  That is a good thing to see in itself because it normalises family life and who we are.</p> <p> This legislation reflects the reality of people's lives and it will help ease some of the burdens.  I strongly welcome it.  I will submit amendments and I hope we will have a chance to discuss them further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.350" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="14:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300037#OO00200"><p>I appreciate the time to speak on this Bill as there are a number of key factors that need to be addressed further.  The area of leave for domestic violence, in particular, seriously falls short of what should be best practice.  This Bill will see the introduction of paid leave for victims of domestic, sexual or gender-based violence.  While always welcome, it is unfortunate to note that only five days of leave will be provided for under this Bill.</p>  <p>  In November 2020 Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies, Deputies McDonald and O'Reilly, introduced the Organisation of Working Time (Domestic Violence Leave) Bill, which was developed through extensive consultation with those involved in this area.  The Bill provided for ten days of statutory leave.  Why ten days?  The reason was that in other countries where such leave had been legislated for - other countries' governments had legislated for this well ahead of our own - leave was provided for ten days.  Indeed, public and private sector organisations such as Vodafone, Danske Bank, An Post and University of Galway have also provided for the ten-day period of leave.</p>  <p>  In countries where ten days' leave is provided for, it is seen as a timeframe which allows victims of violence the time to take care of their affairs, given the trauma involved and the implications it has for the family unit, including children who may be caught up in this.</p>  <p>  When significant time is given, such as the ten days we have proposed, it helps to avoid some areas in which the employee may have to ask for further grace from their employer.  The trauma they are dealing and coping with is intrusive enough without having to make further requests to their employer for time.  That would hardly be an appropriate circumstance for a victim of domestic violence to find himself or herself in.</p>  <p>  The whole purpose of such a provision is to give time to respect and acknowledge the situation in which a person may find themselves and, of course, it should be designed in a manner that respects their privacy.  It is regrettable that only five days have been provided for in this Bill.  I urge the Minister to rethink this and adjust the timeframe in the interest of those who, unfortunately, will need it.</p>  <p>  This Government should take the lead and not be seen as taking what may be seen as a half measure compared to the initiatives taken by others.  We need to be able to send out the message that Government is here to support and lay a landscape that enables an optimum level of support to be available to those who find themselves in scenarios which are complicated, especially in the areas of trauma and family structure.</p>  <p>  With regard to the issue of proof, the Minister is urged to reconsider the recommendation that states that employers should retain the right to request reasonable proof, given that not all victims have engaged with the courts, counsellors or domestic violence organisations in seeking to exit an abusive or violent relationship.  People's circumstances are far less cut and dry than that.  Deputies McDonald and O'Reilly have demonstrated in their 2020 Bill that this is addressed through the provision of protections for employers in line with those contained in other legislative areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.351" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1477" speakername="Roderic O'Gorman" time="14:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300037#OO00300"><p>I thank all the Deputies who have contributed to this debate today and yesterday.  The Government is committed to ensuring that every child gets the best start in life and to supporting parents to spend more time with their children in those precious years at the start of life.  This Bill provides additional flexibility to ensure that parents and carers can be supported to balance their working and family lives.</p>  <p>  This Government has been very active in extending parental and family leave.  The Covid-19 pandemic revolutionised the workplace in many ways, but it has also made many of us much more aware of the need for a proper balance between our work life and our home life and for working parents and carers to be a vital part of that balancing act.</p>  <p>  The intention behind the legislation is to ensure that parents, usually mothers, and carers, again usually women, are not lost from the workforce because of their obligations at home.  The provisions of this Bill are important for the people who will benefit from them, but also for gender equality in the workplace and across wider society.</p>  <p>  The Bill not only further transposes the EU work-life balance directive for parents and carers, it meets commitments under the First 5 strategy and the national strategy for women and girls to extend the entitlement to breastfeeding breaks and will provide additional support to women returning to work after maternity leave.</p>  <p>  We have persistently-low levels of breastfeeding in Ireland, which Deputy &Oacute; Cathasaigh spoke about in his contribution, and we are losing out on many of the benefits of breastfeeding for both mam and baby.  The extension of breastfeeding breaks will play a valuable role in supporting continued breastfeeding and normalising breastfeeding mothers in the workplace.  </p>  <p>  I am grateful for the many contributions from Deputies.  I will go through a couple of them and respond to a few of the more detailed queries now.  This Bill is partially designed to implement the final pieces of an EU directive and, as such, those provisions linked to that are carefully drafted to ensure that we are fully in compliance with the EU directive and mindful of its spirit.  It was especially fortuitous that Deputy Harkin was here, having been deeply involved with the drafting in her previous role as an MEP, to be able to speak a little bit about the history and the complexity of the drafting of this legislation.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, a number of Deputies said that this legislation was solely the Government being forced to do what the EU wanted it to do.  I have to be clear that is not accurate.  Two elements of this Bill are implementation of EU law, namely, the five days' medical leave for parents and carers and the introduction of the right to request flexible work.  However, the provisions we are bringing forward on breastfeeding rates and on domestic violence leave are not required under EU law.  They are being brought forward in fulfilment of commitments within our programme for Government.  It is worth making that point at the outset.</p>  <p>  Deputy O'Reilly spoke on a number of points yesterday.  The Deputy and many other contributors discussed the issue of proof for domestic violence leave.  Let me be very clear on the amendments we will bring forward to introduce this.  We will work to achieve a situation, further to the achievement of which is the introduction of policies is further, where the taking up of domestic violence leave would be based on trust in workplaces.  It is not acceptable for victims to be asked to bring forward proof of the domestic violence they have suffered.</p>  <p>  We will bring forward proposals that are not based on the need for proof but we recognise the complexity of this area.  I refer to what Deputy McGrath said earlier on in that in my engagement with employers' groups concerns were raised about the obligations that knowledge an employee has been the victim of domestic violence places on the employer.  There is some fear there and I wish to address that.</p>  <p>  That is why we will also bring forward this policy of template policies that employers, from a large employer all the way down to a small business, can apply and implement.  It will help them implement this leave, if a request comes from a member of staff, but it will also help them more generally support employees in terms of the issue of domestic violence is raised.  We are conscious of those issues and we are looking to support, but we will not be looking for the proof for the provision of this legislation.  </p>  <p>  There are some employers both in the private and public sectors who have brought in their own policies on domestic violence leave.  Deputy O'Reilly asked if that leave is for ten days, whether the introduction of five days' statutory leave will impact on it.  It will not impact on that.</p> <p>It is the same as where a company has a higher statutory annual leave level than the statutory one.  The company level is not affected by the statutory one nor will a higher provision of other leave by an employer be impacted by our introducing statutory domestic violence leave.<br/><br/>Deputy Cronin made a number of broad points on gender equality and what we are seeking to achieve here.  She spoke about equal and accessible childcare.  We have taken a big step in this year's budget by looking to achieve a 25% average cut in the cost of childcare fees by the very significant investment we are putting into the national childcare scheme.  It will be a subsidised system that cuts parents' costs.  We have also provided core funding to support services.  The Deputy referred to the idea of women handing their children over to other women to be cared for in childcare and referenced that the vast majority of the workforce in early years is female.  The figure is about 97%.  Again, we were pleased to secure a pay increase for 73% of them through the employment regulation order that is funded through core funding.  It is a really important for workers who are by and large female.<br/><br/>A number of Deputies referenced other forms of leave.  Deputy Cronin mentioned bereavement leave on the death of a child.  I think Deputy Martin Kenny referred to leave following a criminal assault or something like that.  Deputies Higgins and Sherlock referred to miscarriage leave and other Deputies mentioned other forms of leave.  Every one of them sounds like an entirely valid reason for leave to be given.  We have done a lot of work on the forms of leave we are bringing forward in this Bill.  There has been engagement with the social partners, namely, unions, employers and other representative groups.  On the specific issue of miscarriage leave, and following on from a Private Members' Bill that was in the Seanad I think a year ago, my Department has committed to doing further research.  That research is ongoing.  Deputies will be bringing forward other proposals on leave and they need to be discussed and understood in the round.  To sound a note of caution on any of those proposals, it is not, in any way, to say they are not valid and very real reasons for leave to be given.<br/><br/>Moving to a final point on the domestic violence provisions, we are proposing that it will be reviewed after two years so that we can have an understanding of its implementation, its take-up and whether we should be looking to move from five days.  Much legislation nowadays has a review period.  We felt because this statutory entitlement is so new and we will be one of the first countries in Europe doing it, it is important we examine it relatively soon after it is introduced to see how it is being implemented.  We picked the two-year period to allow two employment cycles to understand if there are any issues around it and if there are any ways we can support it through the policies we are looking to bring forward it as well.  That is just a wise step to take when bringing in brand new leave like this, which is innovative, in that you have a full understanding of its implications.  If elements of it need to be tweaked, that can be done in subsequent legislation.<br/><br/>Deputy Sherlock raised a number of points about the cut-off point of 12 years of age for accessibility of care leave and flexible leave.  The directive itself provides for these to be applied up to the age of eight years.  We have extended it and applied it up to the age of 12 years but it is important to say, especially with medical care leave, that a parent who is also a carer for a child can, where the child has gone beyond the age of 12 years, still apply for this leave.  Indeed, a parent who is a carer for a child who is now an adult can also apply for the medical care leave.<br/><br/>There was some discussion on the grounds for refusal, especially of flexible leave.  There is a balance here in that if you are too specific, you are seen as giving a charter to, and lots of ways for, employers to get out of it and if you are too vague, it is seen as giving them any reason.  We are trying to strike a balance here.  There has been a similar discussion in the context on remote working.  We are bound by the directive we are implementing and it is clear that when considering requests for flexible working arrangements, employers should be able to take into account the duration of the flexible working arrangements requested, the employer's resources and operational capacity to effect such arrangements.  The employer should be able to decide to accept or refuse a worker's request for flexible working arrangements.  It is true to say that this is a right to request and not an automatic right to flexible work.  The right to request is the right that is protected and provided for in the directive.  It would not be possible to provide an exhaustive list of reasons for refusal within the legislation.  Doing that would risk limiting the right we are trying to create.<br/><br/>Deputy Sherlock also asked why a person must be employee for six months to avail of the right.  That is set out in section 13B(4) which provides that a &quot;...flexible working arrangement [for caring purposes] shall not commence before a time when the employee concerned has completed 6 months continuous employment with the employer concerned&quot;.  Section 13B(5) provides for workers on temporary contracts to have been in previous employment with the employer for at least six months, deemed as a continuous period of service for the purpose of calculating the qualifying period.  Providing a minimum length of service before an employee can commence a flexible working arrangement allows the employer the time to assess the plausibility and the practicalities of a request from a new employee.  Employers can of course waive that period if they wish.  When you look at the other forms of leave, many of them require a minimum period.  For parental leave and carer's leave, there is a one-year minimum period of employment and even the statutory sick leave scheme requires a 13-week period of continuous service.<br/><br/>Deputy Cairns and I think Deputy Harkin asked what information an employer can require from the employee under the legislation.  Section 5 of the Bill inserts a new section 13A into the 1998 Act.  Section 13A(8) sets out what information an employer may request when in receipt of a confirmation of leave for medical care purposes.  This includes information on the employee's relationship with the person for whom care must be provided, the nature of the significant care and support and evidence relating to their need for significant care and support.  Section 13A(9) states that the &quot;relevant evidence&quot; may be a medical certificate or where that is not available some other form of evidence.  These provisions are mirrored in section 6 in respect of a request for flexible working.  Again, the provision of this leave is closely modelled on existing provisions in family leave legislation and, in particular, the Parental Leave Act 1998 that it amends.  Information of a similar nature is sought for other forms of leave, such as parental leave, where information on the child can be requested, including on any disability.  Again, for <i>force majeure</i>leave, a statement of facts must be provided to support the leave but obviously any legislation we bring forward and the application and implementation of it has to be done in a GDPR-compliant way.  GDPR is part of EU and domestic law and everything that is done in this or in any other legislation must be done in a GDPR-compatible manner.<br/><br/>There are a number of other points I will briefly follow up on.  Deputy Cairns raised the dissatisfaction about domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV, leave being brought in as a Committee Stage amendment.  The thinking here is that work had been under way on this directive prior to me becoming Minister and implementing the various issues.  DSGBV leave was discussed in the context of a motion from I think Sinn F&eacute;in in December 2020.  At that point, I had articulated that I was looking to bring forward separate legislation but officials correctly advised we could implement it more quickly by bringing it in as an amendment to this legislation.  The amendments will come forward on Committee Stage, so they will be seen on that Stage, on Report Stage and all the way through the Seanad.  With the goal being to get DSGBV leave onto the Statute Book as quickly as possible, it is the right thing to do to include it as a Committee Stage amendment to this Bill.</p> <p>One of the four elements that probably has not got the attention it deserves is the change we are bringing to breastfeeding breaks.  Breastfeeding breaks are part of Irish law and have been since 2004.  Under the law, a woman is entitled to take an hour's paid break per day.  She can take it as one 60-minute break, two 30-minute breaks or three 20-minute breaks, to breastfeed or to express milk.  It is only guaranteed in the first six months and the vast majority of women take their full 26 weeks of maternity leave, so hardly any women have taken up this right.  We have a nice-looking right on our Statute Book that no one can avail of.  That is why it is so significant that we are moving from six months to two years, so women will be able to avail of this significant right for an 18-month period, for one hour per day.  It will be a significant step to reducing those low levels of breastfeeding in our country and to helping and promoting the return of women to the workplace following pregnancy.  It is a significant point.  It is not required by EU law, but it is the Government following through on a commitment in the programme for Government.<br/><br/>I will address comments made by Deputies T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and Mattie McGrath.  This legislation does not delete the words &quot;woman&quot; or &quot;women&quot; from any legislation.  That is clear in section 15 of the Bill.  I will not get into that any more but to be clear, this Bill does not delete the word &quot;women&quot; from Irish legislation.<br/><br/>Deputies Higgins and Harkin referred to the issue of maternity leave for Oireachtas Members.  My Department is working on that issue.  We had initial engagement with the women's caucus and subsequent engagement with all female Members of the Oireachtas about their views of what this would look like.  We are continuing to work on that.  It is essential and needs to be addressed in this term of government.<br/><br/>The policy that we are bringing in for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence leave is important.  I referred to it earlier.  We need to support smaller employers that do not have a big HR departments in implementing this leave.  That is a response to an issue raised by employer groups in our engagement with them.<br/><br/>Deputy Harkin made a point about leave for medical care purposes being paid or unpaid.  There is a balance here.  There are different types of leave.  In existing and new leave, there is a balance between it being paid for by the employer, paid for by the State and unpaid leave.  In this legislation, we are introducing domestic violence leave which would be paid for by the employer.  We are introducing the leave for medical care purposes, which would be unpaid.  It is also worth remembering existing <i>force majeure</i>leave, which is paid leave.  The Government has taken other steps where the leave is paid as a social protection benefit.  This Government has brought in five extra weeks of parents' leave per parent over the past three years.  It is paid as a social protection benefit.  There is a balance here.  There has to be a degree of flexibility between the cost being shared by the employer, the State, and also in certain circumstances where it is an unpaid leave measure.<br/><br/>The title of this Bill includes the phrase, &quot;work life balance&quot;, which is the focus of what we are trying to achieve with this legislation.  The reality, as we know, is that family life and caring responsibilities do not pause between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. every day.  If we are to be a more equal and more progressive country, the Government has to help parents and it has to help carers to balance their work and family lives.  The Government must be at the forefront in ensuring that our lives reflect and foster that evolving relationship between family life, work, and caring responsibilities.  We have to support people to have the time and space to care for their loved ones and to respond to the various challenges that life can bring.<br/><br/>This Bill is Ireland's most ambitious legislation directed solely at improving work-life balance.  It will help to deliver that better balance.  It will deliver a right to request flexible working so that mothers, fathers and carers can be there for their children and families.  It will deliver five days of leave per year for care for serious medical issues, so that in the most stressful moments of parents' lives, their focus can be solely on supporting a person who is ill.  It will extend breastfeeding breaks from six months to two years.  It will, for the first time, introduce paid leave for the victims of domestic violence.  This will make Ireland one of the first countries in the EU to do this.  This is transformative legislation that will protect and promote women's participation in the workplace.  I commend this legislation to the House.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.359" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1502" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="15:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300039#QQ00700"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>I welcome the opportunity to introduce the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022.  It brings several improvements to our criminal law, including important provisions to help us to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and to tackle organised crime.  It includes new measures to address stalking and harassment, a new stand-alone offence of non-fatal strangulation, and an increase in the maximum penalty or sentence for conspiracy to murder from ten years to life.  I intend to bring further measures on Committee Stage.  Most significantly, I will propose an increase to the maximum penalty for the offence of assault causing harm from five years to ten years' imprisonment.</p>  <p>  We have seen cases where victims have been stabbed, their bones have been broken, they have had boiling water and sugar poured on them while pregnant and they have been left with serious mental and physical damage but the sentences imposed on the abusers have been, quite simply, too low.  That is why this Bill will double the maximum sentence for assault causing harm, which is one of the most common offences in domestic violence cases, from five years to ten years.  I hope new stand-alone offences will encourage victims to report what has happened to them.  That is why I am proposing new stand-alone offences for stalking and non-fatal strangulation.</p>  <p>  We know that stalking ruins lives.  I thank Una Ring and Eve McDowell, a close friend of mine, who used their own experiences to drive a brave campaign to bring about reform.  Under this Bill, anyone convicted of our new stalking offence will face up to ten years in prison.</p>  <p>  Strangling in domestic abuse is often a predictor of even more serious violence or death.  Abusers convicted of our new offence of non-fatal strangulation will also face up to ten years in prison and potentially life in the most serious cases.  These reforms will help us achieve zero tolerance and to build stronger, safer communities.  Earlier this year, I launched our Zero Tolerance plan, the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  Its aim is to bring about changes in attitudes and also in systems to ensure there is zero tolerance in Irish society for such violence.  Part of achieving this is ensuring that our criminal law is fit for purpose with the right offences in place to reflect the crimes that are sadly commonplace in our society, with perpetrators punished in a way that reflects the harm their actions cause, and with appropriate protections in place to protect and support victims and to prevent escalation.</p>  <p>  I will begin with stalking and harassment, which are addressed in Parts 4 and 5 of the Bill.  Stalking is an extremely serious and intrusive crime that can cause devastating psychological distress.  It may also be a precursor to acts of direct physical violence.  While stalking can currently be prosecuted as harassment under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, the evidence in other countries shows that having a specific and stand-alone offence of stalking leads to greater awareness, an increase in the number of victims coming forward and an increase in the number of prosecutions.  This is ultimately what we want.</p> <p>We want to create a system that victims know will support them and will protect them.  That system needs clear and robust legislation that recognises what was done to them as a serious crime.  As I have already mentioned Members will be familiar with the exceptional work done by Stalking Ireland, in particular its cofounders, Eve McDowell and Una Ring.  Eve and Una have shown incredible bravery in recounting what happened to them and sharing their experiences, supporting others who have been affected and pursuing their campaign tirelessly to bring these issues to the fore.  I do not believe they expected so many people to come forward who had been affected by stalking and harassment.  The fact that so many have come forward illustrates why laws like this are needed.  The lived experience of these courageous victims and survivors have helped us to identify how our laws need to be strengthened.  I also acknowledge the work of Senator Lisa Chambers on this issue.  I was pleased to work with her to bring about this reform.<br/><br/>This Bill puts in place several important changes.  It will establish in Irish law a stand-alone offence of stalking.  This offence will cover any conduct that puts someone in fear of violence or causes serious alarm and distress such as to have an adverse effect on the person's day-to-day life.  The conduct in question is illustrated by a wide list of possible behaviours, such as following, spying upon, communicating with or about and impersonating.  This list is not exhaustive.  This open approach is important.  We know, sadly, that stalkers constantly identify new and novel ways of invading victims' lives, so the law needs to be flexible enough to recognise this.  Conduct does not necessarily need to be persistent to fall under the offence.  A single incident may constitute stalking situations where a victim is not actually aware of the stalking behaviour at the time it occurs but discovers it later.  It carries a maximum sentence of ten years' imprisonment.  Courts are required to treat as an aggravating factor that a person has been convicted of other offences against the victim.<br/><br/>The Bill will significantly widen the existing harassment offence.  This offence will remain important, covering harassment behaviours that are broader than stalking.  It is committed where the perpetrator's persistent conduct seriously interferes with another's peace and privacy, or causes alarm, distress or harm.  The same open list of possible behaviours will apply to this as it does to stalking.<br/><br/>It will introduce a new system of civil orders restraining stalking behaviours.  These are vital additions to the law which will allow earlier intervention and do not require a criminal prosecution, which often prevents people from coming forward.  They go significantly further than what is possible under domestic violence laws.  I believe their availability will encourage victims to come forward and engage with supports at an earlier stage.  An order may be sought by either an affected person or by the garda&iacute; on his or her behalf.  The court may make an order where there are reasonable grounds for believing that a respondent has engaged in relevant conduct, and the making of the order is necessary and proportionate to protect the safety and welfare of the applicant.  It is important to emphasise that while the definitions used in the order are aligned with the new stalking offence, the standard for obtaining the order is very different from that required to obtain a criminal conviction for stalking.  To get an order it must be shown simply that the respondent has engaged in stalking behaviour and that it is necessary and proportionate to grant the order.  Intent on behalf of the respondent does not need to be shown nor does it have to be shown that the applicant has actually been placed in fear or was caused serious alarm and distress, only that the conduct is likely to have that effect.  I believe that this approach will ensure that orders are available where they are needed.<br/><br/>The procedural protections in place for domestic violence orders will also apply to the civil order procedure.  These include that evidence may be given by video-link, that proceedings will take place in private and that limitations are placed on cross-examination by the respondent in person.  Breach of the civil order is of course in itself a criminal offence.  It may also form part of the basis for a prosecution for stalking or harassment.<br/><br/>While this Bill is progressing through the House it is important to emphasise that stalking is already a crime.  It can be and it is being prosecuted.  For those who are now suffering there is support available.  Offences already carry potential sentences of up to ten years.  While this Bill will certainly improve the law, perpetrators should not in any way believe that they can act with impunity.  I want to make that very clear.  While improvements to the law are a first step, they must be supported by practical training.  That is a key element of Supporting a Victim's Journey, my plan to improve the criminal justice system for vulnerable victims and witnesses.  It includes training for garda&iacute; separate from the training for those in the divisional protective service units that are now in every Garda division.  It also includes training for solicitors, barristers and the Judiciary.  It is vital that when people come forward they know that the law is on their side and that they will be treated respectfully by everyone they engage with.  I am considering further procedural enhancements to the regime both in respect of criminal offences and civil procedure and I will propose amendments on Committee Stage.<br/><br/>I will move to the provisions in respect of non-fatal strangulation, which are provided for in sections 11 and 12.  Non-fatal strangulation unfortunately is a common feature of domestic abuse and a strong predictor of even more serious violence.  It is overwhelmingly perpetrated by men against women.  While the existing assault offences, which are under sections 2, 3 and 4 of the 1997 Act, cover strangulation, strong arguments have been made for the introduction of a stand-alone offence.  Research has suggested that a history of strangulation presents a seven-fold increase in the risk of death.  Internationally, after stabbing, strangulation is the second most common method of killing in adult female homicides.  Research also highlights that non-fatal strangulation is frequently used as a tool of coercion often accompanied by threats to kill.  The long-term physical and mental health effects of strangulation are also serious.  Studies report that even where there is little to no visible injury longer term physical effects have been identified including internal bleeding, dizziness, loss of memory and other neurological effects.  There is also an increased risk of miscarriage.  Psychological outcomes identified include depression, anxiety, suicidality, post traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, and dissociation.  The undercharging of strangulation and asphyxiation has been identified as a problem in several countries.  The lack of observable injuries means that the offender's conduct may be minimised and the offender may be charged as equivalent to the least serious assault in Ireland.  In recognition of these issues new offences of non-fatal strangulation have been introduced in New Zealand, the UK and the US.  The Garda Commissioner in one of the first meetings I had with him requested the introduction of such an offence in Ireland and we have been working on this.<br/><br/>The Bill would establish two new offences, under sections 3A and 4A of the 1997 Act, aligned in terms of penalties with the offences of assault causing harm, section 3, and causing serious harm, section 4, respectively.  These new offences will establish the seriousness of strangulation and ensure that strangulation convictions are identifiable as such to support further court and care actions.  The effect of adding section 3A is that any strangulation or suffocation will be treated as an offence of similar seriousness to an assault causing harm regardless of whether observable harm or injury is caused or indeed proven.  Where the strangulation causes serious harm the second offence under section 4A aligns with the existing section 4 offence of causing serious harm, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.  The section 3A offence is subject to a defence of showing that the other person consented to the strangulation or suffocation.  This reflects the alignment of the offence with the existing assault offence for which an absence of consent must be proven.  Unlike sections 2 and 3 an evidential burden is placed on the defendant to raise this as a defence.  This defence is not available in cases where serious harm is caused.<br/><br/>In regard to assaults causing harm, these assaults may fall under either section 3 or section 4 of the 1997 Act.  Section 3 currently carries a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment.  Section 4 carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and applies in cases of serious harm.  Serious harm is relatively narrowly defined and therefore section 3 covers a wide range of assaults which although falling short of causing the most serious harm, may nonetheless be of significant gravity.  I mentioned many of them earlier.  Prosecutions under this section have included attacks involving stabbing or broken bones, multiple perpetrators, deliberate infliction of severe pain, attacks against vulnerable persons and attacks causing long-term mental and physical detriment.  The Office of the DPP and others have raised concerns that the five-year maximum penalty is too low given the gravity of the harm caused.  I think we would all agree with that.  It is apparent that the maximum sentence has been used repeatedly by the courts as a starting point for calculating a sentence before mitigating factors are taken into account.  This is unusual compared with other offences where the maximum sentence is reserved for the most exceptional cases.  For the more serious offences falling under section 3 the five-year maximum penalty is lower than would apply in other jurisdictions and lower than comparable Irish theft and criminal damage offences, both of which carry maximum penalties of ten years.  I am not sure what that tells us, perhaps that property is more important than we women are.  On this basis I am satisfied that the existing maximum penalty is not commensurate with the gravity of the offences. The Government has approved the introduction of an amendment which will increase this maximum penalty to ten years and I intend to bring this forward on Committee Stage.  I will emphasise that the purpose of this change is not to increase every sentence under section 3.  Courts will of course continue to weigh the gravity of the offence and the appropriate aggravating and mitigating factors but I believe that they will have a more appropriate and wide range of sentences available.  As I noted the section 3A the non-fatal strangulation offence is aligned with section 3 and I intend that both offences will have a ten-year maximum penalty.<br/><br/>Part 2 of this Bill provides for an increase in the penalty for conspiracy to murder from ten years to life.</p> <p> An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has struck many serious blows against organised crime.  It has built international law enforcement coalitions to relentlessly pursue these gangs across the world.  As Minister for Justice, I will always ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and our courts have the tools, resources and technology that they need to take firm and decisive action.</p> <p> That includes strong laws to put those who try to spread murder and misery behind bars.  The offence of conspiracy to murder is vital in tackling gangland thugs.  These murders are not committed by individuals acting alone.  Even though the good work of the Garda often prevents murder before it happens, the intent and plan to murder was still there.  That is why I am increasing the maximum sentence for conspiracy to murder from ten years to life imprisonment.  We cannot and will not allow these gangs to take hold as we build our strong, safe communities.</p> <p> Part 3 of the Bill contains amendments in respect of firearms.  Section 8 amends the offence provisions of the Firearms Act 1925.  The effect of the section is to ensure that forensic analysts do not commit a firearms offence by being in possession, using or carrying firearms in the performance of their functions.  Section 9 is a technical amendment that ensures there is consistency in the meaning of the term &ldquo;firearm&rdquo; across our legislation in this area.  </p> <p> I will be bringing a number of amendments on Committee Stage in relation to firearms.  These will include a similar provision as proposed in section 8, exempting Garda civilian staff from firearms offences, a cap on the licensing of semi-automatic centre-fire rifles and the regulation of firing ranges.  The overall aim is to ensure that our legislation in this area continues to support public safety.</p> <p> Part 6 of the Bill provides for miscellaneous amendments to a number of other enactments.  Apart from those that I have already referred to, I would mention in particular section 36, which amends section 23A of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 to apply the fixed charge offence regime to section 21, which is on the control of access to certain events, and section 22, which is on the surrender and seizure of intoxicating liquor.</p> <p> Section 41 provides for the repeal of Part 4 of the Prisons Act 2007, which relates to the planning process for large prison developments to bring this in line with other EU legal requirements.  </p> <p> I have also referred to several amendments that I expect to be introduced on Committee Stage, but I expect to introduce perhaps some more on the following matters.  Witness anonymity, for example, in respect of at-risk witnesses or undercover police officers, is currently addressed on a non-statutory basis.  The Court of Appeal has highlighted the importance of having a clear legal basis for determining whether and under what conditions anonymous evidence should be admitted.  My Department has been engaging with the Office of the Attorney General to develop such a legal basis and I expect to introduce this on Committee Stage.</p> <p> Section 25 of the 1997 Act provides that evidence may be given by certificate by a doctor to give evidence of harm and that it would be provided without the doctor attending court.  This avoids unnecessary barriers and delays to the conduct of criminal trials and also ensures that doctors are not diverted from their work to attend in person at criminal trials.  The Supreme Court has identified limitations in the current approach and I expect to bring forward changes to allow it to be used under a much wider range of circumstances.</p> <p> I also intend to extend section 10 of the Misuse of Drugs Act to allow certificate evidence to be provided under a wider range of circumstances.</p> <p> Further amendments are intended in respect of: the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006, to allow for situations where the chair of the Mental Health Board may be temporarily incapacitated; the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008, to facilitate the return of confiscated financial assets to the requesting state; the Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018, to remove certain dual criminality requirements; and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, in respect of interference with or disruption of court proceedings.</p> <p> As all colleagues will agree, this Bill is wide-ranging.  However, in conclusion, I wish to bring the House back to the key elements and to express my gratitude and profound respect for the work not just of Una Ring and Eve McDowell, but for all victims and survivors of domestic violence.</p> <p> Zero tolerance means that we do not turn a blind eye to abuse in the many forms that it comes.  We will support victims with compassion and give them the unstinting backing of our laws. </p> <p> I commend the Bill to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.362" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1607" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="15:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300041#SS00200"><p>The Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022 is very welcome.  It is clear to all of us that this legislation is coming from the pledge that we will implement a zero tolerance strategy, particularly in regard to violence, domestic violence, sexual violence and violence against women.  It is very welcome in respect of that.  Anything that can support victims of stalking, harassment and gender-based violence is, of course, welcome.  I would also like to commend the many people who have advocated and worked so hard to bring this about and make it happen.</p>  <p>  Evidence from across other jurisdictions indicates that once stalking is named as a criminal offence, as the Minister said in her address, it increases the reporting of that offence.  It raises the awareness of people who may just think that person who is following them or whatever is harmless; they realise this is serious, has implications and is a reportable offence that has severe consequences for that person, which it should.</p>  <p>  I was reading the work that was done, in fairness to the Library and Research Service, and the definitions of what we are talking about, which is following, watching, monitoring, tracking or spying upon a person.  We are talking about pestering a person; impersonating a person; communications with or about a person, usually unwarranted or not required; purporting to act or communicate on behalf of a person; disclosing to other persons private information in respect of a person; interfering with the property, including the pets, of a person; loitering in the vicinity of a person; and causing, without the consent of a person, an electronic or communication information system operated by a person to function in a particular way.  The detail of that gets into what this is about, which is a certain small minority of individuals act in the most devious way when it comes to undermining the very integrity of another human being.  While some of the cases that have been in the media are about people who were strangers who were engaged in this, very often, unfortunately, it is not a stranger.  Very often it is a person who is very close to the victim who behaves in this way.  It is part of that coercive control type of activity that we have seen in the past which, thankfully, has been legislated for and there is work in respect of that.</p>  <p>  The other aspects of the Bill are also welcome, particularly the aspects that increase sentences and the options for serious crime.  That is valid and something that we want to see brought forward.  We need to, and probably will, get into more details on Committee Stage as to the definitions of what all of that means.  We always have to be conscious of unintended consequences and what can potentially go wrong in regard to all of this.  We need to be very careful around that.</p>  <p>  We have discussed before the difficulties faced by people who have been stalked and harassed but cannot obtain a restraining order because they did not fit into the narrow parameters of the Domestic Violence Act.  This legislation is moving in that direction.  I am glad to see that the Bill will allow victims to obtain these orders with the changes made by this legislation.  Of particular use is the fact that the stand-alone offence of stalking will cover situations where victims find out about some or all of the stalking behaviour after it has happened &ndash; they do not have to know about it previously.  Dealing with victims of stalking, we have experienced that it can be the case that they do not realise the lengths to which the stalker goes until they are middle of the Garda investigation.</p>  <p>  Stalking behaviour absolutely destroys the lives of victims in many of these cases.  The victim is often forced to move house and change jobs.  In some instances, their families and friends also fall victim to this insidious behaviour.  I am aware of cases where victims have been forced to pursue orders in the civil courts to prohibit stalking behaviour.  Hopefully, this would mean that would not necessarily have to happen.  Not only does this take an emotional and mental toll on the victim, but it also includes the added expense of legal fees that may limit the ability to take civil action in the first place.</p>  <p>  The introduction of special measures within the courts to protect victims of stalking, harassment and non-fatal strangulation is also welcome because it will finally offer some protection to victims who have the abuser in court settings.  I also am reminded of the particular measures in this legislation around strangulation and suffocation.  That particular terror which is visited on a victim is something that, as the Minister mentioned, can often be hidden, is not something that is very obvious and does not leave marks as other instances of abuse may.</p> <p>Those measures are welcome.  We must ensure they are put in place properly.  It is important to note that it is often the case that stalkers choose to represent themselves in a criminal prosecution just to continue the torment of the victim.  That must be stopped.</p> <p> I pay tribute to those in Safe Ireland and Women's Aid who have been a consistent voice for law reform in respect of stalking and non-fatal strangulation.  In particular, the work of Women's Aid on the Too Into You campaign has assisted young people to recognise the signs of unhealthy relationships or coercive control, which, on many occasions, can also be symptoms of stalking and harassment.  The work of Una Ring and Eve McDowell should be mentioned.  As Deputies are aware, they have been pivotal in ensuring this legislation was brought forward and that it moves forward in a proper manner.</p> <p> The Minister referred to the other aspects of the Bill.  One part of it that needs to be examined closely relates to firearms.  The Minister stated that she will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage in that regard.  There is concern, particularly among those who are in the sporting field, in respect of a cap on the licensing of semi-automatic and centre-fire rifles and the regulation of firing ranges.  We need to be cautious about this in order to ensure there are no unintended consequences.  People who are engaged in that sporting activity are concerned that they not be in any way curtailed in pursuing it.  We need to be careful and conscious of that in the context of the Bill.</p> <p> The main focus of the Bill is on protecting the victims of very serious crime and ensuring that non-fatal strangulation and suffocation are brought into the legislation, as well as ensuring that we have laws that deal with these serious cases.</p> <p> I will leave it at that.  I hope we can get more into the detail of the Bill on Committee Stage, and I look froward to seeing the amendments the Minister will bring forward.  There is a concern regarding the aspect I mentioned but, apart from that, the Bill is very welcome.</p></speech>

As my colleague has said, it is welcome and a positive step in the right direction.  I, too, commend the tireless campaigning of Eve McDowell and Una Ring.  These women have shown immense bravery and commitment in campaigning for stalking to be a stand-alone offence.  Both of them were victims of stalking.  They saw at first hand how the charges stalkers face under the current legislation are grossly inadequate.  The same is true of the sentencing options.  When one reads the accounts of the terror and horror these women endured, it is unimaginable.  Una Ring's stalker was eventually caught by the Garda in a surveillance operation while he was breaking into her home with a crowbar and duct tape.  His sentence started at nine years but he ended up getting just five years.  That is shockingly inadequate justice in the context of the terror that he inflicted.</p>  <p>  The Bill provides a legal basis for a stand-alone offence of stalking.  It will amend the current offence of harassment and provide for court orders to restrain stalking behaviour, as well as procedural protections for victims during the court process.  The Bill also introduces stand-alone offences in respect of non-fatal strangulation and suffocation.  The new stalking offence covers any conduct that puts the victim in fear of violence or causes the victim serious alarm and distress that has a substantial adverse impact on his or her usual day-to-day activities.  The introduction of special measures in court settings for victims of stalking and non-fatal strangulation has been strongly welcomed.  In the context of deeply traumatising acts of violence, these measures will finally prevent accused persons confronting their victims in court.  The measures are long overdue.  As I stated, I very much welcome the Bill and the zero-tolerance approach being taken in respect of this offence.</p>  <p>  I wish to highlight the ongoing street violence on City Quay.  Residents have to put up with ongoing street violence and harassment.  They are being held hostage.  The garda&iacute; in Pearse Street station have done a significant amount and engaged in a meaningful way.  Superintendent Dermot McKenna has done a fantastic job in meeting residents, trying to resolve the matter and putting resources into the issue.  The local garda&iacute; are doing a fantastic job but they do not have enough resources.  More resources need to be put into these communities in order to put an end to this random street violence - some people call it antisocial behaviour - which is having a devastating effect on the City Quay community.  I ask the Minister to ensure that resources are put in place to address it.</p></speech>

My colleague put it well when he referred to the need for zero tolerance when it comes to domestic violence , gender-based violence and violence against women.  There can be no place for that in society.  As previous speakers indicated, there is no room for a blind eye to be turned on this matter.  It is vital that stalking be named as a charge.  In fairness, we have dealt with a considerable number of issues that have been in the public domain and through the courts system involving people who have suffered greatly from stalking at varying levels.  Obviously, all Deputies have dealt with people who have been put under undue pressure, but it goes right up to the worst cases of violence.  Wherever possible, we need to ensure that the Garda has legislation such as this to enable it to act quickly.</p>  <p>  At the time of the dreadful case of what happened to Ashling Murphy, a matter came to me, possibly on the basis of this issue being in the public domain, involving young women who were being subjected to behaviour that I can best describe as being where stalking meets pestering meets interfering with property and all the rest of it.  It was raised with me from the point of view of needing to ensure it was dealt with adequately by the Garda and so on.  All Deputies get that sometimes, unwelcome as it is.  That is what you are dealing with as regards particular issues.  There will always be issues, times and places, and there can be an escalation.  Nobody wants to be the person who did not take action at the early stage when there were warning signs.  We need to ensure we have all those parts in play.  The Garda needs to be resourced and there needs to be adequate training across the board to ensure the necessary protections are in place and that there is engagement at the point when it is harassment.  We know about the huge impact that can have on people's lives.</p>  <p>  The Bill is very welcome.  I do not think there will be any major difficulty in dealing with the sporting difficulties raised by Deputy Martin Kenny.  We all accept, in the world in which we live, that we need to provide the strongest possible laws and tools to deal with serious organised crime.</p>  <p>  When dealing with matters relating to criminal justice, I find it difficult not to end up on my hobby horse, which I would much prefer was not my hobby horse, namely, the issue of drug crime and, in particular, drug debt intimidation.  The latter involves individuals and families who come under severe pressure and harassment from criminal elements to pay up what may be a debt but, in most cases, as all Deputies have seen, involves interest rates that are on a spectacular level, where &euro;400 becomes &euro;800 and then &euro;1,200, or &euro;1,200 becomes &euro;6,000 very quickly.  On some level, the business model absolutely works in the sense that I suspect that in many cases the dealers are quite happy when payment is not made immediately.  These are the issues that come across the desks of Deputies and in respect of which they deal directly with the Garda.  All those present know of the serious players, such as the organisation referred to as the Kinahan cartel, and others who are involved in this, but there is no town or village in the State that is not under severe pressure from these criminals.  All Deputies accept on some level that the war on drugs has been well and truly lost and that we need something far more novel that works for everyone in the context of dealing with that element of criminality to which I refer and providing protection and early intervention for families and communities.</p> <p>Beyond that there are the addiction services and the necessary health response.  We hope that a date will be set for the citizens' assembly, that it can happen as quickly as possible in the new year, that the real novel response that is necessary will happen and that there will be sufficient courage to come up with possible solutions, whether we are talking about the Portuguese models or whatever else.  We then need to have the courage in here to follow through on it.  I support this Bill.  We all know the complete necessity of dealing with gender-based and domestic violence and with the whole issue of stalking.</p></speech>

For too long there have been gaps in our legislation that have failed many people over the years.  I am grateful to see that the provisions of this Bill are seeking to address some of those shortcomings.</p>  <p>  One of the provisions of this Bill is to provide a legal basis for the stand-alone offence of stalking and the amendment of the current offence of harassment.  It also provides for court orders restraining stalking behaviour, alongside protections for victims during the court process.  It cannot be over-emphasised how important this is for those who have been victims of these offences over the years.  At present, stalkers are charged by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with intimidation or on similar grounds but no specific legislation exists for stalking.  Campaigners have brought attention to how insufficient this is in dealing with the offence that is frightening beyond belief and can take away any sense of autonomy on the part of the victim.  </p>  <p>  We have heard how the effects of this can stay with the victim, even if it is a single incident or if it is done multiple times.  Victims of stalking have to change nearly every aspect of their lives.  There are cases in which victims feel they have to suffer in silence, such is the nature of stalking and the impact that it has on those who are subjected to it.  Family life, routine, and a range of other elements of life that we all take for granted are affected and the mental turmoil it inflicts upon those targeted is unspeakable.  Stalking is like imprisoning the target with invisible walls.</p>  <p>  I also wish to acknowledge the work done by campaigners Una Ring and Eve McDowell for bringing stalking into sharp focus.  This is what those who carry out this offence hate; their crime becoming public knowledge or being addressed publicly, when what they rely on is a campaign of terror or surveillance that is carried out silently.  But these campaigners also shone a light upon the inadequacies of the charges faced by their stalkers, which were not strong enough to reflect the impact of their actions; nor were their sentences.  This then is an important Bill when it comes to stalking, as it covers any conduct that either puts the victim in fear of violence or causes the victim serious alarm and distress that has an adverse impact on their usual day-to-day activities.</p>  <p>  In terms of its effectiveness, we just have to look at the UK where, once stalking was named as a criminal offence, the perceived power of he stalker was broken.  No longer could they rely upon the terror they were inflicting to keep their victim silent.  This is evident from the visible increase in the reporting of that offence to the authorities.  A route was there to break the hold of the stalker.</p>  <p>  Finally, I want to recognise and commend the inclusion of special measures that will prevent an accused person from confronting their victim in court.  Again, this seeks to sever the campaign of intimidation being carried out by the stalker which could, if left unaddressed, continue into the court room.  </p>  <p>  I welcome this Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.368" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1562" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="15:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300043#UU00300"><p>I thank the Minister for presenting this Bill, which is very important in the context of a number of areas in her Department.</p>  <p>  Crime tears at the fabric of our society.  It chips away at the dignity and pride of our communities and it lures vulnerable young people down paths which often lead to ruin.  Few criminal activities do more to damage lives and communities than the activities of gangs.  The complete lack of regard for the rule of law and for the sanctity of human life cannot be left unchallenged.  A message must be sent to those who feel they can operate outside the constraints of the law and profit from death and destruction.  We see these criminals and over many years we have had to deal with criminal gangs causing all sorts of problems in our State.  Those individuals must face the rigours of our judicial system. </p>  <p>  I have full confidence that the Garda, the Minister and the Department are working diligently to strike at the heart of gangland activity to cripple the ability of criminals to spread their influence.  I, therefore, particularly welcome the significant changes on sentencing that this Bill will introduce.  Among the changes under this legislation, we will see an increase in the maximum sentence for conspiracy to murder from ten years to life.  It cannot be that because the Garda is efficient and effective enough, or that criminals are incompetent enough to have been caught in the act, that the offender is therefore treated with greater leniency than if they had, in fact, fulfilled their dark intentions in the first place. </p>  <p>  Gangs operating within the State are often doing their very best to flood our towns and cities with drugs and mayhem.  They believe they are untouchable.  In the recent past we have learned that they are not untouchable from either the arm of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or, indeed, their rivals.  We must strike at the heart of their operations and target all levels of their organisations up and down the country and abroad.  We have done it before and we can do it again.  The establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau was one such successful measure which undoubtedly deterred some criminal gangs from the level of activity that was seen prior to its establishment.  Working with our international partners we can see these gangs dismantled and their members put behind bars. </p>  <p>  Changes to sentencing for assault causing harm will also give our judicial system the freedom to impose appropriate sentences as they relate to individual cases.  The Bill will increase the maximum sentence from five years to ten years for the offence of assault causing harm.  That particular charge is probably one of the most common and while a life sentence can be imposed for an assault causing serious harm, this only covers a very limited subset of the worst assaults.</p>  <p>  I would also note, and as I have noted in earlier debates today, that this will have an important impact of domestic violence rates.  Assault causing harm is a common component of domestic violence incidents and increasing the sentencing will contribute to greater protection for victims.  I commend the Minister on her work with regard to non-fatal strangulation, stalking and the publication of the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, all of which will contribute to the Government&rsquo;s zero tolerance strategy.</p>  <p>  Non-fatal strangulation is a common feature of domestic abuse and a prelude to even more serious violence.  We also know that the vast majority of these incidents are carried out by men, against women.  This act can leave little or no visible marks on the victim, meaning that it can be difficult for the victim to document the attack and feel confident in reporting the matter.  As with many aspects of domestic violence, studies show that non-fatal strangulation is often accompanied by verbal abuse or threats to kill or both.  This leaves its mark, not physical but psychological.  The fear and coercion that a threat to kill can have on an individual can leave lifelong damage and precipitate post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD.  It is a situation that no one should ever have to endure.  The State must use all its strengths to ensure that those perpetrators of such heinous and cowardly attacks face harsher consequences.</p>  <p>  The introduction of new offences relating to stalking will mark an important step change in how we approach such situations.  Stalking is an extremely serious and invasive crime that can cause profound psychological distress.  By bringing in new laws and offences around this area, we can increase the awareness among the general public of the nature of these crimes, allowing for greater reporting and prosecution of the individuals committing such offences. </p>  <p>  I would also like to say that while these crimes do not just affect women, it is the reality that the majority of these crimes are carried out against women by men.  It is therefore incumbent on all men and boys to be aware of what is acceptable and what is not and to call out behaviours and attitudes before they spiral into these intolerable acts.  When men and boys stand up to their peers, when they hear casual sexism, misogyny or see behaviour targeted at women, they must begin the process of creating a safe environment for their own peers, their friends and family members.</p>  <p>  It is not an easy task to step out and to take such steps.  Our education system plays a critical role in empowering young people, both men and women, to be able to say, "Stop, you should not do that".  In fact, I am pleased to see there are now posts within our third level institutions, as announced by the Minister, Deputy Harris, this afternoon to encourage such supports within our third level sector, which is to be welcomed.</p> <p> This legislation has not come a moment too soon.  As I mentioned in an earlier debate this morning, our domestic violence rates are not going in the right direction.  I commend the Minister and her officials for taking the fight to criminals and I believe this Bill will go towards that effort.  There can be no equivocation when it comes to criminality in Ireland, whether it be gangland killers or abusive partners.  Garda&iacute; and the courts must have the power to send a message to people considering engaging in such activity that they will pay for it and that the State, as announced through various other measures, including the Bill which we were debating earlier in regard to domestic violence leave, is there to support them.  I believe that is something all of us in this House support.</p></speech>

The Bill will give a legal basis to a standalone offence of stalking and harassment and allow for court orders to be introduced to try to prevent these crimes happening.  It will also allow for the increase in the term of imprisonment for conspiracy to murder from ten years to life.  All of these measures are to be welcomed.  My party, Sinn F&eacute;in, will be supporting the Bill.  We will work with the Minister to progress it and to make sure it moves to the next Stages.</p>  <p>  While on the topic of crime, I believe we have to get a handle on what is happening across Dublin and beyond.  As we move into the darker evenings and with the usual troublesome period of Hallowe'en approaching, we have to protect our communities.  The recent dreadful carry-on in Cherry Orchard, with the Garda car being rammed, is not unique.  This type of incident has happened in my area and in other areas across Dublin, but it is just that it was not recorded.  Garda&iacute; in my area are doing the very best they can and they sometimes find it impossible because they do not have enough numbers or resources.  All Deputies in the city have seen the rise of antisocial behaviour across the city.</p>  <p>  Our communities deserve to feel safe.  On a personal level, I am sick and tired of the terror that is being put on our communities because of these people with their antisocial behaviour.  I am being contacted regularly by families who feel intimidated and who are looking to move from the area where they have lived all their lives.  We have to say that enough is enough.  We appreciate the work of garda&iacute;, youth workers, families and community representatives who are all trying to do their best to stamp out antisocial behaviour, but the Government has to support this work.  There is a problem with crime, particularly in Dublin.  It is time the Government acknowledged this and that we tried to get a handle on it for our communities.</p></speech>

It is particularly welcome to see stalking as a standalone offence.  A generation of Irish women are familiar with the realities of stalking and harassment.  For too long, these cases and the perpetrators have been protected.  The threat has been dismissed and, often, the victims themselves have been blamed or it is minimised.  Street harassment in particular is often completely dismissed.  Having a standalone offence for stalking is a very good first step but it is only a first step towards stamping out the incidence of stalking and harassment.  There needs to be constant training of garda&iacute; on how to handle these cases.  While great strides have been made in recent years, it is still too common for women to have their fears dismissed when they bring accusations to garda&iacute;.  Indeed, it is not exclusively women and I have had occasion to advise a man in a situation where there was extreme and constant harassment.  I told him that he needed to keep a diary and to notify garda&iacute;.  It is not knowing where it is going to go that is often part of the problem.</p><p>Of course, most people who experience stalking would never go to garda&iacute;.  This is not because they do not feel threatened but because they do not think anything can be done about it, which is why it is welcome see this change.  In the past, I heard of one young woman who was repeatedly stalked by a young man where her social media presence was used to track her down, and she was tracked in public and also at home.  The man in question lived on the west coast of Ireland and, on several occasions, he turned up on her doorstep.  When friends encouraged her to report it to garda&iacute;, she was told that nothing could be done because he had not done anything yet.  The &quot;yet&quot; was a real concern because of what could happen.</p><p>That is the reality of the experience of many people with this kind of harassment, that is, the fear and expectation of stalking escalating into something more and the lack of power to prevent it because the stalking in and of itself was not taken seriously.  I hope the Bill will help to change that attitude but training needs to be given to garda&iacute; to ensure stalking is taken seriously.  It is intimidating and it is harassment, so it is important that it is escalated.</p><p>While I support the introduction of this specific offence of stalking, I would raise one concern.  I am not sure where the boundaries are in some situations.  The Bill states:</p> <blockquote> 	(i) seriously interferes with another&rsquo;s peace and privacy, or<br /><br />(ii) causes alarm, distress or harm to the other[.] </blockquote>  <p>It also refers to:</p> <blockquote> 	(a) following, watching, monitoring, tracking or spying upon a person;<br /><br />(b) pestering a person...<br /><br />(f) disclosing to other persons private information in respect of a person[.] </blockquote>  <p>It strikes me that some of those descriptions could be applied, for example, to investigative journalism or to garda&iacute; themselves.  The Minister might address that in terms of the protections for particular professions.  I know that would not be the intention and it is just to know where those boundaries are.</p><p>We need to provide education on several levels if we are looking to combat the issue of stalking and harassment, often against women but, I stress, not exclusively so.  The Minister might address the issue of what training will be provided and what public messaging there will be to encourage people to report instances of stalking.  There also needs to be fundamental reform of relationships and sexuality education in schools.  Will the Minister let us know if this training will be provided to garda&iacute; and also if her Department intends to have a public messaging campaign around this issue?  Organisations that work to combat violence against women have been calling for this for years.  We need comprehensive, age-appropriate education at all levels to really change the culture.</p><p>In November, the Government passed but delayed the progress of a Bill that we brought forward seeking to guarantee comprehensive and evidence-based relationships and sexuality education.  The Government placed an amendment to the Bill that we put forward and it kicked it forward nine months.  It is now 11 months on and I repeat the call that it needs to be dealt with.  This idea of pushing something forward when it is never dealt with is very frustrating.  We need proper consent and sex education to change the culture regarding how women and girls are treated and viewed in society.  Very little will change without that and nothing will change without resourcing.  I am acutely aware that my county and the Minister&rsquo;s county are the two counties most impacted by the ratio of garda&iacute; to population.</p> <p>Every time the Minister is in the House, I use the opportunity to draw her attention to that.  There is an inequality.  While the deployment of resources can never be fully equal, we are not getting increases in services as our populations grow.  It is just a reactive style of policing, but a proactive style and personnel will be required.  It is not enough to say that the Garda Commissioner has responsibility for the deployment of resources when there is a clear issue of non-deployment of resources in areas whose populations have consistently been increasing rapidly for a long time.  It changes the nature of the kind of policing that people receive.</p> <p> In 2019, Ireland ratified the Istanbul Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence, recognising violence against women as a violation of human rights and a form of discrimination against women.  It created a legal framework at European level to protect women from violence and to prevent, prosecute and eliminate violence against them.  Despite that, there is a gap between the commitments we signed up to under the agreement and the policies and practices of the State.  The standard set by the convention is one refuge space for every 10,000 people whereas Ireland only provides one space for every 10,000 women.  That is a sizable difference and needs to change.  It cuts the amount of refuge spaces that we should be providing in half and leaves male victims of domestic violence by the wayside.  I have encountered people who have had boiling water thrown over them or have been stabbed.  They are rare enough, but we do encounter such cases.  People feel abandoned.</p> <p> I will speak briefly on another aspect of the Bill.  The maximum sentence of conspiracy to murder will increase to a life sentence.  I welcome this change, which, I understand, is being done on foot of Garda investigations into organised crime, including the Kinahan cartel, in circumstances where the Garda has been frustrated by the maximum sentence of ten years that is currently available for conspiracy to murder.  We are all aware that the higher-ups in criminal gangs do not often get their own hands dirty.  Instead, they give the orders and let others take the hit with long sentences if caught.  Without taking away from the agency of the people who were tasked or hired to commit the murders, there also has to be a recognition that the victims would be alive were it not for the orders.  It is important that our laws recognise this reality and are capable of dealing with senior members of gangs and other criminal outfits.</p> <p> I will endorse some of Deputy Mitchell's comments about what is often described as antisocial behaviour.  It is not antisocial behaviour, but criminal behaviour.  That is exactly what we saw recently in Gallanstown.  That community has been subjected to it.  What was different this time was that it was captured on camera.  It is good to see a response.  Too often, though, we hear people saying that someone is under 18 years of age, so they cannot do anything about it.  That is frustrating.  It is also unfair on those young people because it will only escalate into something more serious.  When an issue down the food chain is not addressed, it tends to escalate.  We should stop calling it antisocial behaviour when all too often it is criminal behaviour.  Large numbers of young people, often only 12, 13 or 14 years of age, can intimidate others and ruin their quality of life.  It is important that we get to grips with this.  I receive more complaints about this issue than I do about more serious issues.  It is important that we do something about it because it impacts badly on the quality of people's lives and they feel that it is not being taken seriously.</p></speech>

I will tell the House a sad but true story from my constituency.  A perpetrator was convicted and did some jail time for stalking a particular female.  Some time later, she woke up in the middle of the night to find the perpetrator in her room.  She was horrified and raised the alarm.  Members of her family alerted garda&iacute;, who promptly came, arrested the person concerned and brought him before the courts.  What I will say next is not a criticism of the judge, but the law allowed the person to apply for bail.  Notwithstanding the fact that the garda&iacute; in the case opposed the application, he was released on bail.  The garda&iacute; did their very best to keep him in custody.  The family were in fear, so they contacted me.  It is not easy to listen to a woman who is in extreme distress and her family saying that this person is loose and could come to visit her again.  Sadly, she now sleeps with a hammer under her pillow because she fears that the person will return.  The judicial system is dealing with the case, but there should be reform of the bail laws so that, if a person who is convicted of stalking is in the home or vicinity of his or her victim again and threatening him or her in the middle of the night, and if the garda&iacute; form an opinion on the matter - I would ask that it be at the rank of superintendent or inspector - then bail should be refused.  Stalkers like that should be put away until their court cases see them being put away for even longer.</p>  <p>  The garda&iacute; involved in this example are concerned about the family and are committed to supporting them.  At a phone call, they will ensure that the person is contacted.  I was involved as someone who was relaying messages to the garda&iacute;, but I wish to stress their concern and how they believe it is important that changes happen.</p>  <p>  I wish to bring to the Minister's attention a case of coercive control in my constituency.  A person who entered this country legally overstayed her welcome and got into a coercive relationship with a male.  She had two children.  The problem was that the father of the children would not agree to their births being registered.  The only way they could be registered was for the mother to make an application to the court.  Since she was in a coercive situation, though, she was fearful for her safety and her life and she could not make such an application.  She had no support and no children's allowance.  She was able to escape from where she was being held against her will and is now in a refuge, which is supporting her financially and helping her in every way.  I praise the work of women's refuges in County Louth and nationally for the fantastic work they are doing.  The problem in this case is that the social welfare support services have a procedural difficulty in processing an exceptional needs payment for a second time.  This person has no income and no financial support due to the regulations, although the Department is doing its best to meet her needs.  In this case of coercive control, the victor is the father and the victims are the children and their mother.  It is through legislation such as this Bill and D&aacute;il debates on same that we can deal with these cases.  While they are the exception, they are happening.</p>  <p>  The Minister stated that the Government will be tough on gangland crime at all levels and that the Bill will increase the maximum sentence for conspiracy to murder from ten years to life.  As the Minister well knows, Drogheda - I thank her for her attention and her visits to the town - is a priority for the Government as a result of drug crime.  Significantly, more than 30 additional garda&iacute; have been deployed to police the community.</p> <p>More importantly, they will reassure the community by prosecuting the perpetrators of the terrible crimes mentioned.  I refer to conspiracy to murder and murder itself.</p> <p> Everywhere I go, the abuse of drugs is a significant, serious and a growing problem.  This is the case North and South.  I was in Belfast during the week and this is a serious problem in that city as well.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is doing a fantastic job.  I commend its actions, and those of the courts.  The tougher they are, the better.  We also need a parallel process, like the Guerin report.  Deputies from other parties also referred to issues around drug abuse.  The Guerin report was prepared for the Department of Justice.  I refer to investment and the significant changes made in this regard.  The Minister has led this process, and the resulting investment in places like Moneymore has supported additional childcare and healthcare facilities and the provision of more teachers to schools where there is significant disadvantage.  This is also the way forward.</p> <p> We must tackle the serious criminals and put them away for increased lengths of time.  Equally, I refer to implementing the model of the Guerin report in the context of supporting communities and giving a voice to those people who have none and ensuring they have other options beyond going into crime.  We all know that sometimes criminality runs from generation to generation.  People must be given the option to get an education and secure employment and thereby to have a different life from that they and their families and relations may have led in the past.  </p> <p> Therefore, I welcome the significant attention this Government, and especially the Minister, her office and her Department, has given to fighting crime in Drogheda.  It is very much appreciated.  This continuing support and the associated ongoing visits are the way forward.  Other Deputies should get copies of the Guerin report and give the priority this Government has given to Drogheda.  Applications for funding are given priority, which is what is needed to tackle these significant problems.  </p></speech>

I also commend the Sonas refuge in Dublin 15 on all its work in supporting women experiencing domestic violence.  I welcome this legislation and all its elements.  I refer in particular to the stand-alone offence of non-fatal strangulation causing harm, expanded harassment offences, a stand-alone offence of stalking, the provision of court orders restraining certain behaviour and the introduction of procedural protections for alleged victims during court proceedings.</p>  <p>  The Istanbul Convention recognises violence against women as a violation of human rights and a form of discrimination against women.  The convention states that it "creates a legal framework at pan-European level to protect women against all forms of violence, and prevent, prosecute and eliminate violence against women".  Under the convention, state parties' obligations have been categorised into four pillars, namely, preventing violence against women, protecting victims, prosecuting perpetrators and implementing related comprehensive and co-ordinated policies.</p>  <p>  I compliment the new Garda divisional protective service units.  During my work with Tusla, I had first-hand experience of their work and I cannot speak highly enough of what they do.  The ongoing support these units have provided to women and survivors of abuse has been excellent and this has given women confidence and belief that they are being supported.  In turn, they felt somewhat safer, despite the high levels of threats against them.  As usual, however, we do not have enough being done in this regard, given the high levels of domestic and sexual abuse being reported and, more importantly, not being reported.  I say this because we know the vast majority of offences, particularly sexual violence offences, are not being reported.  This means we have a long way to go.</p>  <p>  Turning to the prosecution part of the convention, every time we read reports about the experience of women in courts it is absolutely dreadful.  I sometimes wonder whether it is designed to wear people down and to get them to the stage where they just give up.  The protection of women is happening despite the court system and not due to it.  We must do much more in this regard.  We must also do much more concerning the housing crisis.  We know many women, and many people, experiencing domestic violence feel they are trapped because there is literally nowhere for them to go.  They are unable to leave coercive and violent relationships.</p>  <p>  Laws are not just words on a piece of paper.  They get their power from being enforced, a well-resourced system of justice and a well-resourced policing system.  Unfortunately, we have repeatedly heard that there is a crisis in confidence in communities regarding their protection.  Garda&iacute; have spoken to me about how unresourced they feel they are.  The recent experience in Cherry Orchard has shown how dangerous the situations are in which garda&iacute; get into and how young garda&iacute; do not feel assured of back-up.  </p>  <p>  I also raise the issue of rosters.  I spoke about this issue at a recent meeting of the joint policing committee, JPC, in Blanchardstown.  The Garda firmly believes this will undermine the connection between the community and the force.  It was stated that new recruits are being lost hand over fist to other organisations.  The superintendent admitted this was a problem.  In fact, it was stated that a report will be conducted into the loss of recruits who have joined the Garda in recent years.  This issue needs to be addressed.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.382" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1553" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="16:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300046#XX00300"><p>I commend the Minister on bringing this important and interesting legislation before the House.  It contains a variety of measures that will be particularly helpful to those unfortunate enough to find themselves victims of crime.  If we look at Part 2 of this Bill, I believe it introduces a measure I had sought previously that will impose a tougher sentence on those found guilty of conspiracy to murder.</p><p>In March 2019, I introduced legislation here entitled the Criminal Justice (Conspiracy to Murder) Bill 2019.  This sought to amend section 71 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 and, more specifically, section 4 of the Offences Against The Person Act 1861.  We had found ourselves in the anomalous position where people could find themselves convicted of conspiracy to murder and yet were only going to face a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment.  This was notwithstanding the fact that the principal offence, that of murder, is punishable by a sentence of life imprisonment.  Therefore, I welcome this legislation being brought forward.  </p><p>I brought my Bill forward in 2019 because of the specific example of a man who had come to Ireland from eastern Europe to kill another individual living here.  Fortunately, through the good work of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, this man was apprehended when he had a gun and was on his way to shoot, and no doubt kill, this other person.  He decided to plead guilty, and because he did so, he had to be given some credit by the court.  This resulted in this person being given a sentence of six years.  In effect, this meant he would be out of prison after four years.  Therefore, somebody who had the clear intention of murdering another person got away with a sentence of four years.  What the Minister has done in this legislation, in the context of what I sought to do in the legislation I proposed in 2019, is commendable.  The law must be changed concerning this issue.</p><p>One issue I ask the Minister to examine is the requirement to introduce a series of consequential amendments.  It is noted that one of these amendments is to section 77, which deals with double jeopardy.  A new provision will be contained within paragraph (c) of that new section.  I ask the Minister and her officials to consider a situation that may arise in this context.  I refer to people who may find themselves being convicted in another jurisdiction of an offence committed in Ireland.  Let us take the example where someone has been convicted of the serious offence of murder <i>in absentia</i>in another jurisdiction, as the law of that jurisdiction may allow.  What impact would that have if the Director of Public Prosecution, DPP, decided to prosecute such an offence in Ireland?  It may be the case that the new paragraph (c) will not have an effect, but this aspect must be closely examined.  </p><p>Regarding Part 3 of the legislation, this deals with the amendment to Firearms Act 1925.  I note that the reason for this is to ensure that the Forensic Science Ireland laboratory is able to use firearms for the purposes of its work and investigations.  As the Minister is aware, I would have liked to have seen the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990 amended as well to ensure a tougher sentence was provided for in the case of those found in possession of a knife for the purpose of inflicting harm on another.  Hopefully, this is something the Government may revisit at some stage in the future.  </p><p>Part 4 of the Bill deals with the offences of harassment, stalking, non-fatal strangulation and non-fatal suffocation.  I welcome the establishment of these new offences of non-fatal strangulation and-or non-fatal suffocation.  More importantly, however, section 13 deals with the new offence of harassment or stalking.</p> <p>To date, the offence of harassment is dealt with under section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997.  In my opinion, that was a section, irrespective of the issue of stalking being brought in, that needed to be updated.  It is very difficult to prosecute somebody for harassment.  However, the way in which the new offences of harassment and of stalking have been drafted in this Bill will, I believe, make it easier for the prosecution of those offences.  It is particularly welcome that the new section 10(3) of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 will now set out examples of the type of behaviour that will result in somebody being found to have been guilty of committing the offences of harassment or stalking.  When examples are set out, as has been done in this legislation, it makes it easier for a prosecutor.  It also makes it easier for a jury to determine whether the offence has been committed.</p> <p> That brings me on to Part 5 of the legislation.  It is a Part that has not been given sufficient attention in our discussions or in the debate to date.  As I mentioned, it is very difficult sometimes to get a person convicted of the offence of harassment or the new offence of stalking, but that does not mean efforts cannot be made within the civil courts to try to ensure orders are made restraining individuals from carrying out certain types of behaviour.  What we have in Part 5 of this legislation is the establishment of civil orders that can be given by the District Court against what is referred to in the legislation as "relevant conduct".  The type of conduct we see listed here in section 15(3) is conduct which everyone can see is harassing and is impactful on the quality of life of a person who is subjected to it.  However, because of the lack of persistence of it, it probably does not rise to constitute a criminal offence, but I welcome the fact that individuals who are subjected to this type of behaviour and, indeed, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have identified that individuals are being subjected to this type of behaviour can bring an application before the District Court which court can make a civil order restraining a person from following or communicating by any means with the affected individual or by engaging in the type of relevant conduct we have prohibited in this section.</p> <p> Sometimes civil orders can be more effective, from the point of view of a victim, than the criminal sanction and the criminal process.  The criminal process can be difficult for a victim.  It sometimes also does not favour victims in terms of trying to stop the behaviour at a particular time.  However, here we have a civil sanction that will be decided on the balance of probability as the civil standard of proof and I welcome the fact a District Court judge will be able to direct a person to stop engaging in what is referred to as relevant conduct for a period of five years.  The only slight criticism I would have, and I would ask the Minister to look at it, is that under section 25 these hearings will be held in private.  Hearings before our courts should be held in public.  Individuals involved in this type of behaviour should be exposed to public scrutiny and the hearings should be available for public appraisal.</p> <p> I thank the Acting Chairman, Deputy Devlin, and the Minister.</p></speech>

I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022 and I very much welcome it.  It is long overdue.  I am happy to support its passage through the D&aacute;il and I do so for the following reasons.</p>  <p>  First of all, it brings Irish domestic law in line with international best practice.  Finally, we are becoming consistent with our obligations and commitments under the Istanbul Convention.  I also agree with the four Ps of the national strategy: prevention, protection, prosecution and policy co-ordination.  That is a good approach to have.  While I appreciate the Bill focuses on the prosecution component, there is also a significant prevention and deterrent aspect to it as well.  I very much welcome the fact there is a lot of clarity in this document that was not there heretofore.</p>  <p>  There are three specific provisions I want to draw attention to, and I am very much in favour of them.  First of all, codifying and enshrining stalking as a specific stand-alone offence is a very positive way forward.  I take the Minister's point that it is already an illegal activity, which is a criminal activity, but it is always good to specify and codify it exactly because it is an insidious, sinister and intimidatory behaviour.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the fact there is a non-fatal offence of strangulation and suffocation as well.  I take the Minister's point that that is a precursor.  It is a serious crime in its own right but it is a gateway crime as well for even more dangerous crimes thereafter.  It is good that it is nailed down in a particular stand-alone way.</p>  <p>  I liked the fact the Minister mentioned that the Garda Commissioner was the person who recommended this law be brought in.  It is an important point to make that when the senior law enforcement professional in the country requests a particular law, this Legislature at least will review and see if it is appropriate that we bring it in and that we respond to requests from the senior management of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is a good way to go.</p>  <p>  The third point I want to raise is in relation to the increased sentencing for conspiracy to murder.  That is an important provision.  It was ridiculous that those who give the order for a murder were punished much less than the people who pulled the trigger.  We are mindful of the transnational nature of organised crime now that these hit men and assassins are hired internationally and brought into the country to pull the trigger, but the people who give the instructions and people who give the orders get off with a much lesser sentence.  It is important that is brought up to a life sentence.  I very much commend the Minister on that.</p>  <p>  I have two concerns.  The first is about enforcement.  I suspect the Minister would be of pretty much the same view.  We need more garda&iacute;.  We need more patrol cars.  We need greater opening hours, especially in rural Garda stations.  It is a feature across both rural and urban Ireland.  I appreciate there are staff retention and recruitment issues in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but anything the Minister can do to increase the number of uniformed personnel out there would make a significant difference.  There is no point in having all this law if we cannot enforce it.</p>  <p>  Finally, to double-line the good points of Deputy Catherine Murphy as well, who spoke of a public awareness campaign, this is a great opportunity to increase the level of awareness publicly.  We now have specific stand-alone crimes and a public awareness campaign would be useful.  Such a campaign would focus on the first "P", which is prevention, which is what we are all trying to achieve.  We do not want to punish people for crimes.  We want to prevent the crimes from happening in the first place.</p>  <p>  I welcome the legislation.  It is appropriate, proportionate and necessary.  I note the Minister will bring some amendments forward.  I am happy to review those and assess them on their own merits.  However, as it stands, I am happy to support this Bill through the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.385" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1517" speakername="Joe Carey" time="16:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300047#YY00300"><p>I welcome this important Bill, which is another part of the jigsaw the Minister has been bringing before us in reforming and updating the criminal justice system.  I congratulate the Minister, Deputy McEntee, on bringing this important Bill before the House today.</p>  <p>  I am aware this Bill comes before us as a result of the Minister&rsquo;s determination to modernise this system, not only to reform the system but also to streamline the process and ensure that if you do the crime you do the time, and to deter others, particularly young people, from entering into criminal activity, especially those involving criminal gangs.  Maybe in her next Bill the Minister might look at the sentencing policy for being a member of a criminal gang.</p>  <p>  I recognise the issues the Minister is tackling in this Bill such as conspiracy to murder, criminal assault causing harm, criminal assault causing serious harm, non-fatal strangulation, stalking and harassment, and possible civil orders associated with this type of behaviour to prevent it and protect the victims.</p>  <p>  In recent times we have seen, throughout the world in co-operation with other police forces in Europe and America, the arrest and detention of senior Irish gangland figures involved in some of the most serious crimes this country has ever seen.  I compliment An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on its ongoing efforts to track and prosecute these gang leaders for their crimes.  We must also thank the Garda for its intelligence work in preventing many serious gangland crimes, including murder, which often does not get any recognition.</p> <p>The measures in the Bill will strengthen the resolve of the Garda and our communities to tackle gangland crime.  They will also possibly deter others, particularly the young, from becoming involved in criminal activities with gangs.</p> <p> The introduction of the Criminal Assets Bureau was one of the most successful pieces of legislation brought before the House to tackle criminal gangs but it needs to be tightened up to bring about quicker results in confiscating assets.  The initial legislation was carefully drafted to prevent court challenge.  It has now been well tested in the courts and as a result of these rulings we may be able to introduce a stronger Bill to confiscate these ill-gotten assets in a more timely manner.</p> <p> I welcome the particular section of the Bill that increases penalties for all those involved in any way in conspiracy to murder someone and not only the person who pulls the trigger or uses a knife or other weapon to kill, maim or mutilate someone.  The Bill will increase the maximum sentence for the offence of assault causing harm from five years to ten years.  This is one of the most common charges.  While a life sentence can be imposed for an assault causing serious harm it only covers a limited subset of the worst assaults.  Most assaults can only be prosecuted at the lower levels, especially where the victim has fully or mostly recovered.  Even where a judge considers the offence as among the more serious, he or she is limited in sentencing to five years and may have to reduce this further to reflect mitigating factors such as a guilty plea.</p> <p> I understand the clauses in the Bill regarding non-fatal strangulation are a result of a direct request by the Garda Commissioner following quality research into this type of crime and the perpetrators of this type of assault, mainly on women.  We can see from this research that by creating a greater deterrent we may prevent some of these assaults and the suitable authorities will be able to step in earlier to offer support and prevent a more tragic outcome.</p> <p> Stalking and harassment are extremely serious and intrusive crimes.  They can cause serious devastating psychological distress to the victims, sometimes for the rest of their lives.  It is only right to introduce this new offence and bring in this new range of civil orders to protect victims.  I understand this offence was recently introduced in the criminal code throughout the English-speaking world following research into this type of behaviour.  I understand the introduction of this new crime has led to greater awareness of it and increased reporting and prosecution.  This should lead to the prevention of this type of serious crime.</p> <p> Stalking online and bullying online may be covered by other Acts but I believe that if a person is convicted of both the sentencing should be cumulative.  The Bill reflects the public opinion that the seriousness of the crime must be reflected in the sentences that judges can impose.</p> <p> I am not in favour of the practice that has occurred in our courts in recent years of delaying the sentencing of convicted persons for a few weeks.  I understand the legal argument for the need for victim impact statements and assessment of the perpetrator's past history but the gap allows for a distancing between the horrific nature of a violent crime and the sentence received.  We need to find a way to link the sentence received to the crime committed to deter other people from entering the criminal world.</p> <p> The Bill introduces another element of the Government's commitment to zero tolerance and part of the Government's national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  I am proud to support the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-10-13a.387" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1584" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="16:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022101300048#ZZ00200"><p>I welcome the introduction of the legislation.  It is very important.  I compliment the Minister on the work she is doing in this area.  I make particular reference to organised crime and other issues, including stalking, that have been raised by Members.  I compliment my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, on the reference to the <i>in camera </i>rule where stalking is concerned.  I do not see why somebody accused of stalking a woman and terrorising her and her family in the way that has been done should be allowed to have the crime examined in secret under the <i>in camera</i>rule.  I do not see the reason for this.</p><p>It is in this regard that I want to draw attention to something else that is equally ominous and worrying.  This is use of section 47 reports and the degree to which the courts take them into account.  I have previously relayed this concern to the Minister.  I have also relayed it to the House twice in recent times.  A court messenger can, by virtue of his or her recommendation to the court, make it possible to take away children from a mother in order to ensure a particular outcome in a forthcoming case.  This is what it amounts to.  I have dealt with cases in recent times where mothers have been separated from their children and subjected to appalling indifference and callousness by the system.  Their children are removed callously and put in a place determined by the court.  This, in turn, can predetermine the outcome of a family law case.</p><p>I recognise that family law cases are held <i>in camera</i>also.  There is a case for removing the <i>in camera</i>rule and letting the air into the system to such an extent that everybody knows what to expect there.  I do not blame judges.  I am simply saying these issues need to be dealt with.  We need to deal with them in this House by way of legislation.  I hope the Minister will introduce legislation in this regard.</p><p>For an awfully long time I campaigned to have the bail laws amended.  They were amended to a certain extent.  I am not so certain it is efficient.  It has not deterred some people while on bail from committing further and more serious crimes.  This should not be the case.  We should not arrive at a situation of zero tolerance, as was applied in New York as a political claim.  It was Ed Koch when he was mayor of New York who set the scene for what became zero tolerance eventually.  He tackled the big crime barons in such a way as to put them out of business and put them behind bars.  The Minister is hoping to do the same thing and we recognise this.  It is a very important business.  Drugs and violence that result in the kicking to death of an innocent individual outside a pub or anywhere else in the evening are totally and absolutely unacceptable.  There is no use trying to make excuses for it and stating people were not really in control of their actions at the time and they had drugs or alcohol or whatever the case may be.  There is no excuse for this.</p><p>I believe that during the lockdown people spent a lot of time studying videos of motor racing and the like.  Of course we can do all kinds of things in a video and switch it back and forth and overtake from the left and the right.  That is what is going on at present in a big way.  Yesterday on a run to Belfast I witnessed two trucks occupying both lanes of the road with one trying to overtake the other, or pretending it was trying to overtake the other, for at least 20 miles.  We want safety on the roads.  This is certainly not a trip in that direction.  I know it breaks the law but I want to bring it to the Minister's attention.  What happens in a video is not as easily managed when it takes place in reality.</p> <p>I could go on for a long time about how we should deal with these issues when they arise.  It is important to bring them to the attention of the House and the Minister, whatever they may be, even if the House says it is a matter for the courts and it should be brought before the courts; that is not our function.  Our function in this House is to raise matters that appear to be going wrong and are in need of attention and I presume this is done on the basis that right is right and two wrongs do not make a right.  At some stage we should come to recognise, as I do, that there have been situations in the past when issues were raised in the House, against the rules as it were and with huge opposition, that ultimately ended up being the subject of major and serious inquiries involving a whole lot of people.  It would been far better to have dealt with the issues originally.  A case that comes to mind is one in which a woman complained about the sexual assault of her daughter and nothing was done about it.  One cannot walk away from that, therefore, the question was put and answered in a particular way, but action was taken within a few days, which indicates something needed to be dealt with.  I am sure the same has happened to every Member of the House on several occasions.</p> <p> I finish by drawing attention to section 47, which needs to be dealt with soon, because there will be a tragedy.  There is a level of emotion, trauma and coldness surrounding a mother when she is told that she does not matter in this business or that if she does matter, it is only in a way decided by somebody else.  If the activities of Mr. Jim Sheehan in the courts are allowed to continue, there will be serious consequences.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, it is a wide-ranging Bill and I appreciate there are many different elements to it, but that is the nature of a miscellaneous Bill.  It contains many important measures and changes across many different aspects, not least organised crime, domestic violence, firearms and other areas.  I acknowledge civil society, community and voluntary groups, victims, survivors, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and many others who have been involved and engaged in the development of many of these areas.  We have more work to do and further amendments will be brought forward on Committee Stage.</p><p>I refer to some issues raised about firearms, such as the semi-automatic centre-fire rifles that automatically reload.  For a person who goes out hunting, I do not see a reason to have such ammunition or weapon.  An expert committee has been established to advise on all aspects of licensing.  This is something that has been looked at and advised upon, and the shooting and hunting groups are represented as part of that group.  We can discuss it in further detail but based on what we have seen happen in other countries, we do not want to consider something like that being allowed to happen here, without preventing people from genuinely engaging in hunting or lawful acts.</p><p>As to the <i>in camera</i>provisions, this would only apply to civil orders and reflects how the domestic violence orders are operated, which are intended to protect the victim, not the perpetrator.  It will not apply to the criminal side.  We are trying to minimise the trauma and impact going to court can have on victims and how it can be re-traumatising.  Therefore, it is intended to support the victim in that regard and to try to minimise the distress of the court proceedings.</p><p>On any potential implications around the stalking legislation, Deputy Catherine Murphy raised the potential implications for private investigators or garda&iacute;.  The new offences would not include conduct where there was lawful authority or reasonable intent, such as the garda&iacute; or a person doing his or her job.  It is similar to the current harassment legislation and I am not aware of any journalists who have raised concerns in that regard.  I am open to discussing this further at a later stage.</p><p>A number of others were raised, one of which was resourcing.  I have said a number of times, in particular in recent weeks, that when it comes to policing, providing resources is my top priority and making sure garda&iacute; do not just have the laws, funding, IT, and all the things that they need, but that we have as many bodies on the ground doing the work they need to do.  I am confident the most recent recruitment campaign will enable us to increase those numbers as quickly as we can to make sure, in the context of all the laws we are introducing and the resources we are providing, we have the front-line garda&iacute; and civilian staff to carry out that important work.</p><p>I again thank colleagues for their support and I look forward to working with them on Committee Stage. </p></speech>

I have been in touch with the Department for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, and have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, directly and know he is engaging on the issue and recently met students involved.  I acknowledge from the outset that the Government is engaging on the matter.</p>  <p>  The issue I raise relates to Maynooth University in my constituency of Kildare North.  It is a very successful, large and growing university that is an important dot on the map of the national education infrastructure at higher level.  It is a university I have a significant amount of time for.  My daughter recently attended it and I have been there on many occasions.  The institution is progressive in many ways, not least in its commitment to providing a broad education.  Students are not educated in silos of certain disciplines but they are encouraged and are given a broad subject choice at the outset.  However, it has fallen short on one important item, which has exercised and concerned the student body greatly and understandably so, that is the issue of the levy.</p>  <p>  There was a referendum in the university in the late 1990s to impose a levy on students.  The introduction of the levy was done with a view to expand the facilities on the campus thereby creating a student centre; providing greater student amenities and facilities; developing a sports and community engagement cluster; developing an arts and cultural quarter; and providing a basic and fundamental requirement of a student centre in which students could gather, sit, meet and chat with other students and have lunch.  University is not just about lectures.  It is about college life and the public square.  The conversations that happen on beanbags, benches or couches are an integral part of the student and learning experience, which is part of the educational philosophy.  More rudimentarily, it is a place to get in from the rain and the cold and have some lunch.  It is somewhere to go and to gather.  It is a pretty rudimentary requirement.</p> <p>The students have paid for it.  Speaking as the parent of a student, I have paid for it indirectly through my daughter.  Many students and parents have paid this levy for many years.  The money has been gathered into a fund.  We do not know where that fund sits or what its purpose is.  The college announced recently that the student centre will not now to be built and that the plans have changed.  It is a move in bad faith.  The students contributed in good faith for many years.  They created a fund, the purpose of which, through a referendum of the student body at the time, was that a student centre would be created, as well as the other arts, cultural and sporting hubs I mentioned.  That has now not happened.  The money was gathered, but the flip side of the coin, namely, that the student centre would be built, is now not being delivered on.</p> <p> Students have now been told it will not be delivered.  They are very exercised about this, and rightly so.  Niall Daly, the president of the student body, recently led a walkout on campus of the students in protest.  He has engaged with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris.  He has had engagement with Dr. Eeva Leinonen, the college president.  It is not good enough.</p> <p> I know this is not a Government issue.  The Government is not the governing body of NUI Maynooth.  However, the Government has a role to play in engaging with all stakeholders.  It needs to put it very firmly to Maynooth University that it cannot do this and that it is not good enough to collect levies over a number of years for a student facility that is then not delivered, in particular from a student body, given that the latter comprises people of limited means who struggle at the best of times.  That is a breach of faith.  I ask the Government to intervene and make its views very clearly known to the college authorities.</p></speech>

Maynooth University recently informed the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science that its governing authority had taken the difficult decision to terminate the Maynooth University student centre contract.  The Department does not have any direct involvement in the project in question, as no direct Exchequer funding was being provided by the Department for the project, which was solely being funded by European Investment Bank borrowings which were serviced by income from a student levy.  However, all capital projects advanced by publicly funded higher education institutions must comply with the provisions of the spending code.  The Minister understands that, following detailed consideration of a number of matters, including the risk associated with continuing with a project that would then breach the public spending code, the governing authority decided to terminate the contract.</p>  <p>  Higher education institutions, HEIs, are governed by the Universities Act 1997, the Institutes of Technology Act 1992 to 2006 and the Technological Universities Act 2018.  Within the meaning of these Acts, HEIs are autonomous bodies responsible for their day-to-day management and operational affairs, including dealing with policy and procedure regarding any levy payable by students for services or campus facilities.  The expenditure incurred to date on the project will be met by the university from financial reserves.  No financial contribution is being sought from the Exchequer and there will be no impact on the student levy collected from the university student body.</p>  <p>  Maynooth University has an ongoing programme of enhancement of student facilities.  Current projects include additional social spaces for student use, study spaces, meeting pods for student meetings, enhanced furniture in existing spaces, additional parking, a new bus terminus and a new outdoor gym.  Maynooth University is considering the most appropriate way of meeting the needs for additional student spaces on campus in the short and long-term in the overall context of achieving value for money in any future investment.</p>  <p>  The Minister met student representatives on a range of issues on Thursday, 6 October.  The students' union from Maynooth University was represented at the meeting and he listened to its concerns about the student centre and levy.  The Minister also met the chair of the governing authority of the university recently and strongly encouraged the university to continue engagement with the student representative body on the next steps for the project.

I acknowledge that the Minister has engaged on the issue.  I appreciate the Minister of State's response that there is no Government money at involved.  With respect, I do not entirely agree with that.  The university is publicly funded.  I accept that the funding for the project came from another source.  The university receives funding from a variety of sources.  A publicly funded university has reneged on its commitments to students.  Even worse than it being public money, it is money paid by students over many years.</p>  <p>  If one were to be technical about it, the conditions under which the referendum of the student body was held at the time included a provision that any alternative to the conditions of the fundamental premise would invalidate the vote.  This is an avenue the students' union is going to pursue and consider, and I think it has a very good point in that regard.</p>  <p>  The student body has made it clear that it has three basic asks.  One is that the governing body publicly reiterate its commitment to deliver a new student centre for the benefit of students, which seems very basic requirement, and ensure the prioritisation of that over any other capital projects.  The second is that the student levy be frozen, with no increase to the charge for a period of five years.  It seems reasonable that if there is a levy for something that is not happening the students would not need to pay it.  A freeze on the levy makes a lot of sense.  The third ask is that there be transparency around the process in the future.  Where is the money that has been collected and ring-fenced to date?  How much is in the fund?  What is it being ring-fenced and used for?  Is it gathering interest?  Is it being used temporarily for other projects?  What will happen in the future?  Will the money be used to commission a study on the new student centre?  Where will it go?  Where will it be spent?  What are the next steps?</p>  <p>  There should be full accountability and transparency in respect of this matter.  The students' union has a place on the governing body, but it is only one voice among those of many other stakeholders.  It is a reasonable request.  It is good corporate governance.  The students' union did not expect this move.  It took it and the entire Maynooth hinterland off guard.  I, as a local Deputy, was not expecting it.  There needs to be better communication and transparency from the college body as this issue progresses.</p></speech>

Although this project did not involve Government funding and was instead funded by a student levy and the EIB, the university as a body is funded by the State.  It is clear that the Minister is not shying away or distancing himself from this and saying that it has nothing to do with him.  He has met the students and the governing bodies.</p>  <p>  On the three points made very clearly by the Deputy, the first related to whether the governing body will reiterate its commitment to make sure that any money collected is spent on students.  The university has already advised the Department that moneys from the fund will not be lost and that the student levy will remain ring-fenced for student facilities.  The second question was whether there will be a freeze on the student levy.  In other words, that the university will stop collecting it.  The final question was about transparency with regard to how much money has been collected and what it has been spent on.  They are very reasonable and absolutely fair questions.  I will convey them to the Minister.  When he and the Department communicate with the governing body, we will make it very clear that we are looking for transparency and that any publicly funded institution be transparent about its expenditure.</p></speech>

It is an emergency whose dimensions are not immediately apparent to many people because they do not live with it but nonetheless it is an emergency. It is an emergency that is perhaps not so obvious to people, because the change that takes place in the characteristics of the Gaeltacht appears to be one that is taking place relatively slowly so that there is no particular need for haste or hurry. However, the particular characteristic of change as it affects the Gaeltacht and the people living in it is that it is more radical and less reversible than change in almost any other area of our national life. </blockquote>  <p>Os cionn 40 bliain n&iacute;os d&eacute;ana&iacute; agus t&aacute; na focail sin f&oacute;s f&iacute;or.  T&aacute; an t-athr&uacute; bagartha feicthe againn go soil&eacute;ir agus &eacute; &eacute;irithe n&iacute;os measa le deich mbliana anuas.  </p><p>I ndaon&aacute;ireamh 2016, fuaireamar amach gur thit l&iacute;on na gcainteoir&iacute; laeth&uacute;la Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht don ch&eacute;ad uair &oacute;n daon&aacute;ireamh roimhe sin.  T&aacute; s&eacute; sonraithe i dtuarasc&aacute;il de chuid Thuismitheoir&iacute; na Gaeltachta anuraidh nach bhfuil ach 23% de theaghlaigh sa Ghaeltacht ag t&oacute;g&aacute;il clainne le Gaeilge.</p> <p>T&aacute; na figi&uacute;ir&iacute; seo scanr&uacute;il.  T&aacute; an gh&eacute;arch&eacute;im ag titim amach d&iacute;reach mar a d&uacute;radh sa staid&eacute;ar cuimsitheach sochtheangeola&iacute;ochta sa bhliain 2007, a d&uacute;irt nach mbeadh ach 15 n&oacute; 20 bliain f&aacute;gtha ag an nGaeilge mar phr&iacute;omhtheanga i gceantair Ghaeltachta gan athruithe m&oacute;ra &oacute;n Rialtas.  Cad at&aacute; d&eacute;anta ag an Rialtas mar fhreagra air sin?  Fuair siad r&eacute;idh le guth daonlathach don phobal sa Ghaeltacht agus rinne siad ciorruithe m&oacute;ra ar bhuis&eacute;ad na Gaeltachta bliain i ndiaidh bliana.  T&aacute; ruda&iacute; ag dul sa treo ceart de r&eacute;ir an bhuis&eacute;id is d&eacute;ana&iacute; ach n&iacute; i gc&aacute;s forbairt na Gaeltachta agus &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  Is l&eacute;ir go raibh an ceart ag an Teachta D&aacute;la a d&uacute;irt in 1978 go dteasta&iacute;onn toghch&aacute;in chun leas agus fuinneamh na Gaeltachta a chosaint &oacute;n neamhaird agus &oacute; bhfrith-Ghaelachas an St&aacute;it.  Lean an Teachta Horgan ar aghaidh ag r&aacute;: </p><blockquote>	The people and the communities of the Gaeltacht may be a minority in a numerical sense but they are, and remain, the only authentic representatives of what was once the majority tradition on this island and of a tradition and a culture that is still officially, and more than officially in the hearts of the people of this island, something that is vital and that should be preserved. </blockquote> <p>T&aacute;im br&oacute;d&uacute;il seasamh anseo agus an Bille seo a mholadh.  I bhfocail an mh&oacute;r-phoblacht&aacute;naigh M&aacute;irt&iacute;n &Oacute; Cadhain, a thug spreagadh don ghluaiseacht do chearta sibhialta sa Ghaeltacht, &ldquo;Is &iacute; an Ghaeilge athghabh&aacute;il na h&Eacute;ireann, agus is &iacute; athghabh&aacute;il na h&Eacute;ireann sl&aacute;n&uacute; na Gaeilge.&rdquo;  Caithfear tos&uacute; le hathghabh&aacute;il na Gaeltachta agus pobal na Gaeltachta a chur i gceannas ar a bhforbairt dhaonlathach f&eacute;in.</p></speech>

Bh&iacute; 7,809 post i gcliantchomhlachta&iacute; an &uacute;dar&aacute;is ag deireadh na bliana seo caite.  Is dul chun cinn t&aacute;bhachtach agus suntasach &eacute; seo.</p>  <p>  T&aacute; s&eacute; r&iacute;th&aacute;bhachtach do rath lean&uacute;nach na Gaeltachta mar fhearann d&uacute;chais na Gaeilge go dtabharfar deis do dhaoine &oacute;ga na Gaeltachta oibri&uacute; sna pobail ina dt&oacute;gtar iad.  T&aacute; t&aacute;bhacht faoi leith ag baint le rochtain a thabhairt d&oacute;ibh ar leathanbhanda ardluais, agus ar fhosta&iacute;ocht d&rsquo;ardchaighde&aacute;n chomh maith c&eacute;anna, a thagann leis an gcaoi at&aacute; an domhan anois agus cianobair i bhfad n&iacute;os coitianta n&aacute; mar a bh&iacute;odh.

Maidir le buis&eacute;ad 2023, is fi&uacute; a mheabhr&uacute; go gcuirfear &euro;1 milli&uacute;n breise ar f&aacute;il don &uacute;dar&aacute;s don bhliain seo chugainn.</p> <p>Cabhr&oacute;idh an maoini&uacute; breise seo leis an &uacute;dar&aacute;s an obair at&aacute; ar si&uacute;l acu a neart&uacute; ar mhaithe leis na comharchumainn agus na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; pobalbhunaithe at&aacute; ag feidhmi&uacute; faoina sc&aacute;th.</p> <p> Th&aacute;inig ard&uacute; suntasach ar chaiteachas an Rialtais le blianta beaga anuas, agus l&eacute;ir&iacute;onn na figi&uacute;ir&iacute; at&aacute; leagtha amach agam &eacute; sin.  T&aacute;im l&aacute;nchinnte go bhfuil ar &aacute;r gcumas anois dul chun cinn breise a dh&eacute;anamh ar roinnt togra&iacute; caipitil ar cuireadh bac n&oacute; moill orthu le tamall anuas, rud a bheidh ar leas phobal na Gaeltachta agus a chiall&oacute;idh go mbeifear in ann na poist a crutha&iacute;odh cheana a chosaint tuilleadh, chomh maith le deiseanna fosta&iacute;ochta breise a choth&uacute; sa tr&eacute;imhse at&aacute; romhainn.</p> <p> C&eacute; go bhfuil cruth&uacute; fosta&iacute;ochta mar an gcloch is m&oacute; ar phaidr&iacute;n an &uacute;dar&aacute;is, t&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach a aithint go bhfuil f&aacute;s tagtha ar a r&oacute;l le blianta beaga anuas.  T&aacute; dl&uacute;thbhaint ag an &uacute;dar&aacute;s le tamall de bhlianta, cur i gc&aacute;s, le cur i bhfeidhm an phr&oacute;isis plean&aacute;la teanga sa Ghaeltacht faoi sti&uacute;ir fhorioml&aacute;n mo Roinne.  Mar thoradh ar an sainch&uacute;ram seo a tugadh don &uacute;dar&aacute;s, f&aacute;gann s&eacute; go bhfuil cl&aacute;r ar bun aige a chuireann &eacute; n&iacute;os gaire do phobal na Gaeltachta n&aacute; mar a bh&iacute; s&eacute; mar eagra&iacute;ocht riamh.  T&aacute; bonn reacht&uacute;il, ar nd&oacute;igh, ag an bpr&oacute;iseas plean&aacute;la teanga, rud a chabhra&iacute;onn go m&oacute;r lena chinnti&uacute; go dtugtar aitheantas ceart d&oacute; i gcl&aacute;r oibre an &uacute;dar&aacute;is agus a chialla&iacute;onn freisin go gcuirtear na hacmhainn&iacute; cu&iacute; ar f&aacute;il don phr&oacute;iseas go ginear&aacute;lta, rud at&aacute; chun tairbhe na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta i ndeireadh thiar thall. </p> <p> Bh&iacute; deis agam le tamall anuas bualadh leis na pobail &eacute;ags&uacute;la Gaeltachta at&aacute; ag saothr&uacute; leo mar chuid den phr&oacute;iseas plean&aacute;la teanga.  Bh&iacute; deis agam, mar shampla, cast&aacute;il le gairid leis an dream at&aacute; ag pl&eacute; le plean Chois Fharraige i nGaillimh.  Tugann an d&iacute;ograis agus an tiomantas a l&eacute;irigh siad d&oacute;chas dom faoina bhfuil i nd&aacute;n don Ghaeltacht agus don Ghaeilge araon.</p> <p>  Ba mhaith liom d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar Acht na Gaeltachta anois agus ar an d&aacute; phr&iacute;omhchusp&oacute;ir a bhain leis deich mbliana &oacute; shin.  Ba iad na cusp&oacute;ir&iacute; sin n&aacute; bonn reacht&uacute;il a thabhairt don phr&oacute;iseas plean&aacute;la teanga, a bhfuil tagairt d&eacute;anta agam d&oacute;, agus chun taca&iacute;ocht bhreise a thabhairt don Ghaeilge mar theanga phobail agus theaghlaigh sa Ghaeltacht.  Ba &eacute; an dara cusp&oacute;ir n&aacute; leas&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an mbealach a roghna&iacute;odh comhalta&iacute; bhord an &uacute;dar&aacute;is chomh maith le leas&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar chomhdh&eacute;anamh an bhoird &oacute; thaobh l&iacute;on na gcomhalta&iacute; de.  Mar is eol don Teach, is iad na pr&iacute;omhleasuithe a rinneadh san Acht mar a bhaineann s&eacute; le bord an &uacute;dar&aacute;is n&aacute;, ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, gur cuireadh deireadh leis an gceanglas maidir le toghch&aacute;in phoibl&iacute; dh&iacute;reacha don bhord agus, ansin, gur laghda&iacute;odh l&iacute;on na gcomhalta&iacute; ar an mbord &oacute; sc&oacute;r comhalta&iacute; go 12.  Mar is eol don Teach freisin, ceapadh an bord reatha i m&iacute; Ean&aacute;ir 2018 agus mairfidh s&eacute; c&uacute;ig bliana go dt&iacute; l&aacute;r Ean&aacute;ir 2023.  Seo &eacute; an dara bord a ceapadh faoi na socruithe reatha.  D&eacute;anfaidh m&eacute; tagairt ar ball beag faoina bhfuil beartaithe agam a dh&eacute;anamh maidir le ceapach&aacute;in amach anseo.</p> <p> Is &eacute; mo thuairim gur cheart go mbeadh an cur chuige maidir le ceapadh agus comhdh&eacute;anamh an bhoird n&iacute;os daonlatha&iacute;.  Creidim go dtuigeann gach duine againn fi&uacute;ntas an &uacute;dar&aacute;is a thugann &aacute;r dtoghth&oacute;ir&iacute; d&uacute;inn agus an t&aacute;bhacht a bhaineann le bheith i dteagmh&aacute;il leo si&uacute;d a chuireann muid anseo.  Tuigeann gach duine againn go gcaithfimid &eacute;isteacht lena ndeirtear linn, go gcaithfimid naisc a choth&uacute; agus a choinne&aacute;il leis na pobail a roghna&iacute;onn sinn, agus go gcaithfimid oibri&uacute; lena gcuid tosa&iacute;ochta&iacute; a sheachadadh.  M&aacute; bhraitear nach bhfuilimid ag seachadadh ar son na ndaoine a nd&eacute;anann muid freastal orthu, t&aacute; a fhios againn go l&eacute;ir cad a tharla&iacute;onn ansin.  Le cur i bhfeidhm an phr&oacute;isis plean&aacute;la teanga, ina dtugtar c&uacute;raim&iacute; ar leith don &uacute;dar&aacute;s mar a bhaineann s&eacute; leis na ceantair Ghaeltachta, mar a luaigh m&eacute;, t&aacute; s&eacute; thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach go mbeadh gl&oacute;r l&aacute;idir ag an bpobal ag leibh&eacute;al na ceannaireachta san eagra&iacute;ocht. </p> <p> S&iacute;lim go n-aont&oacute;dh gach duine anseo gurb &eacute; an bealach is fearr chun tosaigh n&aacute; go motha&iacute;onn pobal na Gaeltachta go bhfuil nasc acu leis an &uacute;dar&aacute;s agus leo si&uacute;d a bhfuil c&uacute;ram orthu a bpobail a chosaint agus a neart&uacute;.  B&iacute;onn pobal na Gaeltachta ag iarraidh bord an &uacute;dar&aacute;is a chloiste&aacute;il ag labhairt faoi na ceisteanna a bh&iacute;onn ag d&eacute;anamh scime d&oacute;ibh ina saol.  Ba mhaith leo an nasc pearsanta sin a bheith acu leis an mbord.  Teasta&iacute;onn uaim cur chuige a aimsi&uacute; a chuireann leis sin, go h&aacute;irithe &oacute;s rud &eacute; go leagann an pr&oacute;iseas plean&aacute;la teanga b&eacute;im faoi leith ar an gcur chuige &oacute;n mbonn an&iacute;os.</p> <p> Maidir leis an mBille at&aacute; os comhair an T&iacute;, feicfear gurb &eacute; is cusp&oacute;ir leis an cur chuige reatha a chur i leataobh agus dul ar ais go dt&iacute; an sean-chur chuige a bh&iacute;odh i bhfeidhm.  C&eacute; go dtuigim an ch&uacute;is gur cuireadh an leas&uacute; seo ar aghaidh mar at&aacute; s&eacute; dr&eacute;achtaithe, measaim gur g&aacute; roinnt saincheisteanna a mheas go c&uacute;ramach.  Ar an gcaoi ch&eacute;anna nach mbeadh &eacute;inne againn ag moladh go d&iacute;reach dul ar ais chuig na teorainneacha toghcheantair a bh&iacute; ann deich mbliana &oacute; shin, n&oacute; chuig am sular tugadh isteach cu&oacute;ta&iacute; inscne le haghaidh iarrth&oacute;ir&iacute; toghch&aacute;in, is g&aacute; breithni&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar gach blas den sc&eacute;al sula gcuirtear c&oacute;ras roghn&uacute;ch&aacute;in agus toghch&aacute;in nua i bhfeidhm.</p> <p> Beidh Teachta&iacute; ar an eolas faoin ngealltanas i gcl&aacute;r an Rialtais chun athbhreithni&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar an bpr&oacute;iseas reatha i nd&aacute;il le roghn&uacute;ch&aacute;in agus toghch&aacute;in bhord &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  T&aacute; an pr&oacute;iseas sin ar si&uacute;l faoi l&aacute;thair ag mo Roinn.  Tugadh faoi chomhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;n poibl&iacute; faoin &aacute;bhar a eagr&uacute; &oacute;n 16 Feabhra 2022 go dt&iacute; l&aacute;r mh&iacute; M&aacute;rta.  Fuarthas 23 aighneacht mar thoradh ar an bpr&oacute;iseas sin agus cuirfear os comhair an phobail iad sna seachtain&iacute; romhainn.  T&aacute; s&eacute; le sonr&uacute; sna haighneachta&iacute; sin go bhfuil go leor i bhfabhar filleadh ar thoghch&aacute;in.  N&iacute;or mhiste a lua chomh maith gur thug an Roinn faoi phr&oacute;iseas sol&aacute;thair poibl&iacute; chomh maith chun an t-athbhreithni&uacute; f&eacute;in a chur chun feidhme.  Ar an drochuair, b&rsquo;&eacute;igean sin a dh&eacute;anamh tr&iacute; huaire faoi leith mar gheall ar easpa suime sa mhargadh.

T&aacute; obair an &uacute;dar&aacute;is athraithe &oacute; 2012, go h&aacute;irithe ag cur a r&oacute;l sa phr&oacute;iseas plean&aacute;la teanga san &aacute;ireamh.  &Eacute;ireoidh leis an bpr&oacute;iseas sin n&oacute; teipfidh air, bunaithe ar an nasc le cosmhuintir na Gaeltacht at&aacute; luaite agam cheana.  T&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh an t-athbhreithni&uacute; seo cr&iacute;ochnaithe i m&iacute; na Samhna agus tiocfaidh Bille an Rialtais f&eacute;in chun cinn go gairid ina dhiaidh sin.  Beidh Teachta&iacute; ar an eolas go bhfuil s&eacute; ar an gcl&aacute;r oibre reacht&uacute;il a foils&iacute;odh maidir leis an t&eacute;arma D&aacute;la seo.  Le cabhair agus c&uacute;namh &oacute; chomhalta&iacute; an Fhreas&uacute;ra, t&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist agam an Bille seo a thabhairt ar aghaidh faoi dheireadh na bliana, ag tabhairt san &aacute;ireamh na riachtanais lena dhr&eacute;acht&uacute;.</p> <p> Luaigh m&eacute; cheana f&eacute;in ar Ch&eacute;im an Choiste de Bhille na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la (Leas&uacute;) go dtabharfadh an Rialtas seo chun cinn reachta&iacute;ocht ar mhaithe le toghch&aacute;in dh&iacute;reacha chuig an mbord i gcomhth&eacute;acs an tiomantais i gcl&aacute;r an Rialtais agus faoi r&eacute;ir thoradh an athbhreithnithe seo.  D&aacute; dtabharfa&iacute; pr&oacute;iseas toghch&aacute;in ar ais, t&aacute; roinnt r&eacute;ims&iacute; ar a mbeidh breithni&uacute; le d&eacute;anamh orthu.  Mar shampla, d&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfa&iacute; f&eacute;achaint ar an l&iacute;on comhalta&iacute; boird agus measc&aacute;n f&eacute;ideartha de chomhalta&iacute; a bheadh tofa agus comhalta&iacute; a bheadh roghnaithe tr&iacute; phr&oacute;iseas na Seirbh&iacute;se um Cheapach&aacute;in Phoibl&iacute;, mar a luaitear sa chl&aacute;r don Rialtas.

Tagann deireadh le tr&eacute;imhse an bhoird at&aacute; ann faoi l&aacute;thair ar an 15 Ean&aacute;ir 2023.  T&aacute; t&uacute;s curtha ag mo Roinn d&aacute; r&eacute;ir leis an bpr&oacute;iseas chun comhalta&iacute; a cheapadh chuig an mbord nua faoin gcur chuige reatha mar a leagtar amach san Acht Gaeltachta.

De r&eacute;ir mar a thuigim, n&iacute;l s&eacute; ar intinn ag an Aire St&aacute;it cur ina choinne agus taca&iacute;m leis an seasamh sin.  N&iacute;l an Bille gan locht agus aithn&iacute;m go bhfuil ceisteanna tromch&uacute;iseacha ardaithe ag an Aire St&aacute;it ach cabhr&oacute;idh an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo agus, m&aacute; th&eacute;ann an Bille ar aghaidh, d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht an choiste le deacrachta&iacute; at&aacute; ann a aimsi&uacute;.</p>  <p>  Ba in 2012 a cuireadh deireadh le toghch&aacute;in do bhord &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, agus braitheadh &oacute; shin gur chruthaigh an cinneadh sin achar &eacute;igin idir an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s agus na pobail a bhfuil s&eacute; ceaptha freastal orthu.  Tugaim faoi deara go bhfuil roinnt gealltanas sa chl&aacute;r Rialtas a bhaineann le h&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta at&aacute; luaite cheana ag an Aire St&aacute;it.  Ina measc si&uacute;d a bhaineann leis an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo, t&aacute; athbhreithni&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar strucht&uacute;ir eagra&iacute;ocht&uacute;la agus rialachais &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, lena n-&aacute;ir&iacute;tear an pr&oacute;iseas roghn&uacute;ch&aacute;in agus toghch&aacute;in don bhord; agus athbhreithni&uacute; an fhorais riarach&aacute;in ar neart&uacute; an daonlathais &aacute;iti&uacute;il agus an t-athbhreithni&uacute; ar rialachas &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta a thabhairt faoi deara.  Tagann an d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na inniu leis na gealltanais seo.  Sa chomhth&eacute;acs sin is d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht an-&uacute;s&aacute;ideach &iacute;, agus gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le Teachta&iacute; Shinn F&eacute;in, an Teachta &Oacute; Snodaigh go h&aacute;irithe, as an mBille a chur chun tosaigh agus leis an Aire St&aacute;it agus lena oifigigh as an rannph&aacute;irt&iacute;ocht dhearfach at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh acu leis sin.</p>  <p>  T&aacute; s&eacute; ar cheann de bhunphrionsabail an Chomhaontais Ghlais go nd&eacute;anfa&iacute; cinnt&iacute; ar an leibh&eacute;al is &iacute;sle gur f&eacute;idir, n&oacute; ar phrionsabal na coimhdeachta.  Caithfimid a cheisti&uacute; go mac&aacute;nta an urrama&iacute;mid an prionsabal sin le deireadh a chur leis an gceangal d&iacute;reach sin idir bord an &uacute;dar&aacute;is agus muintir na Gaeltachta.  Aithn&iacute;m a bhfuil r&aacute;ite ag an Aire St&aacute;it faoin dl&uacute;thbhaint idir an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s agus muintir na Gaeltachta.</p>  <p>  An fh&aacute;ilte ghinear&aacute;lta sin ar leataobh, d&eacute;anfaidh m&eacute; tr&aacute;cht ar chuid de na for&aacute;lacha sonracha den Bhille a bhf&eacute;adfa&iacute; feabhas a chur orthu m&aacute; t&aacute; an Bille seo le dul ar aghaidh.  Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, beidh g&aacute; ann an sainmh&iacute;ni&uacute; ar theideal an Aire &aacute;bhartha a athr&uacute; chun freagrachta&iacute; reatha na Roinne a l&eacute;iri&uacute;.

B'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil c&uacute;is mhaith ag Sinn F&eacute;in maidir leis an bhfocla&iacute;ocht at&aacute; ann faoi l&aacute;thair, ach t&aacute; s&eacute; sin ar cheann de na ruda&iacute; ar mhaith liom a mheas go mion.  Ar deireadh, t&aacute;im tar &eacute;is labhairt leis an Aire St&aacute;it f&eacute;in agus leis an Aire, an Teachta Darragh O'Brien, ar an gceist seo agus is fi&uacute; smaoineamh ar cheart go mbeadh r&oacute;l ag &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta i sol&aacute;thar tith&iacute;ochta i gceantair Ghaeltachta, go h&aacute;irithe tith&iacute;ocht inacmhainne do Ghaeilgeoir&iacute;.  Beidh g&aacute; leis an bpr&iacute;omh-Acht a leas&uacute; chuige seo, ach ag cur san &aacute;ireamh an g&eacute;arghanntanas tith&iacute;ochta cu&iacute; sa Ghaeltacht agus an gh&eacute;arch&eacute;im teanga at&aacute; ann freisin, b'fh&eacute;idir gur fi&uacute; breithni&uacute; air seo.</p>  <p>  Mar Phort L&aacute;irgeach, chaithfinn tagairt a dh&eacute;anamh d'alt 29(1)(g) a d&rsquo;fh&aacute;gfadh, d&aacute; n-acht&oacute;fa&iacute; an Bille mar at&aacute; s&eacute;, Gaeltacht na nD&eacute;ise mar dh&aacute;ilcheantar do thoghch&aacute;in an &uacute;dar&aacute;is.  T&aacute; ceantar beag Gaeltachta againn i bPort L&aacute;irge - small, but perfectly formed, mar a deirtear.  B&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil claonadh ann i bPort L&aacute;irge dearmad a dh&eacute;anamh gur contae Gaeltachta sinne, agus b&rsquo;fh&eacute;idir go mbeadh an claonadh ann dearmad a dh&eacute;anamh orainne go n&aacute;isi&uacute;nta freisin.  Mar sin, t&aacute; s&eacute; t&aacute;bhachtach go n-&uacute;s&aacute;idfimid &aacute;r nguth agus go gcinnteoimid go gcloisfear sinn, go gcloisfear Gaelainn binn na nD&eacute;ise.  M&aacute; th&eacute;ann an Bille seo ar aghaidh, is for&aacute;il th&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; seo maidir le ceantar Gaeltachta na Rinne, muintir na Rinne agus muintir Phort L&aacute;irge.</p>  <p>  Mar fhocal scoir, gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas le Sinn F&eacute;in as an mBille a thabhairt chun tosaigh agus leis an Aire St&aacute;it as a rannph&aacute;irt&iacute;ocht inniu.</p></speech>

Ag an am c&eacute;anna, caithfear a r&aacute; go bhfuil an Bille lochtach agus nach dtugann s&eacute; aghaidh ar chuid mhaith d&uacute;shl&aacute;n a bhaineann leis na toghch&aacute;in a thabhairt ar ais, ach t&aacute; s&eacute; go maith go gcoinneofa&iacute; seo ar an gcl&aacute;r oibre.  T&aacute; m&eacute; thar a bheith s&aacute;sta go nd&uacute;irt an tAire St&aacute;it nach gceapfar na baill nua ach ar feadh tr&eacute;imhse dh&aacute; bhliain ar a mh&eacute;ad.  T&aacute; sprioc an-chinnte leagtha amach aige faoin am go bhfuil i gceist aige go mbeidh Bille nua &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta i gceist.</p>  <p>  San am gairid at&aacute; againn, is fi&uacute; breathn&uacute; siar ar an stair.  S&iacute;lim gur sa bhliain 1979 a chur ann d&rsquo;&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta don ch&eacute;ad uair.  Bh&iacute; Donncha &Oacute; Gallch&oacute;ir mar Aire nuair a f&oacute;gra&iacute;odh &eacute; agus ba &iacute; M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn a bh&iacute; ann nuair a ceapadh an bord.  An rud nua a bh&iacute; ann ag an am seo n&aacute; go raibh &eacute;ileamh &oacute; phobal na Gaeltachta go mbeadh &uacute;dar&aacute;s d&aacute; gcuid f&eacute;in acu.  Bh&iacute;odar ag breathn&uacute; ar na comhairl&iacute; contae agus rud mar sin a bh&iacute; i gceist acu - rud n&iacute;os leithne n&aacute; eagra&iacute;ocht forbartha tionscail.  T&oacute;gadh c&eacute;im a bh&iacute; misni&uacute;il ag an am; is &eacute; sin go mbeadh tromlach an bhoird tofa go daonlathach ag an bpobal.  Toghadh seachtar agus ainmn&iacute;odh seisear.  I measc na ndaoine ainmnithe, bh&iacute; an cathaoirleach.  Bh&iacute; cas ann ina dhiaidh sin nuair a bh&iacute; Gaillimh, Maigh Eo agus Contae na M&iacute; in aon toghcheantar amh&aacute;in, mar a bh&iacute; Ciarra&iacute;, Corcaigh agus Port L&aacute;irge, m&aacute;s buan mo chuimhne.  Ceann de na fadhbanna a arda&iacute;odh ag an am sin n&aacute; go raibh cuid d&oacute;ibh si&uacute;d a bh&iacute; i bhfad i gc&eacute;in ag r&aacute; d&aacute;ir&iacute;re nach raibh aon tionchar acu ar an toghch&aacute;n agus n&iacute; raibh aon ionada&iacute;ocht acu.</p>  <p>  Bhreathnaigh mise ar na comhairl&iacute; contae agus chonaic m&eacute; ag an am sin go raibh 30 duine ar Chomhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe agus 15 ar Chomhairle Cathrach na Gaillimhe.  Bh&iacute; comhairl&iacute; eile n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; iad.  Faoi l&aacute;thair, t&aacute; 39 ar Chomhairle Contae na Gaillimhe agus t&aacute; 18 ar an gcomhairle cathrach.  C&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach b&rsquo;fh&eacute;adfa&iacute; bord n&iacute;os m&oacute; a dh&eacute;anamh?  C&eacute;n dochar a dh&eacute;anfadh s&eacute; m&aacute;s &uacute;dar&aacute;s leathan pobal agus m&aacute;s &uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta at&aacute; i gceist?  Th&oacute;g m&eacute; isteach Bille nuair a bh&iacute; m&eacute; mar Aire agus thug m&eacute; ionada&iacute;ocht do chuile chontae.  Ach do na contaetha go raibh pobal m&oacute;r Gaeltacht iontu, bh&iacute; orm ionada&iacute;ocht bhreise a thabhairt le nach mbeadh d&iacute;ch&eacute;ill&iacute; ar fad ann, mar shampla, duine amh&aacute;in as Contae na M&iacute; agus duine amh&aacute;in as Gaeltacht na Gaillimhe, tar &eacute;is go bhfuil leath de dhaonra na Gaeltachta i gContae na Gaillimhe.</p> <p>Nuair at&aacute; an Bille nua &aacute; thabhairt isteach ag an Aire St&aacute;it, ba cheart d&oacute; breathn&uacute; ar r&oacute;l an &uacute;dar&aacute;is.  Ar cheart feidhmeanna breise a thabhairt d&oacute;?  An bhfuil g&eacute;arch&eacute;im i saol na Gaeltachta nach bhfuil na h&uacute;dar&aacute;is at&aacute; freagrach ast&uacute; ag tabhairt aghaidh orthu amhail feidhmeanna plean&aacute;la n&oacute; tith&iacute;ochta?  Thiocfainn leis an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag mo chomhghleaca&iacute; anseo, an Teachta &Oacute; Cathasaigh, gur cheart go mbeadh deis ag an &uacute;dar&aacute;s maidir leis an talamh agus an mhaoin at&aacute; aige agus go mbeadh eagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; deonacha tith&iacute;ochta ag f&aacute;il maoinithe &oacute;n &uacute;dar&aacute;s le tithe a th&oacute;g&aacute;il.</p> <p> Bh&iacute; buairt maidir leis an mbord tofa &oacute; thaobh ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; tionscla&iacute;ochta ach is &eacute; an bealach a leigheasadh &eacute; sin sa socr&uacute; a bh&iacute; ann roimh 2012 nuair a scriosadh gach uile sh&oacute;rt agus nuair a bhaineadh an daonlathas den &uacute;dar&aacute;s agus nuair a cuireadh c&oacute;ras a bh&iacute; bunoscionn ar fad ann - tiocfaidh m&eacute; aige sin i gceann soicind - n&aacute; go raibh coiste meast&oacute;ireachta le haghaidh togra&iacute; m&oacute;ra.  Bh&iacute; cothromas idir dhreamanna amhail Industrial Development Authority, IDA, agus Enterprise Ireland agus an feidhmeannas agus bh&iacute; tri&uacute;r comhalta boird agus an cathaoirleach.  D&aacute; dtaobh&oacute;dh an cathaoirleach leis na feidhmeanna agus na saineolaithe, in aghaidh an bhoird, n&iacute; fh&eacute;adfadh an togra dul ar aghaidh.  Ar an taobh eile den sc&eacute;al, mar bh&iacute; siadsan ag iarraidh a leas f&eacute;in a chosaint in aghaidh phobal na Gaeltachta, d'fh&eacute;adfadh s&eacute; dul ar aghaidh.  D'oibrigh s&eacute; thar cinn go praitici&uacute;il agus n&iacute;or cuireadh aon droch-thogra&iacute; ar aghaidh.</p> <p> T&aacute; rud eile ann a gcaithfidh an tAire St&aacute;it breathn&uacute; air, is &eacute; sin, ceantar feidhme an &uacute;dar&aacute;is.  T&aacute; str&aacute;ice m&oacute;r de chathair na Gaillimhe sa Ghaeltacht.  Aon duine a th&eacute;ann &oacute; theach go teach i gcuid den Ghaeltacht sin ag canbhas&aacute;il, b&iacute;onn siad ag g&aacute;ire nuair a thagtar chugat agus deirtear go bhfuil duine &oacute;n Ghaeltacht ina ch&oacute;na&iacute; s&iacute;os an bh&oacute;thair agus is &eacute; an rud at&aacute; i gceist acu n&aacute; duine a bhfuil Gaeilge acu.  N&iacute; aithn&iacute;onn siad f&eacute;in go bhfuil an chuid is m&oacute; d&oacute;ibh sa Ghaeltacht.  T&aacute; ceist mh&oacute;r ann, &oacute; tharla nach bhfeidhm&iacute;onn an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s, is &eacute; sin, ar cheart &eacute; sin a bhaint as?</p> <p> Bh&iacute; s&eacute; sin ann sa ch&eacute;ad Bhille a thug m&eacute; ar aghaidh maidir leis an &uacute;dar&aacute;s agus baineadh amach ag bord an Rialtais &eacute;.  Aire St&aacute;it a bh&iacute; ionam ag an am ach n&iacute; raibh m&eacute; ar n&oacute;s an t&Aacute;ire St&aacute;it, an Teachta Chambers, agus n&iacute; raibh m&eacute; ag su&iacute; ag bord an Rialtais.  T&aacute; s&eacute; thar a bheith t&aacute;bhachtach gur ag an Aire a bheadh ceapadh an chathaoirligh.  N&iacute;l a fhios agam an bhfuil m&eacute; chomh t&oacute;gtha leis an saol m&oacute;r le c&oacute;ras an Public Appointments Service, PAS.  T&aacute;imid ag gearradh aicme m&oacute;r den phobal amach as ceapach&aacute;in bhoird St&aacute;it a bheadh n&iacute; b'fhearr n&aacute; cuid de na daoine at&aacute; &aacute; cheapadh.  Mar a d&uacute;irt duine amh&aacute;in, go cinici&uacute;il, c&eacute; a bh&iacute;onn ar na boird seo but the great and the good of Ireland?  N&iacute; d&aacute; moladh a bh&iacute; s&eacute;.</p> <p> N&iacute; raibh s&eacute; scr&iacute;ofa sa reachta&iacute;ocht go mbeadh duine a raibh c&oacute;na&iacute; buan aige n&oacute; aici ar oile&aacute;n ar bhord an &uacute;dar&aacute;is.  B'fh&eacute;idir n&aacute;r mhiste &eacute; sin a scr&iacute;obh isteach san Acht.  Ba cheart go mbeadh l&iacute;on na ndaoine a thoghfa&iacute; i bhfad &Eacute;ireann n&iacute;os m&oacute; n&aacute; l&iacute;on na ndaoine a cheapfa&iacute;.  T&aacute; t&uacute; in ann saineolas a fh&aacute;il m&aacute; theasta&iacute;onn saineolas uait.  N&iacute;l jab an tsaineola&iacute; ag bord.  T&aacute; m&iacute;thuiscint ann faoi bhoird.  Ceapann daoine go gcaithfidh gach uile dhuine ar an mbord a bheith mar shaineola&iacute;.  Is iad sin an ceangal i mboird St&aacute;it phoibl&iacute; iad idir na saineolaithe agus an gn&aacute;thphobal.</p> <p> Is &eacute; ceann de na f&aacute;thanna go bhfuil an oiread dearmaid &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh anois n&aacute; go bhfuil saineolaithe nach bhfuil aon taith&iacute; acu ar riachtanais an phobail ag ceapadh ruda&iacute; don phobal agus gan aon duine timpeall an bhoird ag r&aacute; gur cheart go bhfanfaimis soicind agus nach n-oibreoidh s&eacute; seo go praitici&uacute;il.  Mar sin, ba cheart go mbeadh formh&oacute;r an bhoird thofa.</p> <p> Breathna&iacute;onn s&eacute; go minic sa saol at&aacute; ann anois go bhfuil fait&iacute;os orainn roimh an bpobal.  T&aacute; dream &eacute;igin &aacute;it &eacute;igin n&oacute; t&aacute; rud &eacute;igin san aer i measc m&oacute;ruaisle na t&iacute;re at&aacute; ag iarraidh an t-am ar fad an daonlathas a mhaol&uacute; agus a laghd&uacute;.  T&aacute; siad ag iarraidh cumhachta&iacute; a bhaint den dream at&aacute; tofa ag an bpobal agus mar sin t&aacute; siad ag iarraidh cumhachta&iacute; a bhaint den phobal an t-am uile.  C&eacute;ard faoina bhfuil fait&iacute;os orthu?  T&aacute; an pobal ag &eacute;ir&iacute; tuirseach de seo.  Ba cheart go seasaimid, na daoine a thoghadh, go l&aacute;idir ar son chearta an phobail.</p> <p> Mar dhuine Gaeltachta agus duine a bhfuil c&oacute;na&iacute; air sa Ghaeltacht, t&aacute; m&eacute; in ann a r&aacute; gurb &eacute; rogha fhormh&oacute;r an phobail gur ag muintir na Gaeltachta a bheadh an say is m&oacute; ar bhord an &uacute;dar&aacute;is agus gur iontu si&uacute;d at&aacute; an mhuin&iacute;n.  Dhearfaid&iacute;s leat, nuair athra&iacute;odh an bord in 2012, gur scoireadh an ceangal a bh&iacute; ann roimhe sin idir an bord, an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s agus an pobal.  D'&eacute;irigh deighilt agus neamhaird agus n&iacute; raibh aon chaint m&oacute;r&aacute;n n&iacute;os m&oacute; i measc an phobail ar an &uacute;dar&aacute;s n&oacute; ar a th&aacute;bhacht.  Scriosadh a bh&iacute; ann sa rud a rinneadh in 2012.</p> <p> Ba cheart breathn&uacute; air th&iacute;os i gContae Mhaigh Eo mar shampla.  C&eacute; mh&eacute;ad de na comhairleoir&iacute; i gContae Mhaigh Eo at&aacute; ina gc&oacute;na&iacute; sa Ghaeltacht?  Is ag na comhairleoir&iacute; ar fad a bh&iacute; an rogha.  I gContae na Gaillimhe, s&iacute;lim go bhfuil c&uacute;igear de na comhairleoir&iacute; ina gc&oacute;na&iacute; sa Ghaeltacht, as 39.  T&aacute; formh&oacute;r ina gc&oacute;na&iacute; taobh thoir den chathair de na daoine agus is iad si&uacute;d at&aacute; ag roghn&uacute; ar son phobal na Gaeltachta agus is daoine iad nach bhfuil Gaeilge ar bith acu.  &Aacute;if&eacute;is a bh&iacute; ann.  Tabhair ar ais don phobal &eacute; agus m&aacute; dh&eacute;antar m&iacute;thuiscint, is ar an bpobal a thitfidh an fhreagracht.</p> <p> Molaim an Teachta &Oacute; Snodaigh agus gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis as ucht &eacute; seo a chur os comhair na D&aacute;la.  D&eacute;arfainn go dtuigfeadh s&eacute; sin go bhfuil lochtanna ann agus go bhfuil go leor ruda&iacute; eile ann ar cheart d&oacute;ibh a bheith sa Bhille ach caithfimid &eacute; seo a choinne&aacute;il ar bharr an chl&aacute;ir oibre sa D&aacute;il.  T&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm faoin m&eacute;id a d'fh&oacute;gra&iacute;odh tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na.  T&aacute; dl&uacute;s leis an obair.  T&aacute; an cur chuige go maith agus t&aacute; s&uacute;il agam go mbeidh Bille foirfe l&aacute;idir d&uacute;shl&aacute;nach Gaeltachta os &aacute;r gcomhair amach agus go bhfeicimid an pobal, uair amh&aacute;in eile, i gceannas ar a gcuid todhcha&iacute; f&eacute;in.</p></speech>

T&aacute;imid ag iarraidh go mbeidh toghch&aacute;in ann agus go mbeadh an Bille rite in am do 2024, nuair a bheidh na toghch&aacute;in &aacute;iti&uacute;la ar si&uacute;l.  Ina dhiaidh sin, beidh jab m&oacute;r le d&eacute;anamh againn &oacute; thaobh na ceisteanna a d'arda&iacute;odh, agus a d'ardaigh an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v ach go h&aacute;irithe, &oacute; thaobh feidhmeanna, maoinithe agus cur chuige an &uacute;dar&aacute;is ina ioml&aacute;ine.  N&iacute;l a fhios agam an f&eacute;idir linn fanacht ar Bhille m&oacute;r cuimsitheach.  B'fh&eacute;idir gur f&eacute;idir m&aacute; t&aacute; an cur chuige ceart againn ach nuair a rinne muid iarracht mar sin a dh&eacute;anamh le hAcht na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la (Leas&uacute;), 2021, chonaic muid go raibh moill ann.  Nuair a dh&eacute;anann muid iarracht istigh anseo, &eacute;ir&iacute;onn moill agus moill eile.  Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil mise ag iarraidh go mbeadh an d&aacute; rud scartha &oacute;na ch&eacute;ile.  T&aacute; deich mbliana imithe &oacute; fuarthas r&eacute;idh leis an mbord daonlathach.  N&iacute; raibh s&eacute; go hioml&aacute;n daonlathach mar bh&iacute; cead ag an Aire a dhaoine f&eacute;in a roghn&uacute; agus a chur ar an mbord chomh maith c&eacute;anna.  Is f&eacute;idir an cheist a chur, an bord ioml&aacute;n daonlathach &eacute; ar n&oacute;s na gcomhairl&iacute; contae?  </p>  <p>  Agus &eacute; sin r&aacute;ite, t&aacute;im s&aacute;sta dul ar ais go dt&iacute; an bealach ina raibh s&eacute; in 2012 agus obair a dh&eacute;anamh ina dhiaidh sin.  M&aacute; thagann Bille n&iacute;os cuimsith&iacute; a dh&eacute;ile&aacute;lann leis na ceisteanna at&aacute; ardaithe anseo, is f&eacute;idir na hathruithe sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  T&aacute; an ceart ag an Teachta &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v gur ch&oacute;ir go mbeadh muid ag f&eacute;achaint ar conas is f&eacute;idir linn a chinnti&uacute; go bhfuil daoine difri&uacute;la roghnaithe ag an bpobal don bhord sin.  T&aacute;im ag caint faoi inscne agus daoine &oacute; cheantair na n-oile&aacute;n, mar shampla.  Faoi l&aacute;thair, is &eacute; an bealach is fearr at&aacute; ann n&aacute; an bealach a bh&iacute; ag an &uacute;dar&aacute;s nuair a buna&iacute;odh &eacute;, is &eacute; sin, aitheantas a thabhairt do na ceantair Ghaeltachta difri&uacute;la agus cinnte a dh&eacute;anamh de go bhfuil daoine &oacute; chuile cheantar Gaeltachta ann.</p>  <p>  Is g&aacute; d&uacute;inn f&eacute;achaint ar an gceist mh&oacute;r lena mbeidh muid ag pl&eacute; amach anseo.  Imp&iacute;m ar an Aire St&aacute;it ceannteidil an Bhille a fhoilsi&uacute; a luaithe agus is f&eacute;idir ionas gur f&eacute;idir leis teacht isteach ag an gcoiste chun go mbeimid in ann d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis an pre-legislative scrutiny go tapa agus gan mhoill.  Is f&eacute;idir leis an Roinn a bheith ag obair ar an dr&eacute;acht&uacute; ag an am c&eacute;anna.  T&aacute; fadhbanna ag teacht muna dtaca&iacute;mid leis an &uacute;dar&aacute;s.  N&iacute;or tugadh ach &euro;1 milli&uacute;n breise d&oacute; i mbliana.  &Oacute; thaobh an choibhnis idir an IDA agus Enterprise Ireland ar an taobh amh&aacute;in agus an t-&uacute;dar&aacute;s ar an taobh eile, t&aacute; an difr&iacute;ocht ag m&eacute;ad&uacute; an t-am ar fad agus b&iacute;onn difr&iacute;ochta&iacute; sa chur chuige at&aacute; ann ina leith.  Ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach air sin agus a chinnti&uacute; go bhfuil taca&iacute;ocht ann don &uacute;dar&aacute;s.  Sular tugadh plean&aacute;il teanga d&oacute; mar cheann d&aacute; fheidhmeanna, bh&iacute; maoini&uacute; &aacute;irithe aige.  N&iacute;or tugadh maoini&uacute; m&oacute;r go leor d&oacute; chun d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis na dualgais bhreise a tugadh d&oacute;.   Ba ch&oacute;ir d&uacute;inn d&iacute;ri&uacute; isteach air sin.</p>  <p>  T&aacute;im s&aacute;sta nach bhfuil an Rialtas ag cur i gcoinne an reachta&iacute;ocht seo.  B&iacute;m s&aacute;sta i gc&oacute;na&iacute; nuair a dh&eacute;anann s&eacute; amhlaidh.  T&aacute; s&eacute; go maith.  M&aacute; t&aacute; seans ar bith ann go mbeadh aon mhoill ar reachta&iacute;ocht &oacute;n Rialtas, ba ch&oacute;ir d&oacute; ligean don Bhille seo dul os comhair an choiste.  T&aacute; s&eacute; tar &eacute;is an cinneadh seo a ghlacadh.  D&eacute;anfaidh muid d&eacute;ile&aacute;il leis chomh tapa agus is f&eacute;idir agus leasuithe beaga a chur chun cinn. </p>  <p>  Cuireadh srian orainn roimhe seo nuair a d&uacute;radh linn go raibh costas i gceist agus iarradh orainn na for&aacute;lacha chun na toghch&aacute;in a fuarthas r&eacute;idh leo in 2012 a thabhairt ar ais a chur i mBille.  T&aacute; mise den tuairim gur f&eacute;idir linn &eacute; sin a dh&eacute;anamh.  Is f&eacute;idir linn obair a dh&eacute;anamh chun a chinnti&uacute; go bhfuil tionchar agus st&aacute;das ag an &uacute;dar&aacute;s agus gur f&eacute;idir leis a chuid oibre a dh&eacute;anamh.  Bh&iacute; m&eacute; ar an gcl&aacute;r "7 L&aacute;" an tseachtain seo caite n&oacute; an tseachtain roimhe agus bh&iacute; Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Neachtain, iarchathaoirleach bhord &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta agus iar-MEP, faoi agallamh d&iacute;reach romham.  D&uacute;irt s&eacute; gur ceann de na f&aacute;thanna nach raibh airgead breise ann n&aacute; nach raibh stocaireacht &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ag an mbord toisc nach &eacute; sin a jab.  B'fh&eacute;idir nach ndeachaigh s&eacute; fada go leor agus nach raibh a fhios ag an mbord gur ceann de na r&oacute;il at&aacute; ag boird n&aacute; stocaireacht a dh&eacute;anamh chun airgead breise a fh&aacute;il.  Chomh maith leis sin, t&aacute; s&eacute; mar r&oacute;l ag gach bord an obair at&aacute; roimhe a chur faoi bhr&aacute;id an Aire agus gach duine eile, agus a chinnti&uacute; go dtuigeann daoine go d&iacute;reach c&aacute; bhfuil an t-airgead ag dul agus c&aacute; bhfuil an g&aacute;.</p>  <p>  Bh&iacute; an tAire St&aacute;it in a l&aacute;n de na ceantair Ghaeltachta le tamall anuas.  Thug s&eacute; airgead breise anuraidh, mar at&aacute; luaite.  T&aacute; dl&uacute;s leis an m&eacute;id oibre at&aacute; &aacute; dh&eacute;anamh ag an &uacute;dar&aacute;s ach n&iacute;or tugadh breis airgead, seachas an &euro;1 milli&uacute;n, d&oacute; i mbliana in ainneoin go bhfuil costais bhreise ar gach uile cheantar sa t&iacute;r agus go h&aacute;irithe ar cheantair Ghaeltachta at&aacute; ag triail le fosta&iacute;ocht nua a mhealladh agus seanfhoirgnimh - n&oacute; seanfhothrach i roinnt c&aacute;sanna - a athmhaisi&uacute; agus a th&oacute;g&aacute;il suas chun d&aacute;ta.  T&aacute; ag &eacute;ir&iacute; leo ach t&aacute; i bhfad &Eacute;ireann n&iacute;os m&oacute; gur f&eacute;idir a dh&eacute;anamh chun comhlachta&iacute; a mhealladh chuig na ceantair sin agus chun go mbeadh tuiscint acu si&uacute;d at&aacute; ag obair leis an &uacute;dar&aacute;s i bplean&aacute;il teanga go bhfuil siad in ann fanacht toisc go bhfuil fol&uacute;ntais ag teacht.  T&aacute; s&eacute; r&iacute;th&aacute;bhachtach go leanann an obair sin n&oacute; beidh baol ann i roinn de na ceantair Ghaeltachta.</p>  <p>  N&iacute;l m&eacute; chun cur le fad na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta seo.  </p> <p>Is trua nach raibh aon Chomhalta &oacute; Fhine Gael i l&aacute;thair.  In ainneoin go bhfuair siadsan r&eacute;idh leis, bh&iacute; s&eacute; sp&eacute;isi&uacute;il nuair a buna&iacute;odh &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta go raibh siadsan ag d&eacute;anamh gear&aacute;n go raibh sraith ainmni&uacute;ch&aacute;n ar f&aacute;il d&rsquo;aon Aire ar bith agus nach raibh s&eacute; sin daonlathach ag an am.  Tamall de bhlianta ina dhiaidh sin, fuair siad r&eacute;idh leis go hioml&aacute;n.  N&iacute; thuigim c&eacute;n f&aacute;th nach bhfuil aon Chomhalta &oacute; Fhine Gael buartha faoi seo.  Measaim gurbh &eacute; an Teachta &Oacute; Cathasaigh a labhair faoin daonlathas.  I gc&aacute;s na hinstiti&uacute;id&iacute; ar fad sa St&aacute;t &oacute;n leibh&eacute;al is &iacute;sle - na comhairl&iacute; contae, na chomhairl&iacute; ceantair agus mar sin de - ba ch&oacute;ir go nd&eacute;anfaimid an rud a d&uacute;radh thar na blianta; is &eacute; sin, an decentralisation n&aacute;r tharla riamh.  Seo ceann de na c&aacute;sanna ina bhfuil cumhachta&iacute; &aacute; tabhairt do ghn&aacute;thphobal na t&iacute;re agus sa ch&aacute;s seo is ceantar Gaeltachta at&aacute; ann, an Ghaeltacht ina ioml&aacute;ine at&aacute; ann.  Beidh s&eacute; de chumhacht ag an bpobal tionchar a bheith acu ar na cinnt&iacute; a ghlacfar, na cinn a dh&eacute;anfaidh dochar n&oacute; a dh&eacute;anfaidh tairbhe, ina gceantar f&eacute;in.</p> <p> Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire St&aacute;it agus leis na Comhalta&iacute; a ghlac p&aacute;irt sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht.  T&aacute;im s&aacute;sta go bhfuil s&eacute; seo ag teacht chun cinn agus go bhfuil an tAire St&aacute;it tiomanta chun an tuairisc &oacute;n chomhairli&uacute;ch&aacute;n a thabhairt os &aacute;r gcomhair roimh an Nollaig, agus gur f&eacute;idir linn bogadh ar aghaidh ansin muna tharla&iacute;onn s&eacute; roimhe sin.</p></speech>
