It is a sector I have backed with new and innovative schemes and that I will continue to back into the future given its value.  It provides feed for our livestock sector and materials for our food and beverage sectors.</p>  <p>While no specific targets are set by my Department for land use associated with the growing of crops for 2022 to 2025, I support the tillage sector through targeted policy interventions and supports.  </p>  <p>  The protein aid scheme has been implemented since 2015 with a budget of &euro;3 million and a target payment of &euro;250 per hectare.  In Ireland&rsquo;s 2023-27 CAP strategic plan, the budget has been increased to &euro;7 million with an increased target payment of &euro;350 per hectare.  In 2021, I introduced the straw incorporation measure, which aims to improve our tillage soils.  In 2022, this measure will deliver an estimated &euro;12 million in support for the tillage crops sector.  I have committed this hugely important measure as part of our next CAP strategic plan.</p>  <p>  In response to the illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia, I introduced the tillage incentive scheme with a &euro;400 per hectare payment on additional crop area.  I bolstered the existing protein scheme by guaranteeing a &euro;300 per hectare payment on beans, peas and lupins and I also introduced a protein cereal mixed crop scheme.  </p>  <p>  These measures have been acknowledged as contributing to the estimated 6% increase in tillage area or additional 20,000 ha, in 2022.  Just yesterday, at a meeting of the national fodder and food security committee, I tasked the committee with scoping out how much more grain we can grow domestically next year to build on the strong return this year.</p>  <p>  Tillage farmers have always been leaders in their willingness to adopt new technology at farm level.  The tillage capital investment scheme provides support to farmers to invest in modern equipment and infrastructure.  To date, tillage farmers have received &euro;31 million in financial support under the scheme.  </p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy that I will continue to work with this important sector and provide the targeted Government support it deserves given the importance of the sector within the wider agricultural industry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400003#A00600"><p>I thank the Minister for that response.  The context of this conversation has changed dramatically because the Russian invasion of Ukraine has exposed fault lines in global, EU and domestic policy on food security.  Of course, Sinn F&eacute;in recognises that the Government is limited in its ability to respond to geopolitical events and global commodity markets and, therefore, any response, while needing the immediacy the Minister has mentioned for this year and next year, also needs to be long term.  One area in which the Government can play a role is in incentivising increased tillage production.  That requires targets.  We have approximately 324,000 ha.  The land under production has fallen by 42% since 1980 ,and 15% in recent years.  Will the Minister examine setting targets for the sector?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400003#A00700"><p>I definitely want to see the area under production increase.  The trend in recent years and decades where the area under tillage has shrunk is not good for Irish agriculture.  We have tremendous potential to grow grain successfully and productively in this country and I want to put a big emphasis on improving that in the time ahead.  Looking at the range of schemes that we have in place this year and that are plugged into the next CAP strategic plan, it is evident that support for the tillage sector is strong.  It is hard to know how much we can push it.  My focus is on the push and pull factors that we can put in place and to stretching the capacity to deliver as much as possible.  We could set targets but it is not the target that will deliver the outcome but the schemes, the pushes and pulls that we can put in place.  We have a lot of measures in place now to try to make progress.  Farmers have stepped up to the mark this year and tillage farmers, in particular, have delivered that 6% increase, which is something we hope to build on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400003#A00800"><p>I acknowledge that tillage production did increase by 6.1% so far this year, which I think was 78% of the objective.  Approximately 13,000 ha of that related to cereal, which was just an increase of 4.5%.  This is a crucially important area as I am sure the Minister recognises, including for other sectors that need feed.  It makes sense if we can produce it in Ireland.  It also makes sense from the perspective of reaching our climate action obligations.  This is win-win if it is a win for the farmers.  Many farmers moved from tillage into other sectors because tillage production was unprofitable and, therefore, the challenge is to make it profitable.  There have been positive examples in my constituency.  The farmers involved in Irish Organic Mill have created an industry they were told was impossible in a county like Monaghan.  However, to expand and to support farmers in that endeavour we need a holistic strategy.</p></speech>

It is encouraging and shows the potential that is there.  Any measure that we can take to push and maximise the potential to reverse the trend of recent years and to grow tillage again is something I will consider and promote.  The straw incorporation scheme, for example, which I launched as a pilot measure for the first time last year, delivers up to &euro;10,000 for a tillage farmer with 100 acres.  That is something that I have plugged into this CAP strategic plan and, therefore, it has moved from a pilot scheme to a permanent scheme under the next CAP programme that will run up to 2027.  There was a meeting of the national fodder and food security committee yesterday under the chairmanship of Mike Magan, under the advisory leadership of Dr. Frank O'Mara and all of the key agriculture stakeholders.  I asked them to reflect on the progress we have made this year and to come back to me with their advice on how we can build on that next year and in the years ahead.  I look forward to receiving their advice.</p></speech>

Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 is a commercial State body responsible for the overall administration, promotion and development of the horse racing industry.</p> <p>The horse and greyhound racing industries receive financial support from the State through the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund under section 12 of the Act.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine makes payments from the fund to HRI and to R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann, RC&Eacute;.  In the period 2001 to 2021, a total of &euro;1.46 billion was paid from the fund to the horse and greyhound racing industries in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  Exchequer support provided from the fund is crucial to the survival and continued development of the horse racing industry.  </p> <p> In budget 2022, an allocation of &euro;88 million was provided for the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund.  This is distributed in accordance with section 12(6) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, with 80%, or &euro;70.4 million, going to HRI and 20%, or &euro;17.6 million, to RC&Eacute;.</p> <p> Horse racing in Ireland is administered on an all-island basis involving 26 racecourses.  HRI has informed my Department that all 26 racecourses are affiliated to the Association of Irish Racecourses, AIR.  The AIR chairperson is a board member of HRI.  This board member also sits on HRI&rsquo;s fixtures committee and is also the chair of HRI&rsquo;s media rights committee.  As the Deputy will be aware, the HRI fixture committee controls the allocation of fixtures which is key for generating income for all racecourses irrespective of their size.</p> <p> HRI has also informed my Department that the merging of 26 racecourses for the sale of media rights has been key to delivering significant revenue increases over the past ten years.  While the details of the media rights allocated to racecourses is commercially sensitive, overall grade 2 tracks have seen strong growth since the last deal was agreed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1610" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400004#B00200"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I have a concern over how equitable the media rights contract is.  Appearing before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and Marine on 15 June, the CEO of HRI said that it is taking the market rate.  I believe this is incorrect.  Since the transfer from the Turf Club, its take has more than doubled from 7% to 16%.  The corresponding market rate in the UK is completely different from that in Ireland.  Ultimately, the breakdown is such that the smaller tracks are not getting their fair amount of funding as a result.  I will table several questions on this to break it all down.  I appreciate that there may be some commercial sensitivities.  Given the amount of State funding being given, it needs to be distributed equitably across racecourses in Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400004#B00300"><p>Smaller racecourses have gained from being aligned with the larger racecourses and this has enhanced their value.  Media rights agreements are subject to approval by HRI and the 26 racecourses involved.</p>  <p>  While I take on board the points the Deputy has raised and am happy to discuss it today, racecourses also contribute an element of their sponsorship income to prize money with bigger tracks providing a more significant percentage - at least double - with the majority of funding coming from HRI and then owners.</p>  <p>  During the Covid-19 pandemic, HRI allowed all tracks retain whatever sponsorship they had while racing took place behind closed doors.  Obviously, that was a very difficult time for racecourses.</p>  <p>  As provided in legislation, HRI has operated several different racecourse capital schemes over the years.  These investments have allowed racecourses to install fit-for-purpose infrastructure for both participants and patrons.</p>  <p>  During the period from 2015 to 2019, a total of 23 racecourses received financial assistance from HRI under this measure involving grant aid of &euro;29.5 million with a total investment cost of &euro;135 million, exclusive of VAT.  Grant aid was generally provided at a rate of 40%.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1610" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400004#B00400"><p>We need to dig deeper into this and consider smaller racecourses such as Thurles and Kilbeggan.  The reality is that HRI has mainly used racecourse revenue received through the media rights fixture charge on capital programmes on the four largest racecourses, two of which it owns, at the expense of smaller rural racecourses.  The Minister previously gave the direction that 50% should be used for long-term infrastructural projects, but that is not happening.  We need to dig into the data and break down where the funding is going because this cannot continue.  The Minister of State should go around some of the smaller racecourses and he will see some of them no longer have the infrastructure.  They are not in good nick.  We need to break down where the funding is going.  The set-up of the current contract is not viable.</p></speech>

As I outlined in my response, 23 of the 26 tracks have benefited from capital grants for infrastructure work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1610" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400004#B00600"><p>Some &euro;8,000.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that smaller tracks are benefiting from being part of a larger scheme.  Where is the great value in terms of media rights when media organisations are looking to buy?  The larger race days will attract the highest value.  It makes sense that the smaller tracks, which have days that are very important to their local communities but might not be as attractive for media coverage, also benefit from being part of that.  As I mentioned previously, all 26 racecourses as well as the HRI approved that media rights deal.  I would be happy to go through this in more detail in time.</p></speech>

The Brexit Adjustment Reserve has strict criteria that must be met to qualify for funding.  In particular any proposed measures must address the direct negative impacts arising from Brexit.</p>  <p>  A number of sectors have been adversely affected by Brexit with immediate effect.  To date, measures have been funded to support the fisheries and horticulture sectors, including the new measure, the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, announced last month to support the development of the seed potato sector.  A capital investment scheme to support the processing sector in diversifying into non-UK markets is also in place.</p>  <p>  Overall, however, the value of our main agrifood exports to the UK has been resilient, with increases in many categories in 2021.  Nonetheless, we will continue to monitor the impact of increased competition in the UK market for Irish food exports as a result of new UK free-trade agreements with third countries.  Non-tariff barriers may also increase costs for Irish businesses exporting products to the UK.  Over the coming years, these factors may increase the competitiveness challenge for Irish products on the UK market, which is why I am exploring whether BAR funding can support measures which would future-proof and build resilience in the agrifood sector.  This approach is not explicitly provided for in the BAR regulation, so it requires further analysis which my Department is currently undertaking in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  I emphasise that the eligibility criteria for BAR in respect of any measures proposed must be met, as must other regular EU funding control requirements, including state aid rules.</p></speech>

Those stories ensured that Ireland was allocated &euro;1 billion from the BAR.  I do not believe they have received the benefit of that.  I welcome that the fishing sector received a large allocation.  I also welcome the &euro;3 million allocated to the seed potato sector, something I advocated for.  As the Minister said, &euro;100 million has been provided to the processing sector.  Considering all the challenges and the fact that Brexit has had an impact not just on market access but also on input costs, we need to go much further much quicker.</p></speech>

As the UK is the main destination for our agrifood exports, the risk factor there was massive.</p> <p>The fact that there was a trade and co-operation agreement mitigated some of the worst fears we had in regard to tariff barriers and other issues.  Thankfully, since Brexit, trade with the UK has been very strong, as have prices and value.  Of course, there are structural challenges in regard to how that evolves over time.  We are working hard to see what opportunities might be there.  While the trade and co-operation agreement has protected the wider economy and sheltered agriculture, it has had a very real impact on fisheries.  We are in the process of delivering up to &euro;400 million in funding for the fisheries sector to support and invest in it.  Any ideas in this regard that Deputy Carthy may have are very welcome.  My ears are fully open.  As he is aware, I want to support the agri-food sector in every way possible, including any mechanisms that might be there through the BAR.  If Deputy Carthy has any particular suggestions, I would welcome them.</p></speech>

The difficulty is that farmers are told that there is a pot of &euro;1 billion to support those who are impacted by Brexit, and although their sector is potentially most impacted, they have not got a fair share as of yet.  We know that there are significant challenges facing the sector, in particular as a result of input costs soaring in the past year or so.</p>  <p>  Unfortunately, the European crisis reserve was not utilised through co-financing.  We have not seen the benefit of the &euro;1.5 billion from carbon tax receipts that we were told would be additional to the CAP.  Instead, they were incorporated into the CAP.  In terms of the Brexit adjustment reserve, I fear that farmers will not get their fair share.  Of course, I am happy to work with the Minister in any way I can to support his efforts, but can we ensure that this issue is prioritised across the Government?</p></speech>

The criteria for qualifying for the Brexit adjustment reserve are very specific.  One has to show the direct impact.  Thankfully, agri-food has done well since Brexit, in particular our trade with the UK.  We are looking at any potential options.</p>  <p>  In terms of any content the Deputy might have or particular suggestions, it is easy to talk about a fair share and to talk in generalities, but there is not much content or proposals in what he has said this morning.</p></speech>

I have done it separate to the emergency support of &euro;15 million because there is less red tape involved by going through national Exchequer funding.</p></speech>

The programme for Government set out a target of 8,000 ha of new forests per year but we are planting only 2,000 ha.  The Social, Economic Environmental Forestry Association of Ireland, SEEFA, which was formed last year to represent private sector forestry in this crisis, continues to raise major issues in the industry.  What is the Government doing in response?</p></reply>

These are to have a well-functioning forestry licensing system, a clear and shared vision for the future of forestry in Ireland, and a new forestry programme which will encourage sustainable forest creation and management that meets societal needs.</p>  <p>  In line with these objectives, I set up Project Woodland more than a year ago to tackle the licensing issue and the backlog and to focus on developing a new forest strategy to promote woodland creation.  We have made significant progress, along with a wide range of stakeholders from the forestry sector.  Among other things, we now have clarity on the regulatory framework, the definition of a backlog, and the principles which will underpin the forest strategy.</p>  <p>  Regarding the licensing system, we have committed to issuing 5,250 licences this year.  That is an ambitious target and is an increase of 30% on last year.  Up to 30 June, the Department issued 2,449 licences, just short of the projected average of 2,635, which is 93% of the target we had planned to reach at this stage.  We are close to or above our projected target across the individual categories of private felling, Coillte felling and roads.  While afforestation is not at the same level, I fully expect the number of licences to increase in the second half of the year and for us to deliver on our projections, which have been shared with the sector.</p>  <p>  We have made, and continue to make, improvements to our system.  We have recruited extra resources, with 35 full-time ecologists now in place.  We are implementing the recommendations from a business process review, with 39% of those complete or in progress.  In addition, the Department is now developing an action plan for the implementation of the recommendations contained in the independent regulatory review of the forestry licensing system, with some of those already in hand.</p>  <p>  Regarding the backlog, the Department currently has 3,148 applications on hand.  Since 1 January, this figure has reduced from 4,800, and from 6,000 in August 2021.  This is significant progress.  The number of applications now in backlog, that is, for more than 120 days, now stands at 2,500, and we intend to maintain our momentum in reducing this number.</p></speech>

National afforestation rates have decreased since the formation of this Government.  It is one of the reasons I voted no confidence in the Government this week.  The service is currently reaching a dismal 25% of the target.</p>  <p>  For the first six months of the year, only 297 afforestation licences were issued.  That is 43% behind the Department's own target.  Significant and ongoing delays in processing and making licence decisions are a major cause.  Also, the sector has identified that afforestation incentives are not competitive with other farm subsidies and schemes.  The Department's policy is discouraging farmers from planting more trees.  The ambitious milk target in Food Harvest 2020 was met in 2017 and the beef target was met in 2011.  However, at its highest, only 50% of the forestry target was reached, and it is closer to 20% today.  Reports from the sector are clear, that the Government's forestry policy is dismal and there is little sign that anything will change.</p></speech>

The figures I gave in my initial response show that progress is being made.  We fully accept the difficulties with afforestation.  We receive about eight applications per week from farmers.  It is not about the throughput of the issuing of the licences, it is the interest.  I accept that confidence in the sector is incredibly low among farmers and landowners.  We accept that and we know we must address it.  We know we have to incentivise it more.  We know there are challenges to forestry from other land-use sectors.  We are working, for example, towards integrating forestry as much as we can with the Common Agricultural Policy schemes.  It is important that it does not become a case of either forestry or farming: it must be fully integrated.  We are working incredibly hard with the sector and all of the stakeholders through Project Woodland to create a forestry programme next year that will be fit for purpose and will attract farmers and landowners into forestry.  Ultimately, that is everyone's aim.</p></speech>

I cannot understand how it is not more of a priority, especially when the Green Party is in government, given that the climate benefits from carbon sequestration to compensate for net emission-producing areas are so clear.</p>  <p>  The 2021 climate action plan recognises that afforestation is the single largest land-based climate change mitigation measure available to Ireland, yet the Government's policies are reaching a disastrous one quarter of the targets.  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has already found that the climate action plan will be entirely insufficient.  Now that the sectoral targets are being negotiated, with demands for a 22% cut in agricultural emissions, without sufficient forestry there is not a hope of that sectoral target being reached.  I am interested to know what the Minister and his two Ministers of State think the sectoral target should be.  Given the Government's track record on this, I have no confidence that it will achieve either the forestry or climate targets.</p></speech>

This is one of the issues that we dealt with more than any other at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I would love to see the figures the Minister of State is using because everybody in the sector says the Department will not reach the target this year.  No one, other than those in the Department, is convinced the target will be reached this year.  The stakeholders keep telling the Minister of State that.</p> <p>Can we see the figures?  Deputy Cairns is correct.  The Government will not meet the target this year.</p></speech>

If the Deputies do not believe me, they can see them.  We are fully aware of the necessity to increase our afforestation.  We are also aware of the carbon benefits that can supply and, if they are planted correctly, the benefits to the wider environment, whether to water biodiversity, soil quality and so forth.  This is why we are having continued engagement with the sector and stakeholders on our new forestry programme, which is only due to start in 2023.  That is not kicking the can down the road but rather when it is due to start.  The new forestry programme will last five years.</p>  <p>  We are working hard to develop measures that are attractive for farmers, deliver for the societal needs of our country, meet our climate and biodiversity targets relating to water and so forth, and re-engage people.  We accept we need to re-engage with farmers and landowners because we have significant challenges ahead, and if we do not have farmers on side, we are not going to meet any of these targets across the board.  It is important we reach out and continue that engagement, and that is what myself and my ministerial colleagues are continuing to do.</p></speech>

Between October and December 2021, a Brexit temporary fleet tie-up scheme made available supports of between &euro;4,600 and &euro;88,700 per month, depending on vessel size, for vessels to tie up for a calendar month.  Vessels in the Rockall squid fishery could tie up for two months, which 179 vessels availed of.  I introduced this tie-up scheme again in May and it will operate until November.</p>  <p>  To further assist the fishing fleet in these difficult times the Deputy mentioned, I am allowing each vessel to receive aid for up to two months this year rather than one month, as was the case in the previous year, despite the sea fisheries task force having recommended just one month for this year too.  A total of 67 vessel owners availed of that in June and 43 in July.  For the inshore fleet, a Brexit inshore fisheries business model adjustment scheme operated from January to March and was availed of by 754 inshore fishing vessel owners, delivering between &euro;2,700 and &euro;4,000.  We have also announced a &euro;45 million Brexit processing capital support scheme and, for coastal communities, a &euro;25 million Brexit blue economy enterprise development scheme to deliver grants of up to &euro;200,000 for capital investments in coastal areas.</p>  <p>  There are specific challenges at the moment with regard to fuel and the impact coming from Ukraine.  Unlike in other sectors, no excise duty is charged on marine fuel and VAT on marine fuel is reclaimable and, therefore, there is no Government take in respect of the fuel.  In effect, the industry is seeking a subsidy to help meet the undoubtedly significant cost.  I met representatives and had a strong, in-depth conversation with them, and I am considering the submissions they made to me.</p></speech>

Another one has been voted for and announced in recent days and the Government needs to avail of it.  The Minister referred to the Brexit Adjustment Reserve fund earlier and a tie-up scheme to compensate for the decommissioning of our fleet and the loss of so much of our quota.  That is totally separate from the issues that have emerged in the context of the impact of the Russian war on Ukraine.</p>  <p>  I cannot put this starkly enough, although I appreciate the Minister has met representatives.  This is unprecedented.  All the fishing organisations nationally, including IFA aquaculture and inshore and offshore representatives, have united and used the strongest language to say they cannot go to sea or meet their responsibilities to the food sector.  The EU is not looking to tie up boats; it wants people to go out to sea to provide food for the European economy.  When is the Minister going to help them do that?</p></speech>

The challenge relating to fuel is one we have been dealing with for some months since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  I previously met all those organisations together to discuss this issue.  Their request to me in March and April was for a second tie-up scheme.  The seafood fisheries task force had recommended only a one-month tie-up scheme for this year, but the fishers' representatives asked me for two and I responded to that by delivering a second one.  Through that, we delivered &euro;25 million in funding to the sector, allowing one in three vessels in any one month to tie up and the other two vessels that were out fishing to avail of the quota that was freed up as a result.  They asked me specifically for that given the challenging cost backdrop that exists due to fuel and so on, and I responded and delivered.  I met them again on the continuing issues a week ago and I am considering the challenges.  I know very much from talking to fishers the pressure they are under from a cost point of view and I am considering that strongly.</p></speech>

When I say "unprecedented", as the Minister will be aware, I mean all the producer organisations, including all those from the islands, IFA aquaculture representatives and fisheries local action groups.  I have never seen every organisation unite.  Some of them have certainly united previously but this is all of them, the entire sector, uniting to tell the Minister they cannot go to sea or afford all the input costs they face.  This is an unprecedented crisis on the back of a loss of quota due to Brexit.  To be clear, the BAR fund is a separate matter to intervening now in what is a serious threat to the future of our industry, as the Minister will know having met fishers.  They cannot afford to go to sea.</p>  <p>  The fuel price at which they can make a profit is 60 cent per litre but it now costs &euro;1.30 per litre.  That is an impossible challenge for them and there has to be some form of financial aid package to keep them at sea.</p></speech>

Such a scheme is not in place in other countries that have been impacted by Brexit, although without doubt they have been impacted to a lesser extent than us.  That was their specific request to me then and I delivered on it.  I met them again as recently as last week for further discussions on this.</p>  <p>  I reiterate there is no Government tax on marine diesel.  There is VAT but it is fully reclaimable, so any support that is delivered will actually subsidise the net cost, minus tax, of fuel.  Undoubtedly, the margins are such for many fishermen at the moment that they cannot make a profit or are very challenged in that regard.  I have been listening to and engaging with them, which I will continue to do, and I will consider the submissions they have made to me.</p></speech>

What further measures can be achieved, both in the budget and beyond, to help farmers as they struggle with the cost of inputs?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.61" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="09:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400006#D01600"><p>I thank the Deputy for his engagement and for his advocacy on behalf of farm families over these challenging months.  The input price challenge facing our farm families is something we are both very much aware of, as is the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon.  Over the past year, significant price rises have occurred, primarily in the energy sector, with natural gas and oil prices reaching record highs.  These high prices have had significant impacts in all sectors.  Following a strong year for farm incomes last year, when average incomes were up by 26% to more than &euro;34,000, Teagasc has forecast that a decline in 2022 is now highly likely, given output price increases will fail to offset the increase in production costs.</p> <p>Significantly higher production costs will be a feature across all sectors in 2022 and, as we know, higher fertiliser costs and fuel prices are leading to increased pressure at farm-gate level.  As the Deputy also knows, I set up the national fodder and food security committee to provide leadership and bring all our key stakeholders together to plot and lead out in meeting these challenges over the course of the year.  The Department also has a rapid response team in place to do this.</p> <p> In terms of supports, I announced a number of measures valued at &euro;91 million this year to support the agrifood sector, including, importantly, the &euro;56 million fodder support package, which delivers &euro;1,000 per farm family to support the increased costs of making fodder, silage and hay up to 10 ha.  I also delivered &euro;20 million in two packages for the pig sector.  I am working closely with the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, who is chair of the round table discussion on the pig sector and who has led out strongly on this challenge.  I delivered &euro;12 million for the tillage sector and then, with the Minister of State, Senator Hackett, &euro;3 million for the horticulture sector, which has suffered a challenging situation.</p> <p> These targeted measures are helping Irish farmers to mitigate the escalating costs they are facing.  We are continuing to monitor the situation and, obviously, as we come up to the budget at the end of September, it will be very much to the forefront of our minds.</p></speech>

He may have noted that in my question I used the word "further" because I acknowledge very much the interventions that have been made to date.  Current political discourse too often ignores the interventions that have already been made and that is not positive for anybody.  We must acknowledge when things have already been done.</p>  <p>  I very much welcome the fodder, pig, tillage and horticulture interventions, which are very important.  However, the Government must consider every possible assistance for farmers in those areas we can control, such as taxes of which the Government is in charge, and in areas such as energy by examining whether more can be done on green diesel engines, or even looking at areas such as motor tax to see if more can be done to help our farmers.  Every possible Government charge that is applied to farmers makes it more expensive for them do business and affects their bottom line.  I ask the Minister to focus on these issues in the budget and look at everything to try to bring down the cost of doing business for farmers.</p></speech>

It is something on which the Deputy has also engaged very closely with the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, and me, and we will continue that engagement.</p>  <p>  The measures introduced in recent months have been thought through to try to deliver support to farm families in the best and most effective way possible in a way that supports them from a cost point of view, helps underpin their farm incomes but also, very importantly, delivers for the agrifood sector in terms of productivity.  We will continue to reflect very closely on this as we come towards the budget at the end of September.  We are assessing closely what the emerging and continuing challenges are.</p>  <p>  We are working closely with the national fodder and food security committee, which I met as recently as yesterday.  I asked the committee to come back with further assessments with regard to how we could support and grow our tillage sector in particular, which is important in the context of the Ukrainian grain supply challenges.  I look forward to working closely with Deputy Griffin and everyone across government to continue to support our farm families in the coming months.</p></speech>

In the context of budget negotiations - I have been there - Ministers have a responsibility to consider matters that are directly related to their Department and secure the best possible package.  The Minister has already done that and I have no doubt he will do it again.  However, I encourage him to also look at the bigger picture with regard to income tax and the universal social charge, USC.  Taxation has a major effect on our farming families as well.  The people who work hard on our farms all over the country, in every pocket and every size of farm, deserve a break.  They are paying too much on income tax and USC.  I encourage the Minister to engage with the Department of Finance to address what is needed for the agriculture sector but also to look at wider taxation issues.  That will directly impact on the farmers the Minister represents.  It will make a massive difference to our farmers in this very difficult time when they are paying much more to produce what they have been doing all along.  I encourage the Minister to do that in the broader context of this budget.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.66" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1613" speakername="Martin Browne" time="09:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400007#E00500"><p>I appreciate what the Minister has done so far but there is more that could be done.  Farmers repeatedly hear that it is not possible to support them in certain ways due to European state aid rules, yet the European crisis reserve provided &euro;15.8 million and allowed for co-financing at 200%, up to &euro;31.6 million.  However, the Minister opted for the minimal approach instead.  What could have been crucial revenue for many farmers, including the pig farmers about whom the Minister spoke and who have been impacted by this crisis, has been forgone.</p>  <p>  Fourteen EU countries believe so much in their farmers that they will co-finance to the level of 196% or higher but Ireland is not one of them.  I know the Minister had to notify the European Commission of his intentions regarding the European crisis reserve by the end of last month.  Given the current circumstances, I believe there would be an opportunity in that regard if the Minister were to engage with the Commission.  Will he do right by our farmers and contact the Commission to see if we can we get the permission unlocked for that funding?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.67" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1546" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="09:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400007#E00600"><p>Deputy Griffin is absolutely right.  Farmers are normal citizens with the same normal everyday pressures on their families that every other family has outside of their daily working lives.  Obviously, there are particular pressures in terms of their work life and cost pressures, on which the Government is supporting them with as best it can.</p>  <p>  Likewise, there is a real pressure arising from the general increase in the cost of living and ordinary non-farming life.  It is really important that we look at how we can reward and support farmers and families in general.  We will certainly look at this in the round with regard to families as we prepare for this budget.</p>  <p>  With regard to Deputy Browne's point, &euro;50 million came from the crisis reserve at European level.  We have spent that on the pig sector specifically.  As I outlined to Deputy Griffin, I have delivered &euro;91 million overall this year in direct funding to support farmers.  I chose not to use that particular mechanism because it is laden down with unnecessary red tape.  Instead of co-funding that &euro;15 million and imposing lots of avoidable terms and conditions on that funding, which would have made it more difficult for farming, I stepped outside of that and provided national funding, which I delivered to farmers through a different mechanism.  This was much more straightforward whereas what Deputy Browne proposed would actually bog down everything in red tape and would not be to the benefit of farm families.</p></speech>

First and foremost, I utterly condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  It is an appalling, barbaric act and has caused untold misery, death and destruction all over Ukraine.  The impacts are also felt here in a very different way, however, and are causing great difficulty for people.  How does the Minister of State plan to continue to respond to this?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.71" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="09:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400007#E01000"><p>I thank Deputy Griffin for raising a really important point.  I completely agree that the humanitarian crisis will always take priority in terms of our view of this matter.  As the Deputy outlined, there are also significant implications, which we are seeing across all sectors, including the agrifood sector, from Russia's illegal and awful war in Ukraine.  We need to take the necessary steps to ensure food security is maintained for EU citizens, the Ukrainian people and in the wider global context.</p>  <p>  Following a strong year for family farm incomes in 2021, where average incomes were up by 26% to more than &euro;34,000, Teagasc has forecast that a decline in 2022 is now highly likely as output price increases will fail to offset the rise in production costs.  I am acutely aware of the challenges facing our farm families as a result of these input price increases.</p>  <p>  Significantly higher production costs will be a feature across all sectors in 2022, with higher fertiliser, feed and fuel prices leading to an increase in agriculture input costs.  The current market outlook for output prices is uncertain, with significant upward pressure apparent, but this is unlikely to cover the additional input costs for many farmers.</p>  <p>  The Minister and I meet stakeholders on an ongoing basis to discuss the impact of the Ukraine crisis on Irish agriculture and supply chains.  At the start of the crisis, we established the national fodder and food security committee and tasked it with the preparation of a response to the emerging crisis in feed, fodder, fertiliser and other inputs and developing contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their farm enterprises.   We also established a rapid response team within the Department, chaired by the Secretary General, to monitor the impacts on agrifood supply chains actively and to contribute to the whole-of-government response.</p> <p>Fertiliser merchants have indicated that there are adequate supplies of fertiliser in Ireland at present.  However, there may be issues with availability of certain products at times and importers are active in securing alternative supply lines where necessary.  Fertiliser affordability and availability is one of the biggest challenges facing our farmers at present.</p></speech>

In fairness to both the Minister and the Minister of State they have worked very hard and have done their best in what are very difficult circumstances.  That effort needs to continue because the three Fs - fertiliser, feed and fuel - are killing farmers right now.  The impacts pale into insignificance in the context of what is happening on the humanitarian front on the ground in Ukraine, but the impact on farmers here economically is massive.  In the context of the budget negotiations, and further to the previous question, I ask that all those input costs be factored into the Minister's and Minister of State's rationale in terms of the package they are seeking.  Perhaps stuff that is not directly within their remit has to be examined as well in the overall picture when they are going to the Department of Finance and seeking a package for farmers.  The cost of produce and of doing business for farmers has absolutely exploded and gone through the roof.  It is unsustainable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.74" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1586" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="09:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400008#F00300"><p>It is important that the point raised by Deputy Griffin and its impact are discussed in the House.  I should point out that there are sufficient supplies of animal feed at present and importers are actively competing on the global market to ensure that supply continues uninterrupted.  Animal feed stocks and imports are being monitored on a regular basis by my Department.  What Deputy Griffin outlines is a stress and strain on farmers due to the very high input costs.  Even though across a number of sectors there are very high commodity prices in many instances, it was a big stress for tillage, dairy, beef or sheep farmers to purchase either the seed for the tillage farmers or the fertiliser and all the different elements because if the price was to change after they had made that significant investment they would be very much caught out.  That is why the Minister and I intervened with a number of measures valued at &euro;91 million, so far, to assist the agrifood sector.  They include the &euro;56 million fodder support scheme and the packages for the pig sector, tillage sector and horticulture sector.  The point the Deputy made regarding the budget is valid as well.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, the Russians, and we know their form, appear to be dug in for a war of attrition.  They do not care how long this goes on or how many people die.  They do not care about the destruction and the death they cause.  This could be a situation that we will have to deal with for quite some time, so that has to be part of the Minister's and Minister of State's thinking and rationale certainly with regard to the forthcoming budget, to allow for a very lengthy disruption of what was normal business prior to 24 February.</p><p><font color="#00201F">  In addition, could the green diesel situation be examined further?

We continue to engage with stakeholders and continue to work across government, and with our European partners, in response to this.  We are taking a very proactive approach to the crisis in Ukraine.  We must protect our farm families and their businesses through this period of significant upheaval.  As Minister of State with responsibility for farm safety and farmer mental health and well-being, I am very conscious of the stress this puts on farmers and farm families.  We have stood with them to date with significant interventions worth over &euro;91 million so far this year.  I, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and our colleagues in the Department will continue to stand with them, and that will obviously be to the forefront of our minds in our preparations for the upcoming budget.</p></speech>

We know that herds are built up over a considerable length of time.  There is a big investment and big commitment by the individual farmer, and we do not switch on or off the breeding or development of herds.  The current compensation levels do not reflect the reality of the prices paid in marts today.  I appeal to the Minister to have the compensation levels for cattle that are depopulated due to tuberculosis, TB, revised upwards.</p></reply>

As somebody who is a strong advocate on behalf of farmers in his constituency and as a former Minister for agriculture, this is an issue he has worked on consistently over the last number of years.  I too am acutely aware of the emotional and financial burden that comes with a TB breakdown for a farm family, so making significant progress in reducing TB incidence rates remains a key priority of mine.</p>  <p>  The main compensation provision of the bovine TB programme is the on-farm market valuation scheme which compensates eligible herd-owners up to the market value an individual animal would have attained on the open market at the time of its valuation under the scheme.  The valuations are carried out by independent valuers who are informed by summary market prices which reflect the most up-to-date market values for various categories sold on the open market.  In addition to the on-farm market valuation compensation package, depopulation grants may be paid to eligible herd-owners whose herds are depopulated either totally or partially.  The grant is paid per animal removed in the depopulation measure and for those removed as reactors since the holding was restricted, on condition that the herd-owner agrees to the depopulation at the time specified by the Department.</p>  <p>  As part of the work of the TB forum, a dedicated financial working group comprising representatives from my Department and the farming organisations was established 16 months ago to review the current financial model of the TB programme.  Its remit includes a review of compensation schemes with respect to all types of bovine herds.  Recommendations from the finance working group will be submitted to the TB forum for consideration.</p>  <p>  Compensation rates for TB reactor animals are capped under the provisions of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013.  Herd-owners in possession of very valuable animals should give careful consideration to mitigating their risks by taking out insurance, thereby enabling them to recover the full market value of such animals in the event of an outbreak of TB in the herd.  By all of industry working together, and I know the Deputy will agree with this, we can achieve significant progress in reducing the scourge of TB in our farming sector for farm families.</p></speech>

That continues and it is hugely important for dealing with animal disease on an all-Ireland basis.  I sincerely hope that this co-operation, which has existed for many years, will work as robustly as it did in the past.</p>  <p>  The Minister mentioned the TB forum and the financial working group.  I hope that will report without further delay.  The Minister said it was established 15 months ago, but prices and costs for everything have changed dramatically in the meantime.  Perhaps the Minister would ask the working group to report to the forum without further delay.</p>  <p>  The caps are outdated at present.  The Minister knows from talking to farmers at the marts and from being in the mart himself that the prices for a number of cattle are exceeding the maximum payment the Department can pay in respect of a depopulated animal.  That live valuation scheme needs to be amended.  There is also a need for simplification.  I hope the Minister will amend the scheme to ensure that the true market value of the animals being depopulated will be reflected in the compensation payment.</p></speech>

The next meeting of the financial working group is on 21 July.  That will be attended by officials from my Department and representatives of the farming organisations.  The group has held five meetings this year so I look forward to it completing its work.  It was the TB forum that was set up 16 months ago and it has a number of working groups under it.  It was very important to come together and work to one strategy.  I acknowledge the work of all key stakeholders.  It is only through everyone working together and everyone recognising the importance of following the scientific advice here that we can bring down TB rates and reduce the hardship involved for families as well as the cost impact for them.</p>  <p>  The current animal ceiling under the on-farm market value scheme is &euro;3,000 in respect of an individual bovine, except in the case of a stock bull where the ceiling is &euro;4,000 or a pedigree stock bull in the same breakdown episode which has a ceiling of &euro;5,000.  However, it is all being considered by the financial working group.</p></speech>

I have concern about the compensation being adequate for pedigree cattle.  Those of us who were reared on farms and represent rural communities take great pride in looking at quality animals at our shows every year and in visiting individual farmers.  I have a concern that valuable pedigree lines could be lost.  I know of some individual farmers who win national awards every year and would have a number of substantive pedigree herds.  If they are unfortunate enough to have a partial or total depopulation, it will mean financial ruin for them.  We need to address that particular matter.  I emphasise again that our farmers have built up quality herds over the years.  When disease comes into a herd it is, to use a phrase we have often heard, like a death in the family.

Overall, we can take heart from the fact that by everyone working together in the TB forum and by agreeing the new TB strategy, we are making progress.  We can make real progress on that in the time ahead by coming together working together.  The financial aspects of that are important and the finance working group is considering those in detail.  It will produce its report very soon and I am looking forward to that.</p></speech>

In Europe, significant numbers of people are going to die in the coming weeks as a consequence of the heatwave we are seeing.  Yet, in Ireland we are already off track on our already inadequate targets.  The Minister is widely reported to be lobbying within the Government on behalf of big agribusiness to have the lowest possible emissions cuts within the biggest emitting sector.  I ask the Minister to tell me how that makes sense.</p></reply>

As he will be aware, the Government will soon establish and publish our sectoral emission ceilings.  The Climate Action Plan 2021 set out a reduction range of between 22% and 30% for the agricultural sector from an emissions baseline of 23 MT CO2 equivalent in 2018.  The achievement of this target will take a whole-of-government and whole-of-sector approach.  I am committed to working with the sector on achieving emissions reductions.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I established the Food Vision Dairy 2030 group.  The objective of this group is to propose measures that will reduce emissions in the dairy sector.  The group is currently working on the final report, having submitted an interim report to me a number of weeks ago.  A similar group was more recently established for the beef and sheepmeat sectors focused on the climate challenges facing these important sectors.</p>  <p>  These groups were not starting with a blank page.  We have a roadmap for the sector to reduce emissions over the course of the decade.  The climate action plan set out a number of core measures that the sector will need to implement over the coming years.  These measures include a significant reduction in chemical nitrogen fertiliser use, which is a key objective of the EU farm to fork strategy.  Other important measures include changing the type of fertiliser N we apply, increasing the level of organic farming and reducing the finishing ages of our prime beef animals.</p>  <p>  The Teagasc signpost farms initiative, along with many public and private advisors, will play a key role in upskilling farmers in the years ahead.  The new CAP strategic plan contains a number of measures that will support a transition to a more sustainable agriculture sector, including increased financial supports for organic farming.  Clearly, incentivisation from industry, in addition to regulation where appropriate, will be acquired to achieve our climate objectives.  By implementing the measures contained within the climate action plan, I am confident that we can transition the sector to a more long-term sustainable platform with co-benefits for air and water quality and biodiversity, while at all times maintaining productivity in this sector.  Strong progress has already been made.  We will build on this in the time ahead.</p></speech>

Even if agriculture does 30%, the rest of society still has to do 60% to meet the inadequate target of a 51% reduction, on which we are already off track.  If, as the Minister is widely reported as arguing for, we choose a reduction of 22%, the rest of society has to do 68%.  If, for example, we do that through energy, that is an extra cost per household of &euro;5,000 each.  Will the Minister tell me how it makes sense to do this from the points of view of the climate, small farmers and households as a whole?  Why should big agri-business basically take an extremely minimal approach to doing what is necessary, considering the extent of its emissions?</p></speech>

We have to consider the important role that agriculture plays in food production in this country.  It is also important to know and understand that because we do not have the industrial base that other developed countries have, agriculture makes up a bigger proportion of our national emissions.  Reaching the 22% part of the range would see transformational change in our agriculture systems.  Our starting point is that we are one of the most efficient food producers in the world in terms of carbon emissions.  Our food production is grass- and pasture-based and we have a very good system from an animal welfare point of view, as well as from an emissions point of view.  We have to build on and improve that even further, as must all other sectors of society, and in a way that continues to produce food.  As the Deputy will know, across the world it is becoming increasingly hard to produce food given the climate challenge we are all facing.  It is important that we continue to play an important role for our farm families-----</p></speech>

Almost half of farms in this country have an income of less than &euro;10,000.  The Minister&rsquo;s industrialised farming system works for Greencore, Kerry Group, Goodman and the big dairy farmers, but it does not work for others.  The figures are there in Teagasc.  Instead of incentivising and pushing farmers to engage in industrialised farming that does not work for small farmers, is extremely damaging for the environment and does not work for society as a whole, why do we not instead have a farming policy that is based on food sovereignty, the principles of regenerative farming and paying farmers for the carbon sequestration services they provide?  Instead of subsidising farmers to engage in industrialised farming that is damaging for all of us, why not instead pay farmers for the important services they provide in terms of our environment?  Who would win from that and who would lose from that?  Big agri-business would lose from it and the vast majority of small farmers and ordinary people would win from it.</p></speech>

He is the only one who uses that language.  We have a family farming model in this country which, frankly and thankfully, the Deputy does not really have a bull&rsquo;s notion about or an understanding of.  It is based on work that farm families do right across the country.  People throughout the food supply chain try to maximise the value of that.  We ensure that farm families are supported.  It is important that this work continues.</p>  <p>  As I said our starting point for agriculture in this country is that we are one of the most efficient food producers in the world from a carbon and climate point of view.  That is something we need to build on and improve, which we are determined to do, as are farm families and those right across the food sector.</p>  <p>  In terms of my engagement at Government level, I am seeking to strike the appropriate balance between doing everything we possibly can to reduce the emissions footprint of how we produce food and continuing the important work of producing sustainable, healthy and nutritious food in this country.  </p></speech>

For me, the key issue is animal cruelty.  However, even from the point of view of value for money, over the last few weeks <i>The Sunday Times</i>Ireland edition has exposed the fact that greyhound industry insiders make up over half of all race attendees and that all of the State funding into the Irish greyhound industry is effectively being lost because it ends up subsidising the low-cost sale of dogs to the UK.</p></reply>

The 2021 Power report found that the greyhound industry provides and supports considerable employment both directly and indirectly across the Irish economy.  It is estimated that in 2019, the industry supported over 4,000 full-time and part-time jobs in the economy.  In addition, there are over 6,000 active greyhound owners.  The total number of people deriving economic benefit from the sector is estimated at over 10,000.  The Department provides dedicated financial support under the Horse and Greyhound Fund to R&aacute;sa&iacute;ocht Con &Eacute;ireann, RC&Eacute;, the statutory body responsible for the operation and regulation of the greyhound industry.  Since 2021, my Department has ring fenced 10% of the RC&Eacute; allocation from the horse and greyhound racing fund for welfare matters.  In addition, the Greyhound Racing Act 2019 develops the legislative basis for the industry, strengthening the integrity and welfare of the industry.  A key element of the new legislation is the provision, for the first time, for a full IT traceability system for racing greyhounds.  The funding provided to the greyhound racing sector helps sustain a longstanding tradition as the industry is part of the social fabric of our country.  The funding underpins economic activity in what are, in many instances, highly rural areas.</p>  <p>  The future of the industry is dependent on a strong governance platform and on the industry having the highest standards of integrity and welfare.  There is a strong commitment to improved animal welfare in this sector in the programme for Government.  The Department remains focused on ensuring that RC&Eacute; is compliant with the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, including an oversight agreement in the form of a shareholder's letter of expectation, which is produced annually and updated as required.  The annual report and accounts of RC&Eacute; are audited by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and are presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We are very committed to the continued strengthening of welfare standards in the greyhound industry.  Future funding of the sector is dependent on welfare standards being upheld.  That is reflected in the annual parameters set out by my officials in their engagement with RC&Eacute;.</p></speech>

An analysis conducted by Preferred Results business consultants, and reported in <i>The Sunday Times</i>Ireland edition, found that 6,300 Irish greyhounds are exported annually to the UK and sold at a loss of almost &euro;5,000 each.  Effectively, it is a direct subsidy from the public, through the greyhound racing industry, to the British greyhound racing industry.  Regardless of the rights and wrongs of funding the Irish greyhound industry, why on earth are we effectively funding the British greyhound racing industry?  Why are we funding the greyhound industry when over half of those attending greyhound races are getting complimentary tickets?  In other words, they are to some degree insiders.  There is not a big public appetite for greyhound racing.  We do not see big queues of people going to events.  Why are we still providing public funding for the industry?</p></speech>

It is particularly important to support it.  It is something that we are continuing to do.  The structure and the oversight of the industry is also important.  The legislative underpinning of the whole sector was significantly changed and strengthened through the Greyhound Racing Act 2019 that we introduced in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad.  Going forward, while the provision of funding is important, public support, through attendance and participation, is crucial for the industry.  RC&Eacute; must focus on that and on its engagement with the wider public to ensure that its racetracks have strong public attendance.  That is really important for the future health of the industry.  Both of those aspects are important.  Certainly, the public funding plays a significant role in underpinning the industry.</p></speech>

That is a huge amount of money, without which I do not think the greyhound racing industry would continue in this country.  I think that would be a good thing in terms of animal welfare.  Of course, I wish to emphasise that nobody should be out of a job as a consequence of that.  There needs to be a just transition for those involved in the greyhound racing industry, with everybody guaranteed a job of at least equivalent terms and conditions and so on.</p><p>I ask the Minister to respond to the reports published in <i>The Sunday Times</i>Ireland edition, in particular, those highlighting the fact that we are subsidising the low-cost sale of dogs to Britain, that the majority of Irish public funding that is provided to RC&Eacute; effectively goes to supporting the British greyhound racing industry and that the Irish greyhound racing industry is sustaining a shortfall of over &euro;30 million a year in supplying greyhounds to the UK.</p></speech>

The funding also goes into welfare measures and supports the welfare of greyhounds.  As the Deputy said, without the funding the greyhound racing industry would be very much undermined.  I am aware the Deputy has no problem with doing away with the industry altogether.  He is not a big advocate of industry or business in general.  I know that he would like to see the industry erased altogether.  However, the industry provides employment.  While it is not important to everyone, it is an important part of our social fabric and of many people's lives.  We have to value that.  Going forward, it is important that alongside the public funding, we see economic revenue generated through participation.  That is a significant task for RC&Eacute; in ensuring that revenue streams are improved.</p></speech>

At the same time, I long for the days when Brexit was the biggest crisis we faced.  However, it is still a crisis.  It has caused significant difficulty, particularly for the agri-food sector.  I ask the Minister of State to update the House on matters pertaining to Brexit in that regard.</p></reply>

It was, and continues to be, a big challenge.  We have to be aware of the medium-term challenges from the fallout from Brexit, particularly in the agri-food sector.  The Deputy will be aware that the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, TCA, maintained tariff-free access for all goods traded between the UK and the EU.  This was a positive outcome of the negotiations, particularly in respect of trade in agricultural goods, as the imposition of tariffs on these goods would have added considerable costs for Irish exporters to the UK.  However, as I have outlined, the full impacts of Brexit on the Irish agri-food sector are still evolving and have not been fully realised yet.  For example, the UK Government's decision in April 2022 to defer the introduction of full import controls on EU products entering the UK to the end of 2023 - the fourth time these requirements have been postponed - continues to create ongoing uncertainty for Irish food exporters.  Uncertainty also continues in respect of the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol, due to the UK Government's legislative proposals which could result in it disapplying large parts of the protocol.  The conclusion reached on this issue could therefore also have significant impacts on Irish and British agri-food supply chains.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to do everything that it can to ensure that the UK Government meets its international obligations and, in conjunction with the EU, delivers solutions which address the needs of all the people and businesses on the island of Ireland.  It is worth noting that despite this ongoing uncertainty, Irish exports of agri-food products to the UK have remained resilient since the end of the transition period.  The value of our exports to the UK in 2021 was up by &euro;438 million, or 8.2%, compared to 2020; and by &euro;291 million, or 5.3%, when compared to 2019 figures.  This underlines the value of the extensive collaboration that has taken place between the Government and the agri-food sector in preparing for the new trading environment post-Brexit.  However, we cannot be complacent.  We will continue to monitor developments closely and to put in place the necessary support for the sector to meet any new challenges that arise.  I continue to work on the area of new market development outside of our dependency on the UK market, which I will discuss further in my supplementary response.</p></speech>

I do not think any of us in 2016 envisaged we would still be talking about this in the D&aacute;il Chamber on the last day of the summer term in 2022.  Unfortunately, we are where we are.  While we can start talking about the blame game and the appalling behaviour of the British Government and of parties such as the DUP, with their scorpion and frog approach to Brexit, we have to be pragmatic in keeping up the efforts to support farm families on this island in the challenges Brexit presents and the potentially fatal challenges it might cause to some businesses also.</p></speech>

Since the result of the Brexit referendum, however, we have stepped up the efforts of diversification, and in my role with responsibility for new market development in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I have worked very closely with the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and we have opened and improved access to markets around the world.  We have looked also to grow our European markets to reduce the risk attached to an overdependency on the UK market that is now outside the Single Market.</p>  <p>  Two of the most valuable markets, the USA and China, are non-EU markets, and in fact ten of the top 20 markets are.  They stretch from Japan to Canada, both of which are examples of where we have improved access now.  These markets may seem far removed from the Irish farm, but what happens on the shelves of the Canadian supermarkets or in restaurants in Japan actually really matters.  We will continue to work to expand these and other markets to ensure we can position Irish produce to the highest value and obtain the best return possible for our farmers.</p></speech>

Those efforts need to be further intensified.  For example, if there is one positive for us to come out of the current situation it the exports to the US, which is a market of great importance for us.  It is something on which I would encourage the Minister of State to maintain his efforts.</p>  <p>  The sooner we can have closure and certainty on the protocol and Brexit, the better for everyone in business, in particular, for our farmers, who are so exposed.  I encourage both Ministers to continue the good work with the Department of Foreign Affairs, as that co-operation is very important in resolving this matter once and for all.  We would rather not have to deal with this at all but we have to deal with reality, and this is something that needs to be concluded as soon as we can.</p></speech>

I am a firm believer in controlling the things we can control, and in respect of my role in the Department, that is clearly to look at tangible efforts to ensure we have a broader diversification of the markets we export into.</p>  <p>  There was no better example of that recently than when the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, and I attending the sod-turning of the &euro;200 million investment in the new Glanbia cheese plant in Belview.  This is an investment that will bring 400 construction jobs to the south east along with 80 permanent jobs and will support the incomes of 4,500 farm families who will supply the plant.  It is being built as a result of Brexit because that plant will produce continental cheeses for the global market from 2024.  This development will diversify Glanbia&rsquo;s offering away from the more traditional Cheddar offering that is bound for the UK.</p>  <p>  Through its partnership with Royal A-ware, Irish farmers will now be producing milk which will go to make Edam, Gouda, and Emmental cheeses destined for the shelves of European markets.  Yes, the UK will remain an important market but we must continue to insulate ourselves against those future risks.</p></speech>

Ultimately, we must defend the best interests of our farm families.  This is a key focus at all times for me, the senior Minister, Deputy McConalogue and for all in government.</p>  <p>  In this regard, it is worth noting that the scale of the additional market access for the most sensitive products has been limited to less than 1% of EU consumption levels. The increase in New Zealand's access to the EU markets for these most sensitive products has been significantly limited by way of new tariff rate quotas, which means these markets have not been fully liberalised, thus protecting the interests of Irish and EU producers.  This is due to the efforts of Ireland and other EU member states in highlighting sensitivities for our agricultural producers and in limiting the Commission's scope to meet New Zealand's much higher demands in these product categories.  An example of this saw the agreed sheep meat quota limited to 38,000 tonnes, which is significantly less than the original 114,000 tonnes offer made by the Commission. </p>  <p>  My Department is currently analysing the full draft texts,  which were only published last week, in particular on the outcomes on sensitive agri-food products.  This analysis is ongoing and is being conducted in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which is the lead Department on trade policy.  This analysis will inform any decision on whether to conduct a socioeconomic and environmental impact assessment of the final agreement.</p></speech>

This is a valid question to ask because while the EU Commission can talk of both trading partners being winners from reduced tariffs that open up the opportunities for exporters, when New Zealand's top exports are red meat, sheep meat and its imports comprise industrial goods generally, the export benefits for Ireland's agricultural industry seem very limited indeed.</p>  <p>  Our family farmers are facing increased costs to produce their goods, and we all know that from what is happening.  If New Zealand's beef, sheep meat and dairy are to enter our markets, with the additional injection from this agreement, with these very products coming from elsewhere, demand could fall and prices could be suppressed.  A socioeconomic and environmental impact assessment for this proposed deal must be carried out.  Our farmers cannot be left to deal with the consequences of what could be a badly arranged deal.</p></speech>

The business model of our farm families in this country is very much dependent on the fact we are a small, open nation that exports 90% of the food and drink we produce here.  Therefore, as an exporting nation, trade deals are very important.  In respect of our place in Europe, it is the case we benefit greatly from the trade deals Europe has undertaken across a number of countries.</p>  <p>  If the Deputy is to look at the discussion we were having in the previous question around moving away to new markets through diversification, all those trade deals matter.  In respect of these deals, we will look at the sensitivities in these areas and we will protect farmers interests in that regard, but there are a number of offensive benefits to such trade deals as well for our sectors.</p></speech>

The Government's own economic and sustainability impact assessment on it has resulted in its opposition to that deal.  It found it would cost Irish beef farmers &euro;55 million annually as the market would be diluted by another 53,000 tonnes of an increase.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, the European Ombudsman accused the EU of maladministration precisely because it did not base the trade negotiations on an assessment of the socioeconomic and environmental impact.  This only adds to the case for a similar assessment to be carried out on the EU-New Zealand deal.  Will the Minister of State commit to this?</p>  <p>  Now that the Government is opposed to the Mercosur deal, why has there been a delay in communicating this to the European Commission?  Has the Government notified the Commission of this opposition yet and, if not, will the Minister of State tell this House when the Government intends to do so?</p></speech>

This is an area in which we obviously have a clear insight in respect of the sensitivities that would have an impact on Irish farm families.</p> <p>Tariffs on EU exports to New Zealand will go down to zero from day one of application of the agreement, which is important to bear in mind, including for key EU export products such as pig meat, pet food, ice cream and dairy products, including cheeses.</p> <p> The pig meat sector has gone through a difficult time and the Government has stepped in to support it.  There are benefits for those areas.  The Deputy asked for the analysis that will be done on this.  That is ongoing in terms of our next steps as to analysis of the agreement, the details of which were only published last week.</p></speech>

The additional needs payment is available to people if they have expenses they cannot pay from their weekly income.  In response to the cost-of-living crisis, I have taken a number of steps to simplify the process of applying for this payment.  These measures include making it clear that the payment is available to both social welfare recipients and families on low incomes, including persons who work 30 hours or more; updating the income guidelines in line with the working family payment; ensuring community welfare officers, CWOs, continue to have discretion to issue payments to assist individuals or households in unique hardship circumstances; establishing a new national community welfare contact centre which can be contacted at 0818-607080; and running a major national awareness campaign, including national radio adverts, to promote and raise awareness of the additional needs payment.</p><p>Community welfare officers are available in 51 Intreo centres throughout the country to meet and assist customers five days per week.  They can facilitate in-person and emergency meetings by phone or in any Intreo centre or branch office.  If the need arises, a direct home visit appointment can be arranged.</p><p>The application form for an additional needs payment is also available online. The completed application form can be posted or dropped into the local Intreo centre where it will be processed promptly.</p><p>My Department is examining establishing a direct online application process for the additional needs payment.  All information on how to apply for the payment is available at <i>www.gov.ie/en/service/4eb45-additional-needs-payment/</i>.  I want to ensure people know the additional needs payment is available to support them if they are experiencing financial hardship.  The payment is demand-led and there is no budget cap on it.</p></speech>

She is in that school situation whereby she has to sign on for the summer months.  It was difficult for her.  She said she could not go to her local community welfare officer because she would feel embarrassed and ashamed.  She should not feel like that but we know, for some, that is how they would feel.  Online access would be very important and make a difference.</p>  <p>  On accessing the community welfare officers, the previous walk-in was important and is a loss because in some cases the Intreo centre is not in a person's town.  He or she has to travel and that causes difficulties.  That should be looked at.</p></speech>

My officials are seeing how we can put it online for some people.  I am trying to make it as easy as possible for people to access this payment.  I understand some people do not want to have to meet somebody so we have a central phone line.  If somebody cannot go to an Intreo office, he or she can ring up and make an appointment and the community welfare officer can visit the house, if that is what is needed.  A person can phone or email the community welfare officer.  I have tried to make it as accessible as possible because this payment and support is the State safety net to help people who run into difficulty and need it.  It is targeted at those on social welfare and low-income families.  I encourage anybody having difficulties to contact their community welfare officer.  Everybody is experiencing an increase in the cost of living and there is no shame in doing it.</p></speech>

That is welcome.  While the online access will be helpful for some, as will phone and email, for others it will not be.  In my home town we have Syrian and Afghan refugees and now Ukrainians.  We do not have an Intreo centre in the town.  There are difficulties.  Previously, a person could walk into the local health centre and see the CWO.  Some of them have little access to phones and do not have email.  This has been raised with me by the local family resource centre.  Others in opposition have raised the issue of accessing CWOs.  I think it is an issue and that it should be looked at as regards walk-ins.</p></speech>

In the same period last year, 23,000 payments were made.  That is a nearly 20% increase in the number of payments year on year for the first five months.</p>  <p>  I have ensured there has been a widespread media campaign to tell people how to access their community welfare officer.

The back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance scheme provides a once-off payment to eligible families to assist with the costs of clothing and footwear when children start or return to school each autumn.  The scheme operates from June to September each year.  This scheme recognises the pressures families with schoolgoing children are under at this time of year, particularly given the cost-of-living challenges people are facing.  This year I have increased the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance payment by &euro;100 for the 2022 scheme year, building on the previously announced budget 2022 increase of &euro;10.</p> <p>The increased rates of payment for the 2022 scheme are &euro;260 for children aged between four and 11 and &euro;385 for children aged 12 and older.  These changes and increases are really important in assisting families with purchasing school uniforms and other back-to-school related costs.  The scheme will remain open for applications until 30 September.  A total of &euro;84 million has been secured for the scheme this year, an increase of &euro;26 million.  To qualify for this allowance, a person must meet a number of conditions including an income limit test.  I have increased the income limits for one-parent families this year to bring them in line with the income limits for two-parent families, widening the eligibility for that cohort of customers.  This was an issue that had been raised with me by lone-parent groups and I was glad to be able to respond.</p> <p> In addition, I recently announced that the provision of the hot school meal option will be extended to all new DEIS primary schools and the cold lunch option to all new DEIS secondary schools at a full-year cost of &euro;26 million.  That will benefit some 60,000 additional children.  There are approximately 317 new DEIS schools and those schools will have the option to apply for the school meals programme so there will be 60,000 more children getting a school lunch.</p></speech>

I would never say that she is a person who does not have concern for those going back to school.  I welcome the expenditure she has secured in terms of advance steps.  I will refer to those who are not eligible for back-to-school payments.  Recent surveys have shown that the average cost of sending a child back to school is now nearly &euro;1,200 for a primary school student and nearly &euro;1,500 for a child in secondary school.  The Irish League of Credit Unions recently released the results of a survey that showed that nearly 24% of families get into debt at this time of year.  It is a significant cost and, as the Minister knows, it is also rising rapidly.  I welcome the Minister's announcement with regard to subsidising school transport and the additions she has outlined but are we doing enough to address the core of the issue of school costs?</p>  <p>  I will raise the issue of school contributions, which every family faces at this time of year.  It is very hard to avoid them.  It is very hard on kids to feel excluded or to be sent home with envelopes asking for school contributions when their parents are really struggling.  It may be time to look at capitation grants.  Will the Minister speak to the Minister for Education about increasing capitation grants to schools nationwide?</p></speech>

Free school transport will be a big boost for many families because it costs in the region of &euro;500.  That will be a big help to families who were facing that cost.  It has been waived for this year so they will not have to worry.  That will give them a bit of extra money that they can put towards the other costs of going back to school.  To be fair, &euro;260 for a child under 11 and &euro;385 for a child 12 or older represents a good help.  The payment was never designed to cover all the costs of going back to school.  I understand that this is a very expensive time for parents.  I know that.  I worked in a credit union and saw it myself.  However, as I said, we have increased the rates and provided an extra &euro;26 million this year towards the cost of going back to school.</p></speech>

These include those receiving rent supplement, the guardian's payment and benefits for the blind.  There are people who need this support who are not eligible.  I have specific concerns for the squeezed middle, for example, families where there are two working parents whose income renders them ineligible for any support from the State in sending their children back to school despite being the ones who are commuting, doing the drop-offs and paying for childcare.  How can we give support to such people?  They are the productive people in the economy who are making PRSI contributions through their employment.  They are seeing a significant uptick in the cost of living and, unfortunately, this is not reflected in their take-home pay.  We all agree that we want to give all our children the best chance in education but that requires us to ensure that their families at home have the financial ability to provide such opportunity without being driven into penury.  I ask that we do more to increase eligibility among those in that squeezed middle bracket.</p></speech>

I am the Minister for Social Protection and my priority is to assist those on low and fixed incomes and to keep people out of poverty.  That is my number one priority.  We have the working family payment.  I understand that there are people who do not qualify for this payment.  I accept that they are working hard but the best way to support them is through a comprehensive tax package.  The Deputy knows that the Government has committed to providing a comprehensive tax package of more than &euro;1 billion in the coming budget, which is less than 11 weeks away now.  That is how we can help those people who do not qualify for these payments.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that, as Minister for Social Protection, my number one priority is to keep people out of poverty and to target those on low incomes and those most in need.</p></speech>

This is why this important and much-needed research was carried out.  The Cost of Disability in Ireland research report will now inform policy from a whole-of-government perspective.  The Indecon report identified that additional costs of disability run across a number of areas of expenditure including housing, equipment, aids and appliances, care and assistance services, mobility, transport, communications, medicines and additional living expenses.  Indecon also found that there is not a single typical cost of disability.  Rather, there is a spectrum from low to high additional costs of disability, depending on individual circumstances.</p>  <p>  As the findings of the research have implications for many areas of public policy, a whole-of-government perspective is needed.  This is why the Government referred the report to the national disability inclusion strategy steering group, which is chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for disability.  This group comprises relevant Departments, agencies, a disability stakeholder group and people with disabilities and will consider and monitor recommended actions required from the various Government Departments on a biannual basis.</p>  <p>  As a starting point, a number of the measures I introduced as part of budget 2022 to support people with disabilities and carers reflect some of the findings of the report.  These measures included supports to employers and increases to income disregards and core weekly payment rates.  Under the Roadmap for Social Inclusion and Pathways to Work strategies, my Department has committed to developing and consulting on a straw-man proposal for the restructuring of long-term disability payments.  The main objective is to simplify the system and remove anomalies.  The straw man will also take account of the conclusions of the cost of disability report as part of its work.</p></speech>

Will the straw-man proposal to look at restructuring long-term disability payments include the domiciliary care allowance?  I believe it should.  Most people would agree that there are ongoing difficulties in this regard.  When you deal with someone applying for domiciliary care allowance, you find that it can take two or three applications before that person qualifies.  There are difficulties and, when we are looking at disability, we need to look at all of the payments that are available.  How does the Minister envisage this working?  Does she foresee a cost-of-disability payment for people who are in receipt of the likes of the disability allowance or the invalidity pension or does she foresee a complete restructuring of existing payments?  Will the Minister give me her view on that?</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is leading on the whole-of-government response through the disability inclusion strategy steering group, which she chairs.  In fairness, there is no better woman than Deputy Rabbitte to do that job because she is very passionate and a very strong advocate for disabled persons.  She is hammering on with that.  In my Department, we are looking at the recommendations around the cost of the disability payment.  The report recommends a tiered approach to disability payments.  This will be a major review.  The Deputy and I both know people who have profound disabilities and who might never be able to work.  I honestly believe they should get a higher level of payment than a person with a more moderate disability who might be able to do a bit of work.  We have to be more targeted in our approach.  I will be publishing that straw-man report.</p></speech>

It is welcome it is being done but a timeline would be helpful, particularly for the implementation plan on the back of that cost of disability report, which the organisations are seeking.  I hope too that in the work that will be done now on restructuring those payments, what they look like and how they work, we also look at people in receipt of disability allowance who are working.  There was a briefing a few weeks ago by disabled artists and academics.  It is a great shame people with such amazing gifts and talents cannot show them off, sell them or perform because they are so worried about winning a bursary or prize that will impact their disability allowance.  That is a great shame and we must look at how work actually interacts with the likes of the disability allowance.  People will get their disability allowance, and if they work, they will pay taxes.  We need to look at all of that as well.</p></speech>

The work is ongoing and very complex.  The Deputy will appreciate it is also a very sensitive area.  I hope we will have that report ready in the autumn.  I will then be able to sit down with the various disability representative groups and the Minister of State and talk them through it because we want to get their views and input.  The one thing I do not want to do is make changes in this area that do not have the support of the sector.  It is crucial we engage with it and bring proposals forward in a way that works for people and is fair.  That is the plan there.</p>  <p>  I know about the disabled artists.  The Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media has brought in the basic income for artists, and some disabled artists will be better off with that.  My problem here is somebody who is an artist getting more money than somebody working in a supermarket who has a disability.  I do not want to treat people differently.  That is the problem.</p></speech>

The Minister of State knows where I am coming from on this as AsIAm has already sent him a submission on it.  We just need to get feedback on that.</p></reply>

The reasonable accommodation fund is comprised of four grants, which are available through the Department's Intreo centres. The grants have been designed to assist jobseekers and existing employees with disabilities, and to encourage employers in the private sector to recruit and support existing employees with disabilities.  The four grants are the workplace equipment adaptation grant, the job interview interpreter grant, the personal reader grant and the employee retention grant.  Another support is the disability awareness support scheme, which provides funding for private sector employers to provide disability awareness training for employees.  It is important to note both schemes are demand-led.  The overall value of the funding provided rises and falls in response to the number of applications received each year.</p>  <p>  Given these grants are demand-led, and as the UK operates a different model of supports, it is not possible to estimate a cost in the manner requested.  However, under the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities, the Department has committed to review the existing supports and a review of the reasonable accommodation fund is currently under way.  The review will look at how to improve the effectiveness of the grants and identify gaps in provision.  It also aims to improve the application and payment processes.  A public consultation took place from 31 March to 13 May.  Officials are now analysing the responses received and a review report will be published in the third quarter of this year.  Officials are also conducting a literature review, which will look at similar schemes in other countries, including the UK's access to work scheme.  Reviews are also planned for the wage subsidy scheme for later this year and for the disability awareness support scheme next year.  We look forward to receiving the reviews and further developing the supports for people with disabilities.</p></speech>

Bringing the four schemes together is helpful in that it can make the scheme easier to access for both disabled jobseekers and employers.  That is where AsIAm is coming from.  What is currently provided for by the Department is not sufficient to help some cohorts access the workplace, such as members of the deaf community.  There is no structure in place for people who want to access other supports that are not provided for by the reasonable accommodation fund, such as in-person supports.  I will be interested to see the review and what the Department comes back with.  This has to be accessible for employers and those who want to go into the workplace.</p></speech>

This is not just something that is nice to have.  The Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2015 oblige employers to take reasonable steps to accommodate the needs of both employees and job applicants with disabilities.  To be honest, the uptake for the fund over the years needs to be improved.  We are looking at a range of measures to encourage and support people with disabilities into the employment market.  For example, both the disability allowance and the blind pension are structured to support recipients to avail of opportunities to pursue their own employment ambitions, be that self-employment or insurable employment.  When individuals commence employment, they can avail of an income disregard of &euro;140 per week.  In addition, 50% of earnings between &euro;140 and &euro;375 per week are also disregarded for the purpose of the means test.  We are looking at a range of ways to improve the situation for people with disabilities.</p></speech>

That is why it is important employers are aware of these schemes and we should have a one-stop shop for access to them.  Is the Minister of State thinking of setting up a reasonable support passport or something like that, which could help the employer and the prospective worker engage with what is available?</p></speech>

As we stand at the moment, Intreo engages with prospective employees and employers, and the employability services throughout the country do so as well.  There is a job of communication there and that will be looked at as part of the review.  As I mentioned, the wage subsidy scheme will also be reviewed.  I am saying this for the purpose of raising awareness.  This scheme provides financial incentives for the private sector to employ people with disabilities as well.  Regarding the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities, the design of the new action plan underpinning delivery is being led by my colleagues in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  The Department has actively fed into the design of that new action plan and there are a range of actions and associated timelines in that.  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, already mentioned the straw-man proposal, which is another project we have in train to improve the situation.</p></speech>

These include housing, equipment, aids and appliances, care and assistance services, mobility, transport, communications, medicines, and additional living expenses.  The cost of disability can be defined as the amount it costs a person with a disability to achieve the same standard of living as a person without a disability.

We know from the Department's report that additional costs faced by individuals with disabilities range from &euro;8,700 to &euro;12,300 annually, on average.  We also know that nearly 40% of those not working due to disability are at risk of poverty.  That figure is three times higher than the general population.  While all families are facing a cost-of-living crisis, it is being experienced more acutely by disabled people, given that they face additional costs.  With the PUP, the Government established that &euro;350 is the rate of payment that individuals should receive, yet disability allowance remains only a fraction of that at &euro;208.  Our motion last week, which the Government agreed to, called for at least a &euro;15 increase in the disability allowance.  The Minister mentioned an increase in the core rates.  What increase is she looking at for the next budget?  Will she answer my first question on the cost of disability rate, which is separate to the core rates of the social welfare allowance?</p></speech>

It states that the worst outcome for people with disabilities would be giving a little to everyone.  That is not what we should do.  We need to target this.  We are looking at doing this better, with a tiered approach to disability payments.  For example, a person with a profound disability who might never be able to work would get a higher level of payment than a person with a more moderate disability who is able to work.  That is a fairer, more sensible approach, which means that resources are targeted at those with the greatest need.  This is not without challenges either, because naturally everyone will want a higher payment.  My Department is currently working on a straw man proposal relating to what this payment structure might look like.  This complex work is ongoing.  I want to get it right.</p></speech>

Like I said, I agree with it.  She said it recommends a targeted support rather than a bit for everybody.  The motion we tabled called for a &euro;20 cost of disability payment targeted at those people who need it the most.  The Department's report and the Social Democrats' motion called for an action plan to implement that cost of disability report.  It outlined the scale of the barriers faced by people with disabilities.  Those obstacles are only increasing with the cost-of-living crisis.  It is only an account of the situation.  It demands an action plan for a strategic and well-resourced response to these systematic issues.  The action plan to implement the disability capacity review is taking too long, but at least there is a plan.  My last question, although answers to the other two would be good too, is about whether there will be an action plan in response to the cost of disability report.  The report was only published after sustained pressure.  Will it require the same pressure for the Minister to develop the action plan to go with it?</p></speech>

My Department is looking at the recommendations relating to the cost of disability payment.  As I said earlier, we will develop a strawman proposal on that.  I do not want to do so without consulting stakeholders.  I was not found wanting in this year's budget when it came to supporting people with disabilities.  I will not tell the Deputy what is in the next budget, but she can be assured that I will look at issues across the board, particularly with regard to people with disabilities.  That is part of the budget negotiations.  I was not found wanting in this year's budget, where I changed a number of things.  I changed Catherine's Law so that people who had secured a scholarship could go on to do their master's degree.  I am conscious of the challenges facing people with disabilities, but I am also conscious that there are profound, moderate and mild disabilities.  I want to provide the most supports to those who need them most, since others do not need as much.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.173" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1450" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="11:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400015#N00900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 83 and 110 together.</p>  <p>  I thank the Deputy for raising this.  The Parent's Leave and Benefit Act 2019 introduced two weeks of paid parent's leave for each parent to be taken in the first year after the birth or adoptive placement of a child.  Following the commencement of the Family Leave and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2021, an additional three weeks of paid parent's leave is available to each parent, and the period in which the leave can be taken has been extended to the first two years after the birth or adoptive placement of a child.  Budget 2022 provided for parent's leave and benefit to be extended from five weeks for each parent to seven weeks.  I am pleased that this extension came into effect on 1 July.  The additional two weeks of leave and benefit will apply to parents of children who are under the age of two in July 2022 or in the case of adoption, children who have been with their parents for less than two years at that point.  Parent's benefit is currently paid at &euro;250 per week.  Parent's benefit can be paid in separate weekly blocks or can be paid over a consecutive period.  Since the introduction of the scheme, up to the end of June this year, my Department has awarded more than 100,000 parent's benefit claims at a cost in excess of &euro;65 million.</p>  <p>  I am delighted that the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and I have been able to progress this and increase it to seven weeks since it first started.  The support applies to both parents.  The Government's ambition is to ensure parents can enjoy meaningful, quality time with their newborn children in the knowledge that they will be financially supported.  The Deputy knows that it is important that parents have the opportunity to spend time with their children in those early, formative years of their lives.  I have a little grandson and I spend time with him at any chance I get.  It is important that we give them that time because we can buy them all the things in the world, but at the end of the day, there is nothing like time with a child.</p> <p>That is what makes the difference.</p> <p> Parent's leave and benefit is available to anyone with a child under the age of two or who has adopted a child within the previous two years.  The take up of parent's leave and benefit has increased threefold since 2020.  In 2021 a total of 51,400 parents were supported compared to just 16,700 parents in 2020.  Since the start of 2022 the total number of applications awarded reached over 28,000.</p> <p> Already this year 28,000 applications are in and I am absolutely delighted to see that more and more people are applying for it.  I note that the number of fathers applying is increasing but I would particularly encourage fathers to take up this benefit and spend time with their children. That is very important.</p> <p> The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy Roderic O'Gorman and I continue to work on this.  The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has responsibility for the policy side and I administer the payments from my Department.</p> <p> Since the formation of the Government we have increased the parent's leave and benefit from two weeks to seven weeks.  This allows tens of thousands of new parents to take time away from work knowing that they are financially supported.</p></speech>

I am aware that the extension has only come into place since 1 July.  I presume there is budgetary planning in respect of this.  Does the Department have any idea of the numbers it expects to benefit from this scheme between now and 31 December?</p>  <p>  With regard to ongoing planning, what is proposed to adequately plan for 2023 and 2024 to make sure there is adequate funding for the benefit if there is a further increase in numbers again?</p></speech>

I can assure the Deputy that the people who qualify and submit their applications will get the funding.  There is no doubt about that. With regard to the numbers who have claimed this year, it is some 22,000 people already.  We would expect that to double.  Last year in 2021 it was 51,395 applications.  Up to the end of May this year 27,488 claims were awarded.  Given it was 51,020 in 2021 and 27,488 to the end of May this year, I would be very surprised if we do not exceed the figures from 2021.  The funding is there for it.  I would encourage as many people as possible to take it up.  In Deputy Burke's county of Cork, 6,629 people have claimed the parent's benefit from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022.  I have a list of the counties.  Dublin, of course, is the highest with 13,400 people who have claimed the benefit.</p></speech>

It is an extremely important area.  I very much welcome the extension in the parent's benefits because it is important for parents that they can get this time after a child is born, and particularly in the first two years.  It is about forward planning for that whole area and funding from the Department.  I was wondering if the Department is having consultations with the various interest groups in that area, and especially with parent representative groups?</p></speech>

They will automatically satisfy the PRSI contribution requirements to receive parent's benefit.  A person must be paying PRSI to qualify.  The payment is &euro;250 per week.</p>  <p>  The question was asked whether single parents can get this benefit.  Under the EU directive single parents cannot get this benefit on the double.  The single parent can get it for himself or herself but they cannot get it a second time.  The benefit goes to both parents, the father and the mother.</p>  <p>  In 2022, 35% of the claims were from males and 65% were females.  That trend is actually improving.  In 2021 only 28% of applicants claiming the benefit were male and now it is 35%.  In 2021 it was 72% female and that figure has gone slightly down, which is now at 65%.  Hopefully, there will be more claims coming in.  Parents have two years to claim the benefits from the time of the birth of the child.  It was only one year but I have extended this to two years to make it easier.</p>  <p>  The Deputy asked about carers.  These are all things that will be considered in the budget.  The budget is not too long away now.  The budget will focus on the cost of living as well as tax measures.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.182" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1563" speakername="Joe O'Brien" time="11:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400016#O00900"><p>The fuel allowance is a payment of &euro;33 per week for 28 weeks at an estimated cost of &euro;366 million in 2022.  It is a targeted payment to people dependent on specified long-term social welfare payments.  The purpose of this payment is to assist those households most in need with their energy costs.</p>  <p>  The criteria for fuel allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to my Department in as targeted a manner as possible.  To qualify for the fuel allowance payment, a person must satisfy all the qualifying criteria including a means test and the household composition criteria.  This ensures that the fuel allowance payment is targeted at those who are more vulnerable to fuel poverty including those reliant on social protection payments for longer periods who are unlikely to have additional resources of their own.</p>  <p>  As part of budget 2022, an increase in the weekly fuel payment of &euro;5 and a number of expansions to the eligibility criteria for the fuel allowance payment were announced, including expanding the means threshold for the fuel allowance by &euro;20 to &euro;120 above the appropriate rate of State pension contributory, which enables more people to qualify for this support.</p>  <p>  With effect from September 2022, the qualifying period for jobseeker's and supplementary welfare allowance recipients to be in a position to access the fuel allowance payment will be reduced from 15 to 12 months.  The Government has, therefore, implemented significant expansions in relation to the fuel allowance through budget 2022.</p>  <p>  We are acutely aware of recent price increases and their impact on households that are dependent on social welfare.  All options will be kept under review, together with trends in prices, to inform preparations for the budget later this year.  We must, however, take account of the overall budgetary context and the availability of financial resources.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection provides additional needs payments as part of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme for people who have an urgent need, which they cannot meet from their own resources.  These payments are available through our community welfare offices.</p></speech>

We can all agree that the fuel allowance at the moment is targeted in a certain way to a certain number of social welfare recipients.  I believe this needs to broaden out to much more than the cohort of people who currently receive it.  If a person is on illness benefit he or she does not get it.  A person on disability benefit does not get the fuel allowance.  There is a whole cohort of people who do not qualify.  For example, a person may be on a small private pension along with a State pension.  If this person is over the threshold by just &euro;5 then he or she does not get the fuel allowance whatsoever.  When one takes into account the spiralling cost of fuel the &euro;33 fuel allowance is welcome but it must relate to the income a person has and the payment itself.  A whole cohort who could benefit by a targeted measure are not benefitting.  Perhaps the Minister of State will address this.</p>  <p>  I also wish to allude to another important point after the response.</p></speech>

There are an increasing number of people in this situation.  The Minister outlined how the applications for additional needs payments have increased compared with the five-month period last year.  That is the short-term answer.  For the longer-term and for the budget, we will have to take all the cases into account, and all the options will be assessed for the fuel allowance in budget 2023.  For those in need now and who are outside eligibility, the immediate answer is the community welfare officer and the additional needs payment.</p></speech>

There have been 35 price hikes by energy companies in the past 12 months.  The cumulative effect has been a 60% to 70% increase in electricity and gas prices.  That is a fact.  Another fact which the Minister will have to address is that since February this year, 20,000 people were refused fuel allowance.  That is an enormous number.  There is a lot of confusion in social welfare offices regarding those who are long-term unemployed for more than 12 months, for instance.  They have changed the criteria, which is welcome, but there is a lot of confusion.  That has to be addressed.  It is only the tip of the iceberg.  There are those who could benefit but who are not because of the confusion relating to the criteria.</p></speech>

The Department of Social Protection is part of that, as are other Departments.  The national retrofitting plan and one-stop shops are also up and running.  We have put &euro;2.4 billion of measures in place and those are worth reiterating.  They include the &euro;200 energy credit and an extra &euro;125 for fuel allowance recipients.  There is a further &euro;100 special payment for fuel allowance recipients, cuts to VAT on gas and electricity between May and October, a 20% cut on public transport fares from the end of April, reduced caps for multiple children on the school transport fees and the more recent announcement on free school transport in the year ahead.  Another good anti-poverty measure relates to the back to school clothing and footwear allowance and school meals.  The Deputy made an interesting point about the refusals for fuel allowance.  We would be wise to look at the reasons for refusal to see if they can be part of the considerations for budget 2023.</p></speech>

The report explores the issue of energy poverty and deprivation in Ireland.   The Government recognises the pressures families are under in respect of energy prices and have taken a range of steps, including targeted and universal measures.</p>  <p>  As part of budget 2022, a number of expansions to the eligibility criteria for the fuel allowance payment were announced at that time.  The weekly means threshold for the fuel allowance scheme was increased to &euro;120 above the appropriate rate of contributory State pension.  With effect from the start of the next fuel season, the qualifying period for jobseeker's and supplementary welfare allowance recipients to access the fuel allowance payment will be reduced from 15 to 12 months.  The rate of the fuel allowance was also increased by &euro;5 a week with immediate effect.</p>  <p>  As part of the Government measures to help mitigate the effects of rising energy costs, additional lump sum payments of &euro;125 and &euro;100, equivalent to almost seven weeks additional fuel allowance, were paid to all households in receipt of the fuel allowance payment in March and May.  This means that low-income households saw an overall increase of 55% in fuel allowance support provided during the fuel allowance season.  When taken in conjunction with the electricity costs emergency benefit payment, paid in April, these households received over &euro;600 in additional targeted Government supports over the course of the 2021 to 2022 fuel season.</p>  <p>  The Government has reacted quickly not only with social protection measures but also having implemented a wide range of initiatives covering tax, energy credits, excise and transport measures.  The Department also supports people through additional needs payments and through a special heating supplement under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  All of these measures will be kept under review, together with trends in prices, to inform preparations for the budget later this year.</p></speech>

We all hear this in our constituency offices and I have no doubt that the Minister of State does too.  People are under incredible pressure.  We are dealing with a 38-year high in inflation at 9.1% in June.  It has also been the fastest increase.  It is incredibly difficult to deal with.  People have problems with their bills and in my part of the world, a large number of people rely on solid fuels and home heating oil.  We need these measures to be put in place as soon as possible.  We will have to get some sort of indication of what will be proposed in the budget.</p></speech>

The community welfare officers have been given direction on what is viable to cover in respect of people's costs, and energy costs are certainly part of that.  The medium-term intervention is the budget.  It was been clearly flagged at an early stage that it will be a cost-of-living budget.  All Departments have been asked to examine how they can assist in that; it is not only our Department, although we will have a key role.  On the longer-term, we do not want to be here in three, four or five years still talking about the same people who need more increases to fuel allowance.  The long-term plan, which has started, is the national retrofitting plan.  It is gearing up and we have committed to investing a significant amount in that in the coming years.</p></speech>

It remains to be seen whether it will be but the pressure is on the Government.  There is no doubt that people are under significant pressure.  I agree with what the Minister of State has said about retrofitting. I would be delighted if people had alternatives that were not only environmentally better but also cheaper.  We need to make sure that the schemes we have are changed slightly so that they become more targeted.  I understand that does not fall under the Minister of State's remit necessarily.</p>  <p>  The additional needs payment needs to be examined.  There are still cases where it is incredibly difficult.  Sometimes there are anomalous scenarios where people are under pressure but they cannot necessarily get the payment.  I call for the household benefits package to be re-examined. Sometimes people do not have a gas point reference number, GPRN, when they are using a communal heating system.  I am thinking of places such as Carlinn Hall where there is still major issues with the cost of the bills.  It might be necessary to change the facility under the household benefits package.</p></speech>

It is just starting.  Every year we look at how impactful it is.  I refer, in particular, to the special enhanced grant equivalent to 80% of typical costs for attic and cavity wall insulation for all households.  That can quickly reduce energy use as part of the Government's response to current exceptionally high energy prices.</p>  <p>  On the additional needs payment, the Minister outlined earlier efforts to make it more accessible and we are looking at a way to apply for that online to do so.  That is key.  I take the Deputy's point about the importance of the budget coming up and the pressure that people are under.</p></speech>

For this reason, the Government did not await a further budget cycle to address these challenges but acted early.  Overall, the tax and spending measures we have introduced to ease the burden and provide support to those most in need have amounted to &euro;2.4 billion.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, my Department can make additional needs payments to help meet expenses that a person cannot pay from his or her weekly income.  Also, under this scheme, a supplement can be awarded to assist with ongoing or recurring costs that cannot be met from the person's own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  The Government has provided &euro;45.75 million for these payments in 2022.  A further provision of &euro;5.3 million has been provided for supplementary welfare allowance payments in 2022, excluding rent supplement.  This is the cost-of-living hardship fund.  This is a demand-led scheme with no budget cap.</p>  <p>  Payments are made at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme, taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  The main items eligible for assistance include help with fuel, utility bills, repairs to or replacement of household appliances, clothing, child-related items such as cots and prams, assistance with funerals or burial costs and travel.  Support is also available to assist persons under this scheme towards rent deposits.</p>  <p>  In addition, the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance scheme operates from June to September each year and provides a once-off payment to eligible families to assist with the costs of clothing and footwear when children start or return to school each autumn.  Recently, I announced that an additional &euro;100 will be paid in respect of each eligible child for 2022.  This measure will have an immediate impact on families who are most in need of assistance at this time.</p></speech>

When I was first active in politics as a councillor, we worked very closely with the community welfare officers in the area.  There was one in the health centre in Crumlin and one in Curlew Road health centre in Drimnagh, as well as others in Parnell Road and Walkinstown.  People approaching me would be able to work very well with community welfare officers and let the person know where to go, etc.  They were taken out of the community during the austerity years of 2011 and 2012, which was a mistake.  They were introduced in the 1980s or 1990s by a Labour Party Minister - I cannot remember his name - because of the need to be close to people in the community.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Kerrane said, some people are in a rural community and do not have enough money.  In some cases, the partner may be spending the money on drink or gambling.  Someone like that with two young kids will not be able to get to an Intreo office.  Will the Minister consider introducing a pilot scheme to bring the fund into the community to see how it would impact, particularly in rural areas?</p></speech>

That is why we have had a very comprehensive media advertising campaign to make people aware that this payment is available.  I have run radio and social media advertisements.  I am sure the Deputy has heard them.  We want to raise awareness and get the message out through our constituency offices.  I would appreciate the help of Deputies in this House in helping to get the message out also.  People affected by the current cost-of-living crisis may be accessing these payments for the first time.  They might never have dealt with the Department of Social protection previously.  I want to try to make things as easy as possible for them.  That is why we have established a national helpline.  The number is 0818 607080.  Most people have access to a phone in this day and age.  People should ring that number first.  They will be dealt with confidentially.  They will be directed to a point of contact in their local office who will look after them.  People can download the application form from the website at <i>gov.ie</i>.  They can complete it and post it in.  It will be processed quickly.</p></speech>

I am sure it will have an impact when we get to see the figures for the past month or so.  Obviously, the number of people looking for additional needs payments increased because of the cost-of-living increase and not because of the media campaign because the increase happened before the campaign.  We should have a specific pilot scheme in a rural area and put a community welfare officer into the community to see how that impacts for people in the area.  It is impossible for someone with no money who is in despair and in crisis to walk from a rural area to the city.  Having community welfare officers in the community would allow them to know who is who and what the needs are.  They would get to know the community in the area.  That has been really badly missed in the community since the community welfare officer was pulled out into the Intreo offices.  That has been my experience as a councillor and a Deputy.</p></speech>

They talk to the people over the phone.  They can meet them in the local branch office.  They can even arrange to meet people in their own homes by appointment if that is what people need.  We are also considering setting up a system where people can apply directly for additional needs payment online.  As the Deputy knows, some people want face-to-face contact.  They might need some help completing a form.  Others would rather submit the form directly online.  We are trying to give people as many options as possible.  We are creating awareness and letting people know that the Department of Social Protection is here to help.  Our primary function is to help people when they need it and allow them to get over the difficulties they are facing.  To be fair, I do not think there are any more media I can use to allow people access to the community welfare officer.  Obviously, I will continue to monitor the situation.</p></speech>

It is designed to prevent in-work poverty for low-paid workers with child dependants and to offer a financial incentive to take up employment.  Eligibility for the payment is not linked to receipt of a social welfare payment but rather a person must be in employment for at least 38 hours per fortnight.</p>  <p>  To qualify for the working family payment, the average total weekly family income must be below the relevant income threshold for the family's size.  The payment is calculated at 60% of the difference between the total family income and the income threshold that applies to the family.</p>  <p>  The income threshold increases with the number of children.  For example, the weekly income threshold for families with one child is &euro;551 and for families with two children it is &euro;652.  Budget 2022 provided for a &euro;10 weekly increase in the working family payment income limits for families of all sizes.  As part of a package of measures to assist families with the cost of living, implementation of this increase was brought forward to April of this year.</p>  <p>  The average weekly payment made to families is currently estimated at &euro;140 per week.  Approximately 47,000 families with 103,000 children are in receipt of the working family payment.  Based on current and projected claim volumes, the Department estimates expenditure of &euro;348 million on the scheme this year.</p> <p>Any further expansion of the scheme must be considered in a budgetary context.</p></speech>

That this is the case in this day and age is one of our greatest sources of shame.  I accept we have the roadmap to social inclusion, which is important, and I know work is under way in regard to that, but this is something we really need to get to grips with.  One of the targeted measures put forward yesterday by the Children's Rights Alliance was to extend the fuel allowance to recipients of the working family payment.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has sought that for some time and it should be considered in the budget.  That is the reason I raise the matter this morning.</p>  <p>  We know there are approximately 370,000 people in low-paid work.  Pre-Covid, it was approximately one in five people.  That is very much at odds with the fact that there are just 47,000 people in receipt of the working family payment.  Perhaps the promotion of the scheme could be considered again.  I know that has been done but the figures do not seem to add up.</p></speech>

The working family payment and other targeted measures such as the increase for a qualified child are specifically designed to assist with that.  We have introduced other measures as well.  We recently announced changes to three initiatives to assist families with children.  The back-to-school costs package is worth a total of &euro;67 million.  As a result, the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance is being increased by &euro;100 for each eligible child under the scheme.  In addition, the school meals programme is being extended to a further 310 schools that were designated as DEIS schools - delivering equality of opportunity in schools - in March.  Students availing of the school transport scheme will not be charged fees for the next academic year.</p>  <p>  We will look at the working family payment.  In another piece of research published by the Department and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, earlier this year the working family payment was identified as being particularly effective in alleviating poverty levels, so we will look at that payment.</p></speech>

I also welcome the increase in the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.  That is an important initiative and it is important that it was increased, especially this year.</p>  <p>  Something does not add up if we have approximately 370,000 people working in low-paid jobs and we have 47,000 people receiving the working family payment.  Many more people should be accessing the working family payment, which is an important support, in particular when it comes to the current level of child poverty.  I think it was the Society of St. Vincent de Paul that put forward a proposal to establish a cross-party committee of the D&aacute;il to consider child poverty, which is clearly growing and should be causing alarm bells to go off for everyone in this House.  That we have 62,000 children living in consistent poverty in 2022 in one of the richest countries on the globe is a major issue.  It is something we have not got to grips with, and we need to do so very quickly.  The Government should consider establishing such a committee.</p></speech>

We had a formal meeting about issues relating to child poverty and setting a new target to reduce it.  We will have the successor to Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures as well.  We are also in the process of bringing on board an EU child guarantee.  Those are frameworks that will push matters on politically as well.</p>  <p>  In terms of people who are working and are also under that line, the Government wants to ensure the welfare system supports people in taking up employment and increasing their level of employment.  The Pathways to Work strategy includes a commitment to prepare a paper on options to modify the longer term jobseeker's assistance payment by utilising the Revenue real-time earnings data to adjust payment levels in line with a person's weekly earnings to guarantee a basic income floor and ensure that in all cases a person's earnings increase when he or she works.  When people are on a welfare payment, especially if they have children, there is always a decision to be made on whether it is worthwhile to take up employment.  We want to ensure that is always the case and the options paper will help us to get to that point.</p></speech>

We know it is not the panacea that has been suggested.  However, the problem is that it does little to help those struggling.  Furthermore, it has resulted in an increase in the workload for already overworked community welfare officers, CWOs.

The delivery of crucial community welfare services to meet the challenges and the needs of citizens across the country remains a priority for me and my Department.  It is important that the community welfare service, CWS, remains accessible, flexible and responsive to meet the varied needs of vulnerable people, particularly in a time of crisis or emergency.</p>  <p>  The Department has maintained staffing levels in the CWS nationwide in recent years during times when demands decreased, reflective of the commitment to continue to support the delivery of locally based services to customers.  The Department has introduced innovations this year, which have increased efficiency in processing applications for supplementary welfare allowance payments.  These innovations and the maintenance of staffing levels have led to the CWS being in a stronger position to respond to increases in the demand for the service as they occur.  This was borne out when a surge of claims was received arising from significant numbers of displaced people arriving from Ukraine.  It is, therefore, anticipated that there is sufficient capacity within the CWS to manage the increased level of claims arising from the promotion of the additional needs payment during the recent advertising campaign.</p>  <p>  Among the innovations that the Department has introduced to help citizens and to support community welfare officers, where possible, is that the preparatory work on applications, for example, the gathering of supporting documentation that is necessary to assess and finalise a claim, is carried out largely by a back-office team.  However, the assessment and decision on claims and any further customer interactions are then carried out by locally based CWOs, as has always been the case.</p>  <p>  The delivery of a locally based community welfare service remains a cornerstone of the system.  This method of processing applications has been found to be very effective in improving service to customers and balancing the work of individual CWOs, especially at times of particular pressure.  Having said that, it is important to note that claims activity within the CWS is closely monitored at all times and resources are deployed as necessary.  There is now a national organisational structure in place to oversee the operation of the service across the entire country.  As the Deputy is aware, when people need money, they need it now and not down the road.</p></speech>

It is not helped by Ministers telling everybody who cannot afford to put petrol in their car to run to the community welfare officer and everything will be fine.  All the problems and solutions seem to be pointing in the same direction.  It is left to those on the front line to break the news to people that many of these statements are inaccurate, misleading or grossly exaggerated.</p>  <p>  Those on the front line also claim that the recent introduction of the additional needs payment was not communicated to them - the people who administer it - until the day after it was announced to the public.  This raises the question of how much thought, preparation and planning have been put into it.  We know this payment is desperately needed by so many right across the country.  The payment is administered to them by the Government and it is important that we ensure people get it in time.</p>  <p>  My colleague, Deputy Kerrane, has been championing the issue of making sure that people can access the payment online.  I understand that the Minister responded to the call earlier.  That is one solution.  It should have been done long before now.  Deputy Kerrane has been calling for this for some time.  Does the Minister have any other solutions or will she take up that proposal, along with other solutions, to alleviate the burden on those who are on the front line?  The Minister should pay the staff respect when communicating the introduction of a new payment.</p></speech>

In my experience, I have always found them to be exceptionally helpful.  They have always gone beyond the call of duty in trying to help people who need support at particular times in their lives.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Doherty is aware, we started a very active media campaign to make people aware that this service is available.  We have been running advertisements on radio and social media.  We have constantly tried to raise awareness and get the message out.</p> <p>I am sure the Deputy will have seen those advertisements himself through our constituency offices.  I would appreciate the help of all Deputies to enable us to get out that message.</p> <p> The community welfare service is closely monitored at all times and resources are deployed as necessary.  As I said, other staff have been able to do some of the back-office work but the community welfare officers are there to meet people.  They cannot be contacted by email or phone and I am working on an online application process.  It takes some time to provide these services because they have to be designed.

Were they given training on what this would pertain to?  Is it the Minister's position that no additional staffing support is required for those working on the front line as community welfare officers and is she satisfied the timeframe from application to grant payment is sufficiently short in all areas of the State to avoid undue delays at a time when the rate of inflation is close to 10% and when every day is crucial to these families?

A briefing note with information on the additional needs payment has issued to all staff in the Department, setting out the role of community welfare officers in assisting customers with cost-of-living expenses.  It directs community welfare officers to use their discretionary powers in considering applications for additional needs payments and places significant emphasis on assisting customers with cost-of-living expenses.</p>  <p>  Where there are household income guidelines, it has been emphasised to the community welfare service, CWS, team in my Department that these are guidelines only and that customers' needs for assistance arising from difficulties in meeting increased costs for food, fuel, electricity and heating are the primary consideration.  The briefing note was augmented by a training webinar for all community welfare officers, CWOs, nationwide with the national CWS management team and a training bulletin has issued to all CWS staff in regard to the increased costs of living and the additional needs payment.  I have asked my deputy Secretary General to meet the community welfare officers and to report to me on that meeting.  While she is in constant contact with them, she will also meet them.</p></speech>

Means tests are kept under regular review and a number of significant changes have been made in recent years.  In particular, I have introduced a number of changes to means testing that provide for higher income disregards.  These disregards ensure that, where people are in receipt of a social assistance payment and are working, a certain level of income from that work is not assessed in the means test.  On foot of the commitment in the programme for Government and the rural development policy 2021-25, my Department recently reviewed the means assessment disregards for the farm assist.  The report is available on the Government's website.  One of the key recommendations of the report was to provide for an extensive expansion to the list of agri-environmental schemes that qualify for a disregard, a policy I introduced with effect from June 2022.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have agreed to carry out a review of how income from land leased by farmers is treated in the means assessments for the State non-contributory pension and the farm assist scheme.  I have also introduced several measures that aim to encourage and support people with disabilities to pursue their employment goals, including a higher earnings disregard for the disability allowance and the blind pension.  Moreover, I have significantly increased the income disregard for the carer's allowance.  This enables more carers with modest incomes to become eligible for the scheme and allows carers and their families to earn more from employment while retaining their carer's payment.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor and review policies for all social welfare payments, including means assessments.  The Deputy and I have discussed this matter and I have been listening to him.  While I have made changes, I acknowledge he has more ideas for further changes.  As always, I would be happy to discuss them with him.</p></speech>

If the parents die and leave their estate to their children, the family home might be sold.  If they leave, say, &euro;200,000 to each of the children, in the case of the person in receipt of the disability allowance, what will happen once he or she receives that is he or she will lose the entire disability allowance.  I do not think that is equitable, fair or just.  The siblings who do not have a disability, on the other hand, will get their money totally free of tax and there will be no penalty.</p>  <p>  There is also the example of a couple with a dependent adult in a one-income family.  In one case, they might put the money into joint bank accounts, and in another, they might put it only into the income-earner's bank account.  In the first case, they will be means-tested on the increase for the qualified adult.  There are any number of examples that are totally anomalous and the system needs to be reformed.</p></speech>

He raised an example of somebody on the disability allowance whose elderly parents have been living frugally in order that they can leave an asset behind, when they pass on, to their disabled child.  They may then find that the asset, or their savings as the case may be, has an impact.  I take the Deputy's point and, as I said, I have made some improvements.  In the context of the budget, I will consider the list of proposals he gave me because there are anomalies and we would like to try to help people, which is what the Department of Social Protection is here to do.  It seeks to support people and target those who are vulnerable or on low incomes.  Many changes have been made but I am happy to consider more if there are suggestions.</p></speech>

Another situation I find totally anomalous is that if somebody is receiving a non-contributory pension, he or she can earn &euro;200 a week and receive the full pension, but if he or she gets that from self-employment, it will be deducted from the pension.  There is no logic for having such a difference between self-employment in farming or fishing and PAYE employment.</p></speech>

Workers and families are facing alarming increases in the cost of fuel, energy, food and transport.  Persistent failures in housing and childcare see households, renters and families paying more and more for keeping a roof over their heads and raising their children.  We on this side of the House all recognise that the causes of the cost-of-living crisis are driven by global factors, including the illegal Russian invasion of Ukraine, but also by domestic factors.  The causes do not remove the responsibilities of Government.</p>  <p>  The impact of this cost-of-living crisis hits lower and middle-income households hardest.  That is clear to anybody who has heard from families who have had to turn off their heating or put less food on the table because they simply have no other choice.  On in three households today are living in energy poverty.  This week, we heard from the Children's Rights Alliance that 62,000 of children are living in consistent poverty.  Most people are feeling the squeeze but lower and middle-income households are bearing the brunt.  They need a Government that understands their struggle and responds to their needs.  Today, this D&aacute;il will rise for its recess and will not return until September, but workers and families will continue to struggle with this cost-of-living crisis week in, week out over those summer months.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste refused point blank to act on the calls from Sinn F&eacute;in to bring forward an emergency budget with measures that would protect and provide certainty and support for these households.  Instead, he told them that they should wait until the end of September.  This is despite organisations such as the Central Bank of Ireland, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and our own budget watchdog all saying that the Government has the capacity to provide further support to struggling households and to provide it now.  This support is necessary and would relieve the pressure households face and help them navigate through the difficult times in the days, weeks and months ahead.</p>  <p>  For months now, Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed sensible and affordable measures that would provide real relief to these families by increasing social welfare rates in response to rising prices, introducing cost-of-living cash payments to those on low and middle incomes, reducing childcare fees, supporting renters by putting one month's rent back into their pockets and banning rent increases, providing greater support for more families with back-to-school costs, and reducing fuel costs for those struggling to heat their homes and fill their tanks.  These are all measures that could have been introduced before the D&aacute;il broke this summer, but they were not.  They should have been acted upon.  The Government should have listened not just to Sinn F&eacute;in but to the pleas and demands from ordinary people who are struggling just to get by.</p>  <p>  We acknowledge that not everybody can be protected from every price increase.  The Government can do and should have done more to protect and support workers and families but it decided otherwise.  As this D&aacute;il breaks for the summer, what is the T&aacute;naiste's message to the tens of thousands of families who are struggling to survive and cling on and who so desperately need the Government to do more for them right here, right now before the summer break?  Once this D&aacute;il returns, will the T&aacute;naiste commit to implementing the solutions we in Sinn F&eacute;in have put forward, some of which I listed today?</p></speech>

The numbers from the CSO this morning indicate that inflation has now risen to 9.6%, which is the highest rate of inflation we have experienced in 40 years.  I think it confirms what people are experiencing in their daily lives.  We see it at the fuel pumps, in the supermarkets and in our utility bills.  The price of everything is going up and the price of nothing is going down.  We face an unprecedented situation, however.  We have war on our Continent for the first time in 40 years.  We had a pandemic for the first time in 100 years with much of the snapback and demands contributing to inflation.  We had the zero Covid policies in China.  We are also at the end of an unprecedented period of monetary policy characterised by low inflation, low interest rates and central banks all over the world printing a lot of money.  It is, therefore, an unprecedented set of scenarios. Things we have not seen in 40 to 100 years are leading to a global inflation crisis, which is resulting in prices rising at a faster rate than at any point in 40 years.</p>  <p>  It is important to say that budgetary measures and actions the Government has taken and will take can help to ease the cost of living and burden of inflation for people.  No budget, however, whether it is an early, late, emergency or ordinary budget, will get us on top of the inflation crisis.  We need to tame inflation and that requires a comprehensive approach that includes international action, action at a European level and also domestic action.  What we must do over the next six months to one year is get inflation down and tame it, not fan the fires of inflation.  That will not help anyone in the long run.  We must avoid that.</p>  <p>  I note that the Deputy made no acknowledgement whatsoever in his contribution of what has been done to date, which I think was unfair and inaccurate.  From listening to the Deputy's contribution, one would think that nothing has been done at all in the past seven months while this D&aacute;il was in session.  Let me recap on that.  In January, we had an increase in the minimum wage, an increase in pensions, an increase in welfare payments, and a reduction in income taxes for low, middle and high-income people, all of which the Deputy's party opposed.  Since then, we have had reductions in VAT on electricity and gas, reductions in excise on petrol and diesel, &euro;200 taken off people's electricity bills, and an increase in the fuel allowance.  Only this week, people saw an increase in the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance for those least well-off families who need it most.  Contrast that with Northern Ireland, where the increase was &pound;7 or &pound;8 or something in the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance-----</p></speech>

People will see in the next few weeks, for example, an increase in the SUSI grant for those attending third level.  The budget in September will introduce a series of measures that people will see in their pockets within weeks, and then another set of more regular measures that will take effect in January 2023.  Therefore, far from not responding to inflation and the rising cost of living, what people are seeing from Government is a dynamic response with action in January, action since January, action over the summer, more action in September and then more again next January.  That is what is required because this is a dynamic and unfolding situation.</p></speech>

Let me say this, however.  When the T&aacute;naiste steps outside the bubble of Leinster House, stops the backslapping and hooraying and all the rest in terms of his own colleagues, and talks to the ordinary people out there, they will tell him that tens of thousands of them are struggling to get by.  We have seen survey after survey and report after report telling us how difficult it is for people.  After everything the T&aacute;naiste just talked about, one in three families in this State are still in energy poverty and struggling to make ends meet.  Organisations far beyond Sinn F&eacute;in such as the Central Bank of Ireland, the budget advisory watchdog and the ESRI are all saying the Government has the capacity to do more and do it now.  However, the Government refuses.  The clear message from Government as it heads off into the recess for the next eight weeks and with a budget 12 weeks away is that people are on their own for the next while.</p> <p>There are no further interventions.  That is a devastating message for families.  It is a crucifying message because many of them are struggling to pay the bills at the end of the week.  What message does the T&aacute;naiste have for that cohort of individuals, the many thousands who are being abandoned as the Government goes into the summer recess?</p></speech>

It is also a populist narrative.  I spend as much time outside this House as the Deputy does, as do my colleagues on these benches.  I spend as much time talking to my constituents - working people, middle-income people, business people and people from all backgrounds - as the Deputy does.  I do not know what the Deputy will be doing through July or August, by the way, but I can guarantee him that Ministers will be continuing to work.  There is a Cabinet subcommittee meeting this afternoon, for example, to discuss the situation with migration and people coming from overseas.  There are trade missions next week and there will be a Cabinet meeting at the end of July, so we will be working throughout July as normal with the exception of coming to the D&aacute;il Chamber.  Throughout August we will be preparing the budget in September.  I do not know what the Deputy will be doing, but he will not be doing any of those things.</p></speech>

Last month, for example, I heard from a mother who informed me that the possibility of her daughter progressing to third level education had been cast into doubt because of the cost to the family of having to fix the defects in their defectively built apartment to ensure it is made compliant with fire safety regulations.</p>  <p>  We understand the working group on defective homes will be completing its report next week, but we also understand it will have found that up to 100,000 apartments have been affected by fire safety and other defects, with up to 44,000 apartments in the process of being remediated right now.  We understand properties in every county in Ireland are affected by construction defects, with a particularly acute problem in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown, Dublin South-Central, Dublin Bay North and Dublin Fingal.  Indeed, in my constituency of Dublin Bay South I have heard from some people who are affected too and I have met members of the Construction Defects Alliance.  I have heard great fears expressed by individuals and families.  There is the fear of debt due to the cost of fixing the defects, but also a fundamental fear about safety in their homes, primarily due to fear of fire because these homes were defectively built.</p>  <p>  I understand the working group is concerned that vital safety works on the apartments, which is ongoing, might stall or be deferred pending any new developments, causing unnecessary risk to the health and safety of the tens of thousands of families and individuals living in those apartments.  We know that vital safety works must continue and that people must be supported to ensure they do continue.</p>  <p>  Will budget 2023 include measures to support people living in homes where there are these construction defects?  For example, will the budget include 100% refundable tax credits for owner-occupiers who have paid already or who are paying ongoing levies for the remediation of defects in their apartments?  Some building management companies will allow for the cost of compliance works to be paid in instalments, but that is not the case for everyone.  Many of those who have already been charged with the cost of remediating their apartments say they are unable to pay and have been dealt intimidating legal notices and even threats to put attachment orders on their property.</p>  <p>  It amounts to a life of fear for the many people affected.  It is hard to exaggerate the scale of this pending crisis, which has been somewhat under the radar until now but which I believe will be highlighted by the forthcoming report.  It has certainly been highlighted to me by the people I have met.  They are in fear.  They are in fear of increased insurance costs.  Those who wish to sell their homes, perhaps because their families have grown and the apartments are no longer big enough, are forced to stay in unsuitable spaces that are far too small.  They simply cannot move on from an apartment that was built defectively and for which an outstanding cost for remediation still exists.  Lenders will not allow the taking out of mortgages on defective properties, so the prospect of selling is a real challenge.</p>  <p>  What will the T&aacute;naiste and the Government do?  Will the T&aacute;naiste give a commitment to ensure the budget will address this and guarantee support for those who are so adversely affected?</p></speech>

It is one I am very familiar with in my constituency as well, where a large number of apartments have apartment defects.  People have been sent bills, sometimes for &euro;10,000 and sometimes for as much as &euro;60,000 per apartment, to carry out necessary repairs.  The inevitable happens.  Some people can afford to pay, some cannot afford to pay and some people will not pay.  Therefore, the money cannot be raised and the work cannot be carried out, so people are left in a terrible limbo where they are unable to sell the apartment and they are worried about whether it is even safe for them to continue to live there.</p>  <p>  The Government responded to the issues that arose with pyrite and it has responded with the new mica scheme for Donegal and other counties.  I believe we will need a response to assist people who are facing large bills as a result of defects in apartments.  I cannot give any commitments at this stage, but as the Deputy mentioned, a working group on this was established by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien.  A report is due.  I have not seen the report but I believe it is imminent or close to being completed.  Once we have that report we will be able to give consideration to it.  However, the basic principle applies that there will have to be Government assistance for people who, through no fault of their own, purchased apartments that are in buildings where there are defects and those defects have to be repaired.</p></speech>

Following the horrific Grenfell fire in London, that is uppermost in all our minds.</p>  <p>  The scale of this problem is immense.  It is thought that up to 80% of apartments built between 1991 and 2013 may be affected by these construction defects.  Many of the people who are living in these apartments are living a life of fear and a life in debt because of the costs already incurred for remediating the defects.  I believe a full remediation scheme will have to be developed, and we will work constructively with the Government to ensure that is done.  However, we are conscious this will take time and it is vital that remediation work would continue in the meantime.  We are asking the Government to ensure people who are paying remediation levies or have paid them will not be at a disadvantage.  In the short term, we believe that will mean providing refundable tax credits to owner-occupiers and grants to social landlords in budget 2023 to ensure the fear that so many individuals and families are experiencing may be alleviated.</p></speech>

I do not want to comment in detail until I have.  However, I understand the point the Deputy is making with regard to some degree of retrospection.  I mentioned some of the blocks I am familiar with in my constituency where people have paid or are paying the levy and others have not paid or cannot pay.  It would be unfair if those who have made a contribution already did not get any State support while those who did not or could not did.  I am sure that is something the group has examined.  I do not know what it has recommended.  I understand the point the Deputy is making, and it is a valid one.</p></speech>

Ireland has used our corporation tax rate as a very effective economic development tool, which has successfully resulted in a flood of multinational investment into the country on the back of favourable conditions.  However, a decision made in October 2021, that Ireland would accede to a minimum global rate of 15%, which is up from 12.5%, will undoubtedly have ramifications for our future ability to attract investment.  The implementation of the OECD agreement will pose major challenges to Ireland given that Department of Finance officials believe there will be a projected loss of income to the Exchequer of at least &euro;2 billion annually.</p>  <p>  The summer economic statement, announced last week, cautions of "a clear vulnerability for the public finances" from the "concentration risk" of ten multinational firms now paying half of all corporation tax and &euro;1 in every &euro;8 collected in tax.  In response, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council said these corporation tax receipts "should not be relied on to fund permanent spending increases".  That is possibly because of the potential impact on multinational investment confidence in the country.</p>  <p>  Given our acute vulnerability, laid bare by many respected commentators, should we explore and review this decision?  The decision was made at a time when the global economy was on a more stable footing.  Other countries are reviewing their position in the context of global economic factors.  Last week, for example, Hungary, which initially supported the minimum rate, has now refused to implement the agreement, with other voices of opposition growing.  Indeed, last week the T&aacute;naiste's party colleagues in Fine Gael voted against the motion on a resolution condemning Hungary for taking this action.</p> <p>Furthermore, the issue was removed from May&rsquo;s meeting of ECOFIN because agreement was unreachable.  We need now more than ever to retain our blue-chip influence.  We are entering into a most uncertain period.  There is the economic impact of war in Ukraine, we have soaring inflation, a cost-of-living crisis is engulfing Europe and the possibility of a recession is lingering.  With the changes in the economic and geopolitical environment in the past nine months, we urgently need to have a defined contingency plan around how we will remain competitive and continue to attract foreign direct investment, FDI, given these proposed global tax changes.  It is clear that we now need a comprehensive, whole-of-government approach.  The change in our corporation tax rate will seriously impact the Exchequer's buoyancy, something which has allowed us to address issues like the cost-of-living crisis, by using a robust tax take to redistribute to those families who need it at budget time.  What plans are in place to address this matter so that as a country we can make decisions that are firmly in our national interest?</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, Hungary is holding up the European ratification of the international agreement on tax at the moment.  Their decision to do so has consequences.  The United States, for example, has indicated that it will suspend its double taxation agreement with Hungary.  One can imagine that if we were to adopt the same approach and if the US were to suspend its tax agreements with Ireland that would not be a position that we would like to be in, given the amount of US investments that we have in Ireland at the moment and have had for decades.</p>  <p>  It is relevant to say that our low corporation profit tax rate, which is 12.5%, has been a great success.  There are some people who believe that increasing taxes always means higher revenues and that reducing taxes always means lower revenues.  That clearly is not always the case.  The fact that we have a low corporation profit tax means that we take in more revenue and get in more investments.  If you take the amount of corporation profit tax paid in Ireland and divide it by the number of people in the country, we get two- or three-times revenue in than the average EU country.  Therefore, low taxes can result in higher revenues.  This is a perfect example of where that works.</p>  <p>  We have signed up to an international agreement to raise our rate to 15%, but that is only for the very largest companies and there will be some changes as to how the base is calculated.  We will probably gain on the 15% but lose a bit on the way the base is calculated.  We think it makes sense from an enterprise and economic policy point of view that we should be inside the tent and that we should be part of the agreement.  Ireland is not a tax haven.  We do not want to be perceived as a tax haven.  We think that it makes sense to be inside the agreement.  That is one of the reasons why we supported it.</p>  <p>  We anticipate that this year we will see record corporation profit tax receipts and that that will continue to rise.  The pipeline for FDI is really, really strong.  We think that revenues will continue to rise over the next couple of years, but we cannot take that for granted.  They will fall at some point.  That is why it is important that we use these corporation profit taxes on companies that are coming in in a sensible way.  One way we are doing that is by investing a lot into capital, into infrastructure and into things that you only have to build once and therefore maintain after, for example, the metro, the national broadband plan and the housing programme.  It makes sense to put these receipts into capital investment, because of the huge deficits that are there in infrastructure, but also to help the economy grow in the future.  If we get into a surplus position, and that may well happen, we can put some of it away, either into a rainy-day fund like we did before or perhaps into the Social Insurance Fund to help-----</p></speech>

In that context, we have look to the future.  I note that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Finance called for submissions in regard to enterprise policy.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment gave less than one month to people to make submissions.  It restricted the submissions to 1,500 words.  There are many companies out there that would like to make a contribution to that policy-making process but the bottom line is one needs much longer and a more detailed submission if the people involved are to get the message across.  It is clear that we need a whole-of-government approach to development in particular of research capability.  This is key to ensuring the robustness of the offer that we are able to make to multinational companies and to make them interested in being involved here in Ireland.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to extend the time of the submissions for both the Department of Finance and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p></speech>

In terms of my own Department&rsquo;s consultation on the new enterprise White Paper, the deadline is 5 p.m. on Friday, 29 July.  The consultation documents ask that submissions be no longer than 1,500 words, but they do not have to be so if somebody wants to make a longer submission of 2,000 words or 10,000 words, we will still accept it.  It is not that it has to be less than 1,500 words.  Because it is not a statutory consultation, we can facilitate an extension of the deadline of 29 July.  All that we ask is that any organisation or any person who wants to make a submission later than that emails us to let us know so that we can have an idea as to when it will come in.

It was 4.5% this week.  With the fear that Russia will not reopen the Nord Stream pipeline, we know that the price is only going to go one way.  Given that approximately 50% of our electricity is generated from gas-fired power stations, that means that for everybody the price of electricity is escalating.  The issue of the impact on householders has already been raised here this morning.  I fully support that.</p>  <p>  I want to raise with the T&aacute;naiste this the impact on small retailers, especially small independent retailers.  They are not at the moment and will not be able to pay their electricity bills.  I have spoken to many of them.  They are genuinely concerned that they will not be able to continue trading.  Honestly, I believe this is not a case of somebody crying wolf when retailers tell us that 18 months ago they were paying 12 cent per unit and that they are now paying almost 30 cent.  They just cannot take that hit.  One of them said to me that politicians do not realise how much at risk that small retailers are.  They were including me in that comment.  Another spoke of the frightening time that they are facing.  The T&aacute;naiste and I both know that it is not just electricity costs that have escalated, but costs for packaging and wages.  They are not complaining about that, but they have to bear those costs.  The problem is that whatever working capital or contingency they have, they have eaten into it.  Many are at the end of their rope as the cost of doing business, as one of them said to me, has just gone out the door.  Many smaller stores are now trading at below break even.</p>  <p>  These are resilient people.  They have survived.  They want to acknowledge the assistance that they got from the Government during Covid-19, but they need temporary support.  They need some stability so that they can plan for at least the next six months and can talk to their banks.  Some of the proposals they have include some kind of price freeze on electricity or a rebate system when energy costs as a percentage of turnover increase over predetermined thresholds.  They want a recognition that many energy providers are making huge profits.  The Government needs to look at some intervention here.  A temporary suspension of commercial rates would help.  They are short-term measures.  They have long-term proposals as well.  I would like to hear if the T&aacute;naiste can give them any respite for the serious few months that lie ahead.</p></speech>

While many businesses are struggling, I think it is fair to point out that most are doing well.  That is evidenced by the fact that there are 2.5 million people at work in Ireland currently, more than two thirds of whom work for small businesses in the SME sector.  We see the tax receipts coming in from VAT and company profits.  There have been very few insolvencies in the last year or two, although I think that figure is likely to rise.  While every business is different and some have very high energy bills, the average business spends between 5% and 10% of its outgoing on energy costs.</p> <p> We are working on some schemes that may be helpful for businesses.  I do not want to raise expectations too high.  We are not going to be able to step in and pay the electricity and gas bills of every business across the country, or even many businesses across the country.  Under the EU state aid framework, we have submitted proposals for an inflation crisis-related loan scheme for businesses, which will be similar to those in place for Brexit and Covid currently, and potentially a grant scheme for businesses that face viability issues as a consequence of energy prices.  That would be restricted, under the terms of state aid, to businesses that are in manufacturing and exporting and would not apply to retail.</p> <p> One of the areas where we are already helping, and where we can help more, is in helping businesses to reduce the amount of energy they use and to make energy savings.  I looked at it recently and there are actually 20 different schemes that businesses can apply to to get help from Government to carry out an energy audit and to get capital grants for the installation of equipment such as solar panels and insulation and for micro-generation.  That is really important because it might be the case that we are not just experiencing an energy price shock.  It could be an energy price shift.  While energy prices might fall back, they might remain at a high level permanently.  The best response to that is a long-term one, reducing the amount of energy we use and increasing the amount of renewable energy and micro-generation that we produce.  That is an area where the Government already has 20 schemes in place to help businesses.  I want businesses to become more aware of those schemes.  I also want to improve them.</p></speech>

I am not so sure that is the case.  I think a lot of businesses are on the brink.  They are running out of working capital and contingency.  While that may not be apparent in the figures that we have currently, it is actually happening on the ground.  The T&aacute;naiste spoke about the fact that most businesses spend 5% to 10% of their outgoing on energy costs.  However, for independent food retailers energy costs are the second highest after wages.  That sector is hit so much harder by increasing energy costs.  The T&aacute;naiste talked about long-term schemes that are available, but when your back is to the wall and you have no working capital, a long-term scheme - good and all as they may be - is not as attractive as it might sound in better times.  Short-term measures need to be looked at now.</p></speech>

It is often the case that we experience things on the ground and hear about them anecdotally, yet it is weeks or months before the official statistics prove what we know already.  That is what we are seeing now with the statistics on inflation.  According to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, prices are rising at 9.6% a year.  I think everyone knew that weeks and months ago.  In fact, it feels to me that they are actually rising faster than that.  I expect that we will see the rate of inflation rise above 10% before it falls back, and it will fall back.</p>  <p>  On businesses, I take the Deputy's point in relation to working capital.  We have helped over 10,000 businesses already through loan guarantee schemes.  However, at the moment, the only businesses that can qualify for them are those that can demonstrate that they have been adversely affected by Brexit or Covid.  We have applied to the European Commission for permission to extend those working capital loan schemes to businesses that can demonstrate that they have been adversely affected by the crisis in Ukraine, i.e. energy prices.  That is the first step.  We made a submission to the Commission to do that.  We will have to legislate to do that.  It is one of the things that I definitely intend to do.  I am also looking at other initiatives that might help, particularly around the longer term response.</p></speech>

I thank all the party leaders and group leaders for the co-operation we have received from them.  You have been very good.  Those of us charged with the responsibility of running the House have very little to complain about.  If I did have one complaint, it would be about some people&rsquo;s inability to keep to time.  Polonius said that brevity is the soul of wit.  Certainly, it is a case that when too much time elapses, interest collapses.  I hope that when Members return in September, those who have difficulties with the clock will have learned how it really works.</p>  <p>  I want as well to avail of the opportunity on behalf of Members to say to Peter Finnegan and to Elaine Gunn, to Noel Murphy our acting Superintendent and to all who work in House services a thank you for the trojan work they do for us at all times of the day and night.  We are greatly privileged to have people here of total and utter commitment.  In thanking them, I want to thank the broader parliamentary community, the people who work for the political parties, the civil servants, the advisers, the committee secretariat and of course our friends in the fourth estate, without which the public would not know what we are up to most of the time - we are deeply indebted to them.</p>  <p>  I want to say one final thing.  I know that as Members leave here they are not going to down tools, close their constituency offices and turn off their phones.  Some Members do not even turn them off in here.  People will be working and I will just say this.  The public are very cynical &ndash; some of them &ndash; about us.  Do not encourage greater cynicism on the part of the public.  Let us be truthful and say we know we will all be working between now and the return in September.  If there is one thing that is important to each and every one of us, it is that we take some time for ourselves and take some time to be with our families, our loved ones and our friends, particularly those of you with young children.  This is not a dress rehearsal.  Time you fail to spend now, you will not be able to spend in the future.</p>  <p>  Enjoy the summer and keep up the good work.</p></speech>

It is true of all of us that we will still be working in our Departments, Cabinet will still be meeting and constituency offices will still be open.</p> <p>Most Members of the House will take two or three weeks' annual leave and will work for the rest of the recess period.  Everyone, incidentally, should take their annual leave.  We only live once.  This is not a dress rehearsal.  It is right that Members continue to work throughout the recess but it is also entirely appropriate that they should take their annual leave and spend that time with their families and certainly not feel bad about that in any way.</p> <p> We also join with the Ceann Comhairle in thanking the staff here in Leinster House and all of our colleagues, including members of the media, for all of their work over the past seven months.  I believe I heard the Chief Whip say yesterday that 100 Bills have passed through this House since the Government was formed. </p></speech>

It is not often the Deputy and I agree 100% but on this occasion I do agree 100% with him.  What we saw happen in Northern Ireland with effigies and posters of politicians, including Michelle O'Neill,  Naomi Long and others, mainly female politicians but not always, being burned is unacceptable.  We also saw the Tricolour and the Palestinian flag, you name it, being burned on bonfires in Northern Ireland.  I respect orange culture and I attended a twelfth parade in Enniskillen some years ago with Peter Robinson and Arlene Foster.  It was a very well organised and respectful event.  It is right that people should celebrate their culture, including orange culture, but burning images of other people and other countries&rsquo; flags is not culture.  That is hatred and it is absolutely wrong and, on behalf of the Government, I completely condemn it.</p></speech>

There are concerning reports today that the transit centre at City West Hotel is accommodating more than 1,000 people and has no longer any further capacity.  We know that there are sites like the former Baggot Street hospital in my own constituency still sitting vacant.  I know that the T&aacute;naiste said that the Cabinet subcommittee will meet this afternoon to consider contingency planning and responses but, clearly, this is a serious issue of humanitarian concern.  Front-line staff across the public service are doing their very best but the situation is very difficult.  What will happen to refugees from Ukraine who arrive in Ireland today and over the weekend?  Will the Government heed the calls of the Ukraine Civil Society Forum for a national refugee response lead for the settlement of refugees here?</p></speech>

There has been an increase in the number of Ukrainians arriving in Ireland across June and July.  We think this may be related to the increased targeting of civilian infrastructure across Ukraine.  Last night 12 people died in a missile attack on a city in western Ukraine.</p>  <p>  We are still responding to a wartime situation.  A subcommittee of Cabinet Ministers will meet this afternoon, as the Deputy said.  My Department has been working very closely with other agencies including the OPW, HSE and the Department of Defence to provide emergency accommodation for people who are arriving right now.</p>  <p>  Our target for that emergency accommodation is to provide it for the people who are in Dublin airport right now and to reduce the numbers in the City West Hotel.  Obviously, places like Baggot Street hospital need to be brought online as well but that will not give us the emergency capacity that we are searching for right now.</p></speech>

The response the Minister has just given there is probably the same response that would have been given five months ago when this crisis started.  I know that no Government could been prepared for what happened.  We are, however, five months down the road and all of the kite-flying on such things as modular homes, incentives for holiday homes and vacant State properties have not eventuated.</p>  <p>  People, in fact, who have offered own-door accommodation five months ago still have that accommodation sitting empty.  That is unacceptable.  Why are refugees fleeing the war sleeping on floors when there is free accommodation waiting and ready for them?</p></speech>

I recognise that the process is not moving fast enough and that will be one of the issues we will discuss at our meeting later.  It is important to recognise that we have grown our accommodation capacity.  The State is accommodating 30,000 Ukrainian refugees-----</p></speech>

That is a total of 42,000 people.  We were accommodating 7,000 people at the same time last year.  The change in scale and the extent to which our capacity, need and how we have increased our capacity to accommodate people has to be recognised as well while always recognising that we need to do more.</p></speech>

We have a crisis now in emergency accommodation for people fleeing the terrible war in Ukraine and other wars and conflicts around the world.  We should not distinguish between people suffering in horrendous circumstances or conflicts anywhere in the world.  We also have, however, our own homelessness and housing crisis.  It all points to the fact that we have to do more and we have to plan.</p>  <p>  The simple thing that should be done, which we have been calling for, is that all evictions into homelessness should stop now.  This is an emergency and emergency measures need to be taken to get into use vacant houses and properties that are littering the towns and cities of this country.  These are being sat on with no justification in many places.</p></speech>

There are people fleeing wars in Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria who need the support of international protection.  That is why, as well as our provision of accommodation for Ukrainians, we are now accommodating 12,000 people.  There has been a significant increase in international protection applicants and a range of factors is responsible for that.  These include the post-Covid-19 situation and the change in the UK policy, which has also had a significant impact in respect of the large increase in the numbers seeking international protection here.</p></speech>

They have proven both their awareness and long-term commitment.  I have been contacted by numerous farmers from across County Tipperary who have expressed their mounting concern at the demands and expectations currently being placed on their shoulders.  The underlying message is that they are willing and prepared to make changes, they know the changes are needed and they accept and agree that they have a crucial role to play.  The changes required of farmers must be realistic and achievable and must be fair to keep them on board.  It is pointless to set targets that are unattainable and impossible to deliver.  Placing such demands on the farming community will only serve to alienate them.  Ireland needs a thriving agricultural sector.  It has, and always will be, the backbone of our rural economy.  When does the T&aacute;naiste expect the Government will be in a position to make a decision on these matters.</p></speech>

I also thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  Discussions are ongoing at governmental level across all sectors and range over the points in respect of emissions targets.  The Deputy raised a valid point, which is that farmers and our farming sector have been on a journey of transition for some time.  We continue to produce our food more efficiently and with a better carbon profile.  That is our ambition and farmers are adopting new measures through a range of approaches.  We want to continue doing that into the future so that we future-proof our sector in line with our Food Vision 2030 strategy in order that we increase the value of the produce in the markets that our farmers sell into.  Those markets all have a higher ambition and future-proofing of the sector is the right thing for us to do.  We will continue to produce food into the future with a better emissions profile and we intend to continue to work to support the sector to do that.</p></speech>

Deputy McNamara said it was 100 Bills at about one minute each.  It is no way to run a parliament.  </p> <p> I ask about the cap on income limits which the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, has promised to review.  Tipperary County Council is waiting.  Since 2011, there has been no review.  It is &euro;25,000 for a single person and &euro;27,500 for a couple.  The T&aacute;naiste just said inflation is almost 10%.  People cannot live on this package.  This is way too low.  The review was meant to be out long before the summer recess.  Here we are, going on the summer recess, and we do not have the review.  We need it, as do the council officials and the people.  The public representatives want it as well.  We have to be fair to people and give them a reasonable chance of getting on the housing list.  Those figures are totally out of date.  2011 was the last time, which was 11 years ago.</p></speech>

It is right and proper that we should increase the HAP limits but we do not want to increase them and cause rents to rise further.  A distinction is being made where it is a new tenancy.  A higher limit is now allowed for that.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste is now a hop, skip and jump away from becoming Taoiseach.  Almost every day of the lifetime of this Government, certainty today and yesterday, University Hospital Limerick, UHL, has been the most overcrowded hospital in the country.  Of the 676 beds we were told would be required at the time of reconfiguration, more than one third have yet to materialise.  As Head of Government, what will the T&aacute;naiste do differently?  The current Taoiseach has said it is a matter for the HSE, even though the HSE is not improving the situation?  What will the T&aacute;naiste do differently to ensure UHL is no longer providing a different level of healthcare from the rest of the country?</p></speech>

As Taoiseach and Minister for Health previously, I did my best to ensure it got a new state-of-the-art emergency department and additional beds.  There are probably 100 or so more beds than a few years ago with more on the way.  I helped secure the opening of the Leben Building, for example.  A huge amount of investment has gone into that hospital.  I accept it may not be enough, given that it is the only level 4 hospital for a very large region, but it is frustrating that that level of investment has not made much of a difference and so many people end up on trolleys.  It is not right.  It is the case that the hospital will need additional assistance, with more bed capacity in particular but we will have to get more involved in making sure patients are managed better as well.</p>  <p>  I have seen hospitals turn around.  Drogheda used to always be one of the most overcrowded hospitals; Beaumont and Waterford were others.  Those three hospitals have seen dramatic improvements and probably have not seen as much additional investment as Limerick.  It is something I am keen to see resolved and improved dramatically over the next two years.</p></speech>

Three-month checks, nine-to-eleven-month checks, two-year checks and four-year checks have all been cancelled.  I have a constituent who is 36 weeks pregnant and who tells me she is terrified of not getting the service when her newborn baby arrives.  I have a friend whose newborn third child will not get the service her previous two children got in Lucan.

I will have to make inquiries with the Minister for Health about it.  We have a large number of public health nurses in the State.

That burden makes this difficult time even more difficult.

We have doubled the size of the tax measures that are afforded for in the summer economic statement.  The Government has always recognised the role that taxation can play in helping those on low or middle wages keep the wage increases they get due to their hard work.  We will in budget 2023 continue with the progress we have made and put together a package that helps.  At the same time, I am confident it will avoid adding to the inflationary challenges we have.  The Deputy's point is well made.  We understand that many workers not in receipt of support through our social welfare system also face higher costs and more pressure on their wallets and purses.  We will do our best in the budget to help them.</p></speech>

It found a sympathetic audience in Fine Gael but, thanks to the resistance of the regulator, it did not succeed.  Recently, the T&aacute;naiste opened the door to the company again when he pointed towards the possibility of ride-sharing as a solution to the current constraints in late-night taxi and public transport.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, has an ongoing recruitment campaign.  It is trying to encourage people into the taxi industry.  Fine Gael's cosy relationship with Uber undermines that.  The T&aacute;naiste's public utterances matter.  Who would invest in a taxi with that cloud hanging over the sector?

However, I have used it in other countries.  I think approximately 10,000 cities in the world have ride-sharing in some form.  I say to people travelling over the summer to try it out in the city they visit, talk to the driver and then form an opinion as to whether it is a good idea or not.</p></speech>

The main dental treatment service provider is flooded with patients and is not taking any new patients until at least September or October.  With regard to orthodontics, there are 3,033 patients in Cork and Kerry waiting to be assessed.  Some 2,355 are waiting for treatment, 1,800 of whom have now been waiting for longer than two years, while 177 have been waiting longer than four years.  I recently came across the case of a constituent, a teenager, who continued to wear a mask to school because they were so embarrassed about their treatment.  That child is in sixth year in school.  Will the T&aacute;naiste ask the HSE to take action, step in and provide more dentists under the public system to alleviate these problems?</p></speech>

We see this at every level of our justice system.  A solicitor, Mr. Gareth Noble, reported on a family list in the District Court in Meath which could not be cleared despite the single judge working a significant number of extra hours.  One case involved a man who was making his fourth attempt to lodge an application for an order for access to his children.  This was his fourth time going into the court and, once again, his case was not reached.  We do not have enough judges for this man to be able to get even a hearing on access to his children.  This is hampering justice at every single level.  Will the Government use the budget to invest in significant numbers of extra judges so that we can have the effective access to justice that is essential in any democracy?</p></speech>

The Deputy will know as well as I do that it is not as simple as providing extra judges.  We need to make sure there is court space and the court staff required to enable judges to do their job.  We need to make sure that, if there are going to be additional judges and Courts Service staff, we see an improvement in the length of time it takes people to get through the courts system.  I was a member of the Government that established the Court of Appeal.  We did that on the basis that it would clear backlogs but it just moved the backlog from the Supreme Court to the Court of Appeal.  I do not regret doing that but we always have to be a little sceptical when we are told that more staff and resources will mean better results for people.  I know some solicitors are critical of our judges and say they work shorter hours and shorter terms than judges in other countries while getting paid more.  We have to look at the issue in the round.</p></speech>

Larger providers seem to be benefiting far more than ECCE scheme-only providers.  Contracts are due to be sent out in early August.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.325" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1564" speakername="Duncan Smith" time="13:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400027#Z02000"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to prohibit the recording or publication without consent of certain images of persons who are dead, seriously injured or in shock as a result of an accident or other emergency, and to provide for connected matters. </blockquote>  <p>I welcome the opportunity to seek leave to introduce this Bill on First Stage today.  In our country, we deal with anywhere between 150 and 200 road traffic deaths each year.  In addition, there are upwards of 8,000 injuries related to road traffic accidents every year.  These can range from very minor injuries to the most serious and profoundly life-changing injuries.  There is hardly a person or community that has not been touched by the tragedy and impact of a road traffic death or serious injury.  It is something that we, as a nation, are very conscious of.  We have striven over many years and through many campaigns to make our roads safer, mitigate the many dangers caused by irresponsible road use and decrease the number of genuine accidents that happen.</p><p>Unfortunately, a phenomenon has recently emerged that is both distressing and grotesque.  In these cases, there is a serious accident and victims are dead, dying, seriously injured or in a state of nervous shock.</p> <p>That is then filmed by passers-by and shared on social media.  We have all heard that the Garda, very quickly after an accident, is having to appeal to the public saying there is an accident on such-and-such a road and please do not share images of it.  I do not even have to go into the reasons but the central reason is that a family member or a loved one of the person who has been injured or killed may see it.  Images should not be shared out of respect for the victim of the accident.  Even after the immediacy of it, those images will stay out there in cyberspace forever.  It is an act of absolute indecency and we need to take clamp down on it.  We need to find our own decency as a society again and look at what we can do as a Legislature to say this is unacceptable.  It is unacceptable that this is done at these tragic events, which happen in the eye of the public.  As someone who witnessed a fatality on a road in Dublin city centre almost 20 years ago, I find it beyond belief that anyone would reach for a camera or a phone to take a recording in the immediate aftermath of witnessing something so serious.</p> <p> This Bill would prohibit the recording or publication without consent of certain images of persons who are dead, seriously injured or in shock as a result of an accident or other emergency.  There are five sections.  Section 1 defines a protected image as meaning a visual representation, including any photographic, film, video or digital representation of a person at the scene of an accident or other emergency who as a result of that emergency is dying, dead, seriously injured or in a state of nervous shock.  Section 2 provides that a person is guilty of an offence where he or she records or publishes such a protected image of another person without that other person's consent and that conduct seriously interferes with the peace and privacy of that other person or causes distress, alarm or harm, including psychological harm, to the other person or members of his or her family.  The Bill also seeks to protect our emergency services, which at certain times need to take recordings of scenes for whatever reason.  We have always trusted, and do trust, that our emergency services are the best of us in terms of responding to these emergencies.</p> <p> With regard to the media, the legislation is compliant with the Broadcasting Act.  We are very clear in the Bill, which is relatively short, that these provisions are specifically for members of the public who take recordings or photographs without consent and share them through social media, where they can spread far and wide and cause untold and unimaginable distress for victims, friends, families and communities after accidents.  I expect the Bill will not be opposed.  I hope we can find some way, even through an amendment to existing legislation, to bring this proposal into law.</p></speech>

It also outlines the Government&rsquo;s medium-term budgetary strategy for ensuring the public finances remain on a sustainable pathway.</p>  <p>  I will outline the context within which the Government will publish the budget for 2023.  Two and a half years ago, we found ourselves facing a public health emergency which no one could have anticipated.  The Government responded in an unprecedented way to shield the economy.  Years of careful and responsible budgetary management meant we had the resources to meet the challenges of that moment, and we deployed those resources in full.  The cost was enormous, but we got the balance right.  Government action prevented a deep and long-lasting recession and laid the groundwork for a strong economic recovery when we had moved beyond the most severe phase of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Nowhere is this more evident than in the jobs market.  We now have more people at work in Ireland than ever before.  When I think back to the depths of the pandemic when unemployment soared to record levels, this is a really important achievement.  The actions and supports of the Government played a crucial role in this.</p>  <p>  I would note we spent many years gradually building up the public finances.  During this time, the constant refrain was that the Government should have been spending far more.  Indeed, it may have been quite popular at times to do so, but if we had not restored the public finances, we would not have had the resources available to intervene on the scale we did and would have been in a more vulnerable position when the pandemic hit and, indeed, now.</p>  <p>  We have proven our track record at being able to intervene at a time of such emergency and we have demonstrated the importance of being ready for new unexpected challenges, one of which we are now confronting today.  I refer, of course, to the consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the after-effects of the pandemic on the supply of goods and services that have given rise to inflation not seen in many years.  Now standing at 9.6%, inflation is at its highest level in almost four decades.</p><p><i>2 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>Of course, Ireland is not unique in that most other developed countries are struggling with the same problem, but we accept and understand the difficult consequences of this inflation for our standard of living and for households and businesses throughout the country.  We understand what the fall in living standards means for them and the difficult choices they are making.</p> <p> While the drivers may indeed be global, we need to recognise there is no Government that can fully offset the impact of these changes on the lives of citizens.  However, we have intervened to ease the burden and help with the costs, providing almost &euro;2.5 billion in direct relief.  Between the response to Covid and our response to the cost-of-living challenge, this means we have now provided in excess of &euro;50 billion in budgetary support since early 2020 &mdash; a remarkable figure.  The Government has not shied away from taking the necessary action when needed.  The question now concerns what further action is appropriate and how we can strike a balance between intervening today and keeping our public finances safe so we will be safe tomorrow.  We got the balance right during the pandemic and it is vital we again get it right as we address the consequences and challenges of cost-of-living increases.  This leads on to the budgetary strategy the Government published.</p> <p> Last year, we set out our medium-term budgetary strategy in the summer economic statement.  This set out the pathway for gradually restoring the public finances to health while still allowing for reductions and changes in personal taxation.  Under this strategy, core current expenditure growth will be limited to the trend growth rate of the economy so that, for example, if tax revenue exceeds expectations, it will not be used to finance new expenditure above levels already planned for.</p> <p> However, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and I recognise that the statement was drafted in a dramatically different inflationary environment.  To reflect this, for one year only, we have amended the strategy for 2023.  Core current expenditure will increase by 6.5% next year.  The tax package to be announced in budget 2023 will be just over &euro;1 billion, more than double what was initially provided for.  Therefore, the total package for next year will be &euro;6.7 billion.  This is a change for 2023 only.  For future years, our strategy will remain unchanged, with core current expenditure targets at 5% per year and tax packages reflecting what we hope will be different and better economic circumstances.  This strikes the current balance, acknowledging the new economic reality while setting out a sensible plan for restoring our public finances to strength over the medium term.  This overall approach has been endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  Taking into account positive tax developments, a budget package of &euro;6.7 billion would be consistent with a very modest budgetary surplus for next year.  I stress, however, that this would be due solely to the strong growth in receipts we have seen from corporate tax.  As I said to this House on countless occasions, while these receipts are welcome and a sign of the strength of our multinational sector, they are also highly concentrated, with just ten firms paying more than half of the entire corporate tax take.  This leaves the public finances exposed to vulnerability from a potentially volatile, unreliable revenue stream.</p> <p> We know all too well in this country that leaving the public finances vulnerable to changes in transient revenue is potentially catastrophic.  It is not so long ago that our tax receipts had become overly reliant on another source of windfall tax receipts &ndash; those related to the property market &ndash; and we are all aware of the consequences of that.</p> <p> Over the medium term, we know that changes to the international tax regime are forthcoming.  While the full impact of the changes agreed under the base erosion and profit-shifting, BEPS, process will take time to become apparent after implementation, our current technical estimate is of a loss of &euro;2 billion.  In reality, due to other changes, for example, in the business cycle, the costs could be even higher.  With this in mind, I would caution that while a headline budgetary surplus is certainly positive news, headline figures alone can overlook very real vulnerabilities in our public finances.  It would not be safe to suggest we can begin spending at increased levels once such a surplus is achieved, particularly if that surplus ultimately proves to be passing because it is built on conditions and foundations that change.</p> <p> Accordingly, I have asked my officials to examine the issue of excess corporation tax in advance of the budget so we can move to address this vulnerability while continuing to ensure Ireland remains a destination of choice for highly successful multinational investment.  Such investment benefits our economy not just through significant tax receipts but also by creating many highly paid jobs.</p> <p> The forthcoming budget will be a cost-of-living budget.  We have already acted, repeatedly, to help to ease the burden and will continue to do so.  In particular, we will ensure workers do not pay more income tax as a result of inflation pushing them into a higher tax bracket.  We will introduce a carefully crafted, appropriate budgetary policy that serves to assist people with the cost of living but not add to the inflationary difficulties we face.  We will ensure we keep our public finances in a safe way.  In short, the strategy set out in the summer economic statement seeks to get that balance right.</p></speech>

This morning I was glad to have the opportunity, alongside the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, to engage with colleagues at a meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  The meeting gave us a good opportunity to tease out in more detail some of the issues involved.</p>  <p>  The summer economic statement is an important part of our annual budgetary timetable.  It sets out our fiscal and budgetary strategy for the year ahead, outlining the resources available in the context of budget 2023.  Back in 2020, when the Government took office, the most pressing issue was tackling the pandemic and ensuring lives and livelihoods would be protected insofar as possible.  The scale of the Government intervention has been truly unprecedented.  Some &euro;37 billion in direct public expenditure supports has been made available to fight Covid and its effects.  This investment was complemented by a range of further taxation and liquidity measures.</p>  <p>  Assessing the economy today, it is clear the Government made the right call in supporting incomes, jobs and businesses.  As we emerge from the pandemic, our economy and labour market have shown remarkable resilience.  At the end of June, the monthly unemployment rate stood at 4.8%.  At the end of June last year, the Covid-adjusted unemployment rate was almost 16%.  In the first quarter of this year, more than 2.5 million people were in employment.  This is an all-time high in the history of our country and far exceeds pre-pandemic levels.  It clearly demonstrates the scale of the recovery in the labour market, which was supported by the significant income and employment supports implemented by the Government over the course of the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Businesses, too, have shown strong resilience, as the many Covid supports, such as the employment wage subsidy scheme and Covid restrictions support scheme, have been unwound.  The economic rebound Ireland has achieved has not been the experience universally.  Ireland's record, by comparison with that of our peers in terms of health outcomes and the strength of our economy, indicates Ireland has done remarkably well.  We owe a considerable debt of gratitude to the public and private sector workers and the thousands of volunteers around our country who made this a reality.</p>  <p>  While the economy has rebounded strongly following the pandemic, the global economic outlook has changed significantly.  A complete cut-off of Russian gas to continental Europe is now a possibility, making the European economy especially vulnerable.  This impact can be seen in the value of the euro, which has now reached parity with the dollar for the first time since 2002.  For Ireland, as an exporting country, a slowdown in the European economy will have an impact on prospects.</p>  <p>  As a consequence of the intervention during the pandemic, Irish Government debt has now reached nearly &euro;0.25 trillion, representing &euro;47,250 for each person in the country.</p> <p>As the Minister for Finance has said on a number of occasions, the era of zero- or low-cost borrowing has come to an end.  These are some of the many challenges that we, as a Government, need to consider when framing the budget 2023 package.</p> <p> Domestic and international inflationary pressures are foremost among those challenges.  Supply issues that developed over the past two years have contributed to price increases.  This has been exacerbated by the conflict in Ukraine and the resultant impact on energy prices.  We are acutely aware of the impact of these price pressures on households, families and businesses.  We saw further evidence of that today, with the official measure of inflation now being at 9.1% annually, which is the highest level in almost four decades.</p> <p> A range of expenditure measures that assist with the impact of cost-of-living pressures were included in this year's budget.  They included &euro;1.2 billion in expenditure across a range of sectors, with increases in social protection weekly rates, health affordability measures and childcare supports.  They were complemented by a significant tax package.  I recognise that the economic context has changed considerably since the last budget and Government and fiscal policy has been responsive to this. More than &euro;500 million in cost-of-living spending measures have been introduced in the current year.  This included an electricity credit of &euro;200, which benefited more than 2 million households.  Further targeted measures in respect of the fuel allowance, reductions in the drugs payment scheme threshold, reductions in public transport fares generally with an additional reduction for young people, and improvements in the working family payment have also been announced.  In addition, the Government introduced a temporary reduction in the excise duties charged on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil and reduced the VAT rate on the supply of gas and electricity.  We have to continue to fund these measures.</p> <p> Last week, acknowledging the strain many families are facing with back-to-school costs, we announced a further package, including the abolition of school transport fees for the 2022-23 school year, a &euro;100 increase in the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance and the expansion of the school meals programme to the newly designated DEIS schools, benefiting 60,000 children.  The Government is committed to continuing to help our people with the challenge presented by the current level of inflation.  This context has framed our preparations for this summer economic statement and shaped today's debate.</p> <p> Last year, the medium-term expenditure strategy set out the dual objective of delivering sustainable expenditure over the medium term by setting the core expenditure growth rate at sustainable levels and providing the necessary resources for ongoing improvements in public services.  The strategy was developed against the backdrop of an average of 2% inflation over the past 20 years.  The strategy must take account of the nature of the economic shocks we are experiencing.  These shocks are exceptional and globally driven.  It is clear that to protect public services, a short-term adjustment to the expenditure strategy is required for 2023.  This is an important element of our budgetary plans.  In framing the summer economic statement and budget parameters, we are seeking to balance the need to protect the real value of public services with policy measures that do not add to inflationary pressures.  While the Government cannot absorb the full impact of the current inflationary shock, we have taken concrete action to support households, protect public services and continue invest in our critical public infrastructure.  We must and will continue to do this through an adjustment to the expenditure strategy.</p> <p> Budget 2023 will be a cost-of-living budget.  We will follow up on the measures introduced this year and as part of the budget 2022.  The summer economic statement sets out the key parameters for budget 2023.  It outlines a total expenditure package of &euro;90.3 billion for next year.  This funding will deliver core services and help businesses and the economy to deal with the adverse impacts of Brexit, provide ongoing Covid supports, which will continue to be necessary, and provide for the humanitarian assistance of refugees arriving from Ukraine through additional non-core funding.  This upward adjustment will result in an increased overall budgetary package of &euro;6.7 billion, comprising approximately &euro;5.7 billion in additional expenditure and a further &euro;1 billion for tax measures.  Some &euro;400 million of this spending will allow for the early implementation of measures in the current year while &euro;5.3 billion will be provided for the 2023 budgetary package.</p> <p> Compared with the position set out in budget 2022 last October, this package will see core spending increase by 6% this year and 6.5% next year, meaning an additional &euro;1.7 billion in resources will be available compared to the stability programme update we published back in April.  This is a significant but warranted increase in the circumstances.</p> <p> Next year, &euro;85.8 billion in core expenditure will be provided for both the ongoing support of, and improvement in, public services and additional public investment.  Approximately 3% of the core current expenditure base will be available to meet existing levels of service costs next year compared with the current year.  This includes meeting public service pay commitments that have been made in the Building Momentum agreement and funding for demographic developments, including supporting a growing population and the changing profile of our citizens.  It also includes meeting costs from the full year impact of measures from budget 2022 that are being implemented on a phased basis, such as the changes to the childcare scheme later this year and the changes to the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant system that will kick in in the autumn.  Funding has to be provided next year for such measures.  There will be a &euro;800 million increase in capital expenditure in line with the ceiling set out in the national development plan, NDP.  Overall core capital investment will reach some &euro;11.7 billion next year, with an additional &euro;200 million as part of the national recovery and resilience plan.  This represents 7% increase, in line with the NDP.</p> <p> This funding will provide for important investment across all sectors, including housing, health, education, transport and also to tackle climate change.  There is also likely to be some carryover from any unspent element of the capital budget in the current year.  All of this means that &euro;2.7 billion will be available for new current expenditure measures, of which approximately &euro;400 million will take effect in the current year.  This must accommodate priorities across a wide range of Government policy areas, including the public service pay bill, which is a significant driver of current expenditure, amounting to close to a third of core current expenditure each year.  Spending on social protection accounts for a further third of core current spending.  It must also provide for Government commitments on housing, climate change and health.  Core spending will continue to provide the funding required to support and provide improvements in public services, while investing in our capital infrastructure around the country.  As the Minister for Finance said, we plan to introduce a number of one-off measures for implementation in 2022.  Those are being developed by Government and an announcement on this will be made on budget day in September.</p> <p> Next year, the Government will provide &euro;4.5 billion in non-core spending for temporary measures.  This follows the provision of &euro;37 billion since March 2020 in non-core funding, mostly for Covid-related spending.  This reflects the Governments two-pronged approach to fiscal policy and expenditure management and is a vital tool to ensure responsive fiscal policy to significant external shocks.  This funding will provide for the continuation of important Covid measures in the health service, the provision of supports to help counter the negative impacts of Brexit through the Brexit Adjustment Reserve fund and the continued provision of humanitarian supports for refugees arriving from Ukraine.</p> <p> The revised strategy provides for a 6.5% increase in core spending for next year.  This will be a considerable increase in funding and resources for the budget but it must accommodate a range of priorities.  It can have a significant impact on the lives of our people but this requires a focus on the design of policy and it requires prioritisation.  We cannot meet all the competing demands on public expenditure, but we can provide support to those most vulnerable and continue to enhance our public services.  This will require decisions to be made across government and prioritisation of demands.  A range of expenditure reforms have a role to play in supporting this process and ensuring that spending delivers efficiency, effectiveness and value for money.</p> <p>These reforms include the ongoing spending reviews, performance budgeting and the use of Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service resources across government to provide key information and critical insights to inform decisions.  In that context, my Department will publish the mid-year expenditure report this month.  This is an important document setting out a clear and detailed view of the baseline expenditure position in advance of the upcoming Estimates process.</p> <p> While we undoubtedly face many new challenges, we have seen considerable improvements in the fiscal position of the State and we recognise the extraordinary resilience of the people and of our economy.  This will allow us to respond to these challenges in a manner that is affordable and fiscally sustainable while protecting public services, improving outcomes and investing in our future, and above all else, recognising that we do need to respond to the significant cost-of-living pressures so many people are facing at this time.</p></speech>

Ag an am c&eacute;anna, t&aacute; bagairt&iacute; fadt&eacute;armacha ann &oacute; Brexit agus &oacute; Covid-19.  N&iacute; m&oacute;r do bhuis&eacute;ad 2023 aghaidh a thabhairt ar na d&uacute;shl&aacute;in sin agus f&iacute;orathr&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute on the recently published summer economic statement and the economic challenges facing households, facing our communities and facing our country.</p>  <p>  The people and our economy have faced a multitude of crises and challenges over recent years.  Since 2016, we have faced the threat posed by Britain's decision to leave the EU.  Not only did Brexit pull the North out of the Union against its will, it has created grave economic uncertainty and political instability on our island.  As the Tories proceed with anointing their new leader, uncertainty remains regarding the British Government's commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, and indeed to international law.  We must remain vigilant and ensure that we do all we can across this island to limit the damage to our economy, to our communities, and to the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  Two years ago the world was plunged into the greatest public health emergency in generations.  The Covid-19 pandemic threatened the economy, jobs, businesses and the health of our people.  Like states throughout the developed world, the Government introduced measures and schemes to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on society.  I acknowledge the success of that response such as the wage subsidy scheme, which retained the vital link between employers and employees to stave off the threat of mass unemployment.  Throughout the pandemic, Sinn F&eacute;in supported the Government in implementing these vital measures at a time of national emergency.  While Covid-19 is now at the back of many people's minds, the virus remains in our communities.  We must continue to support our health services and healthcare provision in the time ahead.</p>  <p>  We have faced another challenge that threatens not only the competitiveness of our economy but also the living standards, the hopes, and the aspirations of our people.  The housing crisis, which the President rightly described as a social "disaster", is not an accident.  It did not fall from the sky.  Just as the Government takes credit for employment growth and headline economic indicators, it must also accept responsibility for overseeing a housing crisis that has left so many people in unaffordable rental traps and many others struggling to buy a house they can call home.  Home ownership rates have collapsed.  Young people are facing an uncertain future.  Persistent failures also exist in other areas.  Hospital waiting lists are higher than ever before.  Access to healthcare remains out of reach for far too many.  Childcare costs remain extortionate.  We must recognise that the provision of housing, affordable childcare, and accessible healthcare are not separate to the economy but are pillars of an inclusive economy</p>  <p>  It is important that we reflect on these challenges in the context of the summer economic statement and the budgetary strategy in the next year and the years ahead.  We do not have the time; people cannot afford for these challenges to be put on the long finger or made worse by the continuation of failed Government policy.</p>  <p>  Workers and families are struggling in the cost-of-living crisis.  With inflation reaching more than 9%, the highest rate of inflation in four decades, the causes are driven by a number of factors ranging from supply chain disruptions as the global economy emerged from the pandemic, some of which still persist, to the illegal invasion of Ukraine that has turbocharged inflation in energy and key commodities.  Of course, the high cost of living is also driven by domestic and persisting factors such as high housing, childcare and electricity costs.</p>  <p>  While inflation has darkened the economic outlook, including consumer sentiment, and impacted our trading partners, we have seen a sharp rebound since the pandemic with the second engine of the economy, the multinational sector, remaining resilient, despite the impact of the pandemic and rising inflation.  The impact of the cost-of-living crisis on households is severe with low- and middle-income households spending a higher proportion of their income on food and energy.  They are the people who are being hurt the hardest.</p>  <p>  While the summer economic statement is concerned with budget 2023, it outlines an intention to introduce measures that will come into effect on budget day through one-off measures.  The cost-of-living crisis is being felt today, not in late September but right here, right now and for the past weeks and months.  It was being felt yesterday and it will be felt tomorrow.  I believe it is a dereliction of duty on the part of the Government to not have brought forward an emergency budget before the D&aacute;il breaks its summer recess.  It is a disgraceful situation.  For those people who are struggling, this is an abandonment by the Government of its citizens.  There should have been an emergency budget with a comprehensive package of measures to support workers and families now.  I am aware that the fiscal assessment report published by the budget watchdog in May found that 90% of the measures introduced by the Government so far this year have been untargeted.  While I acknowledge the recent changes made to the back-to-school allowance, they were made under persistent political pressure, with too many families still not able to access that support.</p>  <p>  For months, Sinn F&eacute;in has been consistent in its call for an emergency budget, with affordable and effective measures that would ease the financial burden faced by so many people.  Instead, the most vulnerable in our society have been allowed to wither on the vine, with struggling households facing months of uncertainty as prices continue to rise and bills continue to mount.  Any measure introduced on budget day must not only support workers and families for the remainder of the year as if the struggles experienced in the previous months and year never happened.  A compensatory basis needs to be taken into account, including the impact of price rises right throughout all of 2022.</p>  <p>  The summer economic statement outlines a clear budget strategy for 2023, with certain measures to take effect from this year.  The budget strategy has increased the previously planned expenditure budget package by &euro;1.7 billion.  I understand this is in part a response to higher inflation, together with anticipated costs relating to a public sector pay deal, currently under negotiation.  Similarly, the previously planned tax package of &euro;500 million has now increased to just over &euro;1 billion.  It is crucial that any tax package should be progressive, recognising the changes solely to the standard rate band provide no benefit whatsoever to the 20% of taxpayer units who never reach the higher rate of tax.  This is especially important given the uneven impact of inflation across income distribution.</p>  <p>  The capital ceilings provided under the NDP remain unchanged, with an additional &euro;800 million to be allocated capital expenditure.  Given the heightened inflation in the construction sector, I have serious concerns regarding the ability of these capital ceilings to deliver the Government's targets in its housing plans, which simply do not go far enough in the first instance.  Those targets are clearly inadequate in the face of a deepening housing crisis.  We will continue to engage with the Government on this and other issues.  Will continue to pressurise the Government to do what is right in regard to housing, childcare, and the cost-of-living crisis that so many people families are facing.</p>  <p>  As I said earlier, we face a multitude of challenges, many of which are persistent problems that have been with us for far too long.  From income inadequacy to childcare, housing and healthcare, budget 2023 must deliver and make progress on these vital areas.  I do not believe that the budget strategy being proposed has the capacity to do that.  I will leave it at that as we are running out of time.</p></speech>

It gives us the context ahead of the budget.  Over the last two years our conversations at this time have been around Covid and the impact of the pandemic.  Before that, the uncertainty surrounding Brexit dominated our conversations whereas this year the focus has shifted to record inflation.  However, as we discuss the parameters for the upcoming budget, households across the State are also discussing financial matters and budgets.  These budgets are their household budgets; they are talking money or more accurately they are discussing the lack thereof.  Households are watching as the D&aacute;il rises tonight and as we leave this Chamber until mid-September.  Workers and families watch on in horror as they realise that there will be no further measures from the Government until the D&aacute;il comes back from recess.</p>  <p>  We have been clear over the last number of weeks that what people needed before we got to this point, the last day of the D&aacute;il session, was an emergency budget, to get them through this time.  We brought forward proposals but these fell on deaf ears, except for last week.  I laughed when the Taoiseach said that our motion of no confidence was a cynical move because I have seen many a cynical move from the Government.  After weeks of the Taoiseach and various Ministers saying that they would not move and would not provide additional supports, at the final hour before our motion was to be tabled, the Government made the most cynical move and announced additional back-to-school supports.  While that was welcome, it would have been better to have listened to and supported our measures, which would have included an additional 500,000 children in the back-to-school supports, but at least the Government acted on this occasion. </p>  <p>   It is unfortunate that the Government has not acted on rents, which continue to increase, with families are pushed into homelessness and more than 3,000 children in emergency accommodation under its watch.  It is also unfortunate that the Government did not act on home heating oil as people in the west rely more heavily on oil than other forms of heating.  That is not because they want to but because they have no other choice.  It is equally unfortunate that the Government did not listen to the whole suite of proposals that my party colleagues and I put forward over the last number of months.  While we have one eye on the gate, people will continue to struggle and wonder how they will make ends meet because the Government failed to act adequately to support them </p>  <p>Ins&iacute;n do na hAir&iacute;, agus muid inniu ar an l&aacute; deireanach de sheisi&uacute;n na D&aacute;la go dt&iacute; 14 mh&iacute; Mhe&aacute;n F&oacute;mhair, go bhfuilimid ag seasamh sa Seomra seo agus ag pl&eacute; c&uacute;rsa&iacute; airgeadais.

This discussion is of significant importance each year but in the current climate of high inflation and the largest erosion of living standards since the financial crash, it is of even more importance.  As we discuss the current economic situation and the upcoming budget it is imperative that we focus on the cost-of-living crisis, the effects on ordinary workers and families and the costs to small and medium-sized businesses, which are still struggling to get back on their feet after the pandemic.</p>  <p>  Just this morning, figures from the Central Statistics Office indicated consumer prices here rose by an average of 9.1% in the 12 months to June, the fastest rate of price growth seen in the economy since 1984.  That is up from 7.8% in the year to May, which is staggering.  Collectively this means Irish households are facing into the biggest cost-of-living squeeze in nearly four decades.  Anyone who remembers the last one will know what that was like.  All the indications are that this will be as bad, if not worse.  If we cast our minds back to those times we can remember the news, with suicide rates rising and people freezing in their homes and people ringing the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; to say they were getting on and off buses to try to keep themselves warm.  There were pensioners struggling and put to the pins of their collars. I was only a child but I remember it.  That was awful; this is likely to be even worse.  </p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has consistently proposed measures to address the cost-of-living crisis.  We called for an emergency budget to address the most pressing issues affecting people, but this was spurned by the Government.  The decision to bring the budget forward by two weeks was a tacit admission by Government that these are extraordinary times.  Household energy prices have risen at phenomenal rates - electricity by 41%, gas by 57% and home heating oil by 102%.</p>  <p>  I am not trying to place all the blame for such increases on the Government at all; of course not, but it could do more and it knows it.</p> <p>The public, as with Members of the Opposition, are aware that high inflation has been driven by supply-chain bottlenecks due to the way the global economy reopened after the pandemic and the recent illegal Russian invasion of Ukraine.  We know that and with the greatest of respect to the Minister and his colleagues, we do not need it repeated and explained to us every time.  They can take it as a given that we read the newspapers as they do and we understand what is happening across the globe.  However, we will continue to propose solutions and push for more to be done at a policy level where Government can have a positive influence to help ordinary workers and families.  We know that the Government cannot do everything, but it can and should do more.</p> <p> My colleague, an Teachta Pearse Doherty, has already mentioned that Sinn F&eacute;in has repeatedly and consistently called for an emergency budget, proposing sensible measures that would support lower- and middle-income households or as these people are now known thanks to this Government's policies, the working poor.  We have proposed further reductions in the rate of excise applied to petrol, diesel and home heating oil; an increase in the minimum wage and a realistic plan to move quickly to a living wage; further reductions in the rate of excise applied to petrol, diesel and home heating oil; a refundable tax credit equivalent to one month&rsquo;s rent and a ban on further rent increases; and a substantial reduction in childcare fees.</p> <p> The Government&rsquo;s response to the cost-of-living crisis has remained slow, piecemeal and inadequate.  The focus of budget 2023 must be to support workers and families.  However, we must also look at the plight of small and medium businesses.  I was recently contacted by the owner of Wharton's, a small take-away restaurant in Bantry.  She sent me a copy of two electricity bills, one from September last year and one from June of this year.  In September 2021 her electricity bill for two months was &euro;1,974.03, but in June 2022 her electricity bill was &euro;4,230.33.  That is phenomenal.  I pay tribute to the owner for keeping the show on the road in the face of those increases.  She wants to keep her business open, but she needs some assistance and she needs hope.</p> <p> This is replicated across the board.  I have received correspondence from shops, supermarkets and other small and medium-sized enterprises highlighting the financial pressure of running fridges and freezers to keep products fresh and frozen.  Many business owners say that unless something is done, they will either dramatically reduce the number of fridges and freezers they have and only sell a limited number of products, or the next step is to close their doors.</p> <p> There is time in advance of budget 2023 for the Government to listen to the Opposition, to listen to the trade unions, to listen to the public and to listen to the plight of SMEs in order to make sure the budget delivers for those most in need.</p> <p> In the few seconds remaining to me I will relay to the Minister as I have done previously to some of his colleagues the contents of a letter sent to me by a constituent.  When something in her house is broken it stays broken.  That is it; no repair.  The only bill she has that is in anyway flexible is her food bill which she had already cut.  Her message to the Government is she cannot cut anymore.  She needs help and she needs it now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.350" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1564" speakername="Duncan Smith" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400034#KK00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the summer economic statement on behalf of the Labour Party.  It is undeniable that the statement shows how well the economy is doing on paper right now, but this is only on paper.  These abstract economic figures do not tally with the real lived experience of hard-pressed households in my own Fingal constituency and across the country.  The only numbers that matter to them are the increasing price of food, energy and services.  Strong GDP figures are not helping them pay the bills or get the kids back to school.  Nor do they support those local business owners in the real economy who face ever-increasing costs, such as insurance and energy.</p>  <p>  To paraphrase the President&rsquo;s recent comments, being a star performer for the speculative sector is not what is important.  Instead, what really matters for people are building affordable homes, investing in quality public healthcare and taking real measures to tackle the cost of living.  The Government has consistently failed on all these fronts.  The reality is our economic performance is largely driven by the multinational sector.  Many of these are footloose companies which could up sticks tomorrow.  Yet we remain completely over-reliant on them for revenue as the summer economic statement shows.</p>  <p>  Just under half of the Government&rsquo;s corporation tax receipts, worth &euro;8 billion, might be unsustainable or at risk according to the Central Bank.  We now have the crazy situation where just ten foreign multinational firms are paying half of all corporation tax.  To say we have put all our eggs in one basket would be a gross understatement.  We need to be clear that this is a short-term tax boon that will soon come to an end.</p>  <p>  Labour's spokesperson for finance and public expenditure, Deputy Nash, has consistently warned about the overconcentration on corporation tax for years.  We have called for the development of a new industrial strategy, one that creates decent sustainable jobs for the long term.  The Government seems to have no strategic plan beyond milking the multinational cash cow in the short term.  We already saw how the last Fine Gael-led Government squandered corporation tax receipts on expensive overruns, such as on the national children&rsquo;s hospital.  We need reassurance that these once-in-a-generation tax receipts will not be wasted again.  Will the Minister give guarantees that such revenues will be used solely to fund infrastructural or one-off projects, or be added to the rainy-day fund?</p>  <p>  In addition to corporation tax receipts, the summer economic statement shows bumper increases across other take headings.  It is important to note that the summer economic statement only cites earlier analysis from the spring about tax revenue projections, whereas the most recent tax figures are ahead of these projections.  In short, there will be much more tax available for spending in the budget.  Much of this increase can be accounted for by inflation.  Simply put, as prices have risen, so too have the Government&rsquo;s VAT receipts.  Budget 2023 must aim to put this tax windfall back into the pockets of those who need help the most.</p>  <p>  Last month the Minister signed off on a further extension of the 9% VAT rate for the hospitality sector.  At &euro;500 million, this will come at a significant cost to taxpayers, but what benefit will they see?  In many cases employers in this sector pay poverty wages.  Basic services through the hospitality sector such as a cup of coffee, a couple of pints, a meal or a trip to the cinema remain out of reach for most ordinary working people as prices have steadily risen.  Rather than tax breaks for big business and higher earners, budget 2023 must instead see cuts in consumption taxes for ordinary citizens.  For instance, the 9% VAT rate on electricity, which took nine months to introduce, must be retained.</p>  <p>  According to the summer economic statement, budget 2023 will focus on the cost of living with an overall package of &euro;6.7 billion.  Again, on paper, this looks impressive.  But in reality, nearly half of this, &euro;3 billion, is already committed to meet existing health, welfare and other calls on the public finances.  This leaves just &euro;2.7 billion to allocate in additional social protection, education, childcare and related spending on services.  Most of this additional spending for public services will barely keep pace with inflation.</p>  <p>  In addition, only &euro;400 million has been put aside to help people through the cost-of-living crisis to the end of the year.  To put this into context, a repeat of the &euro;200 electricity credit for all households would cost &euro;400 million alone.  While everyone acknowledges that the &euro;200 credit makes some difference, it has not gone the distance on electricity alone, never mind other utility services or cost-of-living pressures.  It shows how far the Government needs to go.</p>  <p>  We have seen Minister after Minister speculate on the return of the &euro;200 electricity payment.  This short-term political stroke will do nothing to solve the long-term problem of rising energy costs.  At this stage it should be completely ruled out in favour of more long-term sustainable measures to tackle the cost of living.  At a time of scarce resources, it is simply not acceptable that some of the richest households in the country and those with two or more homes get a &euro;200 giveaway while people who are really struggling to make ends meet get the same.</p>  <p>  Instead, Labour has proposed a &euro;200 carbon credit for families with incomes under &euro;50,000.  This would be a targeted measure to help those who need it most &ndash; working families and those on stretched incomes.  At &euro;100 million, it would only cost a fraction of the Government&rsquo;s recent energy credit.  We have proposed that the remainder be used to bring some 150,000 working households into the fuel allowance net.  This is something we are all hearing at our advice clinics.  It is incredible that in the middle of a warm summer people are coming to our advice clinics seeking to get access to the fuel allowance of all things.  It just shows the depth of the cost-of-living crisis.  Many social protection measures could and should be introduced now.</p> <p>We all know that moving the budget forward by 14 days is a tokenistic exercise.</p> <p> The Taoiseach repeated this week that we are facing a winter of discontent.  We are already living in a summer of discontent.  The reality is that hard-working families are facing into a cruel autumn beyond this difficult summer, with rising childcare and back-to-school costs and the high price of keeping food on the table.  The cost-of-living crisis is not a joke or a game for people.  It is their daily lives and lived experience.  People have their household budgets to draw up and they need certainty to plan for the autumn and winter months ahead.</p> <p> The Government should not be playing politics with people's lives.  Our social protection system is a prime example of this.  Most countries, including the UK, index welfare payments so they automatically rise with inflation.  This means that those who rely on the State for their income, whether pensioners, lone parents or people with a disability, will not be left short-changed when prices rise.  Only Ireland retains a politicised budgetary process where stability in the core income of 1.6 million people is to be begged for each year.  It is shameful that Ministers then claim credit for securing any increases that would be given as a matter of course if payments were indexed to inflation.  The Government must finally put an end to this charade and provide real certainty for those on fixed incomes.</p> <p> We must see more long-term investment in all our budgetary processes.  Today, we saw the announcement of a health facility near Alicante in Spain that will be part of a licensed arrangement with the HSE for public patients using the EU cross-border directive scheme.  I believe this initiative will be oversubscribed.  The model of healthcare provided cannot be a combination of sun, sea, an operation and a cost to the individual getting the care.  If those availing of the initiative are able to get a holiday, it will have to coincide with a much-needed, long-overdue planned procedure.  If we are building, we should be building and increasing our health capacity here.  We should be looking at primary care capacity in particular because that is where we can reduce waiting lists, diagnose people who are ill early and cure them in their communities.  While I understand the EU cross-border directive is helpful, it is not the model by which we should be paring down the waiting lists that developed during the crisis.</p> <p> On transport, we need to show a commitment to projects such as MetroLink.  I am happy to see the Cabinet has signed off on MetroLink.  We must also show that big projects such as that link in with active travel projects that are being rolled out, namely, cycle paths and better pathways for pedestrians.  This is all linked to future-proofing public infrastructure.  That is how the conversation should proceed.  MetroLink does not exist in isolation from improved cycling infrastructure and other such measures that must be and are being introduced.</p> <p> Families cannot take another summer of budget kite-flying.  They can ill afford to wait for a "spin" budget in September.  Instead, the Minister could provide real support and reassurance now with a few strokes of a pen, irrespective of whether the D&aacute;il is sitting.  The Labour Party has already indicated our desire to extend the sitting of the D&aacute;il to pass an emergency summer budget.  That discussion has been and gone, but we strongly encourage the Minister not to put off until tomorrow what he can do today.</p></speech>

The summer economic statement is a testament to how the economy has been managed in the past decade in a careful, balanced and prudent way.  The balance between taxes and expenditure and managing a prudent economy is always made up of difficult choices.  It is easy to promise everything to everyone, an approach those on the Opposition side of the House have been practising since the last election.</p>  <p>  Over the past decade, various Governments have had to have a steady hand on the tiller in order to navigate us through the major storms that have been sent our way, from the Celtic tiger collapse and the banking collapse to Brexit, the pandemic and the war in Ukraine.  These have combined with other difficult challenges, including climate change, logistics and supply chain difficulties, the Northern Ireland protocol and now inflation.  The creation of the rainy day fund allowed us the leeway to take very decisive support measures for employees and businesses in the first two months of the pandemic and that safeguarded and secured many businesses and families.  This has led to the recovery of the economy in the past year.  It is worth noting that the Government provided &euro;40 billion in support measures to citizens and businesses over the period of the pandemic.  That sum is six and a half times the total budget increase proposed for this year.</p>  <p>  While there have been significant changes in specific sectors of the labour market, the fact that there are now 2.5 million people working in Ireland out of a population of 5 million gives us a better dependency rate, which has positive long-term benefits for pension funding.  Chasing inflation is not the prudent thing to do, as was proved in the boom-and-bust years of the Celtic tiger.  As we well know, when the bust happened we had to take drastic measures at the behest of the Troika.  It is prudent that the Cabinet should have as much information available to it before drafting the support measures it will introduce in the next budget.  All independent economic commentators agree that we have kept the national finances on track over the past ten years under successive Governments and Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  This is the way we intend to continue.</p>  <p>  The worst effects of different crises have been felt by the squeezed middle.  It is for this reason that I welcome measures that were announced recently such as the proposed reduction in the cost of childcare.  I welcome other recent initiatives taken by the Government, including that tickets for school bus transport will be free for the next academic year, the increase in the back-to-school allowance and the proposed childcare package, which will assist those in the early years as part of the forthcoming budget in September.  There is no doubt that we have targeted the support measures.  In the previous budget we increased tax relief by &euro;415 for those on the average wage.  We have raised the minimum wage eight times since 2011.  We introduced the living wage to replace the minimum wage by 2026 to align those on the lowest wage with the average wage.  In 2011, unemployment was 15%.  Today, it stands at 4.7%.  In fact, we now have labour shortages in certain sectors.  I am pleased to note the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, is expanding apprenticeship schemes throughout the country over the next three years.  That is another example of prudent planning for the future.</p>  <p>  I have some points to make to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath.  Regional development must be more balanced.  One measure that would address the imbalance is to continue Shannon Airport's inclusion in the regional airports programme.  That must happen.  For the first time this year, Shannon was included in that essential programme, as was Cork Airport.  These grants are used to support the growth of both Cork and Shannon airports and to help to correct the glaring imbalance that exists whereby 83% of airline traffic goes through one airport.  I welcome the fact that the national aviation policy is to be reviewed in the autumn.  I put forward a proposal to the transport committee, which secured unanimous support, that the committee would look at this issue in detail and consult stakeholders and policymakers so that we can put together a more informed national aviation policy that can benefit the regions, including Shannon Airport.  If Shannon were to continue to be in the regional airports programme, it would free up vital revenues to enable the Shannon Group to market and develop routes and relationships with airlines.  Shannon is much more than an airport; it is an economic driver for the mid-west region.  There needs to be a focus on that in the forthcoming budget.  Transport is an area we need to target.</p>  <p>  Another significant issue in the mid-west region is University Hospital Limerick where we need additional capacity.</p><p><i>3 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>The Government has, in fairness, invested more than &euro;100 million in the hospital over the past five or six years and there is increased capacity, with additional consultants, doctors and nurses, but we need much more.  Currently, far too many people are in the emergency department and that is not acceptable.  We need to accelerate capital investment in the hospital, expand capacity and look at enhanced roles for the model 2 hospitals, Ennis Hospital, Nenagh Hospital and St. John's Hospital, which will require additional resources.  Another key issue in the mid-west relates to the provision of an elective-only hospital for the region, as proposed in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  I have raised this issue with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Health, and a group of us Government Deputies in the mid-west have been pressing for this.  I look forward to some support being forthcoming in the budget later this year for that type of initiative.</p> <p> More than half of our population have never experienced inflation of this sort, and a steady hand is needed to secure our journey through these stormy economic times.  I look forward to working with the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance to ensure the budget, which is critical at this time when people are feeling the bite of inflation and the cost of living, will be dynamic, and this summer economic statement puts us in a strong position to respond in a constructive way to address the issues we face.</p></speech>

The impact is far-reaching, and it is not just in regard to food and household bills that families are feeling the pressure.  The cost-of-living crisis is having an impact on the health and well-being of children throughout the State.  I have never had so many parents call me to outline the struggles they face to cover the costs of their children's sporting activities.  Week in, week out, parents make more and more sacrifices to provide for their children.  The cost of club fees, summer camps, swimming lessons and new boots and gear is adding to the pressure on households.  In the past, children used to go and play football in a field and come back when the tea was ready, but nowadays there is much more structure around it.  The cost of these camps is significant and it all adds up.  Even a one-week camp is significant, at &euro;200 per child.  Children are feeling the brunt of this.  Sport contributes to good health and well-being, and for children, that cannot continue to be taken for granted.</p>  <p>  We need to increase investment in sports.  Ireland has been lagging behind our European peers for too long.  Our EU peer group invests on average almost three times as much as we do on sport and recreation.  We urgently need to see real-time investment in sport and recreational facilities throughout the State.  Almost &euro;90 million in funding has been allocated through the large-scale sport infrastructure fund for projects, which is welcome, but barely a fraction of this funding has been drawn down.  Because of the rising costs of building, many of these sports facilities will struggle to reach completion.  The sporting community needs to see the Government step in and provide increased support where needed.  The costs of not investing in sports participation or increasing the levels of physical activity far outweigh the initial costs.  Physical inactivity has been estimated to cost the health budget &euro;1.5 billion each year and is responsible for an estimated 14% of all mortality in Ireland.  The benefits of sports and recreation do not stop with health and well-being.  Research by the Federation of Irish Sport has shown that for every &euro;100 invested in sport by the Government, the Exchequer receives back &euro;195 through taxes on sports-supported expenditures and incomes.  We should not look at sports and recreation as a cost but rather as an investment with far-reaching yields.</p>  <p>  On a separate issue, Debra Ireland, an advocacy group for people living with butterfly skin, or EB, made a presentation last week.  Emma Fogarty, who lives with EB, and the parent of someone living with EB made a powerful presentation.  It was difficult to hear about the impact the condition has.  Their ask for the budget, at less than &euro;1 million, would provide for nursing treatment, outreach treatment and mental health supports.  In the context of this huge budget, their ask is very small, yet it would have a significant impact on the quality of their lives.  As anybody who is familiar with EB will know, it is very difficult.  One girl who just turned 18, Claudia, is an inspiration to young people.  She is about to start on a make-up course in college.  The condition is devastating, not just for Claudia or Emma but for their entire families and the relationship between husband and wife, yet the State is not willing to intervene and give the resources this family and all the families who have children with EB need to ensure their lives will be made somewhat easier.  I beseech the Minister of State to consider them and take them into account, when the budget is being prepared, in order that Debra Ireland will have increased supports to alleviate the daily pain these families are going through.</p></speech>

It is especially regrettable given there is virtually no co-operation in respect of the budgetary process.  We have a short period today for Deputies to make statements and not a whole lot of engagement after that until budget day itself, when there is the big reveal.  There is no attempt by the Government to engage constructively, whether with Opposition parties or the many organisations working across society, to identify priorities.  That should be done on the basis of looking at the evidence and identifying priorities for what can be achieved within the budgetary space.  This is no way to do it.  It is an outdated and outmoded way of preparing a budget, rather than looking at what society needs and trying to reach a consensus on what those priorities should be.</p>  <p>  I welcome the fact we are looking at what can only be described as a strong and healthy economic situation, given the figures before us.  That is important in light of the considerable economic shocks this country has experienced in recent years, from Covid to the savage war in Ukraine, the need to respond to the considerable movement of refugees and, most of all, the impact of that war on people's living standards in this country and the soaring inflation rates, much of that driven by the high cost of energy.</p>  <p>The combination of all of those things undoubtedly raises huge challenges for the Government and for the country generally.  For that reason, it is important that we have strong headline figures.  The question is what do we do with that strong economic performance.  That is the issue because under those headline figures are people's real lives.  When we look at what is happening in this country, it is becoming increasingly unequal in the way it is structured.  There are major structural problems with regard to low incomes.  More than one fifth of workers are on low pay, and fairly miserable pay at that, with very little in terms of job security.  A whole host of people then are dependent on welfare income, yet those welfare rates are not benchmarked to any kind of standard whatsoever despite the fact that really good work has been done through the minimum essential standard of living, MESL, study and by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice regarding what people actually need in real terms to live a life with any kind of dignity.  They have done great work in that regard across a whole lot of different household types yet that research is consistently ignored.</p> <p> We have been in a situation for a number of years now where welfare rates are entirely dependent on the whim of the Minister of the day.  There are, therefore, very serious issues of inequality and structural problems.  In addition to that, of course, we have the significant Government failures with regard to inadequate public services.  That is the real world for an awful lot of people in this country who live below that strong economy.  It is fine to boast about the strong economy, which is very important, but how do we use the proceeds of that economy?  That is the key question.  The Government has clearly ignored the massive impact of those shocks that have taken place over the past couple of years on people's day-to-day lives.  Those of us on this side of the House, as well as many other groups outside of the House, have been calling over recent months for urgent action from Government and highlighting the need for an emergency budget.  That has been very clear.</p> <p> The Children's Rights Alliance yesterday set out very clearly the problem we have with growing rates of child poverty and stated clearly that the meagre steps the Government has taken over recent months do not go anywhere close to addressing the rising problem of child poverty.  In the context of us being a wealthy country, it is pretty shameful that we have rising rates of child poverty.  People are concerned about things like being able to put food on the table.  Parents worry about what will happen and how they will manage to feed their children when the schools and breakfast clubs are closed and school meals are not available.  People are really struggling to pay their bills.  That is why the Social Democrats and so many other people were calling for an emergency budget.  It should have happened.</p> <p> There is a recognition by Government that there is a need for emergency care and support in the September budget.  In principle, the Government recognises the need for it.  Why is it delaying that when people need the support now, and will undoubtedly need more support on budget day and following on from that?</p> <p> The point I am making is that in the context of those shocks the country has experienced in the last couple of years, now more than ever, there is a need to prioritise spending in the country.  We might look at the figures that have been set out in the summer economic statement.  I agree with the point that the 5% limit should be breached; that is the correct approach to take given the exceptional circumstances we are in.  We are talking about &euro;6.7 billion, however.  When we break that down, &euro;3 billion of that is already committed in terms of services and is also required to cover the whole issue of demographics in respect of an aging population and a growing child population.  There is &euro;1 billion earmarked for tax, which I will come back to in a moment.  There is &euro;400 million on measures for the last three months of this year, including pay rises.  There is &euro;2.3 billion then for new spending, of which we know a major part will be taken up by the public sector pay agreement.  As the Minister of State will know, there is already an offer on the table of &euro;1.2 billion, which has been rejected.  Even increasing that by a small amount to bring it up to &euro;1.4 billion would leave us then with &euro;900 million for spending measures.  Where does that &euro;900 million go given the level of need right across our public services?  On what basis is it thought to be a priority that &euro;1 billion be set aside for tax cuts?</p> <p> Everybody is faced with higher bills at the moment, particularly energy bills, but not everybody experiences those increases in the same way.  A large number of people in society can absorb those increases.  None of us likes paying higher costs but many of us are in the fortunate position that we can absorb those.  I will put to the Minister of State the same thing I asked the Cabinet Ministers who left the Chamber - do they honestly think they need support?  Do they think they need help in addressing and coping with inflation in their own lives on the basis of their salaries?  We have large numbers of people in the public sector generally on similar kinds of pay scales.  Do they need assistance?  Do Ministers of State need assistance?  Do many other public servants on that level of income need assistance?  I would argue absolutely not.  Do Teachta&iacute; D&aacute;la need assistance with meeting the increased costs of living?  Absolutely not.  I do not believe there is anybody in this Chamber who needs support to cope with his or her bills yet the Government is talking about tax-cutting measures that are likely to give additional money across the board to all those earning more than approximately &euro;36,800.  What on earth is the rationale for that?  There cannot be any rationale on any grounds for a measure like that.</p> <p> The kind of dog whistling we are increasingly now hearing from the T&aacute;naiste is an absolute disgrace in the context of growing child poverty in this country and the huge pressures being experienced by low-income families, of which everybody in this House is aware.  Deputies who talk to any of their constituents will know what those pressures are.  In that context, how can the Government possibly justify giving an across the board tax cut to people that will make our tax system less progressive than it is?  Does Fianna F&aacute;il agree with that kind of approach?  Does the Green Party agree with it?  It is deeply unfair and it will only have one impact, which is to make this country even more unequal than it is at the moment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.361" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1496" speakername="John McGuinness" time="14:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400037#NN00200"><p>There is no doubt that the overall economic performance of the country has stood the test of Covid-19 and the war and so on.  That is being shouldered by many of the small to medium-sized businesses that all of us know within our own constituencies.  They are, if you like, hiding the fact that they are experiencing enormous difficulties just to continue in their development and hold on to jobs.  That must be recognised.</p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, has done very well in the context of the overall national debt of &euro;240 billion.  It has borrowed long.  Its interest rates are reasonable and will appear to be even more reasonable as interest rates increase.  It continues to have &euro;30 billion in cash assets, which is a good, prudent measure and a good policy measure.</p>  <p>  There are many risks to our economy.  One of the main risks, which has been mentioned by previous speakers, is the risk of corporation tax where one in every four euro is collected and included in that corporation tax.  If we strip that &euro;6.7 billion out of the figures, we will find that all the other figures that make up our tax take are actually weaker than what we expected.  There is a real problem in terms of corporation tax and how other taxes are performing.</p> <p>That will give the true story of what is happening in the economy.  It will show the true difficulties that businesses have with regard to their performance in markets at home and abroad and paying their taxes.  I believe that is a problem that is being stored up because during the Covid-19 pandemic many businesses warehoused their tax obligations, and they will have to be paid at some stage.</p> <p> Looking at the overall economy, one can certainly put forward an argument that the policies have worked and the economy is doing well, but my measurement of all this is always to look at how the people we represent are faring.  They are not faring very well.  On a micro level, people who are elderly, who are marginalised in any way, who are sick or who are carrying debt difficulties from the past, are in serious difficulty.  That is where I want to see the moneys that will be pushed through on budget day go.  It is our responsibility to see that it goes to the weakest in society.</p> <p> Then there are the other issues, such as Sl&aacute;intecare.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council said that the Government has not costed its planned major healthcare reforms under Sl&aacute;intecare beyond this year and that there is no clarity on how much progress has been made to date in terms of the overall cost of those reforms.  Again, we have the headline figure being announced by the Department or the Minister, but when one looks from the bottom up at what the performance is like and what the outturns are, they are not very good.  All one has to do is walk through the gates of Leinster House most weeks when the House is sitting.  For example, cervical cancer sufferers made a presentation in the audiovisual, AV, room.  They have described what they are being put through in the tribunal and in the courts as barbaric.  Money is required to resolve that.  It is a crisis.  We must show compassion and deal with that issue.  It is a budgetary issue because that is where the money comes from.</p> <p> Those who are campaigning for an end to the thalidomide argument should be supported.  Instead, we are pushing them through the courts.  The Department has to provide documentation relevant to that which will cost it the best part of &euro;4 million, yet it will not turn around and resolve that issue.  It is an issue that has gone on for far too long.  As regards the Lyme disease issue, people have been outside the gates for as long as I have been a Member of the House and to this day they are not being recognised.  The laboratories in Germany are not being recognised.  They are recognised in the rest of the European Union, but apparently they are not good enough for the Irish Government.  That has to be changed.</p> <p> These are the small things at the bottom end of the scale that are causing me and the people concern.  Recently, I met three women.  Again, they were in the AV room and they met with Deputy McDonald with regard to the mesh issue and what they are facing in their daily lives relative to correcting that procedure.  It is bureaucracy gone mad.  It is insufficient money.  It is a pathway, as it is called, within health that is simply not delivering.  That has to be examined.  It is likewise with regard to mental health and therapists for those who have autism or who are on the spectrum.  They cannot get them in the schools.  It is fine for the summer statement to announce these big figures or for us to say on budget day that we are allocating billions of euro to health and millions of euro somewhere else.  However, at the bottom end of this where the money is supposed to be spent, it is not being spent.  Public service delivery has almost collapsed for those who need it most.  Many families who have children with autism come to me.  They cannot get through to the HSE about their care and where they should go.  They cannot get therapists or speech and language therapists.  Special needs assistants, SNAs, are refused.</p> <p> We had the outrageous situation in Carlow where there are two schools on the same site, being attended by students from the same families, and one has received DEIS 1 status and the other failed.  Is it a gender thing?  I do not know because the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, said to me that these are not matters that should be published.  I believe they should be published.  It should be known how that decision was made.  That, too, is about supporting families.  It is about budgetary measures and the big figures we are talking about allocating again this year.</p> <p> I have said repeatedly in this House that the mental health services are in dire straits.  In private mental health care at present one cannot get an appointment with a psychiatrist until next year.  If somebody is in a mental health situation where the health circumstances require that the person be seen right now, it is not much use telling the person that he or she will have to wait until next year.  It is the same in the public services.  However, when I raise these questions with Ministers, I am told what the big picture is and that the HSE will get back to me.  That type of politics and that type of budgetary spend are not acceptable to me.  The Taoiseach tells us that government is about getting things done.  On the bottom rung of the ladder things are not being done in a way that would satisfy the general public and that would give me at least the impression that we have public services that are being delivered correctly.  People generally are suffering because of the inefficiency within the public service and the lack of proper policy to ensure that all those services are delivered to those who need them most.</p> <p> I ask my Green Party colleagues, or the ones I know who are in the Government, please to try to inject a little common sense into their budgetary take on things.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has said, in a comment regarding greenhouse gases and so forth, that the impact on the public finances has not been fully assessed or factored into budgetary plans.  They are daft not to do that.  Everything should be factored into a budgetary plan.  Looking at agriculture and the 22% target: if it goes beyond 22% they will destroy rural Ireland.  Maybe that is their mission.  I do not know.  Certainly, in policy terms it appears to be their mission.  We have tried time and again at parliamentary party meetings of my party to explain all these issues.  The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, might ask why I am raising them here.  I am raising them here because I do not think they are heard within the parliamentary party democracy that we have.  I ask the Minister of State to tell his Green Party colleagues to lay off rural Ireland and to ensure that it is 22% and no more.  Everyone is willing to do their bit, but they are not willing to be screwed in the process for some goal that the Minister of State believes in.</p> <p> Finally, I wish to say something about democracy here.  Bills have been rushed through this House at an alarming rate, so much so that even the President has commented on it.  We do not debate them in full.  Now there is a move to restrict the length of time for pre-legislative scrutiny on many issues.  I am a member of one of the political parties, but I choose to try to change it from within.  I may not be successful, but I will not stop trying.</p></speech>

I have on occasion appealed to the Ceann Comhairle to reach out and give the Members the right to speak.  We are being deprived of the right from within a political party.  That is a sad thing to say but it is true on this side of the House.  That we are in a three-party coalition makes it even more difficult.  I have to gain every opportunity I can to take debates like this and to put on the record of the House the demand for change.

While the summer economic statement may paint a rosy picture, when you listen to those matters raised, you hear of all the various issues throughout the country that are affecting people.  These are the issues of services mainly that are so devoid in so many areas throughout the country.  While summary statistics may paint a certain picture, they often hide the reality for so many people.  That is what we recognise in this debate.</p>  <p>  A number of issues need to be dealt with in the justice area in the upcoming budget.  There are significant delays in the courts service and courts system that are causing much anxiety and problems for many people, particularly in the family court service but indeed in all the court services.  There needs to be an emphasis in the budget to make sure resources are put in place to alleviate that.  That is one of the issues that needs to be dealt with.</p>  <p>  In regard to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the numbers of garda&iacute;, community garda&iacute; is a real issue for people throughout the country, especially in urban areas where we have high crime statistics.  That needs to be dealt with.</p>  <p>  On the broader stuff, the issue of us having these bumper corporation tax receipts has been talked of as a potential problem down the road.  The issue is that a small number of large corporations are producing a large section of that taxation.  We have no difficulty with that.  We need to see those corporations pay their proper share of taxation, which they had not done for a very long time, an issue we have all recognised and which is possibly one of the reasons they are now starting to pay a little closer to the proper rate of 12.5%, which they were supposed to have been paying up to now.  That said, I understand a large portion of that is down to intellectual property and issues around that, which is something that may end in the future.</p>  <p>  That tells us the Government needs to have another plan and not for us to put all our eggs in the one basket of foreign direct investment, FDI, as the means to deliver for our economy.  It should also build another economy, our domestic economy, particularly in our regions and in the region I come from, the north west, where we have significant problems with infrastructure and investment and which we need to see the Government step up to the mark and provide for.  That can only happen if the Government has a commitment to do that.  In the national development plan and all of the furore that was around it, we saw great plans put in place but, unfortunately, for many people in the north west in particular and in many other parts of the country, we have seen very little delivery.  We hope this budget will address that.</p>  <p>  The issue we are most critical of at this time is the cost-of-living problem.  So many people are finding it so difficult to manage and the Government is so slow to react to it.  There has to be a commitment by the Government to deliver for the people who are at the base of our economy, who are working hard, who are doing everything they can to pay their way and who find it so difficult.  When they look to the Government for assistance, they have up until now got very little.  I will pass on to my colleague.</p></speech>

It is a matter of the services that are not being dealt with.  It is a matter of failures over many years, such as CervicalCheck, thalidomide and women dealing with the mesh issue.  It is a matter of disability services and mental health services.  We are all dealing with the issues of no psychologists, no psychiatrists, no consultants, no special needs assistants, SNAs, no speech and language therapists, SLTs, and no occupational therapists, OTs.  The preparatory work has not been done to ensure we have the throughput for training, that the people are in place and that we can deliver the service.  We go round and round the garden and we do not get to the place we need to be.</p>  <p>  We can talk about glorious figures and all the rest of it.  I will not even go through what Sinn F&eacute;in or anybody else called for here in relation to an emergency budget.  We all realise people are under severe, significant pressure at this time.  The Government has said it is not going down the road we would have liked it to go, and it has put all its eggs in the basket of the budget.  We need to ensure that budget delivers for people because they are under severe strain.  We can talk about inflation rates, but everybody knows this is not about the figure of 9.6%.  It is about the cost of putting fuel in your car.  It is about the cost of paying your electricity bill.  It is about the cost of childcare and housing.  These are the original sins we brought to party in this State.  These are the problems we did not deal with and everyone has to deal with in society.  Until we deal with those issues, we will have a cost-of-living crisis no matter what the international situation.  The Government cannot do everything, but it can definitely do more.  The pressure is going to be on and it will have deliver in this budget.</p></speech>

It is a cynical tactic.  It shows contempt both for this House and for the people.  Some of us have protested very strongly at the Business Committee about this.  Unfortunately, however, the Business Committee is not a democracy and the Government does what it likes.</p>  <p>  The Government has shown further contempt for this House and, far more importantly, for hundreds of thousands of workers, students, pensioners, low- and middle-income households by failing to take serious measures to protect them from the crushing cost-of-living crisis and the housing and homelessness crisis that are imposing terrible suffering on people at the moment, by going off on this summer recess without taking serious emergency measures to address that, and then, today, not even having the respect to stay for two hours for the last opportunity Deputies have to present the concerns, hardships and difficulties people are facing before the budget.  It is utterly disrespectful.</p> <p>It is why I am very glad that the Cost of Living Coalition, which is a coalition of pensioners, students, trade unionists, single parents groups, Travellers groups and so on, has named the date for what I hope will be a massive national demonstration to put manners on this Government on Saturday, 24 August 2022.  When the Government shows that level of disrespect where not only does it not take measures to respond to a dire cost of living and housing crisis, but it will not even stay to listen to those who are trying to present those concerns on the last day of the D&aacute;il term, the only answer is people power.  We had to do the same on water charges to get people out on the streets.  I sincerely hope that tens of thousands take to the streets to send that message to this Government before it makes the final decisions on budget 2023.  When workers, pensioners and students have effectively had their incomes and wages cut by 10%, because that is what inflation means, people are being made poorer.  In fact, the less well-off people are, the poorer they are made because the cost of living increases in energy, heating, electricity, petrol, food, diesel and housing disproportionately hurt the people who are least able to deal with them.  We, and people on the streets, will be demanding that as an absolute minimum the Government inflation-proofs people's incomes and that we see wages, pensions, student grants, social welfare benefits, disability payments, fuel allowances, living alone increases, child benefit and all of the things that potentially keep people out of poverty - although many people are being driven into poverty - increased at least to the level of inflation.  Many of those who are denied supports because their income is marginally above income thresholds and are driven over a cliff when their income goes over those thresholds.  They get no support.</p> <p> I am absolutely furious that this Government has broken its promise to review the social housing income thresholds.  It promised that there would be an announcement on that before the summer break.  It has gone off without doing so.  As the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, pointed out, ten years ago 47% of households in this country were entitled to social housing and social housing support.  People were lucky to get a council house, but at least they might get some financial support through HAP and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS.  The number has dropped from 47% to 33%, a massive stealth cut.  Working people who could not afford the extortionate rents and house prices used to get at least some financial support from the State.  That has been slashed.  The Government has done nothing, even though it has been sitting on the review of that for five years now.  The review was published in December 2021, yet the Government will show us the results.  It is a nasty, nasty stealth cut.  There are issues with all sorts of other thresholds.  This week I raised the case of a former An Post worker, now a pensioner, who is getting a semi-State pension.  That is all he gets.  He is living below the official CSO poverty line.  He is not entitled to fuel allowance, a living alone increase or the household benefits package.  It is absolutely disgusting.  Those thresholds need to be raised for people who need help more than ever.  They were struggling before this cost of living crisis, but now they are being absolutely crucified and many of them are being denied any support at all.  For those who are getting support, it is totally inadequate.  In reality, the income they receive and supports they are getting are worth 10% less than they were previously, if not more.</p> <p> On the housing crisis, here is a proposal.  This is where I am really furious.  No disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, but he is the Minister of State with responsibility for heritage and electoral reform.  What on earth is he doing taking this debate rather than the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform?  Really, I am talking to the officials, who hopefully will pass on some proposals.  One of the main narratives that the Government has come out with is to say that we have all this extra corporate tax revenue, but we cannot spend it because it is not a sustainable source of revenue, that it is vulnerable to possible changes and we cannot actually use it to shield people from the cost of living and housing crisis that is absolutely crushing them.  I have a suggestion on a sustainable way to spend that money and simultaneously address the crisis.  The Government should use that money to buy up the empty properties that are lying around the country.  According to CSO estimates, there are 35,000 rental properties and 45,000 houses that are sitting there empty when we are facing the worst housing and homelessness crisis in the history of the State.  Buy them.  It is a good investment, not a dangerous investment.  It would add to the capital stock and housing stock, it would potentially reduce the amount spent on HAP payments and it would be a State asset.  It would be an asset for the State when we have some of the lowest levels of social housing provision in Europe.  The proportion of our housing stock that is social housing is 9%.  The figures for Austria and Denmark are 25% and 19%, respectively.  It is important for people in this country to know that all of Europe is being affected by the Ukrainian crisis and is seeing some increases in the cost of living and the cost of housing, but we are far worse off than anywhere else because we have a lower proportion of social housing, because we do not have the rent controls that they have in most of the rest of Europe and because most of the rest of Europe index-links social welfare payments, pensions and so on so they are shielded against the impact of inflation and cost of living increases.  Do not hide behind the Ukrainian crisis.</p> <p> Electricity prices in his country are 26% higher than the EU average.  Housing and utility prices are 78% higher than the EU average.  Rents in this country have gone up 70% in the last ten years and 19% in the last two years.  In the rest of Europe over the last ten years rents have gone up by 13%, a fraction of what has happened here.  There is something fundamentally dysfunctional.  It is a key point about the cost of living and housing crises that while huge numbers of workers, students and pensioners are suffering, some people are gaining.  For some people, it is not a crisis, it is a bonanza.  It is a bonanza for the investment funds, the vulture funds, the energy companies, the big food distribution companies and the property speculators.  They are making a fortune.  Yet, this Government will not even contemplate some redistributive taxes or windfall taxes.  Even the Johnson government was willing, albeit under pressure, to have windfall taxes to redistribute some of the super profits being made by these corporations to protect ordinary people from a crushing cost of living and housing crisis.</p></speech>

It is a debate.  I think it is extraordinary that we have come to the stage in this House that terms such as big companies in the food sector, big companies in the ICT sector or big companies in the energy sector should become terms of abuse.</p> <p>This is how we sometimes regard these companies, which have created between them the economic success we have enjoyed over the past decade, having come from a difficult position.  They are now regarded as pariahs in this country.  The truth is that many of those enterprises that receive so little attention and are treated with contempt in this House by the Opposition are the companies that have restored our economic sovereignty and have brought us back to a position where we have 2.5 million people employed and under 5% unemployment.  The truth is, which it is not popular to hear in the House it seems, that unless we have enterprise success married with social progress and environmental sustainability, we are going to fail future generations.  Many Members come into this House focus solely on the perceived and, indeed, real deficiencies in our public services, but we will not be able to deliver improved public services without the robust arteries of a strong food sector led by internationally competitive companies, a strong energy sector and a strong ICT sector.  These are the arteries that underpin any successful economy in this world of ours.  We then have the derision with which the Opposition treats those companies.</p> <p> I was privileged to work with those companies at a time the economy was on its knees.  They sought new markets, found new ways of solving problems and have generated very strong tax revenues for us.  We are now in a position where we can use those moneys now to address what is an unprecedented global challenge.  We must pay some attention to the difficulties these companies are facing, both small and large.  We have rising interest rates, supply bottlenecks that are very real, and economic difficulties in many of their key markets.  Those companies that are treated with such derision in this House are the backbone of this country and we have to ensure in this coming budget that we support and make sure they can continue to thrive in very difficult circumstances.</p> <p> I am a long time in this House and I have witnessed the difficult times.  I have seen the havoc that has been created for small, ordinary people who have borne the brunt of political mistakes when they have been made.  Members who come into this House and find only fault with the public service and look to enterprise as some pariah that should pay more miss the point.  We need to have those forces in harness and, especially with the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, in the Chamber, I emphasise that environmental sustainability is a third pillar of that stool.  We will not have the sort of society we want unless we can get those three pillars together: enterprise success, environmental sustainability and social progress, which can be framed by the former.</p> <p> One of the other realities that emerges from the summer economic statement, which must be taken to heart, is that we cannot compensate everyone for the losses in income that have occurred as a result of the vast amounts we have to transfer abroad to pay higher commodity and energy prices.  That is the sad reality.</p> <p> Let us consider what is happening in other countries.  Germany is now considering fuel rationing and it is debating how it will choose between keeping homes warm and keeping their industries going.  That is the reality of the world we are living in.  Members who say that this is a bottomless pool of money that the State should have to compensate everyone for the impact of the changes are deceiving the people.  We have to be very careful and cautious in this budget and to look to where people are struggling and ensure that we support them.  We also have to make sure that the decisions we make are ones that are resilient for the long term.  It is not just about this year but the years ahead that will make certain that we can pass a strong society to the generations that will come after us.</p> <p> I appeal to the Ministers to consider one priority above all else in the budget, which is to have a national resilience programme.  Many opportunities could be seized to deliver shallow retrofits quickly, not just to the 500,000 houses that we hope to address over the coming decade, but to the 2 million households around the country, many of which are not protected by even basic retrofits or basic smart controls to allow them to cut down on their heat use.  Some 1 million homes have smart meters and they are not being utilised because of general data protection regulation restrictions requiring people to opt in instead of arranging for opt out.  </p> <p> We are not developing the sharing platforms that could reduce our reliance on private motoring and private car ownership.  We are not delivering the infrastructure to allow people to switch to electric vehicles which immediately ceases our dependence on electric vehicles.  We are not taking seriously our commitment to halve food waste.  Such waste is worth &euro;700 for every household in the country.  We are not helping people to make the switches between providers where well over &euro;2,000 can be saved by helping people to switch or by changing the regulatory environment to make it more obligatory for the various suppliers to tell consumers that they are on higher payment plans than they need to be.</p> <p> We must hold strong to an approach that recognises that we need mixed economy solutions to all of our challenges and not to pretend that the State is almighty and does not need the private sector to deliver success.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.390" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1481" speakername="Cormac Devlin" time="15:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400041#RR00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to examine the summer economic statement.</p>  <p>  Clearly, we have a challenging period ahead.  The Government was not found wanting when it came to supporting incomes, jobs and enterprise during the Covid-19 pandemic.  People recognise that the pandemic was handled reasonably well.  However, the increased cost of living is having an impact on their standard of living.  Inflation has moved beyond energy prices and is now impacting core inflation rates.  The budget needs to be framed with this in mind.   We need to see an increases to social welfare and pension rates to match that of core inflation rates.  These costs are unlikely to reduce over the medium to long term.  Core inflation is running at about 4%, so we need to see a &euro;10 to &euro;15 per week increase in social welfare rates.  </p>  <p>  Energy costs are a slightly different matter.  They may fall back next year or over the medium term if the war in Ukraine ends or as we shift to more renewable energies.  However, this winter the cost of energy will be a major factor, particularly in Dublin were most households use natural gas.  Wholesale gas prices are up to three times 2021 rates.  If they stay at this level, people will be looking at significant energy bills.   </p>  <p>  It is disappointing in many respects that more was not done over the summer to prepare Ireland for the winter.  Many of us in this House called for a national effort to insulate homes ahead of the winter.  I have raised the need half a dozen times or more to provide solar panels for people with high energy use, for instance, those with medical needs, to help to defray some of the costs.  Unfortunately, I have no progress to report.  This window is rapidly closing and I ask the Minister and his colleagues in the various Departments to step in to provide significant support for those vulnerable households over the coming months.</p>  <p>  The fuel allowance should be topped up by way of a temporary enhancement.  We need eligibility expanded and a second band introduced for people earning slightly above the current eligibility limits.  Pensioners with a modest private pension and people on carer's allowance also need to be looked after.  The eligibility threshold for carer&rsquo;s allowance needs to be increased and a second band created to support working families.  These families are at the pin of their collar and do not have the capacity to make ends meet.  Even a second band with a half payment for households that are slightly above the income threshold would offer some relief to them.  If this cannot be done, perhaps the criteria can be loosened for appeals.  We need progress in this regard.  It is not possible for many carers to seek other income opportunities. </p>  <p>  I welcome the recent allocation of funding to increase the back to school clothing and footwear allowance by &euro;100.  This will give families some relief as they prepare to return to school.  Again, this is something I have called for in the recent past.</p>  <p>  There will need to be a significant tax package in budget 2023.  The relatively high rates of income tax for people with middle incomes needs to be addressed.  These households are struggling to deal with the cost of inflation.</p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>Tax relief in the form of adjustments to the tax bands is badly needed.  It is ridiculous that people are being pushed into the higher 40% bracket with earnings of just &euro;36,800.  The equivalent in the UK is &pound;50,271.  I would favour some relief on USC or PRSI bands to ensure they are indexed for workers on lower incomes so they are no worse off.   Others have mentioned health and education.  I will not repeat what has been said, other than to support the temporary uplift in grants to deal with energy costs.  We also need to closely examine pre-budget submissions from groups such as the Irish Cancer Society, Age Action and Alone to ensure their reasonable policy suggestions are given adequate consideration in advance of budget 2023.  </p> <p> The budgetary position for Ireland is relatively positive.   I agree with many of Deputy Bruton's comments regarding the outlook for the budget and the expectation around the preparation for it.  We expect to run a surplus and there is scope to manage things well.  We need to be prudent and focused about what we target and where we target resources.  I favour changes tied to core inflation rates with generous but focused emergency uplifts to help people deal with those energy costs.  The focus must be on working families, pensioners, carers, workers on modest incomes and peoples on the margins.</p></speech>

Never in the history of the State have we had as large a sum of public money to disburse.  It is &euro;85.8 billion next year, up 6.5% on last year.  With that also, never has our national debt been higher.  It is &euro;241 billion.  Now we are talking real money.  This whopping number is double the national debt at the end of 2011, which stood at &euro;119 billion.</p><p>As before, a lot of public resources will be wasted in the mismanagement of that expenditure.  I point the Minister of State to<i>The Irish Times</i>yesterday where the HSE announced an agreement to bring orthopaedic patients to Alicante to a new hospital built for &euro;60 million, and how that compares to our dysfunctional procurement of the national children's hospital, now approaching &euro;2 billion.  No one knows how this poly-crisis affecting the global economy will unfold but in this country we had better hope and pray we have seen the worst of it because we are running out of wriggle room in the coming years if it gets any worse.  </p><p>This Government, like all previous Governments, is all too quick to spend its way out of the early stages of a crisis.  Have we not learned anything from the national nightmares of past years, all of which started with domestic financial indiscipline?  Have we learned nothing from our past over-reliance on an unstable tax base?  In the past, it was stamp duty from construction activity.  Today it is corporate tax from foreign direct investment, FDI.  Why is there a real unwillingness to tackle competitiveness and productivity issues in our economy, particularly in our mollycoddled professions of medicine, construction, finance, insurance, retail and law?  Of course we would need measures to support the most vulnerable in the cost-of-living crisis but much more needs to be done to tackle the root cause of inflation in our competitive sectors.</p><p>We need to fix our own house before seeking the help of the international debt markets or the kindness of strangers, or implementing aggressive corporate tax strategies.  These do much damage to our international reputation for being a well-managed economic partner.</p><p>Regarding the announced summer economic statement, the Government is signalling that it is keeping all people happy all of the time.  It is now a magic money tree whose aspiration is to deliver a package that works to protect the long-term wellness of our economy and society but at significant cost.  Not only is the Government spending fecklessly, we cannot see where the money goes.</p><p>I had two clarifying exchanges in the D&aacute;il last week.  In the first, the T&aacute;naiste confirmed that he shares my view that the data in the summer economic statement is inadequate to allow D&aacute;il oversight.  When I put it to him that this was to give Cabinet members a free hand to support their own pet projects, largely in Cork and Dublin, the home constituencies of almost all senior Ministers, he could not refute my point using any data.  In the summer economic statement we get again foggy sentiment rather than hard data and nothing like the proper granular data on public spending that we need, in particular on capital projects, as are available to every other OECD parliament.  This feeds the practical sense that vast parts of Ireland, particularly the north east and west, midlands and our region of the south east, are frozen out of a fair share of capital spending.  We see the money going in.  It is &euro;87 billion this year, &euro;12 billion of which is going on capital projects.  Of this &euro;12 billion, the south east should get &euro;1 billion and Waterford should get &euro;300 million.  With the data available to me, I estimate the south east got just &euro;330 million, one third of its due.</p><p>The second clarifying discussion I had was with the Taoiseach on the recent vote of confidence.  In exchange for durable and reliable support for the Government in the current and next semesters, I asked for nothing more than concrete delivery on the regional priorities committed to in the programme for Government and reiterated<i>ad nauseam </i>by Cabinet members.  Priorities in acute healthcare, education and transport are what I sought.  I asked the Taoiseach to provide political hope to the south east that some or any of our priorities would advance.  I was not gauche enough to raise any specific project.  I simply asked him to point to something positive in the works for the region, anything that was aligned with Government policy and regional priorities.  I am sad to say that nothing could be identified.</p><p>I am repeatedly on the record of the House seeking explicit advancement of regional rather than constituency priorities.  I will likely be asked to vote for the budget in the coming months, despite Government being unable to show any project in the works for the south east or any advance on the capital for the region's acute healthcare or capital investment in our higher education or infrastructure.  All this in a region equating to 10% of the country.  A billion euro here, a billion euro there and nothing like the &euro;1 billion that is its fair share for the south-east region.</p><p>The future will tell if this summer economic statement was a macroeconomic mistake or a lost opportunity to get our house in order before further international hardship bites.  However, it is clear, and the T&aacute;naiste agrees, that it is a technically flawed presentation of our State's financial circumstances.  We have the sizzle but are missing the sausage.  We have engaging oratory and unengaged data.  Along with that, our Taoiseach has made clear it holds nothing for the south-east region.  Perhaps that is a shortcoming that can be addressed but the clock is counting down.  If this summer economic statement is a requiem to celebrate the past two and a half years of the present D&aacute;il's tenure, it is obvious that the snuff of this wake was and is reserved solely for Dublin and Cork consumption.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, this year's statement has not provided any certainty to households struggling with the immediate effect of the cost-of-living crisis and serious questions surround the credibility of some of the figures published.  It offers little hope to households struggling with the soaring cost of living this summer, as workers and families face increasing energy bills and food prices and a drop in living standards.  What was needed was an immediate emergency budget before summer recess.  These families cannot face a wait of eight weeks for the D&aacute;il to return from the summer recess or a ten-week wait for the budget announcements that may not be implemented until next year. </p>  <p>  We learned this morning that prices rose by 9.1% in the year to June 2022, the largest increase in 38 years.  In answer to a parliamentary question from my colleague, an Teachta Doherty, the Minister for Finance confirmed that the summer economic statement was framed with the assumption of an inflation rate of 7% to 8%.  What provision has been made for contingency if this is the situation and if it worsens further?  On the subject of contingency, this Government often blames unforeseen events for poor performance, yet we have a lack of clarity on plans to contribute to a rainy day fund.  Government Members often talk about the pensions time bomb, but we have no clarity on plans to top up the National Pensions Reserve Fund.</p> <p>This uncertainty only adds to the stress and anxiety of workers and families who are struggling with rising prices and poor public services in the here and now.  This week, we saw that Spain, having cut the cost of public transport by half, has now made train journeys of less than 300 km free of charge.  Why does the Government not consider radical proposals such as this, which would make sense from a climate action point of view as well as a cost-of-living perspective?  We have seen what is called an anti-inflation shield in Poland.  The VAT rate on food, gas and fertiliser has been cut to 0%, the rate on electricity and heating has been cut to 5% and the rate on fuel has been cut to 8%.  Why has the Government not done something similar here?  </p> <p> The Government could take decisive action that would have an immediate effect on inflation and relieve the pressure on families, farmers and hauliers but it chooses to fiddle while Rome burns.  Deputy Bruton spoke about companies.  Many farmers and hauliers operate as small companies and are struggling to keep their employees paid and supplied with work.  We need to address the cost of diesel, insurance and so on as well.</p> <p> It seems that every week one of the energy companies announces a price hike despite the fact that we are told we are producing vast amounts of electricity from wind turbines and have gas coming from the Corrib fields and the UK interconnector.  At this stage, it looks like price gouging.  We all know that is what is going on.  What action will the Government take to address this massive contributory factor to inflation?  Will it consider a windfall tax on energy profits?  I suspect it will not because the lobbyists would not like that.  With the Uber leaks and the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2022, we have seen that this Government exists to keep lobbyists happy.</p> <p> There are also serious questions surrounding the summer economic statement.  The Government has provided no allocation for increases in public sector pay.  Mr. Sebastian Barnes of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council told the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach yesterday that full costings on actions to meet climate targets and deliver Sl&aacute;intecare had not been provided by the Government.  The allocation to fund the existing level of services remains unchanged from last year.  This is despite the budget watchdog recently warning that these costs will increase as a result of inflation.  As a result, we do not know what funding is available for new measures to improve public services, to deliver additional affordable housing and to increase social welfare rates in response to inflation.  </p> <p> Workers and families needed certainty that the Government would act immediately to support them in the face of a cost-of-living crisis this summer.  They did not get that certainty from the summer economic statement.  Workers and families needed clarity and certainty about budget 2023 and whether it will deliver in the core areas of housing, health, childcare and education.  They did not get that either.  </p> <p> Last week, representatives of the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, attended a meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, of which I am a member.  One of the things that stood out was the mention of the lack of statistical information and the need to invest in the Central Statistics Office, CSO.  We are not measuring properly.  We cannot plan properly to address these issues.  This is a basic requirement and this issue needs to be addressed.  In speaking on that, the ESRI told us that it was approximately a year behind with its statistics.  That is not solely due to Covid.  We need to address all of those issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.396" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1480" speakername="Jennifer Carroll MacNeill" time="15:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400043#TT00200"><p>It is welcome to work within a budgetary structure in which we have a measured opportunity to reflect on income tax, the current economic position, the challenges the country faces and the necessary and appropriate budgetary responses.  I always welcome the process of the summer economic statements and the autumn statements because it shows a State that is thinking, planning and reflecting on the challenges it faces and the information that is coming to it in an open and transparent way.  Looking back over the last ten years, it can be seen how the budgetary process has evolved.  While it is very dull and a bit of an anorak subject, this process has developed into one of the responsible, mature and evolved political institutions that are a hallmark of a developed, democratic and mature state.  It sets out the reality of the need to protect the centre and where our income tax is coming from and the conditions associated with that.</p>  <p>  There is a lot of discussion in this House of a failed state.  There is a narrative that Ireland has failed in many different ways.  There are glib attacks on those in the middle ground who create enterprise and take risks and on those who work and pay tax and who do not receive any State supports.  There is a constant contempt for enterprise and, it seems, for those who work in it despite how dependent we are on enterprise for job creation.  Over recent years, more than 700,000 jobs have been created by enterprise.  They were not created by Government.  Government creates the conditions for jobs to be created and only that.  It can just as easily undo that and take away the conditions in which jobs and enterprises are created.  </p>  <p>  We have to ask a basic question because I never hear the answer from the Opposition benches.  Do Opposition Deputies want to create and protect jobs - yes or no?  Are they interested in creating, protecting and maintaining jobs - yes or no?  Is that something they are interested in, because I never hear that?</p>  <p>  Deputy Patricia Ryan was correct to mention agriculture and small enterprise.  They are a part of what we are talking about when we talk about jobs.  On income tax cuts, I was challenged by Deputy Mac Lochlainn who suggested they were tax cuts for the rich.  They were tax cuts for middle-income earners, which the Deputy voted against.  Are those in the Opposition interested in creating and maintaining jobs?  I remember when the unemployment rate was at 15% and 16%.  I remember, as I am sure Deputies across the House do, the social impact on families of job losses and the effects of emigration.  There is no mention in this populist narrative of how emigration has been reversed and how enterprises have been able to create jobs.  Again, while Government creates the conditions, it is enterprises that create the jobs.</p>  <p>  In that same time, we have increased the minimum wage, begun moving to a living wage and substantially increased the supports available to employees of all different organisations.  I refer to sick pay, the retention of tips and different types of leave for different social situations, including miscarriage.  These are all important and all welcome but none of them matter if you do not have a job against which to bench them.  </p>  <p>  These are meaningless words at a time of full employment but we have seen how volatile the economy can be and how volatile geopolitics has been.  The key watchword in the summer economic statement is "uncertainty".  The near-term fiscal outlook is highly uncertain; of course it is when we consider what has happened in the last five years, never mind the last two.  On the upside, we have been surprised by certain tax revenues but we have full notice that corporate tax, in particular, is uncertain and that we cannot build an economy or society upon it.  We have to take the steps we can to preserve and protect that rather than steps to tax it and make the returns worse.</p>  <p>  Those who work in the private sector should lean in and listen beyond the rhetoric.  They should ask what are political parties saying about their jobs and their pay.  Sinn F&eacute;in, for example, proposes four separate tax measures related to jobs worth nearly &euro;1 billion.  This includes a change to employers' PRSI.  That is a tax on jobs.  What does it even mean?  It means fewer jobs, less risk-taking by employers and it being more expensive to create a job with the pot of revenue employers have available to pay incomes.  It does not mean any sort of increase.</p>  <p>  Do we want to pay a salary and keep people out of poverty - yes or no?  Are we happy to take steps on tax to keep people out of social welfare bands?  You cannot say, as some Deputies do, that people must be kept out of poverty while also voting against and complaining about tax cuts that attempt to do exactly that for workers.  Some Deputies claim to represent workers but they do not represent workers who pay tax and to whom we want to give indexation so that they pay less tax and have a better opportunity to stay out of poverty.  These might be policy inconsistencies but they mean real things for real people.  Despite this, we only ever hear rhetoric and glib attacks on enterprise and tax cuts.  However, these measures are targeted at keeping people in well-paid jobs, genuinely improving the conditions for people in jobs and making sure they take home as much of their pay, which they need more than ever because of the increase in the cost of living, as possible.  That is really important.  </p>  <p>  My priority and that of Fine Gael in preparing for budget 2023 is maintaining conditions in a highly volatile and uncertain world so that we can retain employment and continue to attract employment because we know what an important social and economic measure that is.</p> <p>It is about making work pay and making sure people, particularly those on middle incomes who are so caught and pressed due to not receiving State supports, are offered the chance to take home more of their pay.  Those are the things that are most important to my party, and to me, and I look forward to the budget that delivers on them.</p></speech>

In recent weeks, many people across the country have seen the extraordinary and cynical attempt by the Opposition, and more so Sinn F&eacute;in, to undermine the public's confidence in our Government.  Listening to some of the rhetoric we have had to listen to over the past fortnight, you would think this country was on the verge of bankruptcy, that there are masses of people not in employment and that everything the State is doing is wrong.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  We have one of the lowest levels of unemployment in the world, our quality of life is among the highest in the world and we have one of the largest GDP ratios <i>per capita </i>in the world.  Ireland is one of the best places to live or grow up in and has one of the highest standards of living on the planet.  We have to put ourselves on that footing, backed up by statistics, which often do not suit the narrative of Sinn F&eacute;in.  The reality is that this is a wonderful place to live.</p></speech>

We are facing unprecedented uncertainty, which has driven large increases in interest rates.  The euro and the dollar are on par for the first time in 20 years, which is going to cause more difficulty as we head into the winter.  We are facing an energy security crisis, facing up to the reality that Ireland does not have enough gas to fuel our economy and we do not produce our own oil.  These are challenges the Government will have to face up to and deal with.  They will impact on every aspect of our society and economy.  The reactionary nonsense of an emergency budget in response to everything that is going on is utterly contrary to the economic realities the Government has to face and what is responsible.</p>  <p>  A lot of people, particularly those who work in our economy and in business, now have concrete reassurance that Sinn F&eacute;in has no idea how to handle the public finances.  We need to be responsible in what we do with taxpayers' money.  It is all about giving this or giving that and paying out more money here, there and everywhere.  Nobody ever asks a question in this House about what we take in order to do that.  I get the impression from the Opposition that one can keep lumping taxes on people who work hard in order to pay for more supports.  However, that does harm to the economy because somebody has to pay the VAT we need to keep it going.  Increasing corporation tax causes significant issues when it comes to attracting foreign direct investment, an area in which we are global leaders.  Where are Sinn F&eacute;in's solutions to all the economic promises it has made?  The business community in Ireland does not see those solutions either.  That is a worry.  The economy is a fundamental part of keeping society going.</p>  <p>  We are an open, free, democratic country.  Our economy has had unrivalled success over the last four decades.  We have brought ourselves out of poverty to become world leaders in enterprise and trade.  That is something we need to be proud of but, more important, it needs to be protected.  There is  a very dangerous political narrative developing in Ireland as the Opposition is sowing the seeds of hopelessness about Ireland's place in the world.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  It is about time members of the Government stood up and outlined that to the Opposition.</p>  <p>  I am not saying everything is perfect.  We should also outline the significant challenges and areas we need to improve upon.  At a recent party meeting, I spoke about increasing supports for people who want to get their first home.  In the situation we now find ourselves in, where there are unfortunately extremely high rents and record levels of foreign investment in domestic property, the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform need to grab the bull by the horns and tell the Central Bank that the tens of thousands of well-educated, young working professionals who want to buy their first home must be shown leniency when it comes to the deposit requirement.  People say 0% deposit mortgages are a bad idea but for somebody's first home, separating it out from investment property, there should be some degree of leniency shown.  These people have been renting for five or six years at extraordinarily high rents and in the majority of cases those rents are significantly higher than mortgage payments over a 25-year or 30-year period.  That is something the Government needs to look at.  If we do not do that, the social contract of getting an education, working hard, saving money and making the correct financial decisions in order to purchase a home, with which we have had so much success, will be broken.  We need to do more work to protect it because it is at risk at the moment.  That is something the Government needs to take on the chin.  We are getting it wrong at the moment and more work needs to be done, alongside the record investment in the area of housing to increase supply.</p>  <p>  I wanted to relay that message.  I do not have a monopoly on talking about issues facing younger people but young prospective first-time buyers are to the pin of their collar in places like Cork and Dublin.  That is something I would like the Government to look at ahead of the next budget.  I also recognise the very positive work that has been done to shepherd our economy through Covid-19 and now through a war and record levels of inflation.  That needs proper management and we have had that for the last two and a half years, despite what the Deputies opposite wish to tell us.</p></speech>

The Government did not get things right.  With its record on housing, health and childcare, it has got them completely wrong.  Another Deputy a few minutes ago talked about uncertainty.  I will tell both Deputies about uncertainty.  Sinn F&eacute;in Deputies know low and middle-income families as well.  The Government does not have not a monopoly on these kinds of people.  We know them.  They come to our offices as well.  They cannot afford to put food on the table.  They are sleeping in cars, under the Government's watch.  Fine Gael has been in power since 2011 and Fianna F&aacute;il since 2016, whether it likes it or not, with the confidence and supply agreement.  It is now two years in government.  Do not start preaching to us on this side of the House and telling us we have not put forward solutions.  We have brought forward solutions but the Government refuses to take them on board.  When suggestions are made by Deputies on this side of the House it rejects them, week after week.  That is the only thing the Government has done on a continuous basis and it is not working.  Look at the figures and the way homelessness has gone up.  People cannot pay rent.  Families with two jobs cannot pay rent.  They are struggling with childcare, which is another mortgage.  Please do not start preaching to us over here that we do not know what is going on.  We have these people coming to our doors and into our offices as well.</p>  <p>  The consumer price index published this morning confirmed that the annual rate of inflation was 9.1% up to June, the largest increase in 38 years, when an annual inflation rate of 9.7% was recorded in the second quarter of 1984.  When those figures are broken down, the largest increases were recorded in the costs of housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, which rose by 22.5%, and in transport, which rose by 20.4%.  Looking even further into those figures, we can see where people need particular help.  The cost of electricity, influenced by the headline figures I have just referred to, has risen by 40.9%.  The cost of gas has soared by 57.2%, while the cost of home heating oil has skyrocketed by an astonishing 115.4%.  The pressure on households and businesses across this country is immense and it is hitting poor, rural and lone parent families the hardest.  Carers and families who have to run electricity-hungry medical equipment for their ill or disabled family members have always been left behind by the Government.  That tradition has unfortunately not been addressed either.</p>  <p>  I have spoken to the Minister of State about this and I have represented a number of these families since being elected to this House.  They feel forgotten about.  They get up early in the morning as well.  Deputy Carroll MacNeill and the T&aacute;naiste keep talking about people who get up early in the morning.  These are people who get up early in the morning as well to go to work and they are still struggling under this Government's watch.  It is a sad fact that as we speak one in three households lives in energy poverty.  This significant portion of society is struggling to make ends meet.  While the Government claims to have introduced over &euro;2 billion worth of measures to support households since budget 2021, this misrepresents the level of support these lower income households have actually experienced.</p> <p>The &euro;500 million social welfare package last October saw social welfare rates rise by 2.5%, which as the Minister of State is aware, is far below the rate of inflation.  In real terms, the most vulnerable, who are in receipt of those payments, have experienced a cut to their incomes.  The bulk of the &euro;500 million tax package last October went to just 20% of income earners.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council stated that 90% of the measures this year, such as electricity credits, were untargeted.  The public deserves more detail in the summer economic statement about where assistance will be provided for families.  It leaves them in a state of limbo and uncertainty.  The public deserves an emergency budget to deal with the immediate need low and middle-income families are experiencing.  The Government refused that too.  Many families do not have entitlements because of income limits, yet they are struggling with the cost of rent, childcare and keeping their homes warm.</p> <p> Sinn F&eacute;in called for an emergency budget with sensible measures designed to support lower- and middle-income households.  This included increasing working age social welfare rates and pension payments in response to inflation and introducing cost-of-living payments of &euro;200 and &euro;100 to low- and middle-income workers.  The Government turned that down.  While the Government refused to introduce an emergency budget to implement these measures, Sinn F&eacute;in was clearly successful in putting pressure on the Government to go in directions it did not plan to, such as introducing the recently announced increase in the back-to-school allowance and bringing forward the budget by two weeks, but its response remains too slow.  Inflation is ploughing ahead but the Government is not acting to keep up with the drastic changes in people's lives.</p> <p> The focus of budget 2023 must be to support workers and families in the face of the cost-of-living crisis and to tackle problems that have persisted and worsened under this Government.  Housing, healthcare, childcare and education are just a few issues.  The situation is dire, whether the Government likes it or not.  The budgetary strategy outlined by the Government appears to be incapable of delivering on any of those priorities.</p></speech>

The document provides a snapshot of what is happening.  On paper, things are going exceptionally well, with Government Members saying how great things are.  When you look in more detail at what is happening and how people are reacting, the problem is people are just trying to survive.  They should, in normal circumstances, be doing okay.  Based on their wages, they should be doing all right, but they are struggling badly.  It is happening across the board throughout the country.  Much of it is down to the policies, or lack of policies, of this Government.  Vulture funds, cuckoo funds, multimillionaires and people in the top 5% income bracket in this country are doing well and Government policies are working well for them.  The mistake we often make on this side of the House is we think the Government is starting from the same place as us and that it wants to help people at the lower end who are in difficulty.  That is not where the Government is coming from, which is a problem that leads to many misunderstandings and conflict in the House.  From the point of view of the people the Government represents, the Government is doing well, but they are not the vast majority of people in this country.  People who have been left behind consistently are not being looked after.</p>  <p>  Much was made in the statement about the provision of &euro;2.4 billion in the previous budgetary cycle.  Some &euro;1 billion of that was the &euro;100 or more given to everybody for energy.  A multimillionaire with ten houses would get ten times that.  People who are struggling to get their children onto the bus for school, to clothe them and to pay their electricity bills get the payment once.  How does that work?  It was dressed up as being too difficult to do in a targeted way and said that it had to be done this way.  It was seven months from when the Government said it would do it until the payments came through.  The reality is that if it could not do it in a targeted way within seven months, it should not be in government.  We see that problem all the time in this House.  We give the Government credit by thinking it wants to help the people we are talking about, but it does not.  Maybe we should change our arguments a wee bit.</p>  <p>  The statement claims the economy has recovered to 5.6% above pre-pandemic levels and that things are going well in the State, yet we continue to see people having difficulties.  I know of at least three food banks in my constituency of Donegal.  That is a sad reflection on the Government.  There are food banks all around the country.  This is supposedly one of the richest countries in the world, as has been mentioned in the House.  How can we expect citizens to rely on food banks to feed their families?  It is a sad reflection on us and we should all be embarrassed about that.  A food bank in Letterkenny is open two days a week.  Another food bank opens regularly in my home town of Killybegs.  It is unbelievable.  There are food banks in Clare and elsewhere.  The Government is quite happy and talks about how well the economy is doing.  An economy is not doing well if citizens have to depend on food banks for their families to survive.</p>  <p>  I was at a farmers' meeting a couple of weeks ago.  There was a rake of spuds that were late for this season and were held over until the next season.  They did not want them to go onto the market and were going to put them into silage pits to make silage from them.  What would be wrong with packaging those spuds to give to the food banks so that people can survive?  They were perfectly good spuds.  There was nothing wrong with them.  They were going to make them into silage.  That is the kind of country that we live in, which this Government has created and is pursuing.</p>  <p>  We see the consequences of the war.  I heard the T&aacute;naiste say earlier today that electricity costs are not significant for businesses.  I would love for him to tell that to the business that came into my office which saw its ESB electricity bill increase from &euro;1,988 per month to &euro;3,400 for the month of May.  That is a 42% increase in one month.  How are those small businesses supposed to survive?  The Government does not care about small businesses.  All it wants to do is to keep the multinationals happy.  Those small businesses employ people in rural areas around the country and keep them going.  That needs to be looked at by the Government and be highlighted in the summer economic statement instead of having a gloss about how we are the best country in the world and so on.  The reality is people on the ground do not feel or see that.  They are not living it.</p>  <p>  The issue of homelessness is raised every day in this House.  A couple of weeks ago, Deputy Boyd Barrett brought up the case of a woman who works for Tusla to prevent homelessness among clients of Tusla who has herself been made homeless.  That is telling.  You could not make it up.  This happens every day.  It gets no traction at all with the Government.  That is what is wrong with this statement.  We hear about how great and positive things are.  Things are not positive.  No matter how much we stand up in the House to say how great things are and how we are the second best country in the world for this or the third best for that or how we have the most multinational development, people are hungry, scared and homeless throughout the country.  People in Donegal cannot get into homeless accommodation.  Every day, I deal with people who have been put out of their houses.  The council cannot provide any houses for them because councils are not allowed to build houses.  That happens every single day.  This Government knows about it and will not do anything about it.  That is a sad reflection on it, but it is happening right across the board.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.404" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1566" speakername="Emer Higgins" time="16:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400046#WW00100"><p>Budget 2023 takes place against a backdrop of real uncertainty.  People are feeling that uncertainty in their pockets at the moment.  Between a war on European soil, the ever-present pandemic, the rising cost of living and the prospect of a potential UK trade war, these are no doubt challenging times.  I am relieved to have steady and experienced financial leadership at a time like this.  It is one of the main positives that our public finances puts us in a good position to weather this storm.  Inflation is continuing to rise and this is eating into the hard-earned incomes of households and inhibiting businesses investment.  In the face of these challenges, the Government cannot and will not bury its head in the sand.  We will tackle these challenges head on.</p>  <p>  Budget 2023 will be a cost-of-living budget, building on the &euro;2.4 billion in financial supports that have already been provided to cushion the impact of higher prices on households.  We must also, however, strike the right balance.  Government policy will absorb some of the price shock but it cannot be used to absorb it entirely.  This simply would not be economically viable.  Budgetary policy should not and will not fan the flames of inflation and inadvertently add further inflation into the system.  The lessons of past inflationary crises are very clear.  The Government can no longer borrow at interest-free rates.  Borrowing costs are on a rising trajectory.  I strongly disagree with those who say we should simply borrow our way out of the current crisis.</p>  <p>  Thankfully, our recent finances have been managed exceptionally well.  The economy is recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic far quicker and far stronger than ever predicted, leaving us with an additional &euro;6.7 billion.  This gives me great confidence that we will be able to support the most vulnerable in these difficult times.  While we are fortunate that tax revenue has held up remarkably well despite the challenging backdrop, much of this revenue comes from an increasingly narrow base.  Corporation tax receipts have contributed greatly to our public finances.  The Government is keenly aware, however, that this also represents a significant risk, with &euro;1 in every &euro;8 collected by the State coming from an exceptionally small number of firms.  Obviously, this becomes a clear vulnerability in the public finances we need to be aware of.  We cannot become overly reliant on tax revenue that may not always be there in future.</p>  <p>  Against this backdrop, budget 2023 will focus on providing further supports, through targeted measures, to those households who need it most.  It is so important to stress that the households that most need the help are not only those on low incomes and social welfare support.  The squeezed middle desperately needs help as well.  These are ordinary folk earning a decent wage but who can no longer afford a decent quality of life because the cost of living has risen so much.</p>  <p>  There is a lot of pressure on budget 2023 but, nonetheless, in the areas like health, housing, childcare, energy, transport and taxation, it must and it will deliver.  The summer economic statement provides for a total budgetary package of &euro;6.7 billion for 2023, of which almost &euro;5.7 billion will be allocated for public spending and &euro;1.05 billion for taxation measures.  This will bring core spending growth for 2023 to 6.5% compared with 4.7% as set out in the stability programme update, SPU.</p>  <p>  On the tax side, this is double the amount set in the original strategy and, once again, reflects the need to adjust the parameters given the higher than assumed inflation.  A key objective of taxation policy in the forthcoming budget will be to avoid workers paying additional tax simply because they move through higher tax brackets because of inflation.  It is important that any measure introduced to put more money back in people&rsquo;s pockets is not lost to tax.</p>  <p>  On the expenditure side, the provision of overall core spending of &euro;85.8 billion will support the implementation of measures that can protect the most vulnerable in society, address public service pay, support improvements in our public services and our infrastructure, and ensure policy does not become part of the inflation problem.</p>  <p>  The key priority over the medium term will be to slow the pace at which debt is accumulated.  This is particularly important given factors such as our ageing population, climate change mitigation, the digital transition, and funding for a number of Government policy decisions, which will all put significant pressure on public finances.</p>  <p>  We are in a time of uncertainty.  Revenues performed strongly in the first half of this year, but the less favourable outlook for the second half of the year will no doubt have implications.  No one will thank me for mentioning winter in the middle of July but there is no doubt that, as we head into the colder and darker months, spending on heat and electricity will only increase.  This is a worrying prospect for a lot of families.  They are already worrying about making ends meet in the winter months.  This is why the Government must strike a really delicate balance between delivering timely and targeted support while at the same time ensuring the public finances remain on a sustainable trajectory for the future challenges that will come.</p>  <p>  I have every confidence we can and will deliver on those ambitions.</p></speech>

I read the summer economic statement and I thank the Minister for setting out the parameters for what is possible within a budget.  I was inspired to talk today having also read that HSE officials had attended the launch of a 60-bed private hospital in Benidorm.  I did not realise the HSE has a commercial unit.  The head of the HSE commercial unit called this an "exciting" development with "lucrative" possibilities for private developers in the hospital.  This is in Benidorm.  In the past we associated Benidorm with holidays, if we could afford it.  This private hospital is part of a new major healthcare agreement.  The HSE will pay up to the cost of what it would cost in Ireland but the procedures will be done in Benidorm.  The general manager of the commercial unit of the HSE said this was a very "exciting" opportunity and that "It is a lucrative and very valid market for private providers".</p>  <p>  I am aware the Minister is a very honest and hard-working Minister but can he seriously stand over that "lucrative" and "very valid" assessment?  This is from the head of the commercial unit of the HSE, while I come from a city, and I am not exaggerating, where someone has been on a trolley for seven days.  People have been waiting for two years to get a triage assessment.  That could be done in the private hospital in Kilkenny or whatever hospital they use in Sligo.  That is a two-year wait for a triage assessment and then a further two-year wait for the surgery, if the person is lucky.  This is a city that saw two of its operating theatres go out of action in 2017.  It took until this year to get them back in action.  It seems to me the Health Service Executive is functioning to fund the private market.  In my time, land was rezoned - although I did not and I refused to do it - for a further second private hospital in Galway.  My memory might be a bit hazy so I will take the lower figures, but this was done on the basis that 20% of the beds at that private hospital would be kept as public beds.  That was the mantra from Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il at the time to justify the rezoning of land for a private hospital.  Not one single bed for the public materialised in that hospital.</p>  <p>  Now we have the latest figures.  I look at this statement and I am overwhelmed with the figures.  If the truth be known, I am out of my depth with the figures they are so big.  I tried again and I read the statement a second time.  My colleague beside me thinks I am not 100% that I would read the document a second time to try to get it.  This is what I did, however, to try to understand it and to be fair to the Minister.  Then I see the story about the private hospital in Benidorm and I say, mother of Jesus, what is going on here?  What have we learned, if anything?  We seem to have learned nothing.</p>  <p>  Let me be positive, first, in relation to it.  Yes, the Minister and the Government did the right thing in supporting businesses and households during the Covid pandemic.  I understand that more than &euro;37 billion was provided.  It is interesting it says most of it went on that.  I do not know where the other funds went.  In any event, I welcome that and it was positive.  It was the right thing to do.  It kept up the connection with the employers and with employment.  I absolutely welcome that.</p>  <p>  I then look at this document and see that it clearly sets out the challenges we are facing, including high debt, the cost of borrowing, which is related, and the other challenges.  I do not like the term "ageing population", perhaps because I am going there myself.  It is very negative.  An ageing population is in there as a challenge.  The rolling out of Sl&aacute;intecare is there.  There would be no need of Sl&aacute;intecare at all if we get more hospitals like in Benidorm and elsewhere.  We would not need Sl&aacute;intecare because we could function without hospitals and export all of our patients abroad.  People would have the added advantage of getting vitamin D.</p> <p>Challenge 4 is exposure to corporation tax, which I will return to, and challenge 5 is the need to avoid adding to inflation.  One euro in eight of tax comes from ten firms and one euro in four of tax receipts comes from foreign direct investment.  I realise more than anyone, coming from Galway city, the importance of foreign companies but they must always be balanced.  It seems to me this Government and the previous Government utterly ignored the risks of putting all our eggs in one basket.  Suddenly, we are beginning to look at this because the Central Bank and other reputable organisations have told us it is not possible to keep going on like that.  Now we need to think about what we will do with the extra and unexpected revenue we got this year.  It was obvious even to me, and I am no expert in finance, that relying on this was unwise.</p> <p> IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland brought in industry, which was very welcome but it was not done in an overall, integrated and sustainable way of doing business.  I am thinking of Galway where all the industry - an outdated word - went into one industrial estate rather than being mixed across the city.  It has created enormous problems with traffic and so on.  It has one entrance and one exit.  Councillors such as me at that time were left with egg on our faces although we had nothing to do with it, but we took the blame from the angry people on the ground who were stuck in traffic jams which were created by tunnel vision that anything from abroad was good and industry was good - and I am the first to say that - but it was not done in a greater context.</p> <p> Have we learned anything?  I do not think so.  We talk about the rebound being better than we expected but Covid and the climate change emergency has told us we cannot rebound; we must change.  We cannot go back to keeping going at the pace we were going but quite the opposite.  I am extremely worried that we have learned nothing about sustainability and what that means in terms of climate change.  The statement sets out no analysis whatever on the cost of the targets we have to meet.  I am utterly on the Government's side about climate change measures but it must be done in a way that brings along people on the ground who are way ahead of us.  Twenty years ago they were doing the right thing in Galway until everything was privatised.  We can never do it on the basis of punishing the ordinary person who is doing their best and letting the polluters get away with it.</p> <p> My head is like a jigsaw.  I am thinking of all these figures and the legislation we are pushing through the D&aacute;il this week which puts extra burdens on local authorities.  We met the officials yesterday and some of the elected members.  There is a shortfall of &euro;20 million in Galway County Council and it has a shortage of staff.  I have lost my note but I will be conservative by saying a shortage of 120 staff.  Yesterday the Government was eloquently talking about preplanning meetings but there is no such thing because there are no staff to roll-out the climate change objectives.  There are none.  That is the reality on the ground.</p> <p> Then there is housing.  We are told by the experts that we must watch out for inflation.  Listen to the Simon Communities.  This thriving economy thinks it is okay for there to be collateral damage of 10,325 people homeless.  Presumably that is just a little footnote to this economic and fiscal strategy.  How can any economist or expert on finance say we are thriving if 10,325 people, and rising, are in homeless accommodation?  How can any economist say we are thriving when not a single unit in Galway city or county comes in under the HAP or revised HAP scheme?  I made this point briefly during the debate on the no confidence motion.  We need a profoundly different way of doing things.  We need free public transport.  The Government has gone some way with free school transport but only for a year.  We need free transport and we will save ourselves in the long term if we do that.  We need public housing on public land and nothing else.  That is the message that should be given and the order given to the Land Development Agency.  We need public childcare.  The statement has a picture of it and little pieces of a jigsaw where we are giving a little bit of money there.  The population has risen to 5.2 million, which is great.  Within that the number working is at a record high.  An extra 100,000 women are working but we still have no public childcare.</p> <p> I could go on but I am over my time and I keep to the rules.</p></speech>

It has been a really busy few weeks here and I want to say a huge thank you to them all.  It has been long hours on all of them and I want to use the opportunity to say that while I am here.</p>  <p>  I thank all Deputies for their contributions.  I have stayed here for two hours of them.  The Cabinet Ministers have been very busy and there are a lot of meetings on today so I am more than happy to attend this debate on behalf of the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance.  </p>  <p>  I will make a couple of responses to some of the contributions that were made while I was here and then I will give my closing statement.  Deputy Andrews spoke of the cost-of-living crisis.  I agree wholeheartedly about what he said about sport and recreation.  It is something the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers has been working on with significant investment in the area, recognising the significance of it for communities.  I take his points about Debra Ireland too.</p>  <p>  Deputy Shortall spoke about engagement.  There is the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and Deputies engage in the briefings we receive, particularly in the run-up to the budget, and do so very positively on those and on the pre-budget submissions.  There is ample engagement with Deputies and the Government on the budget.  She made points about income inequality, something which the Government is attempting to address during its tenure.</p>  <p>  Several Deputies spoke about emergency budgets.  We have been clear about this.  A &euro;2.5 billion package has been put in place already, some of it targeted and some direct intervention.  There were calls for an emergency budget followed by a motion of confidence in the Government.  Opposition positions are not consistent on these things.  Had the motion succeeded we would have entered into a serious period of uncertainty.</p>  <p>  Deputy McGuinness made very valid points about the organisations he met with.  However, he also made a very irresponsible point about climate change and addressing the climate challenge as some goal we believe in, referring to my own party.  It is very unfortunate to say that in a week where half of Europe is on fire with rising temperatures.  It is unfortunate he brought that in.</p>  <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny spoke about regional investment.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Bruton for his very useful intervention on enterprise success and what funds our economy.  That is critically important.  We are talking about taxation but it is the redistribution of tax income that is critically important.  We need good enterprise success in this country to fund the social and environmental progress we all hope to achieve.  He raised relevant points on shallow retrofits of homes and infrastructure.  Deputy Bruton and I have spoken about this and the circular economy before.  These are critically important.</p>  <p>  I also thank Deputy Devlin who spoke about solar panels.  Deputy Shanahan spoke about regional investment in the south east.  I take on board the points made by Deputies Pringle, Browne and Higgins.  I thank all Deputies for their contributions.  It has been a useful debate and it is very much appreciated.</p>  <p>  I echo much of what my colleagues the Ministers, Deputy Donohoe and McGrath, said in their opening remarks.  The summer economic statement sets out a very significant budget package for next year in recognition of the changed economic landscape and, in particular, the cost-of-living challenge while also laying the groundwork to keep our public finances on a sustainable trajectory into the future.  We are living in deeply uncertain times.  Time and again we have been confronted with unprecedented challenges.  Brexit reshaped our relationship with our closest trading partner.  An historic pandemic caused economic turmoil on a massive scale and Russia's illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine resulted in inflation at a level we have not seen in decades.</p>  <p>  We did not foresee these events but we were prepared to address them.  We were prepared because over many years we repaired the damage caused by the global financial crisis and carefully and gradually restored our public finances to a stable footing.  This meant we could intervene to shield the economy from the most severe impacts of the pandemic and lay the foundation for a strong and broad-based economic recovery.  Just months on from the lifting of public health restrictions, we have more people at work in Ireland today than ever before in our history.</p>  <p>  We have continued to act to assist people with the cost-of-living burden.  Between the pandemic and the response to inflation, we have made approximately &euro;50 billion available over the past two and a half years.  This has been necessary and justified, and the remarkable recovery we have seen in the labour market proves the Government made the right call.</p>  <p>  We must recognise there are signs the global economy is slowing and the risks to our recovery are very much towards the downside.  The summer economic statement outlines the Government&rsquo;s intention to introduce a cost-of-living budget.  A budget package of &euro;6.7 billion is in place for next year.  A package of this size demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to assisting people with the cost-of-living issue while continuing to invest in our public services.  This is a much larger package than was set out in the strategy published last year.</p>  <p>  The sustainability of public expenditure requires that two criteria be satisfied: the level of core expenditure growth must be sustainable over the long term, and investment in expenditure must protect and deliver improvements in public services.  The second of these criteria means our fiscal policy must be responsive to changes in the economic environment.</p>  <p>  Core spending will now increase by 6.5% next year.  This additional expenditure balances the need to protect core public services while ensuring budgetary policy does not become part of the inflation problem.</p>  <p>  Government is also providing &euro;4.5 billion in non-core expenditure for temporary measures.  This expenditure will provide humanitarian support for refugees arriving from Ukraine as well as a more limited Covid provision for potential ongoing requirements.</p>  <p>  The budget package reflects the changed economic environment at present.  However, those of us in government also have a responsibility not to take short-term decisions that could ultimately jeopardise our future economic stability.  That is why the Government has also restated its commitment to our medium-term fiscal strategy for the years beyond 2023, controlling current public expenditure at sustainable levels and rebuilding our fiscal resources.  We will also ensure measures aimed at reducing cost-of-living pressures are carefully targeted so they do not add to inflation.</p>  <p>  We are now projecting a very modest budget surplus for next year, but as has been highlighted previously, this is entirely a reflection of the rapid growth in corporation tax receipts.  Were it not for these receipts, we would still be running very significant deficits.  Corporation tax receipts, more than half of which come from just ten large companies, are not a sustainable basis for permanent spending commitments, as many Deputies mentioned this afternoon.  We know from our own recent history that windfall tax revenues can suddenly disappear.  A small headline surplus is a positive sign, but it does not paint the full picture.</p>  <p>  The package for budget 2023 and the medium-term fiscal strategy set out in the summer economic statement recognise the changed economic environment and the need for Government to do more today, but they also reflect the reality that we cannot afford to continue to intervene on such a scale indefinitely, especially when much of the uplift in our tax revenue cannot be relied upon.</p>  <p>  The Government has shown we can keep the public finances on a stable pathway.  We have done so before.  We have also shown over the past two and a half years that we will act when needed to support our economy and our citizens.  The summer economic statement strikes the right balance.</p></speech>

Castlemagner is a beautiful village situated almost midway between Kanturk and Mallow.  There was significant development in the village more than 15 years ago.  We have been working for some time with Cork County Council.  Councillor Bernard Moynihan put considerable work in with the council and Irish Water.  We were delighted that Irish Water announced earlier this year that Castlemagner would be included in the small town and village scheme for the upgrade of its sewage treatment plant.  Once that is in place, it will allow the village to further develop.  It is in a very central location, almost at the heart of Munster.  The upgraded treatment plant will allow much-needed houses to be built in the village.  In the debate on the summer economic statement and in multiple debates here every week, housing is very a important issue.  Housing is not just a Dublin or city issue.  It is very important for rural areas.  Many people have moved back to rural communities, including Castlemagner.</p>  <p>  While Irish Water has announced that Castlemagner is on the scheme, I want to ensure it progresses in the shortest possible timeframe.  I ask the Minister of State to use his good offices and those of his Department to liaise with Irish Water and Cork County Council to ensure this is expedited.  The upgrade to the existing system has been taken over by Irish Water therefore allowing the village to further develop.  Many people would be looking at Castlemagner as a place they would build homes.  A number of homes could be built there.</p>  <p>  It is very important that there is no delay.  We want Irish Water, Cork County Council and the Department on song to ensure that this development happens.  Over the years, many projects have been delayed because funding was not in place.  We have got that commitment from the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and Irish Water.  We are very grateful for that and for the work done by the Cork County Council, the Department and Irish Water to bring it to this level.  However, we cannot rest on our laurels at this stage.  We are into the second half of 2022 and we want to ensure that what was announced for 2022 happens in 2022 and that plans are developed.  I am aware that engineering works, etc., need to be carried out.  We need the full support from all the stakeholders who have stepped up to the plate and made it a priority.  We now need to ensure that it happens in the shortest possible time.</p></speech>

They apply to all our small towns and villages.</p> <p>We launched the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns fund this morning.  A lot of Government policies are converging to try to attract families back to living in small communities.  It is vital that such communities can grow in a sustainable way.</p> <p> I will outline the position in regard to Irish Water&rsquo;s responsibility on this issue.  I know Deputy Michael Moynihan raised the issue directly with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, and the Minister recently had the opportunity to visit the site in question with the Deputy in May.  The Minister is aware of the importance of the delivery of this upgrade and is fully committed, through the Department, to supporting Irish Water in its delivery of the project. </p> <p> The Water Services Acts 2007 to 2017 set out the arrangements in place for the delivery of water and wastewater services by Irish Water, and for the scrutiny and oversight provisions that apply in respect of these arrangements.  As the Deputy will understand, the provision of facilities in Castlemagner is a matter for Irish Water in the first instance.  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local level.  Irish Water takes a strategic, nationwide approach to asset planning and investment, and meeting customer requirements.  The prioritisation and progression of individual projects and programmes is a matter for determination by Irish Water.</p> <p> My Department has made inquiries of Irish Water on the issue mentioned by Deputy Moynihan, and I am informed as follows.  In October 2021, Irish Water announced the upgrade of the Castlemagner wastewater treatment works as part of its small towns and villages growth programme.  This announcement instigated a series of steps towards the development of an upgraded wastewater treatment plant to provide for residential growth in the village in accordance with the proposed Cork county development plan.  The initial steps involve an assessment of needs process: the collation of this data is under way and a number of upgrade scenarios will be developed and considered, ahead of a scope of works being agreed.  Once this scope of works is defined, the project will move to detailed design, undergoing statutory planning, tendering and procurement stages, as required.</p> <p> Again, both the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, and I recognise the importance of these upgrade works and our Department will continue to work to support Irish Water in the delivery of this project.</p> <p> The Government is aware that significant and sustained investment is needed to ensure the continued operation, upgrade and repair of the country&rsquo;s water and wastewater infrastructure and to support economic development in the years to come.  In this regard, as part of budget 2022, my Department secured funding of more than &euro;1.57 billion to support water services.  This includes &euro;1.459 billion in respect of domestic water services provision by Irish Water.  This overall investment will deliver significant improvements in public water and wastewater services, support improved water supplies right across Ireland, including rural Ireland, and support a range of programmes delivering improved water quality in our rivers, lakes and marine area.  I hope this response is of use to the Deputy.</p></speech>

I am pleased that he and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, are committed to the funding of the wastewater treatment plants in the small towns and villages growth programme.  It was on the scheme in October 2021.  The Minister of State outlined what Irish Water said.  The initial steps involve the assessment of needs process.  The correlation of data is under way.  When will the data be ready?  We welcome the commitment of the Government and the Minister, who visited the site recently and gave serious commitment to it.  What we are looking for here is to make sure that Castlemagner is prioritised, given all the projects that are being developed around the country.  There is real scope here for houses to be built to alleviate the national crisis in housing.  After today&rsquo;s discussion, I seek that a clear indication would be given on the project.  The initial steps involve the assessment of needs and the correlation of data.  When will the data be ready and the scenarios developed and considered?  There is a lot of work to be done in regard to scoping of the work that is needed and the detailed design and planning.  That will all take time as going through the statutory process takes time.  I ask the Minister of State to use his good offices and those of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to make sure that there is no delay in Castlemagner and that there is a clear indication of when the project will commence.  Perhaps after today's discussion, the Minister of State might seek information from Irish Water and report back to me on the exact timing of the steps that are required and their timeframe on a monthly basis to make sure that this project becomes a reality in the short term.  It is hugely important that the work is developed as a matter of urgency for the community and to make sure that housing is provided for people.</p></speech>

We can work with Irish Water to get a timeline, as that would be useful for the Deputy and the community in terms of when the collation of data will be completed and the different upgrade scenarios that are to be developed.  The project will then have to go into a scope of works and move into the project design and statutory planning stage.  There are a number of steps involved in the process but it would be useful for both the Deputy and the community of Castlemagner to have the timeline for the steps laid out in clear terms.  I will work with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, to try to achieve that and expedite this project in as quick a timeframe as possible, noting the urgency for this upgrade and that there are developments waiting to take place pending the upgrade.  We will get that information for the Deputy to help try to move this project along quicker.</p></speech>

I appreciate him being here.  Week after week we come into the House to raise matters.  On tonight's schedule of Topical Issues, as on many occasions, we are talking about services, be it issues related to Irish Water, as Deputy Michael Moynihan has just alluded to, or in my case, the last three of my Topical Issues have in one way or another been related to the HSE.  Here I am again raising the issue of respite care in Cork, specifically for students of the new special school in Carrigaline.  While it might not specifically be in my constituency, given the nature of the school, children travel from far and wide to attend it.  The unfortunate reality for the parents and their children is that when the school was established it was not assigned a children's disability network, CDN team, so there is no access to therapies or any services unless they are accessed privately.  A knock-on impact to that is that the parents have not been able to access respite care either for many of the children for that time and I note the school was established nearly a year ago.  Many of the children have different disabilities and challenging behaviours.  Unfortunately, the State has completely abandoned them for the past year since the school was established.  The State has a responsibility but so too does the HSE.  It gets a budget of &euro;20-odd billion every year, yet we are here every week decrying and complaining about the lack of services.</p>  <p>  I had a meeting with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, six months ago in the Vienna Woods Hotel, Glanmire, when she listened to more than 150 families talk about the lack of services in the disability sector.  One point was repeated over and over.  Many people shared their own personal stories.  Nobody should have to go through that in such a fashion where there was a large crowd but these people feel they have to do it because of the issues I referenced earlier.  I do not see how we are in a situation here where we have got massive investment in special schools in Cork - we have a second one in the pipeline.  In addition, a site is being purchased in my own town of Glanmire.  There is a lot of good happening in that sector but the schools are not being accompanied by services.  For a new special school not to have the services accompany it is a travesty.  In the case of Carrigaline, the school was taken under the patronage of Cork Education and Training Board, ETB, which does fantastic work and is probably the most efficient board of management body in County Cork, it is a travesty not to have the services accompany the school.</p>  <p>  Subsequent to the fact that a CDN team was not designated to the special school, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, met me and Bernard O'Regan of the HSE and a commitment was given that CDN teams would be assigned to all special schools and reinstated.  I would appreciate if the Minister of State had an update on the position in that regard.  I know it is not specific to the issue of respite, but I would appreciate it if the Minister of State has any information on the matter.  I would like to know whether we are at the point where we are advertising those posts.  A validation process was undertaken and I understand the HSE has done that work but I would appreciate if the Minister of State has any information that would shed light on the matter.</p> <p> To return to the issue of respite raised in the Topical Issue matter, these are people with challenging behaviours.  The parents need a break and, from what I am hearing on the ground, they are doing well if they can get access to a couple of nights of respite in a year.  I would appreciate any information the Minister of State has on the matter.</p></speech>

The Deputy highlighted a difficult case and it is important the issue of access to therapies and respite be resolved.  The Government recognises how important respite can be for relieving pressure and enhancing the quality of life of families, particularly due to the impact the absence of respite service provision can have on other services being delivered.  It is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities that will empower them to live their lives and provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose.</p>  <p>  Regarding the specific issue of respite provision raised by the Deputy, the HSE is aware of the issues related to access for children in Carrigaline Community School.  It is a new school established by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and the Department of Education.  Cork-Kerry Community Healthcare has advised it is engaging with the CDNT with respect to scoping the needs of the children enrolled in the school.  I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has had recent discussions with Cork-Kerry Community Healthcare regarding access to respite and therapy services for children attending the school.  There is limited access to children's respite services in Cork at present due to capacity and resource issues.  Traditionally, children who attended special schools under the patronage of section 38 or section 39 organisations had access to respite in those agencies.  Cork-Kerry Community Healthcare is implementing a more equitable regional respite service for children in Cork with the establishment of a regional respite committee.  It has advised the Department that all children attending the relevant CDNTs will be able to make an application under the new process.  This is a work in progress and information with regard to how to access the service will issue to stakeholders in the coming weeks.  Nevertheless, Cork-Kerry Community Healthcare has advised that respite services are limited with respect to capacity and that access will be based on the prioritised needs of the children and families.</p>  <p>  I assure the Deputy the Government remains committed to ensuring increased capacity is built into respite services to support families, help preserve the family unit and support family stability.  I do not have a response relating specifically to the posts he mentioned but I will ask the Minister of State to revert to him on the matter.</p></speech>

It was probably unfair of me to throw in the CDNT issue on top, but I thought to myself that I did not ask, I would not get so I said I would try.  It is great that the HSE is aware of the issues relating to access for children.  The Minister of State indicated this is a new school established by the NCSE and the Department of Education but that was the case a year ago and saying so now is kind of stating the obvious.  I would love to know what the HSE is doing now.  The Minister of State went on to point out that it is carrying out a scoping exercise but, again, stating as much after a year has passed is too slow.  These kids have profound intellectual disabilities.  Some of them are fed by tube and require round-the-clock attention, and one year on from the opening of their school, we are still scoping.  Somebody needs to shout about this.  It is just more ineptitude.</p>  <p>  I understand that most of these issues relate to employment and recruitment.  I was given a report last night by the Minister stating that 36% of all the posts in my community healthcare organisation, CHO, are unfilled.  I asked the question, which I reiterate now, as to what we are doing about it.  We have been talking since 2017 about one in three or four HSE posts not being filled, and five years on, one in three or four HSE posts remain unfilled.  When the HSE talks about the lack of capacity in respite services, it is specifically down to recruitment.  We are consistently told in the House, week in, week out, that money is not an issue, and I believe the Minister for Health when he says money is not an issue.  If it is about recruitment, what is going to be done?  Are we going to sit on our hands and hope it falls right for the HSE eventually?  It has been clearly shown that will not happen.  The executive has to start thinking outside the box, and whether that means relaxing visa rules and going outside the EU, or going on roadshows across the globe to find the staff we need, somebody needs to grab the bull by the horns and get on with it.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the regional respite committee and its establishment.  It seems to be in its infancy, but I would welcome any details about it he might be able to give.  He stated that due to capacity issues, children are being given respite on a prioritised-needs basis.  How many children in this school does that relate to and how many respite hours have been given specifically for those children?</p></speech>

A letter from Majella Daly, the head of the disability service in Cork-Kerry Community Healthcare, is attached to my prepared response but it does not offer much more information than I have outlined.  The Deputy has raised quite a number of supplementary issues and we will revert to him with a response to them.  I acknowledge there is an immediate issue in Carrigaline Community School that is causing great distress to the families affected.  The HSE is committed to supporting the service users affected by this and Cork-Kerry Community Healthcare is implementing a more equitable regional respite service for children in Cork.  It is recognised, as the Deputy noted, that recruitment, rather than finances, is the issue.  I apologise that I cannot give a more comprehensive reply to the questions he has raised on behalf of the families he is representing, but I will ask the Minister of State to revert with specific responses.</p></speech>

I recognise this issue is not his area.  It relates to childcare in Wicklow.  It is no secret that childcare in this country is at crisis point.  The costs, which are exorbitant, are putting severe pressure on families who are just trying to keep their heads above water.  Wicklow is at the forefront of that crisis, given parents there pay the highest fees for childcare outside of Dublin, at approximately &euro;924 per month, or between 20% and 25% of their disposable income on average.  That is an incredible sum for any family to find, not least for a service the Social Democrats believe should be publicly provided.  I cannot quite understand why we are so far behind our European neighbours in how we deal with childcare.  In raising the issue of costs, I understand the budget is approaching and hope the Government will make that serious investment we need in respect of childcare costs in order that parents will be supported.</p>  <p>  Childcare availability and flexibility are equally important issues that need to be addressed in this context.  In regard to availability, many parents in Wicklow have found that no cr&egrave;che or childcare spaces are available when they have gone looking for them, whether coming off maternity leave or having found out they are pregnant, which is when many parents start searching for childcare places.  It is difficult to find places for children under 12 months, in particular.  Capacity in Wicklow stands at 0.6%, meaning that percentage of all places in the county is set aside for children under the age of one.  That is the second lowest rate in the country, which means many parents, primarily women, have to decide between their job and staying at home because they cannot find any facilities that will take their babies.  I have spoken to parents who have spent a year looking for places for their children and to a woman who had to turn down two job offers because she could not find childcare when she looked for it.  Similarly, I have spoken to parents who, when they went looking in April, were told it would be next July before they would be able to get a place, which is not acceptable.</p> <p>Parents need to be able to work, particularly in my constituency in Wicklow, in order that they can meet their incredibly high mortgage repayments or afford their rent.  In addition, we do not want women being unable or not having a choice to continue with their careers because the service is not provided.</p> <p> I also wish to raise the issue of childcare of a part-time and flexible nature.  It would be really useful if flexible full- and part-time childcare were available to parents in order that they could pay for three or four days' childcare as opposed to the full five.  If such childcare were available, it would facilitate with the type of remote working policies at which we are currently looking.  People could also take their parental leave and make their work-life balance a bit more manageable.  The three main issues I wish to raise with the Minister of State in the context of childcare are cost, availability and flexibility.</p></speech>

I have served on voluntary boards of community-based childcare services for many years, however, so I have a great interest in the sector.  I appreciate the points the Deputy raised.</p>  <p>  High-quality early learning and childcare that is affordable and accessible is a key Government priority.  Before the onset of Covid-19, national data indicated that, on the whole, the supply of early learning and childcare places was meeting demand, notwithstanding the points raised by the Deputy, with evidence of some undersupply for the youngest children in certain areas.  Capacity data gathered throughout the Covid-19 pandemic revealed lower demand for early learning and childcare places.  An initial analysis of the data captured in June 2021 found significant vacancy rates across the country with the national vacancy rate averaging at 21% and a vacancy rate in Wicklow of 16%.</p>  <p>  In April of this year, the network of county childcare committees undertook a nationwide survey of capacity in early learning and childcare services.  This was followed in May by the early years sector profile survey, which is undertaken annually by Pobal on behalf of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.  An initial analysis of this data shows that there is currently a vacancy rate in Wicklow of 12.5%.  However, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is aware that, in some areas, capacity issues have re-emerged for some families.</p>  <p>  A key priority for the Government is to support the early learning and care and school-age childcare sector through the provision of capital funding where it is most needed.  Assisting childcare providers in extending their existing childcare services or establishing new childcare services have always been key areas of focus for the Department's capital programmes.  The Department has demonstrated its commitment to increasing capacity through having secured &euro;70 million in the revised national development plan for the early learning and childcare sector.  This funding will enable significant capital investment in early learning and childcare and much of it will go to increasing capacity in the sector in order to fulfil the Government priority of ensuring availability of high-quality early learning and childcare that is affordable and accessible.</p>  <p>  In order to assist with increased capacity, the Department secured &euro;70 million for the sector under the national development plan for the period 2023 to 2025.  The majority of this funding is earmarked for new places.  This will enable significant capital investment in early learning and childcare during 2023 to 2025 across the three pillars of modernisation, new capacity and First 5 initiatives.</p>  <p>  Parents in Wicklow who are experiencing difficulty in respect of their early learning and childcare needs should contact their local city or county childcare committee, which can provide assistance on centre-based childcare, childminders and other options.  City and county childcare committees in areas with unmet demand are actively engaging with early learning and childcare services to explore the potential for services to increase capacity.  Where services can increase capacity, their applications to Tusla to increase their capacity in the service area have being fast-tracked to ensure that as many places as possible are made available to families.</p>  <p>  We are aware of media reports that suggest there has been a high level of service closures this year.  Data from Tusla on the actual number of closures over the last three years does not support this claim, however.  There are more than 4,500 early learning and childcare providers in the State and, as can be expected, some services close each year and new services open.  In 2019 and 2020, more than 190 services closed, while 140 services closed in 2021.  By Aril 2022, only 25 services had closed, which is similar to the same period in 2021.  These closures were balanced by new services opening.</p>  <p>  As I have set out,  there will continue to be capacity in the sector as a whole.  I will come back to the Deputy and follow-up regarding the issue relating to children under one year, which is a particular challenge in many counties, and the flexible and sessional three to four days of childcare to support remote working.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.426" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1627" speakername="Jennifer Whitmore" time="16:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400051#BBB00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State.  I understand that this is not his area.  The response that the vacancy rate in Wicklow is at 16% is quite disappointing.  Many parents have contacted me to say the opposite.  In fact, one parent said she contacted 46 cr&egrave;ches and minders before she found someone.  There is obviously a problem.  When we talk about averages, what needs to be reflected is that Wicklow is a very diverse county with many towns and villages.  Some villages have no access at all to any childcare and they will obviously not be reflected in those figures.</p>  <p>  The other issue is that when we talk about childcare, we are looking at a wide range of ages.  Although the Minister of State showed me the same statistics, Pobal also said that only 0.6% of the childcare places in Wicklow are for children who are aged under one year, which is the second lowest in the country.  There is an obvious issue in Wicklow, particularly when it comes to younger children and babies.  That is not reflected in that figure either.  To say that we found an average vacancy rate and that everything is fine is to dismiss the problems parents are facing.  It indicates that the Department is not listening to people or aware of what is happening on the ground.  One could do a desktop study and come out with these averages, but that is actually not what parents are feeling or what they are finding.  We are talking about women who had to give up two job offers because they could not get a cr&egrave;che place.  That is completely unacceptable.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister of State to bring that message back to the Department.  It needs to look closer at the granular data in respect of the ages of children and at the different locations in Wicklow to identify where there are problems.  When the it identifies a problem, the Department needs to go in and focus on it.  It cannot be left to the market because the market is not delivering when it comes to childcare.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.427" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="16:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400051#BBB00400"><p>I agree with many of the points raised by the Deputy.  From my experience in volunteering in the sector, there are challenges around the requirements for facilities for children aged under one year.  That is perhaps something that has not been responded to by the providers.  There is a significant challenge around the actual layout of physical premises in terms of sleeping areas, etc.  That is, perhaps, one of the reasons.</p>  <p>  It really falls back on the county childcare committees to work with providers in the county to look at where the deficits are.  Certainly, what the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, has done over the past two years is address much of the sustainability of the sector and the capital funding to help cr&egrave;che providers to really provide the full range of services possible.  It is really important that the Wicklow county childcare committee works with the providers to look at that granular data the Deputy is seeking.  That would get to the nub of some of the challenges.</p>  <p>  Second, I wish to provide reassurance in respect of the budget package.  This will be a cost-of-living budget, as has been widely stated.  The Minister is committed to working on the core funding issue but also on the retention of staff to ensure the professional development of people working in the childcare sector can also be addressed.  It is critical to ensure that we have a sustainable childcare and early learning sector that can respond to the needs in a particular country or individual community.  It goes back to the county childcare committee to support that.</p>  <p>  I will absolutely take back the points the Deputy raised.  The response does not really give the Deputy the answer she is looking for, which I appreciate.  Again, that issue around the flexibility of sessional provision and three to four days' remote working really is something providers should be able to supply families with.</p></speech>

We awoke this morning to news of the situations in Dublin Airport, Citywest and beyond.</p> <p>However, those of us who have been engaged on the ground not just since the Ukrainian war but before that in terms of the situation for refugees coming to this country through the international protection accommodation services, IPAS, system have known there has been a crisis for a long time.  It has never or seldom made front-page news.  We now have a situation where the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has found itself totally overwhelmed.  From the start we called for a cross-governmental approach and for something as basic as having individuals of expertise and experience to be in reception centres and hotels to deal with refugees, and we have generally been ignored.  That is coming home to roost now and the people who are suffering are those who are coming to this country from wars in Ukraine and elsewhere and who are sleeping on the floor in Dublin Airport or in overcrowded conditions in Citywest or in a reception centre managed by a private entity.</p> <p> With regard to Citywest, at present there are residents there who are beneficiaries of the EU temporary protection directive, TPD, category of refugees, mainly Ukrainian people, and there are also people there under protection in the direct provision system from IPAS.  The issue is not the mix or, indeed, the two systems.  The issue is that one category, those under the TPD, is being processed in 24 hours on average, while others are being processed in two weeks on average.  These are all human beings, and this is absolutely indefensible.  It is understandable that a lot of the media coverage is focused on Ukraine, but this has laid bare how inhumane our treatment of refugees has been for many years despite the best intentions of the Irish public and many in politics.  I have huge concerns about the conditions in Citywest.  The communal areas are being used as temporary shelter for people who have been displaced.  Citywest is not meeting minimum standards.  This is coming from public health officials who are working there.  There are major issues with regard to education.  It is the summer holidays now but we are only a few weeks away from schools reopening - we were discussing back-to-school matters last week in the House - and 33% of young people coming to this country under the schemes do not have a school place.</p> <p> We now have details about what is going to happen in Gormanston Camp.  I would like to hear a further update on that with regard to this tented village.  However, we are getting a sense that the Government is downplaying this issue.  This is not a temporary issue.  It has been building for a number of months.  The system appears to be totally overwhelmed.  The community response being led by the local authorities was never fit for purpose and never met the real needs of refugees in this country.</p> <p> Will people be at the airport for more than one night?  What will happen to arrivals today and over the weekend?  What washing and laundry facilities are available at the airport?  Have people sufficient access to water and so forth with the heatwave that is coming and the rise in temperatures?  What safeguarding measures are in place there?  What is going to be done about the two-tier approach that is being applied to all human beings who are coming to this country as refugees?</p></speech>

The operational challenges brought about by responding to the conflict are significant.  Our country has never experienced an influx of displaced persons like the one that we have seen over the past months.  Numbers seeking international protection have also increased, adding to accommodation capacity issues.  The role of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is focused on the immediate, short-term accommodation needs of those who have arrived here.  To date, more than 41,000 people have arrived in Ireland and in excess of 31,000 of those have been referred to us seeking accommodation from the State.  Overseeing the provision of accommodation on this scale during this timeframe for all those who require it remains immensely challenging.  Due to the urgent need to source accommodation, a broad range of accommodation types have been contracted, including emergency accommodation.  While this is not ideal, the priority is to place people fleeing the conflict in safe and secure accommodation.</p>  <p>  As of 13 July, the Department has contractual arrangements in place with approximately 450 accommodation services.  The Department has contracted over 25,000 beds across hotels, guest houses, bed and breakfast accommodation, hostels, student accommodation, commercial self-catering accommodation and certain other repurposed settings, with additional capacity also being pursued through accommodation pledged by the general public and State-owned or private properties which may be suitable for short-term accommodation.  Given the number of people arriving, which has increased in recent weeks, sourcing suitable accommodation continues to be a major challenge.  In seeking to address accommodation needs, safety and security are the paramount considerations.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to delivering a humanitarian response to welcome people seeking protection in Ireland as part of the European Union's overall response.  The scale of the response to this crisis has been unprecedented and Irish people have displayed an incredible level of generosity in their support and pledges of accommodation.  The Irish Red Cross Society has put in place a national pledge mechanism for channelling the offers of accommodation which many members of the public wish to provide.  Over 25,000 offers of accommodation have been pledged through the Irish Red Cross Society.  Implementing partners include local authorities, the Irish Red Cross Society, the International Organisation of Migration and the Peter McVerry Trust.  As of 13 July, over 2,155 people have been successfully matched to 776 pledged accommodations, with placements taking place daily in multiple locations across the country.  The process of placing people in pledged accommodation takes time.  It is a complex process and needs to be done correctly for the safety and security of those fleeing.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding those measures, over the past number of weeks there has been a very significant increase in the number of people seeking access to the international protection service and this is causing a severe shortage of available accommodation for both people arriving from Ukraine and international protection applicants.  Based on those numbers and with capacity maximised, the prudent decision was taken in the interests of health and safety to temporarily close the Citywest transit hub to new arrivals.  To minimise overcrowding, incoming arrivals will remain in Dublin Airport if they do not have an alternative source of accommodation until more accommodation becomes available.  It should be noted that this measure is temporary in nature.  Staff from the Department are on-site at both the airport and Citywest locations and the focus is very clearly on assisting those who are most vulnerable.  Furthermore, the Government is working intensively to put alternative arrangements in place with immediate effect, and this will include the use of tented accommodation in Gormanston from next week, as well as other emergency solutions that are being developed.  The Taoiseach and relevant Ministers are meeting today to discuss the situation and to review the current policies and processes.</p>  <p>  While current circumstances are undoubtedly challenging, it is important to acknowledge and pay tribute to the efforts of the Irish people in the outpouring of support and response for those fleeing conflict.  This extends to individuals and families, the many volunteers under the co-ordination of the local community forum, the local authorities, the Defence Forces, State agencies such as Tusla and the HSE, and Departments.</p>  <p>  I will refer later to the Deputy's other questions.</p></speech>

We have an amazing volunteer group of people in Swords who were working with a number of different reception centres and creating great links with the community of Ukrainians that have arrived.  However, after a big public event to which everyone was invited at the Emmaus Centre just north of Swords, the company that runs it now, Allpro Services, has, in effect, frozen out the group of local volunteers.  An atmosphere has been created in this reception centre, which was very positive at the start, whereby the advocates, the spokespeople and the Ukrainian people who were linking in with local volunteers have been ostracised, to the extent that one was removed on 16 June.  I have made the Minister and the Department aware of it, and I have been in contact about it.  It is the removal of Alexander Neeshkasha.</p>  <p>  We cannot continue to rely on private facility management companies to come in and look after refugees.  What happened there is that we had a positive situation where the local volunteers were able to go in, create links and bond the community early.  They have now been frozen out and the advocates from the community who were working there have been splintered.</p> <p>This company, Allpro Services, is operating in a manner over which none of us have any oversight.  This is what will happen and it will become the norm if the State does not get a handle on it.  We are not saying that it is easy, but the processes are so slack at the moment that this is what is happening.  It is having a real, detrimental impact on those who are currently seeking refuge here.</p></speech>

This is really, really serious.  We understand.  I spoke to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman, about it yesterday, and to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien.  We are facing an increasingly challenging situation from a humanitarian perspective.  The Deputy has raised the issue in Swords around local volunteers.  We need a combination of voluntary supports and professional services.  That has to be the case.  It is important because of the sheer scale of the challenge that we are facing.  I am more than happy to raise that matter with the Minister, Deputy O&rsquo;Gorman.  I am sure the Deputy has raised it with him himself.</p>  <p>  Separately, on the temporary protection directive and what appears to be a two-tier system, there is no doubt the temporary protection directive was brought in as an immediate response to the Ukraine war.  It is a different system than the international protection, IP, system.  There is no doubt that, in terms of timeframe or processing, that was going to be the case.  The Government just making every effort to address the immediate challenges around what has happened over the last number of weeks.  We have reached capacity at every level.  It is important that we continue to make those efforts and support the families.  This will not be resolved in the short term.  The numbers will still come in.  We have to continue to work and adapt.  The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, has spoken to me about seeking all available options across the country for accommodation.  We appreciate the voluntary efforts of which the Deputy speaks across communities and across the country, which have been overwhelming.  I will take those points back to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman.  </p></speech>

I have been campaigning on this issue for a number of years, as have the local Labour Party and our local area representative Shane Folan.  This impacts some on my colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, as well, because the issue borders his constituency too.</p>  <p>  I am referencing the Dublin 13 and Dublin 17 area, where the Minister of State will be aware that there are thousands and thousands of new units being constructed.  It is effectively a new town.  Within that new town we need to not repeat the errors of the past when we only built dwellings and did not build the community infrastructure.  Obviously, other things are needed rather than just a Garda station.  We have been to the forefront of advocating for new schools.  We had a successful campaign to have a new second-level Educate Together school.  However, more is needed for families to grow up and for the place to feel secure.</p>  <p>  In that area there has been an identifiable need, which has been recognised by the Department of Justice and by senior Garda management for a new Garda station.  The site has been identified at Northern Cross.  In June 2019, the assistant Garda Commissioner gave notice that they were moving to progress to construction of a new Garda station at that location.  It would serve the existing communities in Dublin 17, in Dublin 13 and the wider communities.  If you move to a new area and things are beginning to knit themselves together, you need the sporting clubs, the community associations and you need to know that the agencies of the State are there to serve you, to work with you and to protect you.</p>  <p>  It has come to my notice in the more recent past that there has been a number of troubling instances in Fr. Collins Park.  They have been of a physical assault nature and of a verbal assault nature.  There has been a racial component to them.  This has been bubbling under the surface for a number of years, unfortunately.  That is not to suggest in any way and that that part of the world is any different to any other part of city.  Every part of the city has policing concerns and antisocial behaviour concerns.  We have had issues around Clongriffin DART station as well, which has been targeted by antisocial behaviour.</p>  <p>  When Shane Folan, other Labour Party members and I began this advocacy with the Clongriffin community association which had identified this need and made presentations, it was welcome that those who were in government at the time and Garda senior management were listening and identified the validity of the case being made.  The political response has always been that this is a matter for Garda management.  We felt that was a dispiriting response, when the Government at the time could see fit to reopen Garda stations that had been closed.  I make reference to Stepaside Garda station.</p>  <p>  However, this is a good news story.  The community has gotten involved.  The community wants to look to the future.  It wants to build an area that it can be proud of.  It wants to focus on community infrastructure.  The Government responded positively.  The assistant Garda Commissioner responded positively.  We are now in a position hopefully to move forward.  What I want now, and I raise this issue as often as I possibly can, is to get an update on where we are on the construction of this Garda station at the site of the corner of Northern Cross on the Malahide Road to serve Dublin 13, Dublin 17 and the wider jurisdiction.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.440" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1512" speakername="Malcolm Noonan" time="17:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400053#DDD00900"><p>I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee.  The Minister is pleased that budget 2022 reflects the commitment of the Government to ensuring that our communities are safe and that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources to be an effective and trusted police service.  The budget provided by Government to the Garda Commissioner continues to increase to unprecedented levels with an allocation of over &euro;2 billion in funding for this year.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Garda Commissioner is by law responsible for the management and control of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the effective and efficient use of Garda resources, including the provision of Garda stations.  In addition, the Office of Public Works, OPW, has responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation.  Garda accommodation matters are therefore progressed by the Garda authorities working in close co-operation with the OPW.  As such, the Deputy will appreciate that the Minister, Deputy McEntee, has no role in relation to this matter and she is not in position to comment on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s interaction with other agencies.</p>  <p>  As the Commissioner has previously stated, accommodation is a crucial element for facilitating policing activities.  We must further proof this in the area.  It is for this reason that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to engage with the OPW on capital and maintenance works across Ireland.  This includes what the Commissioner has referred to as an exciting project that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is working on with the OPW and Dublin City Council regarding the development of a substantial new Garda station and facilities on Dublin City Council lands at the corner of the R139 and Malahide Road at Northern Cross.</p>  <p>  The Minister understands that discussions around the possibility of Dublin City Council making a site available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to the OPW for the construction of a new Garda station at Northern Cross remain ongoing.  As the Deputy can appreciate, until a site is secured, no further update on the status of the application for planning permission or further phases of the project will be available.  However, the Minister is assured that the Northern Cross project is considered a strategic priority project by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  I hope this is of some assurance to the Deputy.  I know that he has raised it consistently directly with the Minister.  It is important, as the Deputy said, for good community infrastructure.  We look at our census data and our populations are increasing.  It is vitally important that communities feel safe.  Those issues that the Deputy has raised about assaults and antisocial behaviour are not exclusive to this area, but it is important that people report everything and particularly racial abuse.  It is vitally important that that is reported.  I hope that the response from the Minister has given some assurance to the Deputy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.441" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1551" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="17:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400053#DDD01000"><p>I am reassured by the response from the Minister.  I do sometimes get a little disappointed with the political reaction as if there is no influence that the Minister can have in this regard.  We know that the soft power of a Minister can be quite strong.  The Minister needs to be an advocate and a persuader for this.  Her office and her Department needs to be fully engaged on the progress of this.  While the Garda Commissioner has described it as exciting, the site has been identified and talks are ongoing between Dublin City Council and the OPW, the community is still waiting.  There have been justifiable delays.</p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>Covid was obviously one reason for that.  Yet, we are still seeing a lot of construction around that area.  As a public representative, with other public representatives, I want to be able to stand over our period of influence in that area in 50 years' time and say that we put everything in place to ensure that the area was a thriving community, a place to be proud of, a place to bring up children and a place for families to feel safe and secure.  </p> <p> I do not like the arm's-length response that we often get from Departments, as if there is no influence that can be brought to bear.  Having said that, the message that I want to see passed on to the Minister is that we would like her to be a persuader for this project and to actively engage on the issue.  I ask that the Department do anything it can to make the process easier.  I ask that the Minister is willing, able and at hand to be a facilitator in the process.   I will continue to raise the issue.  I am not going to let it go.  I feel that we have to move to a position where a Garda station is constructed so that communities can feel that the community infrastructure is going in and that they live in a proper community with all the services and resources a Garda station will provide for them and the wider area.  </p></speech>

The allocation of Garda resources is made in light of identified operational demand.  As such, the Minister for Justice has no direct role in the allocation of Garda resources.  The Minister is advised that as of 31 May, the latest date for which figures are available, Dublin Metropolitan Region North has a strength of 793 Garda members in all its ranks.  This is an increase of 125 members, or 18.7%, since the end of 2015.  The division is currently further supported by 64 Garda staff, an increase of 20 or almost 45.5%, since the end of 2015.  For the Deputy's information, the area referred to is covered by Coolock Garda Station.  There were 125 Garda assigned to Coolock Garda Station as of 31 May, which is an increase of 21.4% since the end of 2015, when 103 Garda were assigned to that station.  The Garda in Coolock Garda Station are supported by 15 Garda staff members.  As I have said, the Government is committed to ensuring that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources it needs, with an unprecedented allocation of more than &euro;2 billion provided in budget 2022.  The Deputy may be aware that there was a very strong interest in the recent Garda recruitment campaign, with more than 11,000 people applying to become members.  The recruitment process is continuing to identify candidates to enter the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  College over the coming period.  I wish to reiterate and reassure the Deputy that the Northern Cross project is considered a strategic and priority project by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I hope the Deputy continues to use his considerable influence to help bring the project to fruition.</p></speech>

He is in a 14 ft. room with 23 other men.  They have cushions and some bunk beds.  He gets outside for 20 minutes, three times a week, on the weeks that he does actually get outside.  He can speak to his family once a week.  His three children and his wife are thousands of miles away.  They live in my constituency, in Elphin, in County Roscommon.  They miss him desperately.</p>  <p>  Robert is a renowned engineer.  He has spent much of his working life rebuilding war-torn areas and building hospitals, in particular.  That is very much the measure of the man that he is.  He was working in Iraq last year as the lead engineer for an engineering company alongside his colleague and deputy, Khalid Radwan, who was also detained.  The company Robert was working for as an employee had a contract dispute with the Central Bank of Iraq, whose headquarters they were there to rebuild.  These headquarters were seen as critical infrastructure to rebuilding Iraq.  On 1 April 2021 Robert returned to Baghdad to try to assist in ending the dispute.  During a meeting the Iraqi police entered and he was arrested.  On 25 August 2021, Robert was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and issued with a fine of $12 million.  On 16 March 2022, the United Nations Human Rights Council published a report on the case.  It concluded that the deprivation of liberty of Robert and Khalid, being in contravention of Articles 2, 7, 9, 10, 11, 19 and 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and articles 2, 9, 10, 11, 14 and 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, is arbitrary and falls within categories I, III and V.  The working group called on the Government of Iraq to take urgent action to ensure the immediate and unconditional release of both men.  The report went on to raise serious questions in relation to the trial proceedings, which I will not get into here.  The working group raised concerns around the conduct of the trial, and noted with grave concern that during the trial, the men did not have clarity around their charges.  The working group also discussed collusion in its report.</p>  <p>  Robert is not an Irish citizen, albeit his wife and three children are.  He is Australian.  We understand that the Government is limited in what it can do and cannot, for example, provide consular assistance.  However, I want to take this opportunity before the D&aacute;il rises to plead with the Irish Government to do anything it can do, engage with anyone it can and raise the case anywhere it can.  I understand that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is limited in what he can do.  However, I acknowledge that he has done what he can to date in relation to raising this issue.  He needs to continue to do that.  When I first met Robert's wife, the most mesmerising thing about the case and the thing I could not understand was that even if the company did something wrong, why would an employee be held to account for it?  It makes no sense.  Robert has now been in prison for over 14 months.  His health is deteriorating rapidly.  His two sons, his daughter and his wife are at home in Ireland.  In fact, they moved to Elphin because they bought the old convent and were doing it up to create a wellness centre for women recovering from an illness that Robert's wife, Desree, has herself.  That is the measure of the family we are talking about.  That is what they were doing in my constituency.  Robert is now in an Iraqi prison and has been on his own for the past 14 months.  I urge the Government to do more, to do anything in the world it can, to try to bring this absolutely horrendous and horrific situation to an end and to bring Robert home to his family.  </p></speech>

I want to extend our best wishes to Robert and his family.  What the Deputy has described is a hugely challenging situation.  It is desperate for any family to have to face that.  I am aware of the case of Robert Pether, who has been detained in Iraq for over a year along with his Egyptian colleague, Mr. Khalid Radwan.  Mr. Pether is an Australian engineer, and was working in Baghdad on a project to construct a new headquarters for the Central Bank of Iraq.  He was arrested in April 2021, and in August 2021, was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and issued with a fine of $12 million.  Mr. Pether is an Australian national, but his wife and children live here in Ireland.  Mr. Pether's imprisonment has understandably been a huge source of distress for his family.  The Department of Foreign Affairs has taken an active interest in this case.  The Minister has discussed the case with Ms Pether, and officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs have been in regular contact with Robert's wife.</p>  <p>  We note, with deep concern, the conclusions made by the UN working group on arbitrary detention on this case, and urge the Iraqi authorities to engage urgently and constructively with the working group on the issues raised.  Mr. Pether is an Australian national, and the Australian Government is the appropriate consular authority in this case.  In February, the Minister for Foreign Affairs discussed the case with the then Australian Foreign Minister, Ms Marise Payne.  Ms Payne detailed the extensive consular support being provided by the Australian Government.  Officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs have also been in contact with the Australian Embassy in Iraq and the Australian Embassy in Dublin to express concern about Mr. Pether, and the impact that this case was having on his Irish-resident family.  As the Deputy will understand, it would not be appropriate to comment in detail on an ongoing consular case of an international partner.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has also raised concerns over the case of Mr. Pether directly with the Iraqi authorities.  While he has made clear that Australia is the appropriate consular authority, he noted that Mr. Pether's family are based in Ireland, and highlighted the distress which this case is causing to them.  Officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs will continue to follow this case very closely and will keep in close contact with the family of Mr. Pether, with the relevant Australian authorities and with the Iraqi authorities as appropriate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.447" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1604" speakername="Claire Kerrane" time="17:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400055#FFF00100"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his response. It is important that he made reference to the fact that Mr. Pether's wife and children are living here and they are, indeed, Irish citizens.  All four members of the family are Irish citizens and while we and the family understand that consular assistance has to come from Australia, we too have a part to play.  I acknowledge what has been done to date but I take the opportunity today, as the D&aacute;il rises, to raise this case.  I have been in touch with the Minister for Foreign Affairs previously in respect of this case and I understand that he has done what he can to date.  The Minister of State mentioned that the Minister has raised concerns about the case directly with the Iraqi authorities.  When did the most recent engagement happen?  If this information is not available, perhaps he might ask the Minister to come back to me with it.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks the new Prime Minister of Australia has spoken out on this case and has also spoken to Iraqi authorities on the case.  That is welcome given that he is a newly elected prime minister.  It is important now that Australia picks this up and brings it to the next level, particularly given as I have said, that Mr. Pether's health is deteriorating rapidly.  The family are gravely concerned for his welfare and health.  I ask that Ireland and Australia come together to do what we can because, at the end of the day, his family are suffering more than anyone in this world in this case and they are Irish citizens.  They are our citizens and I believe that we can do more together with Australia to put the pressure on, particularly on the back of that UN report that is so grave in respect of its findings and conclusions.  It believes and has concluded that both men should be immediately released.  There is scope now on the back of that to go back and raise this issue again.</p></speech>

As the Deputy said, this is a challenging and concerning case and I thank her for raising it.  It is significant that she has raised it here in our Parliament and that is important to maintain that pressure.</p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs will continue to closely monitor the case of Mr. Pether and his Egyptian colleague, Mr. Khalid Radwan.  We understand the significant distress this case is causing from Mr. Pether's family here in Ireland.  Officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs will continue to remain in regular contact with Mr. Pether.  I do not have with me a date as to when the issue was most recently raised with the Iraqi authorities but I will ask the Minister to revert with a response on that.</p>  <p>  The Australian Government is continuing to provide high-level consular assistance to Mr. Pether.  As the Deputy will understand, it would not be appropriate to comment on the details of the case or on the consular assistance provided.  I assure her, however, that officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs will continue to remain in close contact with the relevant Australian officials and will continue to advocate for Mr. Pether and his family.  We will also, as appropriate, continue to raise concerns over Mr. Pether with Iraqi authorities.  It is our sincere hope that officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs will continue to follow this case closely and that a satisfactory outcome can be found in this case, above all, for the sake of Mr. Pether and his family.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.450" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1509" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="17:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400055#FFF00400"><p>I wish to raise the issue of the passport service because of the sheer volume of queries my office has received from people on a daily basis who are anxious to have their passports returned to them in advance of their travel dates.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge the tremendous work the staff have been doing.  When I have spoken with them, they have been both professional and courteous on every occasion.  They seem, however, to be snowed under with the sheer volume of passport applications they are receiving. </p>  <p>  Citizens suffered two years of the Covid-19 pandemic because of the necessary but challenging restrictions that were imposed to suppress the spread of the virus.  People were unable to travel abroad for two years.  One does not need to be a weather person to know which way the wind is blowing and one certainly did not have to be an expert in aviation trends to anticipate that there would be a large number of people seeking to travel after a two-year moratorium.</p>  <p>  Having spent 19 years myself in the travel industry, it was obvious that the industry would recover quickly and that people would travel for holidays, business, and, most important, to meet family members who are abroad.  Why were we not prepared for this when we knew that was going to happen?  Why were additional staff not sought during the pandemic?  Not knowing whether they are going to receive their passport two days before their flight happens places a tremendous burden of stress on parents who are looking forward to for what is for many of them is their first family holiday abroad.</p>  <p>  My office dealt with a lady earlier this summer who faced a challenging set of circumstances.  A family member had died suddenly in the UK and she wanted to attend the funeral.  As the Minister of State may know, such funerals do not happen quickly in the UK and, therefore, she had the time to get over there.</p>  <p>  She applied for a passport renewal, albeit with a name change following a divorce, and was told that by the office that it would not be able to escalate the passport application as she had no flight booked.  She could not book a flight as she was unsure whether she would get the passport or that it would be returned to in time.  The advice she was offered was either to drive from Limerick to London and back again, which in fairness is crazy, or to travel with an airline provider whose prices were four times the price of the provider that had earlier demanded the production of a passport.  Unfortunately, some airline providers demand the production of a passport to travel to England whereas others do not.  Needless to say, she missed that flight.</p>  <p>  Another family of five I spoke to submitted their application at the end of April with a flight date of 15 July.  It was a first-time application for a child born in November 2019.  The family were faced with the prospect of having to rebook flights or cancelling their plans.  Thankfully, their flight is the late flight tomorrow and their passport was dispatched today.  These types of turnaround times, however, are a little too close for comfort when people have spent money on flights and accommodation abroad.</p>  <p>  Staffing seems to be a key issue and some gaps have been filled by those who had worked previously in Covid-19 track and trace roles but this seems to be too little and far too late.  I ask that the Minister of State in his response states what extra steps the Department is taking to ensure that all citizens are issued with passports in advance and, ideally, further in advance of their travel dates and not so close to those dates as is the case at present.  I appreciate that there are staff retention challenges but it must be asked why we have these.  Why have one third of those persons who are offered temporary clerical roles declined the offer?  What is the reason for that?  Is it conditions or pay and why is there such a high attrition rate in that section?</p>  <p>  Another issue of concern in respect of the applications for passports is the Passport Office website.  Given there is such a backlog of passport applications and such a delay in the processing of passports, it would be expected that the home page of the office's website would display warnings about those delays but it does not.  When looking at the home page, one would think that there was nothing going wrong or strange and that there were no problems.  There is no easily visible warning about expected delays.  Perhaps such a warning should be put on the website when people are accessing it.  It might then deter them from submitting applications if the realistic times for processing the applications were readily visible.  I look forward to the Minister of State's response on this issue, please.</p></speech>

The service is already outperforming any previous year, despite the challenges that it has encountered over the past two years.  Prior to the pandemic, the busiest year for passports was 2019, when in excess of 900,000 passports were issued.  The passport service is currently outperforming 2019 by almost 20%.  More than 720,000 passports have been issued to date in 2022, compared to 634,000 in the whole of last year.</p>  <p>  As Deputies will appreciate, there has been a significant increase in passport demand after two years of pandemic-related travel restrictions.  This level of demand is not unique to Ireland.  In countries such as the UK and US, the turnaround time for all types of passports can be up to ten weeks.  During this period of unprecedented demand, the passport service has, in fact, decreased the processing times for first-time online applications from 40 to 25 working days.  This is a decrease of 40% for complex first-time applications since March of this year.</p>  <p>  Processing times for online adult renewals are among the fastest in the world, with almost half of these applicants receiving their passports within two working days.  To achieve these results and to continue to improve the service, the Department of Foreign Affairs has made an unprecedented investment in the passport service.  On staffing, more than 570 staff have been assigned to the service since June of last year, including 200 since May 2022.  The addition of these staff members has allowed the service to achieve its current turnaround times in the face of enormous demand.</p>  <p>  In addition to significantly more staff being assigned, the service has made important improvements that will help to ensure that passport applications can be processed within turnaround times, including assigning a large number of the new staff to the customer service hub, which has greatly increased the number of calls and webchats being answered and is assisting with customers getting access to the information they need.  In recent weeks, the number of calls handled by the hub has increased to more than 2,000 per day.  The passport service has worked with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to develop a system for verifying Garda witnesses on passport applications in cases where the Garda member's signature cannot be verified.  This system assists in reducing the number of applications that are delayed due to a failure to verify witness details.  Intensive training of new staff and upskilling of existing staff has been underway for several months to increase the resources that can process complex applications, such as first-time child applications.</p> <p>Passport Online is continuing to expand and is available to 97% of our citizens around the world.   The availability of Passport Online worldwide will continue to enhance the customer experience and mean even more efficiencies in the Passport Service.  The Passport Service is currently operating at its highest capacity ever, hitting an average of 6,000 passports per day, and considerable improvements are being seen across the system.  The Passport Service is confident that the increased resources that have been allocated will continue to improve the service for all our citizens.</p></speech>

I appreciate his comments on the volume of passport applications being received but that is no succour to people stressing over being unable to travel aboard for holidays.  Providing a passport is a basic function of the Department of Foreign Affairs and, unfortunately, it is often shambolic and a national embarrassment when people have put in applications on time and cannot travel for often very valid reasons.  I appreciate one should ideally make sure to have an in-date passport before booking flights, but, unfortunately, it is not always the case.  The Department has a responsibility to deliver for those seeking a passport and does not always succeed.  This is evidenced in the dramatic increase in complaints about the Passport Service.  I think there have been 359 so far this year.  People should not have to contact their local Deputy to expedite their application.  It is not what we should be doing but we are forced to do it.  This demonstrates the system is broken in parts.</p>  <p>  These long processing times are not specific to passport applications.  We see those booking driver tests facing a 14-week wait for a test date.  The Covid pandemic can be blamed for only so much.  It is obvious there was no forward planning and no anticipation of the huge volume of people who would seek to travel after restrictions were lifted, especially in the summer.  Coupling the problematic passport application process with the pre-boarding chaos witnessed at Dublin Airport in recent weeks has meant travelling from this State is more burdensome for some citizens than it should be.  We need to see solutions to this crisis.  We are in the peak period of summer travel.  Unless this matter is addressed soon, we will witness more disappointed applications into August and beyond.  </p>  <p>  One effective thing the Minister of State can do to address the backlog would be to establish a passport office in the North.  This year for the first time there were more applications for Irish passports than for British.  Recently, at a polling station in south Belfast in what is considered to be a unionist area during Assembly elections, I was pleased to see so many people go in to vote with their Irish passports in their hands.  A recent motion passed by the Seanad supported the establishment of such an office.  Will the Minister of State pass on my comments and suggestions on behalf of my constituents?  The current service cannot be described as efficient or effective; rather it is better described as exhausting and elongated.  </p></speech>

Many countries have experienced that rise in demand after Covid restrictions eased.  The Government and the Passport Service have responded.  Demand for passports fell by 30% in June, when just over 100,000 new applications were received, compared to 146,000 in May.  The Passport Service expects to see demand level off and return to more normal levels in the coming months and into next year.  The number of passport applications currently in the system has also dropped by 30% in a few weeks, from close to 200,000 to just over 140,000 this week.  This means the investment made in the Passport Service is paying off.  The Passport Service will continue to work to deliver enhanced customer service and experience in service delivery to customers, which is a critical citizens' service.</p>  <p>  There are two things citizens should know this summer.  First, the urgent appointment service in Dublin and Cork is available to people who need to renew their passports urgently in time for travel.  Second, Passport Online is up to four times faster than An Post passport for passport renewal applications and is the most efficient way to apply for a passport. </p>  <p>  I encourage all citizens planning to travel overseas this year to check their passports before looking to travel and to apply online in plenty of time.  I will take on board the points the Deputy has raised and bring them back to the Department.</p></speech>

I hope he is running across the corridors as we speak.  T&aacute; an t-&aacute;dh linn scoil cos&uacute;il le Gaelchol&aacute;iste Mhaigh Nuad a bheith againn i dtuaisceart Chill Dara.  Is scoil iontach &iacute;.  Cuireann s&iacute; go m&oacute;r le deiseanna oideachais i Maigh Nuad.  I am glad to share my time and am glad that an Teachta Lawless has made it.  I give my best wishes to Deputy Durkan, who is at home with Covid.  He would be here if he could, as would Deputy Catherine Murphy, if she were free.</p>  <p>  Gaelchol&aacute;iste Mhaigh Nuad is a multi-denominational secondary school that came from the heart of the community in north Kildare and from gr&aacute; don teanga i gCill Dara.  There is a passion in Maynooth and beyond to nurture it.  It is a credit to the pr&iacute;omhoide, M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Ceoin&iacute;n, na m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; involved in its running and the management.  It is blessed to have a parents' body that has been diligent in its communication with all Oireachtas Members about the Gaelchol&aacute;iste and the health and safety concerns they have for their children.  We have been waiting for this school for 20 years in the north of the county.  In this phase of the development of the school, it is operating upstairs in a shopping centre, above Dunnes Stores in Manor Mills in Maynooth, with dangerous roads for the children to cross to do most of their four subjects.  They have to go up to the old school building where Maynooth Post Primary School and Maynooth Community College were.  That is why I mentioned health and safety.</p>  <p>  We have been here before in Maynooth.  Transition year, TY, students from Maynooth used to do part of their education above the shopping centre in Maynooth and there was a big worry about the children going up and down.  The school opened two years ago with 30 students.  It now has 60 and will have over 100 this September.  Parents are naturally anxious about them going up and down.  I have been inundated with reports.</p></speech>

Deputy Catherine Murphy supports the motion as well.  We in Kildare tend to work together on these issues, which is a good and collaborative way to finish out the term.  It is very much a team effort.</p>  <p>  The points have already been outlined.  Gaelscoil Chill Dara, which took a long time to get established, campaigned for many years to have this second level Gaelscoil established in Kildare.  The current mayor of Kildare, Councillor Naoise &Oacute; Cear&uacute;il, is involved and his father, Colm &Oacute; Cear&uacute;il, led the campaign for over 20 if not 30 years to get it to this point.  It is only in the last couple of years they have established the school.  Though they have a new school, they are playing second fiddle and are receiving the hand-me-downs of the other schools.  Maynooth Post Primary School moved up the road from the old school site to the new site on Moyglare Road.  It is a brand spanking new school which took significant effort to get going and thankfully is up and running.  The old building has been nominated potentially for the Gaelchol&aacute;iste but that is not even in place yet because many of the students are in the Manor Mills Shopping Centre, and going to and fro from the shopping centre down the stairs, across the road and into the old school building.  They are the little sister or brother getting the hand-me-downs, rather than getting a building fit for purpose. </p>  <p> The difficulty is not only for the current students.  There is a significant demand for education through the medium of Irish at second level in Kildare.  That momentum and head of steam they built up and the excitement of finally getting their Gaelchol&aacute;iste approved in the area is being derailed and threatened because the lack of capacity and uncertainty means those children and families are in some cases understandably sending their children elsewhere, including outside of the county, or back into an English-language medium.</p>  <p>  This is for the benefit of all, including the medium of Irish, families in the school and prospective families.  I think progress is being made.  I have been talking to the Minister, Deputy Foley.  Perhaps the Minister of State can give us the latest position on that.  </p></speech>

I am taking this question on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Foley, who is regrettably unavailable.  I send best wishes to Deputy Durkan and Deputy Catherine Murphy and thank the Deputies for working on this issue together.  It is admirable.</p>  <p>  I will outline to the House the position with regard to the provision of permanent accommodation for Gaelchol&aacute;iste Mhaigh Nuad, County Kildare.  As the Deputies may be aware, Gaelchol&aacute;iste Mhaigh Nuad was established in 2020 as a multi-denominational Irish-medium Gaelchol&aacute;iste under the patronage of Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board.  The school has a current enrolment of 66 pupils for the 2021-22 school year.  The school is currently located in interim accommodation in Manor Mills pending delivery of permanent accommodation.</p> <p>As to the permanent accommodation solution for the school, it is intended that the Gaelchol&aacute;iste will be located in the former Maynooth Post Primary School building.  Pending delivery of the school's permanent accommodation, the Department recently approved funding to Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, KWETB, to undertake refurbishment works in the former Maynooth Post Primary School property to facilitate access to additional specialist accommodation by Gaelchol&aacute;iste Mhaigh Nuad.  This accommodation includes science, woodwork and home economics rooms.  The delivery of the refurbishment project has been devolved to KWETB.  The Department of Education understands that this project is due to be completed within the next two months.</p> <p> With regard to determining the options available in meeting the Gaelchol&aacute;iste's permanent accommodation needs, the Department of Education permitted KWETB to carry out an options study of the former post-primary school building, which is in KWETB'S ownership.  In order to ensure that optimal use is made of this property and in support of the achievement of value for money, KWETB appointed a consultant to undertake an options study of the property concerned.  KWETB has furnished the options study report to the Department and this is currently being assessed.  The Department is examining the proposals put forward in the study and it is its intention to consult KWETB regarding the matter in the near future with a view to finalising a long-term plan for the school.  I hope the Deputies will welcome that.</p></speech>

The school has been aware of this for several months according to the parents in Maynooth.  I can tell the Minister of State that you could not move anything with regard to their children's education without the parents of Maynooth knowing.  It actually has not started yet.  This school opened in the middle of a pandemic and it has done really well to reach a student population of more than 100 for the coming year.  Students have to go to the old site for four subjects, namely, science, woodwork, technology and PE.  That is a lot of travelling and they are losing approximately 20 minutes of education time with the ten minutes' walk either way.  It is a lot of time to be losing.  The school is severely hampered and there is no plan.  A shopping centre is not the right place for a school.  I hope the Minister will get back to me with regard to this work not having actually started.  I would appreciate it if he could check that out and get back to me.</p></speech>

As has been said, the refurbishment works are overdue and need to progress.  While they will be welcome when they do take place, these works are really a sticking plaster.  Some clarity on the long-term plan is needed.  It is not a bad idea for the school to occupy the site of the old post-primary school but, as I have said, it is not suitable in its current condition.  It would need a significant upgrade either through knocking it down and rebuilding or through a complete refurbishment of the building.  The school is looking for clarity.  The school, its board of management, the principal and the school team have managed well and are putting their best foot forward but they are really trying to attract pupils.  This problem really arises from the school's success because it has been so popular since approval for this new Gaelchol&aacute;iste was secured.  However, as I have said, that progress is threatened with derailment if parents have to decide in the next two or three years whether their children will attend school in a shopping centre or in an old dilapidated school building.  Perhaps they will vote with their feet and send their children elsewhere.  In the long term, that could undermine the viability of the school, which would be a shame as it is the culmination of a couple of decades' work to get it open in the first place.  It is thriving but it needs that certainty.  I believe the Minister, Deputy Foley, is to meet with Deputies after the break.  That is welcome and would represent progress.</p>  <p>  I am not sure whether I will get to speak again.  I see I will not.  I put on record my thanks to the Minister of State for help with another matter local to Kildare, in Bodenstown Cemetery, where he was very helpful to the community.  I want to acknowledge that while I am on my feet.  The Minister of State is on overtime tonight with all of the Topical Issue debates.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.466" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1507" speakername="Darren O'Rourke" time="17:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400057#HHH00800"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  I welcome the opportunity to move this Bill on Second Stage.  I thank my co-sponsors, Deputies Quinlivan, Cronin and Guirke.  I note the Government amendment which states that this Bill will be deemed to have been read a second time this day six months, that is, in January 2023.  I understand the rationale for this amendment and hope the Government will have accelerated its planning in the area of green hydrogen by that time and that it will have produced a comprehensive strategy before the new year.  </p>  <p>  Tuesday of this week saw the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications open a public consultation on the development of a hydrogen strategy for Ireland.  This was very welcome.  It goes to the core of what we are debating here today.  We brought this Bill forward with the intention of addressing a gap in Government policy with regard to green hydrogen.  We sought to be constructive and we are glad to see the Government now moving ahead in line with the intention of our Bill.  It is fair to say that the Government has come some way in its thinking on this issue and on the potential opportunity of green hydrogen.  That is also welcome.  </p>  <p>  We believe green hydrogen can play a central role in the decarbonisation of our economy.  It is emerging as a sustainable solution for the decarbonisation of many sectors including heavy transport, shipping, aviation and industry.  Both Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus now have hydrogen buses, which is an exciting development.  These buses are filled with hydrogen in a compressed gas state and water is the only by-product emitted through the vehicles' exhaust.  I met with Bus &Eacute;ireann earlier this week and it outlined a positive experience so far with its small hydrogen fleet.  This fleet operates on the 105X route, which runs in my constituency of Meath East.  Although this area is in its infancy, it highlights the potential applications and benefits of green hydrogen.  In the North, Wrightbus is now building hydrogen buses.  This highlights the need to plan our hydrogen strategy on an all-island basis, as we have consistently stated.</p>  <p>  The hydrogen strategy consultation paper published two days ago further notes that hydrogen is also used in the energy, aerospace, electronics, pharmaceutical and medical industries here, albeit in a limited role.  As the technology improves and advances are made, it is important that we are in a position to capitalise on the use of green hydrogen in as many areas as possible in order to help meet our climate targets.  Ireland has some of the best offshore wind potential in the world, which affords us the opportunity to become a leader in green hydrogen production through the harnessing of just a portion of this wind energy.  This hydrogen can be used domestically to reduce our carbon emissions in line with the national objective of achieving a carbon-neutral economy and society by 2050 or can be sold on international markets as energy, thereby raising revenue for investment in public services here.  Ireland has a major opportunity to exploit our wind resource for the production of green hydrogen, which can then be exported to Europe to meet demand.  The German-Irish Chamber of Industry and Commerce has already formed a German-Irish hydrogen council in response to the interest expressed in forming closer relationships with Germany in the field of green hydrogen.</p>  <p>  Green hydrogen and renewable energy products hold significant potential to create jobs in rural and regional Ireland.  This can be seen in the hydrogen-related projects already in the pipeline.  Merck's renewable energy division is planning a &euro;200 million green hydrogen plant in Mayo while Bord na M&oacute;na has a renewable hub with hydrogen production capabilities planned for the midlands.  The ESB's multibillion euro Green Atlantic at Moneypoint plan would see the conversion of the existing coal-fired power station to a renewable energy hub that would include capacity for 1,400 MW of offshore wind, a wind turbine construction base and green hydrogen production and storage facilities.</p> <p>It is great to see ambitious plans like this from semi-State companies.  It is exactly the type of State-led investment we have been calling for to ensure we remain in control of vital energy production in the years ahead.  Ireland's green hydrogen potential is contingent on the success of our offshore wind sector and there is a significant amount of work to be done in that area.  I might come back to that in my closing remarks.</p></speech>

The amendment from the Government would delay the Bill for six months.  I would rather it was not delayed but we will accept that amendment and move forward.  It is positive that the Government is listening to what we have put forward.  We are very fortunate on this island that we have an abundance of natural resources, in both the waters within the State and those that surround it.  We are very well-positioned to harness the potential of green hydrogen.</p>  <p>  Green hydrogen is made using only renewable power through a process known as electrolysis.  For those who have an interest in the science, electrolysis is a process that involves passing an electrical current through water, causing the water to dissociate itself into its constituent chemicals, namely, hydrogen and oxygen.  As it is created through 100% renewable power, it is the green alternative to other fields.  Across the globe, it is emerging as a key renewable and, importantly, sustainable solution for industries looking to decarbonise.  It has been considered for potential use in both maritime and aviation transport.  In our State, hydrogen-powered buses have recently been introduced.  While limited in numbers, they have had an impact and while currently expensive, they show the potential of hydrogen as a solution.</p>  <p>  Despite its benefits and the abundant availability of necessary resources, we do not have a hydrogen strategy as of yet.  That is quite bizarre.  We are playing catch-up.  The European Commission published its hydrogen strategy two years ago in July 2020 and Scotland published its strategy in 2015.  We are in serious danger of being left behind.  If we are serious about the use of renewable energy, we need to make the most of our resources and create a hydrogen network.  Without such a strategy, our ability to attract funding will be hampered, as will our potential to become a world leader in green hydrogen, which I believe we can do.  The green hydrogen we produce could be used to reduce our carbon emissions and support us in our ambition to be a carbon-neutral economy by 2050.  Not only that, but the potential exists to sell this energy product on the international markets.</p>  <p>  In an increasingly unstable world where we are still dealing with the shocks of the economic crash, Brexit, the Covid pandemic and the illegal Russian invasion of Ukraine, it has never been more important to build energy security in our own country.  This will be good for businesses, consumers and the entire economy.  Ireland has huge potential to develop offshore wind farming but we need to ensure ports and coastal communities are supported in these efforts.  That support is seriously lacking at the moment.  Unfortunately, Belfast's D1 harbour, which I hope to visit soon, remains the only facility on the island that can provide both staging and construction services for offshore wind farms.  That said, there are a number of ports across the State that are at various stages of development.  I am very proud to say that ports in the mid-west region, including Shannon Foynes and Moneypoint, are looking at investments to get them to the point where they can service the construction of offshore wind energy.  Other ports such as Killybegs, the Cork docklands and Rosslare are further along in this development project.  The ramping up of investment in these ports and the adoption of all-Ireland approach to issues of energy and climate action will be critical in our efforts to reach climate targets.</p>  <p>  Let me be abundantly clear on this next point.  If we do not provide the necessary investments for our ports, green hydrogen and offshore wind projects will be directed to countries that are willing to provide such investment.  I have no doubt that if we do not build the infrastructure needed in Ireland, others will build ports on the west coast of Britain, in France and even in the Netherlands.  In an ironic twist, they will possibly sell their energy to us.  The country that should be a world leader in this area will become an importer of energy created by wind and hydrogen if we do not get our act together.  Irish wind farms could create jobs in France and support businesses in Holland and across Europe if we get our act together.  I understand from feedback from those involved in the industry that some of these foreign ports are already engaging with these projects.  Strategic investment must be directed urgently to our ports to enable them to build the necessary infrastructure to support the construction of offshore wind energy.  We need to ensure, as far as possible, that we build our own energy security and develop an ability to sell any excess.</p>  <p>  This is not to suggest that we as a State have been entirely idle on the issue.  The German-Irish Chamber of Industry and Commerce has formed a hydrogen council to forge closer relationships in the field of green energy.  Plans for green hydrogen facilities are already in place for both Moneypoint in County Clare and the &euro;200 million green hydrogen plant in Mayo.  However, without an international green hydrogen strategy we are limited in our potential for success.  Our Bill is simple but crucial.  It seeks to ensure that this State is prepared and ready to realise our full potential in the field of green hydrogen.  It would have the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications publish a strategy within six months, including provisions for consultation with relevant stakeholders.  I welcome that the Government has initiated of the consultation stage of this process.  I ask people to engage with that and I look forward to moving forward over the next six months.</p></speech>

I have noted the Government's amendment.  Normally I would be very disappointed with such an amendment but I acknowledge that we are having a public consultation with interested stakeholders.  It is very important that we get this right so that is welcome.</p>  <p>  I have a particular constituency interest in green hydrogen which I will address here.  It is not only about its use as a fuel but the context of its wider impact on how we work, live and do business.  It is a clean, green, renewable and sustainable fuel coming from the electrolysis of water.  From source to use, it has huge potential to change transport and heating in north Kildare and all across the Thirty-two Counties.  In north Kildare we have a highly aware and climate-conscious population, which is hugely concerned that the local biodiversity and ecosystem must be protected for this and future generations.  This was evidenced in Leixlip recently by a huge outcry over pollution in the River Rye.  People were extremely distressed about it.  The lockdown also gave people a sense of awareness of the local area and the fragility of the ecosystems and habitats.</p>  <p>  There is also a big business and economic component to the importance of this Bill for my constituency.  Kildare has become a major logistics hub, with a lot of the big players having warehousing and logistical operations in Kildare.  Due to that, there is major use of HGVs in the county, as well as all the work and jobs involved in meeting customer demand and expectations across the island.  A company's reputation would only be as good as its ability to fulfil customer demand.  The interconnectedness of community and nature is the same interconnectedness between logistics, warehousing, production and retail.  Clean green hydrogen is crucial to our environment in north Kildare in every sense, be that natural, transport or economic.</p>  <p>  This demonstrates the importance of joined-up thinking and big picture politics.  In north Kildare we have suffered from a distinct lack of such thinking and our economies and communities are suffering due to this lack of big picture politics.  Just this week I addressed the lack of connection between planning, housing and public transport.  People are stranded in housing estates in rural communities.  Despite our belief in the power of the bicycle, a lot of my constituents are so far away from education and work that cycling is not always an option for them and they do not have access to proper public transport.  Hydrogen could be very important for fuelling public transport and as a clean way of fuelling cars.  Hydrogen engines will be critical as public transport embraces this new green technology.</p>  <p>  Green hydrogen also has huge potential in aviation.  As an island nation, we should never have sold off our national airline and left all those talented workers to the mercy of the private market.  A growing number of people are talking about not travelling by air or cutting it to a minimum for the sake of the planet.  I hope the use of hydrogen in aviation will have a major impact environmentally, as well as on customer choice.  We are an island nation.  Unlike our European neighbours, we do not have the option of hopping on a train in our capital city and being taken to a capital city in another country.</p> <p>That option simply is not available to us, so we have to be realistic.  Climate action has to suit the citizen too.  We have to make the best of it and this is an option.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Climate Action, I am aware of the urgency of the issue.  I accept the amendment.  I am delighted that this is going ahead to consultation.</p></speech>

I am also grateful for the engagement of Deputies on this issue.  My Department and I have considered their suggestions with great care.  Therefore, while I acknowledge the intention of this Bill, it is not required.  The Government has already committed to prioritising the development of a hydrogen strategy in the national energy security framework.</p><p>I will now outline the important work that has been undertaken to fulfil this commitment.  It is important to note that work on developing and delivering a hydrogen strategy for Ireland is already under way.  I mentioned that the Government has committed to prioritising the development of a hydrogen strategy in the national energy security framework.  This framework was developed to address the challenges of ensuring the ongoing and long-term security of affordable energy supply.  It sets out a number of measures to accelerate the investment in renewables planned in the climate action plan.  This includes a hydrogen strategy for Ireland as a key priority.</p><p>Green hydrogen, which is hydrogen produced from renewable sources, has been identified in the climate action plan as having the potential to support decarbonisation across several sectors including heavy goods transport, high-temperature heat for industry and electricity generation.  It is intended that the hydrogen strategy will expand on the role of hydrogen in Ireland's energy system and the actions needed for its development.  In addition, work is under way on the review of the security of supply of Ireland&rsquo;s electricity and natural gas systems.  It will be done in parallel with the development of the hydrogen strategy to ensure that long-term security needs take future hydrogen technologies into account.</p><p>As an essential part of the work of preparing the hydrogen strategy, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications recently launched a consultation seeking the views of stakeholders and interested parties to inform the development of the strategy.  A comprehensive consultation paper has been developed setting out various areas of interest to be considered in the development of the hydrogen strategy and inviting stakeholders' views on an extensive range of specific questions to be answered in this regard.  There is an eight-week period for the consultation, which will mean that the detailed work on analysis of the various submissions will begin in early September.  It is anticipated that the submissions received will be extensive, given the high degree of public interest in this topic and its importance both for Ireland's future energy security and its high export potential.  The aim is to have the strategy in place later in the year.</p><p>While I fully agree with the objectives of this Bill, I must stress that it is seeking to address an issue, the hydrogen strategy, which the Government has already committed to prioritising in the national energy security framework, and that strong progress has already been made.  Therefore, it is appropriate for further consideration to be deferred until such time as the consultation has been completed, analysis of the replies has been undertaken and the hydrogen strategy has been published.</p></speech>

I was at a Cabinet subcommittee.  I will briefly add to what the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, has said.  We are trained on developing this strategy.  We agree with the Opposition that it is central to the development of our energy future.  There is real potential for large-scale offshore wind energy and other renewable sources, which can use electrolysis to create green hydrogen as the centre of our industrial and energy strategy.  It is at an early stage for every country.  Even other countries in Europe which are talking a lot about hydrogen are the start of their development paths for large-scale green hydrogen.  It is likely to be initially centred around large industrial users, power generation and transport users rather than being distributed widely.  In the development of our offshore wind energy plan, which will be State-led, we can make sure that we incorporate the hydrogen plan.  The two go together.</p>  <p>  The public consultation, which was started as part of the development of our hydrogen strategy, is critical.  We believe that the Government is doing what the Bill is proposing.  We look forward to coming back in six months, having delivered the sort of strategy that is being proposed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2022-07-14a.473" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1451" speakername="Matt Carthy" time="18:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2022071400059#KKK00400"><p>I commend my colleague Deputy O'Rourke, along with Deputies Quinlivan and Cronin, on tabling this Bill.  I thank the Minister for being here and for the response.  I commend the fact that we are finally moving towards having a hydrogen strategy for the State.  I would argue forcefully that it needs to be an all-Ireland strategy insofar as is possible.  I am sure many will be surprised to hear that we do not actually have a hydrogen strategy.  It is telling that we have all the debates about climate action, that we know that green hydrogen can become an invaluable mechanism to try to achieve our climate action targets, and that we have a consultation process in 2022 about targets to be reached in 2030.  It is symptomatic of the challenges that we face to reach our climate targets.</p>  <p>  I will make one point about what that strategy should look like once complete.  I accept that we need to hear from stakeholders, experts, communities and industries about how we can have a fit-for-purpose green hydrogen strategy that delivers its full potential.  We need to learn from the mistakes in other areas, particularly with respect to onshore wind energy, which never fully reached its potential and probably never will.  That is largely due to the fact that it was completely outsourced and left to the private sector to deliver.  The only consideration for the location of onshore wind farms became whether a private company could source land.  Virtually nothing else was taken into account besides where land was available for purchase.  We saw something that should have been a positive development for renewable energy become a source of conflict within communities and between individual landowners.  It meant we never reached our full potential, because we never set out, at a Government level, a strategy that would ensure we had the best possible resources for onshore wind energy.  We did not have a strategy about the optimum placement of turbines or how they would connect to the grid.  I would argue strongly that the final strategy and roll-out must be Government-led.  This cannot just become another mechanism whereby the State pays millions in taxpayers' money in subsidies but has no control of who benefits from it and how.</p>  <p>  I want to comment on the ongoing debate on sectoral targets, which were due to be released this week.  That has not happened.</p><p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock</i></p>  <p>We are told it did not happen because there is a conflict between the respective Departments of the Ministers, Deputies Ryan and McConalogue.  We have seen the outworking of what I consider a very silly debate.  We hear some in this House saying climate action is the enemy of agriculture and we hear others on the so-called left trying to frame it the other way around, claiming agriculture is somehow the enemy of climate action.</p> <p> We can have all the debates we want on whether the target should be 22% or 30%, but unless we have a strategy that will deliver whatever target is set, the figures are, in effect, meaningless.  I deal on an ongoing basis with a very large number of areas within the agriculture sector in which there are targets being missed annually.  Forestry is a perfect example.  The programme for Government sets out a commitment that 8,000 ha of new afforestation will be planted.  Since the Government came into office, it has hardly hit the 2,000 ha mark.  I am told this year could be the worst ever in terms of new afforestation.  I note this is the responsibility of a Green Party Minister of State.  The failure to meet the targets annually has impacts because the Government's entire climate action strategy is based on the assumption we have been planting 8,000 ha for the past three years.  Nobody has explained to me what happens when the Government fails to do what it set out to do.  We must ask ourselves why the Government is failing in this regard.  Why is it reaching only a quarter of its target?  The answer is it has alienated the very people it needs to implement its strategy.  In fact, there is no strategy, only a set of targets without a plan to achieve them.</p> <p> It is the same in the case of organic farming.  The EU has set a target of achieving 25% of agricultural land under organic production. One of the most shocking aspects of the programme for Government, especially considering the Green Party had just signed up to it and there was going to be a Green Party Minister of State with responsibility in this area, was its target of 7.5% organic production. That target was set, we were told, with the Green Party in government, because it is the current EU average.  In fact, it is the average from 2018; the figure is now closer to 10%.  We are chasing a target that is already three years old and failing miserably to meet it.</p> <p> Across all areas of agriculture, farmers are willing and able to make a positive contribution on climate action objectives.  The Government, rather than supporting them, is putting blockages in their way.  At the same time, members of the Government are taking to the airwaves to talk about 30% cuts in emissions.  Nobody has explained whether that means a 30% cut in food production, and what the consequences of that will be, or if it means different types of productions, in which case the question arises as to how we make the transitions.  I have the same message for the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and his Department as I have for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and his Department.  If they want to set a target, they need to do so in conjunction with setting out a roadmap for how it will be achieved.  Otherwise, we are just having another silly debate about numbers that mean nothing.  I have a fear the Government is going to become the best in the world at setting climate action targets but the worst in the world at delivering climate action.</p> <p> There needs to be a sea change in how we approach this task.  If we do it in the way in which the Minister, Deputy Ryan, has developed a reputation for doing it, which is acting in conflict with communities, particularly rural communities, and working people and families in general, then we are on the road to nowhere.  I appeal for a sea change.  I welcome that the Government has accepted this Bill, albeit on a delayed basis.  I welcome that we will have a hydrogen strategy.  We need to do the same in respect of solar energy.  I am currently writing a report on behalf of the agriculture committee on how our farms can be used as a source of solar energy generation.  It is mind-boggling the hoops farmers have to jump through to contribute.  Some of them have farm buildings with solar panels on the roof but they are forbidden by law to connect them to the grid because of the form of grant they receive.  Nonsensical obstacles are being put in the road and they are turning people away from contributing positively, which, in my experience, the vast majority want to do.</p> <p> Let us change tack on all of this.  Rather than just citing numbers, let the Government set out how it plans to achieve those numbers.  Rather than having silly debates about targets of 25%, 26% or 27%, let us set out for the world to see what a target of 22%, 25% or 30% would mean and what needs to be done to achieve it.  We need to bring the public into a real, commonsensical, forward-looking and progressive debate rather than the silly rhetorical arguments that have been the hallmark of the Government's approach up to now.</p></speech>

I support it on behalf of the Labour Party and I am glad we are having such a constructive and collaborative debate on it.  The Government's proposal to adjourn the Second Reading of the Bill for six months has been accepted by the proposers.  This is sensible given that a public consultation is under way and it is such an important issue on which a good deal of preparatory work needs to be done.</p>  <p>  I very much welcome the concept behind the Bill, which is the introduction of a statutory basis for a green hydrogen strategy.  It is an issue I have raised on a number of occasions since I was elected to the House.  I recently tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister, Deputy Ryan, on the topic.  We are all conscious that green hydrogen has always been the energy future, but there is a good deal of work still to be done to ensure it can become a viable source at scale.  As we know, most hydrogen is produced by fossil fuels and is, therefore, known as grey hydrogen, but it can also be produced using renewable sources such as wind and solar power.  That is the basis for the green hydrogen that is the subject of this Bill.  The World Energy Council recently highlighted the challenges to scaling up hydrogen in an energy system, the main one being the chicken-and-egg problem of supply and demand and another being the problem of cost.  Green hydrogen costs more than $5 per kg in the West but just as solar energy has become affordable to produce over time, the same can be said of green hydrogen.  It is vital this energy source is made economically viable.</p>  <p>  We need a green hydrogen strategy.  As the Minister said, it is both an industrial and an energy strategy.  In Ireland, we have an opportunity to build out our renewable capacity to ensure the ability, also based on renewables, to provide much greater energy security for our country.  This is a major priority as we see the brutal war on Ukraine continuing to unfold.  Indeed, we can become a world leader in renewables and offshore wind production.  Green hydrogen must be a part of that strategy.  We welcome the idea of a statutory basis for the strategy, as well as the public consultation and the work the Government is doing in this area.  If we can build out such a strategy, it will allow us to become a green hydrogen exporter in place of a fossil fuel and liquefied natural gas, LNG, importer.  This will have substantial benefits for us and in terms of achieving climate targets internationally.</p>  <p>  According to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, electricity accounts for only 20% of our energy system, with the majority still produced by fossil fuels.  We will require more than electrification to reduce the amount of carbon emitted by our energy system.  Already, our 2030 targets will require a reliance on other sources for days when there is little sun or wind.  We saw that last year when there was a diminished wind supply during the summer months.  During this transition, energy security must be to the fore of new policies.  The increasingly alarming reports of energy shortages this winter, with potential rationing of fuel and energy, are focusing all our minds on the need to ramp up our capacity to produce energy through other sources such as wind, especially offshore wind, solar and green hydrogen.  We must develop the infrastructure to produce hydrogen and to be able to store it.</p> <p>We must produce hydrogen that is green and produced through renewable sources and that can then be used to power sectors including heavy transport, industry and indeed data centre power generation too.  I listened to Deputy Cronin's remarks about cars and transport in her own area and the idea of hydrogen as the fuel to power transport.  There have been low-emission bus trials here in Dublin with hydrogen-fuelled buses.  There is real potential there for an absolute sea-change in how our public transport is fuelled.  It is very exciting and a very positive development.  While there is discussion as to the urgent need to phase out the use of energy intensive technologies we also need to build capacity while we are changing our habits.</p> <p> I will not take any more time and I thank An Leas-Cheann Comhairle for letting me in.  I very much welcome the Bill.  It is time to develop and then implement a clear strategy both to build hydrogen capacity and to ensure that our hydrogen infrastructure is completely based on green hydrogen produced from renewable sources.</p></speech>

It is around this time that I make my apologies to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Ceann Comhairle and the wider staff of Leinster House and thank them very much for how much they enable me.  I have added my apologies for the times when I do possibly test people but these things need to be done.</p>  <p>  I commend Deputies O'Rourke, Quinlivan, Cronin and Guirke.  This Bill is a fine piece of work.  I am very glad that we are seeing action from the Government in relation to it.  I thank the Minister, Deputy Ryan, for showing up.  That shows intent and it is welcome.</p>  <p>  I will not disagree with anything that has already been said.  A green hydrogen strategy is an absolute necessity.  It has to be part of the wider renewable framework and must be part of our getting the work around wind energy correct.  It is almost trite to say but we have to recognise that wind energy is something that we can become a super power in.  I had to listen to some of the Minister's Government colleagues - they may have all been from a certain political party - who spoke of their economic competence and inferred that we do not have any.  They spoke of the wonderful economy they had put in play.  They may have left out difficulties including the housing crisis, the cost of childcare and other issues that were impacting on people before this cost-of-living crisis.  If the Government is to be real about dealing with the issues that we have, and the over-reliance of foreign direct investment - none of us are taking away from the huge benefit this State has derived from foreign direct investment and from its importance - we have a facility here with renewables, with green hydrogen in particular which is part of the wider solution with wind energy and we really need to make it happen.  The public consultation process needs to happen as quickly as possible and we must ensure that there is a proper road map and strategy that can deliver.</p>  <p>  There has been great evolution with electric vehicles.  A great deal of work has been done on the technology.  It may be a considerable time before it can apply to bigger vehicles, particularly buses or haulage, but we will get to that point eventually.  Green energy may be a medium-term solution that will work in transport but it has a real part to play.  Others have spoken earlier about the electrolysis process by which green hydrogen can be produced particularly using wind energy.  It has a huge part to play in relation to storage which will be a vital part of us putting this infrastructure together.</p>  <p>  We must make sure we have the grid infrastructure.  Considerable work has been done to ensure that we have the framework around planning.  There are still pieces of work to be done around some aspects of planning and there are also the wider issues.  The Attorney General is still carrying out the review of planning.  We all know the difficulties with planning up and down the State.  Some of it relates to insufficient resourcing with An Bord Plean&aacute;la or the courts.  There are things that need to be fixed along with the work that needs to be done specifically on wind energy.  I am aware that there will be changes in the coming period.  Some of the legislation that the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, also related to that.  We need to make sure we dot every i and cross every t and that we can deliver something that works.</p>  <p>  It was said earlier that we all know the issues around planning where there has not been sufficient interaction with communities.  With better planning projects engagement happens with communities at a very early stage so that there is an element of community buy-in and community pay-back.  You will not have the same level of antagonism but it also means the community is involved at a very early stage and we catch those mistakes.  Deputy Carthy spoke about the difficulties we are all aware of around onshore wind and we need to make sure we do not have the same difficulty with offshore wind.</p>  <p>  Deputy Carthy's comments were fair, particularly on microgeneration.  Farmers consistently say that none of the grants for renewables, whether it is solar panels or microgeneration, has been fit for purpose.  He is also correct about the false, lazy narrative about farming and farmers.  Back when Deputy Carthy was an MEP and I was a councillor, we attended an IFA meeting at Monasterboice and I was taken aback at where a huge number of those farmers wanted to go.  They all accepted that we are in a changed world and that things are moving.  But as others have said, the only way that we can deliver decarbonisation and emission reductions and the percentage reductions at any time, is if they are provided with a road map.  These farmers are people that need to be engaged with.  They are only too willing to deliver on many projects and many of them have engaged with these grant processes and used them but they found that none of them was fit for purpose or able to deliver what the farmers wanted and what we and our society need in general.  There is an onus on the Government and the Minister to engage at that stakeholder level and sometimes we will get further than it might seem in the public domain where people can get involved in a bit of game-play.  Obviously, I myself would never lower myself to that type of politicking but others are not quite as sound as me, as I often tell my wife.  She does not necessarily believe me.</p>  <p>  This is vital work that is being done, particularly by the team in front of me.  I welcome that the Government is running in this direction.</p>  <p>We have an opportunity to make this State, hopefully, eventually a country.  Deputy O'Rourke said that if we are really serious from now on, we need to ensure we have an all-Ireland strategy in nearly everything we do.  We all know the conversation that is taking place.  The time will come when there will be a referendum and constitutional change.  We need to ensure we have all the preparations done.  Specifically for infrastructure that we will require for a considerable amount of time, we need to deliver the changes that are absolutely necessary.  We need to make sure this public consultation happens and that there is Government commitment.  I welcome what many have said.</p> <p> During the pandemic we saw that when action needed to be taken, it was only when the State and states across the Europe took action that we were able to deliver.  The State must do the heavy lifting to ensure we can produce a strategy.  With green hydrogen or as it relates to the wider idea of renewables and specifically wind energy, we need to ensure that roadmap is put in place while also dealing with the other difficulties, particularly those that Deputy Carthy laid out much more eloquently than I have.</p></speech>

I agree with Deputies O'Rourke and &Oacute; Murch&uacute; that we need to take an all-island approach to this.  We need to think bigger again and take a European approach.  We will not make the decarbonisation to new energy system as an island alone.  It will require co-operation with the United Kingdom and our continental European colleagues.  It is a regional balancing system and a regional renewable system feeding into a hydrogen system.  Electricity interconnection, gas interconnection and common gas strategies will be critical for security as we switch away from fossil fuel, particularly Russian gas, and develop the alternative.</p>  <p>  In Ireland our ports will have a critical role.  It will be Dublin, Belfast, Foyle and a range of the operation or maintenance ports, but also, in particular, Shannon, Cork and Rosslare ports.  I could mention a range of ports.  The centre of this new industrial revolution will be based on ports for a variety of reasons.  Shannon and Cork are likely to be centre stage.  Going back to what we said about this being an industrial strategy as well as an energy strategy, oil refinery, power generation, pharmaceutical and advanced manufacturing industries are all located around Cork Harbour.  The ability to bring that offshore wind power ashore, convert it to hydrogen and-or ammonia or other fuels and then use it in the sort of industrial applications and the power generation sector we already have will be centre stage.</p>  <p>  The same applies in the Shannon Estuary.  Where are our emissions?  Where is our industrial base?  Where is our gas use?  It is in facilities like Aughinish Alumina, Irish Cement and Moneypoint - not for gas but currently coal - where our power generation is.  As the ESB has indicated, the real efficiencies will come where we bring offshore wind energy ashore.  It is used in power generation and on those points of strong grid connection.  Hydrogen is then used as a backup storage fuel so that when the wind is not blowing, we have a 100% zero-carbon backup power supply that uses the same hybrid grid connection providing efficient use of existing energy assets and of that offshore wind energy.</p>  <p>  Similarly, with ports, it will be hydrogen to ammonia for transport, fuel and shipping.  Even in Shannon Airport there is the potential to look at the use of hydrogen in synthetic fuels in the future, leading to zero-carbon flights.  That is why much of the development will take place around the ports.  That is where the offshore wind energy will come ashore.  That is where we will have the capability and the industrial tradition to be able to do this.  This is large scale.  There is no point going small when converting to hydrogen or using hydrogen; we need to go big.</p>  <p>  Our phase 1, 2 and 3 offshore wind plans are exactly the phasing to allow us to develop and use this.  Phase 1 relates to the relevant projects on the east coast primarily feeding into Dublin Port and a new transmission system in Dublin used to power cars and heat our homes as well as run our data centres, our industry.  We then move south and west in phase 2.  It is not just those ports.  We can look at Great Island and other locations.</p>  <p>  It is possible to see that hybrid interconnection between offshore wind and onshore grid backed up by hydrogen power as a continual seamless indigenous secure energy system.  It can also be exported through interconnectors, gas pipelines or the shipping of, for example, ammonia, as I mentioned.  It is a balancing system because we will have a surplus with our wind power at the scale it is, our sea area being seven times our land area.  Phase 3 is the 30 GW opportunity.  That is why we need to transport it as part of a wider European energy security system.  That is where we will go.</p>  <p>  That strategy will not all be written in the next six months.  It needs to be an iterative strategy.  We need to learn by doing and learn from other countries.  What the Portuguese and Dutch are doing at the moment is interesting.  The British, Germans, Spanish and Swedes are all going in this direction.  We can learn from our European colleagues.  We must collaborate North-South and east-west.  I agree with the Deputies on that.</p></speech>

I thank all those who contributed to a good debate tonight.  I thank the Minister for being here in person.</p>  <p>  There are a number of things to take forward.  There are key areas where climate action is clearly in the social and economic interest of people and, of course, in the environmental interest of people and the planet.  We need to go after that low-hanging fruit rather than constantly framing climate action as the stick without providing people with alternatives.  In key areas, many of them mentioned already, we can empower communities, the regions, rural areas and farmers.  There is enormous opportunity in this if it is delivered in the right way.  This is an example of that.</p>  <p>  The challenge, of course, is that it is so all-encompassing and covers so many fronts that we need the capacity to deliver it.  That is why it is essential for Government to prioritise those areas that will return the maximum social, economic and environmental benefit rather than getting into the weeds.  There are a number of examples where whole communities and whole sectors locked horns.  Invariably people's backs get up and positions become entrenched.</p>  <p>  It is essential for Government to prioritise and provide the resources and support to deliver on key objectives because we have not had that experience to date.  This area is an example of it more broadly in terms of the offshore wind potential that we have.  Sinn F&eacute;in has repeatedly raised concerns about the slow pace of our offshore wind energy development and the capacity constraints at planning and other levels within the system.  We are not on our own in that regard.  As I have discussed with the Minister previously, agencies such as EirGrid, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, MARA and the CRU need to be resourced and financed to deliver on the potential that is there, at all times ensuring that systems are robust, comprehensive, biodiversity sensitive and environmentally sensitive.</p>  <p>  Deputy Carthy spoke about shortcuts, fast-tracking and bypassing the considerations of communities, and in certain cases bypassing the considerations of the environment requiring us to go back and redo or undo what was done.</p> <p>We need increased efficiency and responsiveness in the planning system, but we must ensure that it does not run roughshod over communities, the environment or biodiversity.</p> <p> We know there are challenges in terms of the cost of renewables here.  If we do not bring down the cost of renewables, green hydrogen will not be a viable commercial proposition.  I have raised that issue with the Minister previously.  If we are to realise the potential of green hydrogen, we need to look towards a ring-fenced floating offshore renewable electricity support scheme, and there needs to be clear indication in that regard. The industry is stating that there is only a 50-50 chance at this stage - in 2022 - that we will make our 2030 targets in terms of renewables.  That is a deep concern.  I say that not to score political points or anything like it, but the Government has a responsibility to ensure that the resources and capacity are there.  It will have the support of the Opposition if it does that.  This approach aligns perfectly with environmental, social and economic objectives.  I encourage the Minister and the Government to take said approach rather than getting into the weeds or anywhere else in order to lock horns with individuals or sectors.</p> <p> As stated, I welcome the Government's engagement on this issue.  If the Minister is honest, he will acknowledge that there has been a step change in terms of the position in respect of hydrogen.  Several factors have contributed to that, not least the criminal invasion of Ukraine by Russia.  That conflict has changed the whole energy landscape and forced everyone to prioritise the opportunities that exist, including those relating to hydrogen.  I look forward to engaging further with the Minister on this issue.  I encourage people to engage with the public consultation process.  There is an emerging sector that will be eager to engage.</p> <p> This needs to be about more than strategies.  We have lots of public consultation, plans and strategies - we need more - but what we need in respect of these is delivery.  If the Minister begins to deliver, he will have the support of the Opposition and, I am sure, others.</p></speech>
