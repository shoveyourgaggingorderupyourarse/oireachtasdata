    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-10a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121000003#A00100"><p>Community facilities, businesses, cr&egrave;ches, leisure centres, hotels, pubs, marts, you name it, are all under extraordinary pressure because of the rising costs of insurance.  Many of us in this House have met a range of groups across the country that feel their enterprises are endangered by the dramatically escalating insurance costs and premiums.  Many businesses are under significant threat.  There are quite a number of fraudulent cases, which are a significant factor in the rising costs of insurance and in the culture of claiming at any cost.</p> <p><i>The Irish Independent</i>, in a recent undercover investigation, has also reported that some GPs and solicitors are contributing to this culture of fraudulent and exaggerated claims by amending and holding back vital information in terms of medical reports and some sort of interaction between elements within both professions.  In that context, it is fair to say that the Government's response to date, going back over the past three years and the various commissions that have been established, has been one of considerable inertia, with delay after delay and a lack of urgency in grappling with the essentials of this crisis.<br/><br/>I welcome the intention of the Government to support Senator P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's Perjury and Related Offences Bill 2018, which has been supported by my colleague, Deputy Troy, and the Fianna F&aacute;il Party from the outset.  We will help to fast-track this through the D&aacute;il.  I also point out to the Taoiseach that as far back as October 2018, former Deputy, Billy Kelleher, tabled legislation, the Civil Liability and Courts (Amendment) Bill, which would have mandated the courts to refer claims and actions which they dismissed as fraudulent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, so that fraudsters would face the full rigours of the law.  We have been waiting and waiting for a response from the Minister for Justice and Equality about that legislation.  The Minister is nodding.  I have letters about it.  Eight months ago, he indicated that he would deal with this within a month and it has not been dealt with.  Deputy Michael McGrath also introduced legislation that would again have increased penalties for those making fraudulent claims.  It would have added to the strength of our deterrence to people who would take such claims, especially since they would be obliged to pay the legal costs of a fraudulent claim.  At the moment, the holder of the insurance policy or the establishment or the enterprise has to bear the full brunt of the legal costs in many of these cases.  Deputy Michael McGrath's Bill is still on Committee Stage.  I welcome the fast-tracking of Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's Bill but, equally, I put it to the Taoiseach that former Deputy, Billy Kelleher's, Bill should have been fast-tracked a long time ago, as should Deputy McGrath's.<br/><br/>It is more than 12 months since the completion of the final report of the Personal Injuries Commission.  Incredibly, it showed that the level of damages for soft tissue injuries in Ireland is four and a half times higher than that of our nearest neighbours in England and Wales.  Will the Government commit to fast-tracking former Deputy, Billy Kelleher's, legislation and Deputy Michael McGrath's legislation, which would have an impact on those making fraudulent insurance claims?  When will the Government establish a publicly-funded anti-fraud unit in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-10a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121000004#B00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue, which all in this House know is a significant concern for the business sector, sports clubs, cr&egrave;ches and community halls, all of which are facing the cost of rising insurance premiums.  We and everyone involved in the sector, including insurance companies, Judiciary and others, need to recognise that increasing insurance costs have a consequence.  They can cause businesses to close and people to lose their jobs.  None of us wants this to happen.  We have made good progress in recent years on the broader area of insurance.  We have seen motor insurance fall from its peak in 2016 by maybe 20% or 30%.  Health insurance, which had been rising rapidly every year, has now levelled off for the past few years, and the same goes for home insurance.  When it comes to public liability, we have much work yet to do.  I join the Deputy in complimenting the <i>Irish Independent</i>on the investigation it carried out into the nexus that exists between some elements of the legal and medical professions when it comes to exaggerating and altering claims.  That was a very timely investigation and it is something that we all need to pay a lot of attention to because, unfortunately, there is a profit motive there.  Elements of both professions make a lot of money out of these claims.</p><p>With regard to Government action, as the Deputy acknowledged, we are pressing ahead with the Perjury and Related Offences Bill, which is being piloted by Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh and others.  That will strengthen our perjury laws regarding those who make fraudulent and exaggerated claims.</p> <p>In addition, the judicial council will set up a committee, led by judges, to examine the quantum of personal injury claims.  Those judges are independent and it is important to allow them to do their work independently.  As the Deputy pointed out, the payouts for personal injuries in Ireland are four and five times what they are in other jurisdictions.  As we all know, in around 90% of cases, people no longer need to attend treatment for their whiplash once they receive a payment.  It seems the cure for whiplash in Ireland is a compensation payment rather than any medical treatment.</p> <p> Deputy Pearse Doherty has also brought forward legislation to address this issue, for which the Cabinet approved two amendments this morning.  We will bring that Bill through and it will result in greater transparency around insurance costs.  Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's Bill on perjury and Deputy Pearse Doherty's Bill on transparency are progressing, and most importantly, the judicial council is setting up its independent committee to review the quantum of awards paid to people who suffer injuries in Ireland.  If the awards payments go down, we expect the insurance industry, which notwithstanding everything else is very profitable in Ireland, to respond with lower premiums.</p> <p> I will have to come back to the Deputy about the Bills proposed by Deputy Michael McGrath and former Deputy Billy Kelleher.  I will take a look at them and come back to the Deputy during the week on whether they can be progressed and find out why they have not been.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-10a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1224" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="14:10:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121000005#C00200"><p>My understanding is that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, was supposed to come back to us on that eight months ago.  Former Deputy Billy Kelleher wrote to him about this matter.  I got the Minister's response.  It might have been eight months ago when he said he would respond within a month.</p>  <p>  There are no data available on public liability insurance claims.  Many of the Personal Injuries Commission's recommendations have yet to be implemented.  The Taoiseach spoke of health insurance costs levelling off.  There is a terrible air of detachment to that comment because most people are frightened and desperate because of the level of health insurance prices.  Health insurance has a huge impact on people's incomes.  The Taoiseach's statement that costs are levelling off would not resonate with elderly people, who cling to their health insurance, in particular.  The cost of motor insurance has also increased by 32% since 2014.  The Taoiseach should ask young drivers, returning emigrants, or even older drivers about this matter as they have huge issues with it.</p>  <p>  The real issue here is the delay.  The Taoiseach mentioned the Judicial Council Bill.  How long has it been since that was recommended?  This is a crisis.  I do not believe there is a timeline for the judicial council to report back, but I ask the Taoiseach to indicate what it might be.  We meet with various interest groups which are paying insurance, and they are desperate about this.  Take Killinarden community centre, for example.  It may have to close some facilities because it simply cannot afford the 30% hike in premium it is facing.</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, the Judiciary guards its independence fiercely, and is right to do so.  It is not for this House to set a timeline for its work.  However, I will ask for the work to be carried out as expeditiously as possible.  Perhaps the chairman of the committee, or the Chief Justice himself, can inform us as to what timeline they think they can meet.</p>  <p>  In terms of the Garda response, it was recommended that a dedicated bureau be established to deal specifically with the issue of insurance fraud.  That is the Garda Commissioner's decision, and in his wisdom, he has decided that rather than setting up a dedicated national bureau which would deal only with insurance fraud, this issue would be best addressed at divisional and local levels and through the national economic crime bureau.  I agree with his decision.  The matter is being dealt with-----</p></speech>

One in six households spends more than 10% of its income on heating and electricity.</p> <p>Older and lone parents are particularly affected.  Significantly, the report highlights that 42% of children living in the private rental sector experience energy poverty and 36% of children living in social housing have the same difficulties.  The report clearly shows a relationship between poor-quality accommodation and energy poverty.  The report states that 140,000 children are living in homes with leaks, damp and rot.  One parent quoted in the report said:</p><blockquote>	There are six of us with two bedrooms, living room, kitchen and bathroom.  We have one small heater, and we move it from room to room. </blockquote> <p>One small heater is a clear breach of minimum standards.  <br/><br/>Two years ago, this House passed a Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members' motion on standards in the private rental sector.  It called for an NCT-style certification system for private rented housing, adequate resourcing for local authorities to ensure meaningful inspection and enforcement and a review of penalties for non-compliant landlords.  Two years on, what has changed?  Last year, just 9% of private rental properties were inspected.  Of these, 82% failed to meet minimum standards and less than half of these had their breaches resolved by year end.  This is simply not good enough.  The Government's failure to resource the enforcement of minimum standards is leaving tens of thousands of people, including thousands of children, living in the cold and its failure to properly fund the maintenance of council housing is leaving thousands of the State's tenants in unacceptable conditions.  In light of the depressing findings in today's report, will the Government fully implement the proposals in the 2017 Sinn F&eacute;in motion, which was passed without opposition in the House, and actively consider implementing the seven recommendations in the Society of St. Vincent de Paul report published this morning?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-10a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:20:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121000006#D00200"><p>The Deputy has given me the courtesy of a very direct question.  Unfortunately, I have not yet had the chance to read that report so I would have to look at it before I could tell him which recommendations we can and cannot implement.  I acknowledge that many people in Ireland experience energy poverty, or fuel poverty, if one prefers to use that term.  This is particularly relevant at this time of the year during the winter as days get darker and colder.  We are all aware that quite a considerable number of people every year across the western world, including Ireland, die as a result of cold-related illnesses.</p>  <p>  What are we doing about it?  There are four main measures.  First, the fuel allowance will go up again in a few weeks in January.  We are investing in retrofitting social housing to make sure we improve the quality of that housing and make those homes warmer.  New building standards mean that pretty much all new buildings and new homes are near zero-energy buildings.  The better energy warmer homes scheme can assist people to retrofit their homes and make them warmer.  Local authorities also have a role to play.  Many parties opposite are in controlling positions in local authorities and can reduce or increase property tax or commercial rates.  They also need to be held accountable for their decisions where they choose to reduce property tax instead of, for example, investing in housing and other services or perhaps choosing whitewater rafting as a priority over other issues when they get control of a local authority.  </p>  <p>  It would be remiss of the House not to acknowledge the significant progress that has been made in recent years in reducing poverty.  Notwithstanding the many individual stories of people suffering and families in distress, we know from the CSO survey on income and living conditions, published last week, that poverty in Ireland has fallen for five years in a row.  It is at its lowest in a very long time.  Deprivation rates are falling and income inequality is at its second lowest since records began.  This is a considerable achievement that perhaps does not always come across when we tend to focus on hard cases, however real they may be.  We are seeing significant progress in reducing poverty, including child poverty, and deprivation in recent years.  This did not happen by accident.  It happened because we have jobs, the economy is being well managed, the minimum wage has been increased and incomes and pay are increasing.  Take-home pay is increasing because of reductions in tax and increases in social welfare.  Those will continue as long as we manage the economy and public finances well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-10a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="14:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121000007#E00100"><p>The great difficulty is that under the Government's two-tier economic recovery, increasing numbers of people are being left far behind.  There is a fuel allowance but it comes nowhere close to covering the rising cost of fuel.  Retrofitting of local authority stock is ongoing but one must wait for two to three years to get one's windows or doors replaced.  The new standards for building are very much in question when local authorities are not being funded by the Government to adequately inspect private rental tenancies.</p>  <p>  Local authorities have a role to play but let us not forget that, thanks to the Government and its Fianna F&aacute;il predecessor, local authorities lost 25% of their staff during the recession.  That was the single greatest loss of staff in any sector of the public service.</p>  <p>  I ask the Taoiseach to carefully study the report from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and its seven recommendations, and then come back to this House to tell us which of those recommendations should be implemented.  I also ask the Taoiseach to respect the democratic decision made by this House in November 2017 and to implement fully the recommendations of the Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members' motion to ensure that all private rental properties are fully inspected and all minimum standards are fully adhered to in order that no child is living in energy poverty because of the failure of the Government to fund adequate enforcement of inspection of properties in the private rental or local government sectors.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-10a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121000007#E00200"><p>I have immense respect for the Society of St. Vincent de Paul as an organisation and I will look at the report.  The Government will issue a reasoned response when it has had a chance to consider the report.</p>  <p>  On the wider issue, everyone is entitled to their own opinions but they are not entitled to their own facts.  If we had a two-tier economic recovery in Ireland, we would not see income inequality at its second lowest level since records began in 2004, nor would we see consistent poverty falling dramatically as it has in recent years.  We would not see deprivation going down or 40,000 children lifted out of child poverty in recent years.</p>  <p>  Things vary from region to region and the experience is not the same for every family but the experience in Ireland is, broadly, that we are going in the right direction.  Unemployment is down and incomes are rising while poverty and deprivation are falling.  Those are the facts and no amount of politics, populism or spin can cover those up.</p>  <p>  The Deputy spoke about inspections of properties and the new Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act gives new powers to the Residential Tenancies Board and there are additional inspectors.  The first cases are now under way.  By 2021, it is anticipated that one in four properties will be inspected so, roughly speaking, every property will be inspected every four years.  Money is being provided for this by central Government but it would be helpful if those parties in control of local authorities that could help to contribute to the cost of that would do so, rather than cutting the local property tax, LPT, or investing in white-water rafting.</p></speech>

[Last] year, SVP spent more than &euro;5 million helping people with the cost of energy - an increase of 20% on the previous year.  We are therefore concerned about the current and future impact of energy price increases on the households we are assisting - the majority of which are families with children.  Furthermore, amid the current housing crisis, </font>]the Society of St. Vincent de Paul<font color="#2F2F2F"> is] meeting more and more families who are forced to put up with substandard accommodation, with issues like damp and mould commonplace.  Members are particularly worried about the risk of poor health for children living in these conditions for long periods of time.</font> </blockquote>  <p><font color="#2F2F2F">  The report notes &quot;A household is considered energy poor if it is unable to attain an acceptable standard of warmth and energy services in the home at an affordable cost.&quot;  Some of the figures in the report are stark.  Households with children are more than twice as likely to be in arrears with utility bills than households without children.  Some 140,000 children are living in homes that have issues with leaks, damp and rot, while 31% of lone parents are spending more than 10% of their income on energy and one lone parent in seven is in severe poverty.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  I wish to raise a couple of issues beyond those raised by Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  The fuel allowance was increased to a generous &euro;5 - I am joking - in the most recent budget.  It is clear that it will go nowhere near meeting the increases in carbon tax that were brought in in the same budget.  Moreover, not all of the poorest children who rely on social welfare are in receipt of fuel allowance.</font></p> <p>As a member of the Joint Committee on Climate Action, I pursued and won the support of this House for a fuel poverty study to be carried out prior to the carbon tax being increased.  As the Minister and the Government failed to do that, we must revisit the question of fuel poverty among 140,000 children, who will be waiting for Santa Claus in freezing cold and who, the report states, will huddle together in one room in an attempt by their parents to heat that room rather than have them separated throughout the house.</p> <p> I want to highlight three areas of the Taoiseach's failure.  The first is the housing policy and the over-reliance on the private sector.  A private landlord can apply for grants to retrofit and secure a home with insulation.  A tenant cannot do that.  The second is the blind insistence on increasing the carbon tax for everybody, regardless of their situation.  The third is the lack of ambition shown by the Government in its policies on retrofitting.  The Government is leaving people in the private rented sector, as well as those who are council tenants, completely vulnerable.  Councils do not have a budget this year for retrofitting homes.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, is inadequately funded to do the job that is required.</p></speech>

The child dependant allowance also will increase, which will help the poorest families who have children with bills in general.  We are retrofitting social housing.  One of the policy decisions we made in the budget was to ring-fence any additional funding coming in from an increase in the carbon tax for climate action and just transition.</p></speech>

We are also building more social housing.  Approximately 11,000 houses will be added to the social housing stock next year; while 10,000 were added this year.  Those houses, three quarters of which are new builds, are built to the highest standard and are warm homes.  I have been in many of those homes and have seen how comfortable they are.  They are a huge improvement on the very old social housing stock across the country that needs to be upgraded.  That can only be done, however, year by year and bit by bit.</p>  <p>  The fuel allowance goes up to &euro;24 a week, not &euro;5 a week.  For those in receipt of the fuel allowance, it will compensate them, and then some, when it comes to the carbon tax.  I appreciate that some people do not receive the fuel allowance but of the worst-off, the lowest income quartile in society, most do receive it.  The cost of the carbon tax increase is approximately &euro;40 per household but the fuel allowance increase is approximately &euro;50, so it more than compensates those in receipt of fuel allowance.  I appreciate it varies from household to household and people have different heating systems but that is the case, generally speaking.</p>  <p>  The Deputy mentioned that the carbon tax applies to everyone.  I wonder if she understands how carbon tax works.  It is not possible to apply carbon tax to some people and not to others.  The whole point of a behavioural tax like carbon tax, like the tax we have on cigarettes and alcohol, is that it does apply to everyone.  The more carbon one produces, the more one pays.  It applies to businesses as well.  In fact, most of the carbon tax is paid for by businesses.</p></speech>

How does that make the Taoiseach feel?  It makes me feel appalled.</p>  <p>  I want to relocate where I believe the problem exists.  The Taoiseach says the carbon tax is to change behaviour but he does not allow people to change their behaviour.  People living in private rented accommodation cannot apply for SEAI grants and there is no compunction on landlords to have their homes up to standard.  People living in council houses cannot apply for SEAI grants.  The council must intervene and retrofit their homes.  The Taoiseach, therefore, is penalising the most vulnerable and the poorest.</p>  <p>  I will not repeat the statistics I read out at the start of my contribution but I wish to point out another major anomaly.  Many people who move into council tenancy or buy their own homes are forced to go onto pre-pay power.  A company known as PrePayPower Ireland released figures in November indicating that it has received a dividend in this country of &euro;17.2 million.</p> <p>That is outrageous when people are forced to use these cards.  Yet, we have the highest rate of energy arrears in Europe.  There is something desperately wrong when a company is making vast profits and ordinary people have to suffer in this way without any returns from the company to help alleviate the poverty and cold that children are experiencing this winter.</p></speech>

In October the number was 3,826 and now we approach Christmas 2019.  I had proposed to put this question to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs but it was transferred this afternoon to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government for reply at a later date.  It was to be a priority question.  I am going to ask the Taoiseach the question instead.</p>  <p>  In July 2016, I suggested to the Minister for Children and Family Affairs in a parliamentary question that the spectre of 2,177 children being housed in emergency accommodation was a blight on the nation.  With projected figures of 4,026 children in such accommodation by this Christmas, I asked how the Minister would respond to the appalling deterioration in the figures.  Of course I am now asking the Taoiseach instead of the Minister, who transferred the question.</p>  <p>  In a similar question that I put to the Minister in 2016, she replied that the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, which had just been published, had an ambition that within one year we would not be reliant on emergency accommodation to house children and families.  She went on to outline the support services that would be put in place to support those children until mid-2017, when they would no longer be in emergency accommodation.  The services included access to early years services, education and nutritional needs, Tusla services, and supports for pregnant women.  The Minister intended to move towards a sense of normality for those children.  It was to be a political priority to avoid lasting damage to these children.</p>  <p>  Of course, the fundamental solution to addressing child homelessness is to provide them with a home, not to rely on emergency accommodation.  That was to be phased out by mid-2017 but it has worsened.  Instead of having 2,177 children homeless, we now have 3,826 and the number is rising.  When one considers that children move in and out of homelessness on a frequent basis, the figure is probably far greater than the 3,826 who are affected.  This is my question to the Taoiseach: how does he respond to this appalling deterioration in child homelessness figures?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-10a.41" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121000009#G00800"><p>I think it is heart-breaking that so many children are living in emergency accommodation at any time of year, but particularly at this time of year.  Even though they may go in and out of it quite quickly, as the Deputy said - perhaps six months or a year in some cases - that is still far too long and there are far too many cases.</p>  <p>  I am unsure where the Deputy's projected figures come from.  We know that in the most recent monthly figures the number of families who are homeless and the number of children who are homeless fell slightly.  I hope that will continue in the coming months.  The number of rough sleepers is also down.  I recall the week when across the road from here on Molesworth Street John Corrie died in a doorway.  At that time there were approximately 168 rough sleepers in Dublin.  The most recent figures show that this figure has fallen to approximately 92.  Many of these are people who need a great deal of support and it is hard to get them in.</p> <p>However, it demonstrates some of the progress that has been made.  The rough sleeping is now down to its lowest level in approximately five years, but this is certainly a problem that is a real blight on our society, as the Deputy described.</p> <p> When one talks about the fact that there are 10,000 people living in emergency accommodation, we should not forget that 14,000 people have been brought out of emergency accommodation, have been housed by the Government and are now in secure accommodation, and it is not the same 10,000 all the time.  In fact, more people have been taken out of homelessness into secure housing now than are homeless but, unfortunately, people continue to become homeless every day and every week.</p> <p> Deputy Harty asked how we respond.  We respond in two ways.  Provided in budget 2020, which the Deputy did not vote for, is &euro;160 million in funding for the charities and agencies that work with us, both to prevent people becoming homeless in the first place - half of people are now prevented from becoming homeless in the first place - but also to help them through emergency accommodation, to run the family hubs and to then get out of emergency accommodation.  That is not something the Deputy supported or voted for.</p> <p> The second way is in stepping up our investment in social housing.  Three years ago when this Government came to office, maybe 3,000 or 4,000 were being added to the social housing stock every year.  That is up to 10,000 this year.  It will be 11,000 next year and 12,000 the year after that.  Not in any year this century have more houses been added to the social housing stock than this year.  We will do better again next year and better again the year after.  However, as the Central Bank pointed out today, we are catching up on a massive deficit.  A country, such as Ireland, with our population and demographics should be adding 35,000 houses to its housing stock every year.  We are not there yet.  We have trebled the amount of supply, up from 7,000 a year three and a half years ago to more than 20,000 now.  We will get to 25,000 next year.  We will get up to 35,000.  If we could do it quicker, if there was a cheque I could sign, a button I could press or a lever I could pull, we would have done it by now.</p></speech>

The Royal College of Physicians has produced a report, The Impact of Homelessness and Inadequate Housing on Children's Health.  The reason I was addressing my question to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, not the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government - it was transferred and I have no control over that - was that it was specifically about child homelessness and its impact on their health.  It causes serious mental and physical illness to children who are in persistent homelessness.  Some 25% are at an increased risk of physical and mental ill-health.  There is a higher risk of pre-term pregnancies in women who are pregnant in homeless accommodation.  There are higher rates of asthma, respiratory illness and infectious diseases, poor nutrition, and less access to development opportunities, play and recreational and social activities.  They are more likely to be bullied.  These effects on children's health go way beyond their childhood and go into their adult lives.  These children are our future.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach's response failed to address any of the issues I raised.  He failed to explain how, in 2017, we were not going to rely on emergency accommodation to house children and yet the figures have almost doubled in the lifetime of this Government.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-10a.57" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="14:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121000010#H01600"><p>I think I am correct in saying that when this Government came to office, or certainly when the current Minister came to office, the number of people in emergency accommodation was 8,000.  It is now 10,000.  That is not quite a doubling but it has got worse - there is no denying that - despite our best efforts.</p>  <p>  In terms of what we have been trying to do to alleviate the situation, the most important thing is preventing people becoming homeless in the first place.  As I mentioned, because we fund and work with so many charities and NGOs, we are able to prevent half of people becoming homeless in the first place.  That is a significant change from where we were a few years ago.  We have also invested in the family hubs, precisely because we accept that hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation is inadequate.  Whereas family hubs are by no means perfect, they are better.</p> <p>They give people dignity, their own door, their own cooking facilities, and their own play areas.  I have been to visit them and I have seen them for myself.  The people who spend time in family hubs get out of them into permanent housing much quicker than those who self-accommodate.  Above and beyond all that, the solution has to be more supply of social housing, so we can take people off the housing list and out of emergency accommodation, more supply of private housing so that people have homes to buy, as most people want to buy their own home, and also more homes for people to rent because lots of people will need to rent at some point in their life.  We need to get to the point where we are building approximately 35,000 new homes in Ireland every year, as the Central Bank said.  We have trebled housing supply just under the term of this Government of Fine Gael and the Independent Alliance.</p></speech>

Last Monday,there was again a headline in <i>The Irish Times </i>to the effect that the Government would take action on the smoky coal ban but when one reads the detail, one will see it is a consultation framework and it is being referred to councils.  This is more ducking and diving, dodging of the core issue and failure of backbone or to stand up to the vested interests.  In a recent letter to Deputy Browne from the HSE on this issue, the HSE estimates that the cost to the Exchequer of poor air quality and associated health impacts is approximately &euro;2 billion a year.  In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, confirms the extraordinary impact of the introduction by the then Minister, Mary Harney, of the smoky coal ban in 1990 on air quality.  The medical evidence shows a reduction in respiratory illnesses and premature death.  Given the overwhelming medical evidence, it is extraordinary that a Minister was able to do it in 1990 but the Government is incapable of doing it.  This Government seems to lack the bottle to take on the vested interests in the interest of good human health and air quality.</p><p>Several of us have been raising this for well over a year.  The reason for that first headline was that the then Minister, Deputy Kelly, made that commitment.  It was a legislative promise by the Government.  He was in the previous Government.  He was followed in office by Deputy Naughten, who made the promise.  The former Minister, Deputy Naughten, is going around the place saying that if he was still there, this definitely would have happened.  I assume he had access to the same advices that the current Minister has.  </p></speech>

Today is the deadline for public submissions on the second draft of the BusConnects plan.  Many of us in this House will have made detailed submissions to try to improve the final product.  However, the success or failure of the final redesign of bus networks will be wholly dependent on Government funding.  I ask the Taoiseach to confirm exactly how much funding has been committed to the network redesign as distinct from the cost of compulsory purchase orders related to the bus corridor project.  Will the Taoiseach commit to the additional funding for the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Dublin Bus that is needed to increase peak-time capacity on routes such as the 25, 39 and 18 which are already over capacity?</p></speech>

I know that the Deputy will want to join me in welcoming the considerable investment that has been made in public transport in the past few months alone.

However, this myth has been regularly debunked by organisations such as the OECD, the US Federal Reserve, the University of California at Berkeley and many others.  In the Irish context, it has now been debunked by the ESRI in its analysis of the increase in the minimum wage in January 2018 from &euro;9.25 to &euro;9.55 per hour.  The ESRI found that this increase had no effect on the average hours worked in the hotel and food industries, where the majority of minimum wage earners work.  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment to the House, in the run up to Christmas, that in the event of a deal being signed on Brexit his Government will immediately sanction the increase in the minimum wage recommended by the Low Pay Commission?</p></speech>

However, I would say ratified rather than signed because there is a difference there.  Should the withdrawal agreement be ratified, the Government will implement the Low Pay Commission's recommendation to increase the minimum wage to &euro;10.10 per hour.  That will be the third increase in three years by this Government and will mean that we have the sixth highest minimum wage in the world.</p></speech>

The programme for Government makes a particular promise to improve oversight of spending programmes.  Given the obvious incompetence, mismanagement and obscene salaries of Mr. Delaney and his clique in the FAI, the Government must take some responsibility for its failure to investigate what the dogs in the street knew.  Those at the grassroots of soccer knew that there was something rotten at the heart of the FAI.</p> <p>I am looking at an email response from the Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, which was sent to somebody on 24 March where he was asked by the emailer to investigate the internal affairs of the FAI.  His response was that it was not appropriate for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to comment on the internal structures of a national sporting organisation.</p></speech>

Is that not just the problem when the Government hands out money to these quangos, which are run like medieval corrupt fiefdoms, and pays no attention whatsoever to the goings-on in entities like the FAI?  The grassroots of soccer are now threatened in a very severe way.  Indeed, the FAI's very viability is under threat because of a failure in oversight.</p></speech>

There are huge concerns among farm and forestry contractors and, indeed, many farmer-landowners, over the desperate delays in getting tree-felling licences.  This is going on for too long and I believe there is a serial objector out there as well holding it all up.  We need to change the legislation here.</p>  <p>  Between 2010 and 2018, the number of felling licence applications submitted showed a sustained increase from more than 1,700 in 2010 to almost 6,000 in 2018.  This year, the number is way down to 1,800 applications.  These people have long-term investments.  They need to get the product out.  As well as that, there are skilled contractors with huge investment in machinery and they need to be able to work.  They will be idle in 2020 if something is not done here.  T&aacute; an tAire St&aacute;it anseo.  This is a serious situation where we need to amend the legislation to stop serial and frivolous objectors, and allow contractors to do their work.</p></speech>

Also, a commission will be established on the future of Irish public service broadcasting, to report by September 2020.  The terms of reference include examining how public service broadcasting can be delivered in Ireland over the next ten years, how that work can be funded in a sustainable and secure way and how it can be overseen and regulated having regard to our EU obligations, including the requirements of the audiovisual media services directive.  As part of this decision, the Government has given the view that RT&Eacute; should not proceed with the part sale of its Donnybrook site until full consideration has been given to a green field option and that it should defer any decision on removing Lyric FM from Limerick until the commission has reported.</p></speech>

This time last year the Minister gave a commitment that he would publish a scheme to help those who need redress and financial assistance to fix their homes.  A year later the scheme has not been announced and no homes have been fixed.  This is the second last working week before Christmas.  Can the Minister ensure, at the very least, that the scheme will be published before Christmas so homeowners will know they can apply for a scheme in the new year to get their homes fixed?</p></speech>

It is nearly ten months since the public health nurse in Baile Bhuirne retired.  That was a planned retirement but there has been a stop-start service in the meantime.

Four public houses in Cork South-West have been informed since last Wednesday that they can no longer hold bingo events in their pubs, a custom they had for many years, raising funds for CoAction and other fundraising events, and, most of all, giving and outlet for people to spend a few hours after a stressful week.

I have corresponded in my previous life with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on investment in the Rosslare rail line, particularly as an alternative to the M11.  I am aware that the Minister rarely attends these sessions, but perhaps the Taoiseach might ask him what plans are in place to invest in the Rosslare rail line.  The Minister in his email correspondence to me has said this is primarily the responsibility of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and the National Transport Authority.  When I raised the point with him I was not asking him to physically drive the trains; I was asking him to drive rail policy.

As recently as a few years ago we had to seriously contemplate closing some lines.  We no longer have to do that.  Now, rather than repairing faults as they arise, we will have a managed maintenance programme to ensure we have a well-managed, steady-state railway, something we did not believe we would ever be able to have again as recently as a few years ago.

This will have a significant impact on the company's 150 workers and their families coming up to Christmas.  What was most disappointing about this process was the 30-day procedure put in place.  The works committee of the firm put forward practical, credible solutions that would have improved the efficiencies and the operation of the plant.  Enterprise Ireland was equally involved in this process and put forward proposals.  It is quite clear that this was just a box-ticking exercise by this company and that all it was doing was moving the operation back to Germany.  Arklow has an incredible workforce, and it is vital we put a task force in place to deal with potential investment coming down the road that can deal with these job losses.</p></speech>

Since the announcement on 8 November, Enterprise Ireland has been engaging intensively with the company to see whether it was possible to find a solution that would avert the job losses.  Unfortunately, it has not proved possible, and the company announced on 9 December, only yesterday, that the factory in Arklow will close at the end of January and relocate to Krefeld, in Germany.  The company has confirmed that all staff have been offered redundancy packages which exceed the scale of mandatory redundancy packages.</p></speech>

Page 57 of the programme for Government states: "We will ensure appropriate care pathways are in place to improve cancer services."  It goes on to refer to fantastic community-based services exactly like this.  In short, the service has to leave the premises it is in.  It has found a fantastic new premises, which will greatly expand cancer services provision for the community in north Wicklow.  The Minister for Health has met Purple House representatives twice and promised that he would make the money available.  They received a letter from the HSE today, which seemed to kick that promise into next year and it may or may not happen.  I appreciate that the Taoiseach will not be able to answer directly.  Will he ask his officials to look at this as a matter of urgency with a view to Purple House getting that funding so that it can secure the premises?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-10a.276" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1354" speakername="James Browne" time="16:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121000018#Q01300"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to prohibit insurers, insurance providers, brokers or other such undertakings from failing or refusing to make payments under life insurance or assurance policies, including death benefit, where the person insured dies by suicide. </blockquote>  <p>This is a Bill to prohibit so-called suicide clauses in life assurance and life insurance policies.  The purpose of the Bill is to prevent insurance companies from failing or refusing to execute or pay out on an insurance policy, including a death benefit policy, in respect of a person who dies by suicide.  For a long time, a discriminatory practice of refusing to pay out on insurance policies in cases of death by suicide has existed in Ireland.  I believe this is wrong and is based on an outdated understanding of suicide.  Its origins were based on the idea that suicide was a crime and that a person should not benefit from his or her own wrongdoing.  Many families were the victims of this outdated view and policy.  Families that suffered the lost of a loved one, and very often the loss of an income, only to be met with a refusal of financial support from an insurance company, had their loss compounded by hardship, uncertainty and financial instability.  The insurance companies sought to benefit by wrongdoing, refusing to pay out.</p><p>Families that could afford to had to hire solicitors and barristers to challenge the refusal of insurance companies to honour their agreements.  The legal teams of families had to put forward technical legal points that the insurance companies should pay out, with arguments such as appealing that people did not intend to kill themselves, but rather that it was a cry for help that went too far and, therefore, did not have the requisite intention to take their own lives, or that they were suffering from a mental illness and, therefore, were not capable of forming the requisite intention to take their own lives.  Those arguments only added further to the distress of families.  Perhaps if the insurance company was afraid it might lose in court, it might pay out some of the money, usually only a certain percentage, but it often paid out none.  It is acknowledged that many insurance companies have recently voluntarily adopted a policy of not applying the suicide 12 months after the date the policy was taken out.  This is in line with UK legislation.  Nonetheless, insurance companies are not bound to do so.  It is, therefore, important to codify the law to ensure that no insurance company attempts to benefit from this outdated concept and understanding of mental health.</p><p>It is 26 years since suicide was decriminalised by the then Fianna F&aacute;il Minister, M&aacute;ire Geoghegan-Quinn.  This Bill is another step to ending the stigma that still pervades many aspects of our society with regard to suicide.  Much work has been done on this journey but there is still a long way to go.  I understand that the Government supports the legislation going to Second Stage and has supported the principle behind the Bill.  I thank the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, who has worked with me on this Bill.  This is the fourth Bill that I have introduced to this House since being elected to the D&aacute;il three and a half years ago.  I was honoured by the support that I secured across the House for the other Bills, especially the Mental Health (Amendment) Act 2018, which was signed into law by the President.  I was elected in part to legislate and propose solutions to the challenges that society has.  I hope that I am doing that.  I hope to have cross-party support for this Bill when it comes before the House on Second Stage.  The Bill aims to prevent insurance companies from failing to provide financial compensation under a legitimate insurance policy when a person dies by suicide.</p></speech>

The Citizens' Assemblies Act 2019 providing for the use of the electoral register to select members for both Citizens' Assemblies was subsequently enacted and signed into law by the President on 25 July.  The membership of the Citizens' Assembly on gender equality will comprise the chairperson and 99 citizens entitled to vote at referendums, recruited at a national level and randomly selected to be broadly representative of Irish society.  Significant progress has been made with regard to the various elements required to establish the assembly.  Dr. Catherine Day, the former Secretary-General of the European Commission has been appointed to chair the assembly.  A secretary has also been appointed and a secretariat team is in place.  The immediate priority was to secure the various services required through procurement with a view to holding an inaugural meeting of the assembly as soon as possible.  This is now complete and member selection is under way with an inaugural meeting of the assembly scheduled for Saturday, 25 January 2020.  The first full weekend meeting is planned for the weekend of 14 to 16 February 2020 and the dates for four further weekend meetings have been confirmed.</p> <p>As agreed in the Oireachtas resolution, the assembly will engage independent researchers to monitor and record, among other things, the deliberative quality of the assembly.  An Irish Research Council call to select a research fellow to conduct this work has closed with a view to an appointment shortly.  Consultation and public engagement are also important to ensure a broad spectrum of views is available to the Citizens' Assembly members and to ensure public buy-in and awareness of the work of the assembly.  With that in mind, there has been extensive engagement with relevant experts in the field including through consultative round tables, and a public consultation will also be initiated.</p></reply>

The assembly on gender equality is due to hold its first meeting in January and we wish it well in its work.  This is different in that, unlike previous assemblies that dealt with issues such as the eighth amendment, among others, there is no parallel or detailed proposal for the Oireachtas to engage with the issue or the assembly's outcome.  Are there any proposals for a process for considering the assembly's report?</p>  <p>  On an administrative matter, this may be the first time a citizens' assembly is due to sit during a period a general election is likely to be held.  Will the holding of the election have any particular implications for the assembly?  Has it agreed to adopt the precedent of other bodies established by the Oireachtas to suspend public activity during elections?</p>  <p>  In the years since citizens' assemblies were adopted on an all-party basis, much evidence has accumulated about what works and how best to put issues to them.  Most people agree that the more specific the issue and the closer it is to a direct proposal for action, the more likely it is that the assembly will have an impact and assist in bringing an issue to a conclusion.  Our position remains that assemblies should not be used to delay political action on urgent issues.  Would it not be a good idea, before near permanent demands are made to put even the most uncertain and complex issues to such assemblies, to carry out a genuinely independent review of what works and the most effective means of using assemblies in the future?</p></speech>

To use the Taoiseach's own words, women are all too often "disproportionately represented in low pay sectors".  At the same event, a survey of participants from the public, private and NGO sectors showed that better and more affordable childcare would do more to promote gender equality in the workplace than any other single action.  Somewhat ironically, low pay predominates in the childcare sector, where 98% of staff are women.  The average hourly rate of workers in the childcare sector is &euro;10.96, which is barely &euro;1 more than the minimum wage and &euro;1.34 below what is regarded as a living wage.  Unsurprisingly, a recent survey of early years educators revealed that the majority cannot make ends meet, with 84% unable to meet an unexpected expense such as a visit to the doctor, a car repair, or a utility bill.  Consequently, more than half of current childcare staff are actively looking to exit the sector and are looking for alternative jobs.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that the agenda for the forthcoming Citizens' Assembly includes the provision of universally available, high-quality and affordable childcare in this country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-10a.355" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1238" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121000019#R05500"><p>I also raise the issue of childcare and the necessity of including it as part of the Citizens' Assembly deliberations on gender equality.  To say there is a crisis in the affordability and provision of childcare would be a massive understatement.  The average cost per week of childcare in this country is &euro;186, but it is &euro;246 in my area.  That is completely unaffordable.  It is the same as having a second mortgage.  The lack of provision of available, affordable places is shocking.  It is all very well announcing programmes such as the national childcare scheme, subsidies, or two years of free preschool year after year, but people cannot find places.  More recently, small community cr&egrave;ches are suffering the consequences of the backlash against badly-run, often big corporate, childcare facilities.  The numbers of places in such small cr&egrave;ches are being reduced and costs are going up to meet Tusla's compliance standards, which is pushing prices even further out of the realm of affordability.  This is one of, if not the biggest, contributing factors to gender inequality in this country.  What is the Government going to do to provide affordable, universally available and sufficient childcare places in this country?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-10a.356" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1434" speakername="Ruth Coppinger" time="16:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121000019#R05600"><p>It is very difficult to squeeze the issue of gender inequality into a minute and a half.  I will have to drop the topics of the gender pay gap, unaffordable childcare, and the endometriosis briefing that took place earlier.  I will focus on what was newsworthy today, namely, the Safe Ireland report, which stated that nine requests for help from women's refuges are unmet every day.  In some cases, those women then stayed in violent relationships.  What is the point of Department of Justice and Equality spending money on awareness campaigns if there are no places for people to go when they seek help?  I refer specifically to the refuge based in Blanchardstown.  On International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, 25 November, the refuge held a public meeting at which the CEO of Sonas spoke.  She told us that up to 500 families are turned away from that refuge every year, which is in mine and the Taoiseach's constituency.  Tomorrow, women from Blanchardstown will come here at 11.30 a.m. to hand in hundreds of letters signed by local people.  I ask the Taoiseach to make the time to meet them and to take those letters.</p> <p>When I last raised this, the Taoiseach said that maybe we should look at something different and that maybe the perpetrators should leave.  With all due respect, I think the women would have thought of that without the Taoiseach raising it.  It did display an ignorance about being in a violent relationship and the dangers facing women.  Why has &euro;20 million been given to the entire sector nationally, a figure that is just slightly greater than that given to the greyhound industry, when the Taoiseach knows that up to four or five times more people seek help than actually get it?  We also need more outreach services for schools and prevention and a rape crisis centre for Dublin West.  Why will the Government not increase the funding for this sector?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-10a.358" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1253" speakername="Joan Burton" time="16:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121000020#S00200"><p>As the founding chair of the Blanchardstown rape crisis centre, I would welcome any assistance the Taoiseach can give to this very important refuge that is built to a beautiful standard, as I am sure the previous speaker is aware, and that offers much-needed support to women and particularly their children.  Consequently, I hope the Taoiseach can put that on the agenda.</p>  <p>  What is the Government's position with regard to the Citizens' Assembly recommendations on climate change, which have been available since April 2018?  I will address two specific issues.  One is air quality in Ireland.  There is a significant amount of air pollution.  Emission levels in Dublin West have been exceeded recently on more than six occasions, which is a terrible outcome.  We know from the work of the Asthma Society of Ireland that there is an asthma epidemic in this country, yet the Taoiseach is sitting on his hands when it comes to the issue of smoky coal and is finding a phony reason to long-finger it.  Why does the Taoiseach not reassemble and recall the Citizens' Assembly on climate change to get it to say what the people of Ireland want?</p>  <p>  The assembly also recommended the expansion of public transport.  We know, however, that it is almost dangerous for a pregnant woman to travel on trains into town from Dublin West and Maynooth at certain times because it is so crowded.  Could the Taoiseach look at recalling the Citizens' Assembly on climate change to get it to continue its work because it was a mechanism to reach agreement?  The Taoiseach has opened a can of worms with regard to how he is addressing the smoky coal issue.  It needs to be banned and people with asthma need to be given relief and clean air.    </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-10a.359" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="16:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121000020#S00300"><p>I start by thanking the assembly members for taking part in the process.  We look forward to their recommendations.  Their work will play an important role in shaping policy and political decisions that are necessary to end gender inequality.  Having said that, much of the research and analysis that will come from this process is already known to us.  For example, we know that women on average earn less than men.  The latest figures for the European Union tell us that women in Ireland earn 86 cent for every euro a man earns.  We know that the older one is, the larger that gap is.  We know that women workers are disproportionately represented in low-paid sectors such as childcare, health, education and retail and that under 7% of company CEOs are women.  They are not just problems we have today.  They are problems we take with us throughout our careers and into retirement.  In terms of cold hard cash, women earn less money so they consequently have less money to invest in their futures.  The EU average pension gap between women and men is a massive 35.7%.</p>  <p>  There are, of course, decisions the Government can make today that would start to address poverty in work for these women.  Fine Gael and the Independents could introduce a living wage across the public sector.  We know that women disproportionately populate the lowest-paid public sector grades.  Aldi has committed to a living wage.  It boggles the mind that the Government cannot do the same.  The Government could also increase the national minimum wage.  The Government has collectively refused to comply with the Data Protection Commissioner's instruction on the public services card in a really awful manner.  If the Taoiseach is serious about this, there is a number of steps he can take right now.  </p></speech>

When it comes to the proposed citizens' assembly, the model the Government has in mind is to follow the same process as we followed with regard to the Citizens' Assemblies on the eighth amendment and climate change.  The assembly will sit and report, that report will be referred to an all-party Oireachtas committee specifically established to examine the recommendations of the citizens' assembly and the Government will respond to it.  We will need the agreement and co-operation of the House to do that.  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin asked a very valid question about what we would do during a three to four-week election period - whether the assembly should sit or not.  I am not sure whether it should sit but it is a pertinent question about which I will consult with officials.  I will also consult with the chair of the Citizens' Assembly as to whether she thinks it is appropriate that the assembly should sit during that three to four-week period----</p></speech>

I was asked whether there has been an independent review of what does and does not work and the pros and cons of citizens' assemblies more generally.  That was done.  A report was submitted by Ms Justice Mary Laffoy, which gives her advice and experience, having chaired an assembly.  It is a very good report on the strengths, weaknesses and limitations of citizens' assemblies that is worth reading.  It is a very good piece of work for which I thank her in addition to her chairmanship of the previous assemblies.</p>  <p>  I am not sure if any Government prior to this one has done more to make childcare more affordable or to improve its quality.  I will give a few examples.  Everyone now has two years of free preschool through the early childhood care and education programme.  We have introduced paid parental leave and paid parental benefit for the first time, extended unpaid parental leave, increased maternity benefit and changed the rules, particularly around women whose children were born prematurely in order that they can have more maternity leave.  We have increased paternity benefit, provided capital investment for childcare and in the past few weeks, have introduced the national childcare scheme.  We will publish the initial figures from that tomorrow but I can tell the House that over 14,000 children have already signed up for that scheme.  It means increased subsidies for those already receiving subsidies and for the first time, some middle-income families qualify for subsidies.  These are families with a gross income of around &euro;100,000.  I think this is only right because people on middle incomes pay the most income tax and they should benefit from these schemes as well.  I envisage the Government increasing the subsidies in the years ahead for everyone but also ensuring that more middle-income and middle-class families can qualify for these subsidies as well, because it would be wrong to expect them to pay very high amounts of income tax and USC but be unable to benefit from these schemes.  This is very much the direction of travel in terms of policy.  Regarding pay and terms and conditions in the sector, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, is very much of the view that there should be a sectoral employment order for this sector to set minimum standards and wage levels.  There is a process by which that can be followed.  I believe the terms of reference of the assembly cover the issue of childcare.  Obviously, neither I nor the House can change the terms of reference now but the fourth term of reference is to recognise the importance of early years parental care; to seek to facilitate greater work-life balance; to examine the social responsibility of care, including women and men's co-responsibility for care, particularly within the family; and to examine the gender pay gap scrutinising structural pay inequalities that result in women being disproportionately represented in low pay sectors.  The terms of reference are very wide.  </p>  <p>  Regarding domestic violence, two refuges are opening or re-opening in the near future.  One will be in Rathmines and while I cannot remember where the other one will be, it is outside Dublin.  This will bring us almost up to the level recommended by the Council of Europe.  I think we were 28 short.  The new refuges will bring us to being about three short of the recommended level.  Two different measures are recommended but on the first one, it brings almost to that level so we probably need to open one more.  I will give the House the figures on funding for domestic violence services funding.  This is done through Tusla's domestic, sexual and gender based violence services.  The budget in 2014 was &euro;17 million.  It went up to &euro;19.5 million in 2015, although &euro;2.5 million was transferred from the then Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.  In 2016, the figure increased to &euro;20.6 million.  The figure in 2017 was &euro;20.1 million and in 2018, it was &euro;23.8 million.  As the figure for this year is &euro;25.3 million, there has been a &euro;1.5 million increase this year.  I can give a breakdown as to how that was used.  </p> <p>Separate to that, a lot of money goes through the Garda budget.  The Garda is establishing special victims units in every division at the moment, most of which, although not all, are up and running.  That is important but is counted as part of the Garda Vote, as opposed to the Tusla Vote.</p> <p> On the question of climate change, there was a Citizens' Assembly on the topic, the report of which went to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action, and then the Government produced its climate action plan.  We now report quarterly on how that is being implemented.  The first report has been done already and the second will be coming soon.</p> <p> I responded earlier to the question about smoky coal.  The air quality in cities is largely down to diesel cars and not particularly down to the burning of solid fuels.  That goes back to a decision made by a previous Government to encourage people to buy diesel cars.  That reduced greenhouse gas emissions but it made our air quality worse.  We have been trying to unwind that policy mistake for the past two years.</p> <p> Turning to the issue of railways, there will be a 34% increase in capacity on the Maynooth line in 2021.  The necessary rail carriages are now on order but could not come fast enough.</p></speech>

Following a Government decision on 25 July 2019 on the establishment of Cabinet committees, Cabinet committee structures were reorganised.  The six Cabinet committees cover the areas of economy; social policy and public services; infrastructure; Brexit, foreign and European affairs; environment; and security.</p>  <p>  The Cabinet committee on Brexit, foreign and European affairs was established to ensure a co-ordinated approach in the areas of Brexit, foreign and European affairs, including Global Ireland 2025.  The committee met for the first time on 10 September 2019 and met again yesterday, 9 December.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has lead responsibility for matters of foreign policy generally, including relations with Israel and Palestine.  The T&aacute;naiste briefs the Cabinet on developments in the Middle East and, when appropriate, it is discussed at Cabinet and was so discussed this morning.</p></reply>

Before the last Israeli general election, Prime Minister Netanyahu followed a strategy of becoming more extreme and anti-Arab by the day.  Much of this was, frankly, racist.  He was calling on Israeli Jews to be scared of their Arab fellow citizens.</p>  <p>  However, he went much further and announced his intention to annex large parts of the West Bank, in particular current settlements and areas around them, should he win the election.  This is essentially a plan to prevent any independent Palestinian state from emerging and to consign millions of people to permanent statelessness.</p>  <p>  This country and Fianna F&aacute;il have been consistent in supporting a two-state solution with parity of esteem and equality.  As I say, the situation has become progressively worse and, quite frankly, it confirms the view of myself and my party, and the rest of the Opposition in this House, that we are correct to say that the time has come to take assertive action against creeping annexation.</p>  <p>  The Government has said it opposes the legislation about the settlements that is before the Oireachtas because it is against EU regulations.  However, there is no regulation stopping the Government from pushing for changes of policy and demanding action at European level.  </p>  <p>  I have had discussions with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on this matter.  The T&aacute;naiste has been unsuccessful in persuading Mr. Netanyahu to moderate his approach and was wildly over-optimistic more than a year and a half ago about the prospects of a peace initiative emanating from the Israeli Government.  It is time for this Government to start proposing concrete actions in line with the seriousness of the threat of annexation.</p>  <p>  On a separate matter, I have asked, at various times, for details of the likely economic impact of the withdrawal agreement on Northern Ireland.  Last week, the UK Labour Party released a leaked document from the UK Treasury which predicted that the impact of new east-west checks on Northern Ireland would be severe.  There has been more than enough time to review the issue.  Can the Taoiseach tell us if he accepts that the agreement will have a negative impact on Northern Ireland?  </p>  <p>  I apologise that there are two separate questions covered in that one contribution.</p></speech>

Last week, my colleague, Deputy McDonald, raised with the Taoiseach the routine detention and prosecution of Palestinian children as young as 12 in the Israeli military court system.  We know that child detainees have been blindfolded and deprived of sleep, had their hands and feet restrained and have been intimidated and assaulted at the hands of the Israeli military.  In his reply, the Taoiseach stated he has not had any engagement with the Israeli Government or Israeli politicians.  Was this continued violation of human rights raised by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on behalf of the Government when he met the Israeli Prime Minister last week?</p>  <p>  It also appears that the T&aacute;naiste did not raise Ireland's opposition to Israel's illegal settlements in occupied Palestine, which are inconsistent with international law.  It appears, from media reports, that the T&aacute;naiste instead reassured the Israeli Prime Minister that the Government will not support the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill that would make trade with illegal settlements a criminal offence in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked the Taoiseach last week if the Government would call on the EU to take action against settlements by imposing meaningful sanctions.  The rationale offered up for not doing so was that such a call could not secure the required unanimity to be enforced, yet the Taoiseach has a mechanism for Ireland to impose its own sanctions against Israel's continued flouting of international law through the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill and he has set his face against it.</p>  <p>  Water pollution is not the leading cause of child mortality in Gaza, as the T&aacute;naiste stated last week.  The continued barbarism of occupation and the ghettoisation of Gaza is what is killing Palestinian children and their families.</p>  <p>  The State increase in investment for Palestine, announced last week, is welcome but the Taoiseach knows as well as I do that it falls far short of what is needed both in monetary and political terms.  Will the Taoiseach reconsider his opposition to the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill and, by so doing, join with others in this D&aacute;il to uphold the rule of binding international law?</p></speech>

That was done unilaterally.  Nelson Mandela and many other leading fighters against apartheid made the point at the time that Ireland had made a unique contribution to bringing down the apartheid regime.  Why does the Taoiseach hide behind the coat-tails of the EU and say that we can do nothing because we do not have qualified majority voting, when we took unilateral action against apartheid South Africa?</p>  <p>  Israel flouts international law through its treatment of and detention of children.  Its criminal siege of Gaza has reduced Gaza to being a place that officially is uninhabitable by human beings.  There has been flagrant and brazen annexation of Palestinian territory in contravention of international law.  The right to self-determination for Palestinians has been officially cancelled by the Israeli Government.  Only people who are Jewish in the land that is Israel or Palestine, whatever one wants to call it, have the right to self-determination.  Human and international rights are just gone.</p>  <p>  This just goes on and on.  Ethnic cleansing is a day-to-day reality for Palestinians.  Why will the Taoiseach not take a leaf from the book of the Dunnes Stores strikers and what this country did in response to apartheid South Africa and support sanctions, including Senator Black's Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill?  The Taoiseach should support, not block, that Bill and take a lead in calling for and imposing sanctions on the apartheid, racist, repressive and illegal activities of the Israeli state in respect of the Palestinian people.</p></speech>

To be specific, in an interview he gave to the Israeli public broadcaster, KAN, he stated:</p> <blockquote> 	We will continue to advocate, yes, for new thinking because I think the solution now is probably not the same as what a solution looked like 20 years ago.  A lot has happened in that time. </blockquote>  <p>Every Member in this House knows a lot has happened in the past 20 years, most especially the illegal annexation of more Palestinian land by a succession of Israeli governments, led by Benjamin Netanyahu.  For clarity, can the Taoiseach tell us the Government's new thinking in respect of the settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute?  As a House, we need to be crystal clear that it is no lessening of our total opposition to the illegal annexation of Palestinian land that has gone on unchecked.</p></speech>

During the visit, the T&aacute;naiste also met with a number of Palestinian political leaders including President Abbas and Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, and a number of UN officials also.  The T&aacute;naiste used these meetings to discuss how Ireland can support efforts towards a durable two-state solution to the conflict and to convey Ireland's concerns about the impact of the occupation, including in respect of settlement activity and the blockade of Gaza.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, 9 December, the T&aacute;naiste briefed Ministers at the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels on his visit to Israel and Palestine.  He highlighted two specific issues which merit further discussion at EU level - annexation and the need for free elections in Palestine.  The T&aacute;naiste is concerned by appalling evidence of creeping annexation in the West Bank.  Ireland and the EU's position on Israeli settlements could not be clearer.  They are illegal under international law and fundamentally undermine the prospects for a two-state solution.</p>  <p>  Israel's violation of human rights and mistreatment of Palestinians was also raised in these meetings.</p>  <p>  The T&aacute;naiste also raised the potential for elections in Palestine, which may take place in 2020, and which have not happened for more than a decade.  EU members states must encourage Israel to facilitate voting for Palestinians in east Jerusalem also.</p>  <p>  Ministers will return to the Middle East peace process in more detail at the January Foreign Affairs Council.</p>  <p>  Regarding new thinking, this does not mean any departure from the two-state solution.</p>  <p>  Regarding the labelling of products coming from the occupied territories, a French court challenging the rules on the labelling of settlement products was referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union.  Ireland, as an interested member state, lodged observations on the case to endorse EU guidelines on the labelling of settlement goods issued in 2015 and appeared at the oral hearing in early April.  The court's judgment was issued on 12 November and found that foodstuffs originating in the occupied territories must bear the indication of the territory of origin and when these products originate from a settlement, that must also be made clear on the label.  Therefore, a boycott by citizens is possible and indeed by business.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Control of Economic Activities (Occupied Territories) Bill, the T&aacute;naiste has set out the Government's position in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il.  The Government's opposition to settlements is unequivocal.  However, the proposals contained in this Bill go beyond what is in the Government's power to do.  Trade is a matter of sole EU competence and that is clear in the treaties.  Passage of the Bill would expose the State to legal action and to substantial and recurring damages and no Government could endorse that.</p>  <p>  On settlements, we must choose policies which will be effective, are consistent with our position in the EU Single Market and customs union and will not be struck down as illegal, giving comfort to settlers rather than Palestinians.  Informal soundings in Brussels indicate that the European Commission agrees that the Bill contravenes EU law as trade is a sole EU competence in the treaties and would take a legal challenge if the Bill was enacted.</p>  <p>  On the issue of settlements more widely, all settlement activity is illegal under international law and contrary to Israel's obligations under the fourth Geneva convention on the treatment of civilian population under military occupation.  It is also damaging the viability of a future Palestinian state.  The T&aacute;naiste spoke with the US ambassador about this matter when he met him on 20 November, shortly after Secretary of State Pompeo's comments.  The views of the international community on settlements are extremely clear on this point and are comprehensively expressed in UN Security Council Resolution 2334 but also in many other UN Security Council resolutions.</p></speech>

This is done through the enforcement of regulations which have children at the heart of their implementation.</p><p>The removal of childcare providers from the register of early years services is the ultimate sanction by Tusla, the independent statutory regulator for the sector.  It comes at the end of an enforcement process during which Tusla makes every effort to support the provider to come into compliance with the regulations.</p><p>De-registrations and prosecutions are evidence of Tusla&rsquo;s robust approach where it finds evidence of disregard for regulations.</p><p>I acknowledge that de-registrations can cause significant challenges for parents in finding alternative childcare provision.</p> <p>I have great sympathy for parents in this situation.  Yet, I firmly believe that robust enforcement of the regulations is in children's interests and is the right thing to do.  Where a service is removed from the register, the staff of 30 Department-funded city and county childcare committees throughout the country are available to support parents who need help finding an alternative service.  Officials in my Department liaise closely with the relevant childcare committee to ensure that everything possible is being done for parents affected by closures.  In recent cases, childcare committees have operated extended opening hours to support parents.  The childcare committees have also been actively supporting and exploring the development of alternative childcare options in the locality.  Tusla has agreed to prioritise or fast-track the registration of any new service wishing to open.</p> <p> Capacity in the sector has doubled in the past five years and continues to rise.  However, I recognise that capacity constraints remain.  In 2019, I provided &euro;5.9 million towards the creation of new places within the sector.  I hope to announce details for a 2020 capital scheme in the coming months and I encourage providers to consider expansion.  In time the draft childminding action plan, which I published in August for public consultation, will have a major impact in increasing capacity in the sector through opening up regulation and funding to childminders.</p></speech>

The Minister talks about locality and fast-tracking.  I am aware of the issues because I met two of the providers in the area.  They do not have the capacity.  Capacity is at a premium, to be honest.  I am looking for a commitment from the Minister today on how Tusla, the Department and the city and county childcare committees can work with the parents to keep them together.</p>  <p>  The Minister referred to Tusla being robust.  Yet, it took the agency 18 months to get the service registered.  We are two years talking about this particular service.  I have no wish to go into that, but these parents have no option and they are being left high and dry.  They cannot find childcare in the area.  They want the Department to come on board and have a mentoring system.  Let us put someone in there who can help with management and administration.  The parents speak well of the really good staff, the baseline workers.  The parents have no option.  Their backs are to the wall and they are pleading with the Minister to help in finding a solution.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for her correspondence on the matter.  The county and city childcare committees have been offering support to parents, especially in those areas.  For example, the Dublin city childcare committee has received notice from more than 50 services declaring availability.  The committee looked for other services that may have additional capacity.  That list of services with availability has been circulated to the 32 parents who have made inquiries.  The Fingal county childcare committee has contacted 110 full-day services to establish availability.  A total of six parents have been in contact with the Fingal county childcare committee.  The city and county childcare committees have been working with parents on a case-by-case basis to try to match places with requirements.  They are engaged in other ways to support parents as well.  That is only the city and county childcare committee but I can refer to other things going on in my final reply.</p></speech>

We have a capacity crisis.  I appreciate the good work and what went online in the past week.  It is welcome to identify where there is availability in these areas.  That is a welcome move.  However, it does not address the position that these parents find themselves in.  We are three weeks out from 1 January and in the particular area two services are closing because they have to get ready for re-registration.  There is no capacity because parents have gone around and asked.  They have asked me and the Minister to liaise with Tusla and the city and county childcare committees to see whether there is a chance of getting someone in place to work with the owners to put in a mentoring service.

I would welcome the input of the Minister in trying to find a solution.</p></speech>

They have tried to identify where places are available.  If parents have not been in direct contact with the committees I urge them to make contact.</p>  <p>  Deputy Rabbitte has explored a recommendation with parents.  We have been thinking about that as well.  The Deputy referred to putting in place interim management to ensure a service does not close.  Unfortunately, it looks as if such a move needs legislation.  There needs to be some changes to legislation to allow an interim management to come in to run the service.  I have, however, asked the question.  We are looking at whether we can fast-track amending the legislation to allow for the placement of interim management in a de-registered cr&egrave;che.  That is what is required.  Second, Tusla is fast-tracking registration of some of the new services.  Third, I am going to call for a meeting of city and county childcare committee co-ordinators from throughout the country early in the new year to look at whether there are any further solutions we can offer relating to the capacity and de-registration of services.</p></speech>

The Deputy will be aware that Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, supports Amber in Kilkenny as part of its role to provide care and protection for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.</p>  <p>  Tusla has informed me that Amber has received &euro;506,468 in funding in 2019.  I understand Tusla is currently engaging with Amber on funding for 2020.  Details of funding and required service provision will be agreed in a service level agreement.</p>  <p>  A sum of &euro;25.3 million in funding is being allocated to Tusla for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services in 2020.  Following budget 2020, I issued Tusla with its performance statement for 2020 in line with the Child and Family Agency Act 2013.  In response to the performance statement Tusla will prepare a business plan for 2020.  The precise level of funding to be allocated to individual DSGBV services will be considered by Tusla in preparing its business plan.  The plan will be submitted to me shortly.</p>  <p>  In 2019, I provided Tusla with an additional &euro;1.5 million to provide additional targeted supports for domestic and sexual violence services.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that good progress has been made in the roll-out of these additional resources by service providers.  I highly value the work of individuals providing services to victims of domestic violence, including those in Amber.</p></speech>

It was very much appreciated that the Minister took the time to go down and see the service.  The service covers a vast area and includes the whole of Carlow and Kilkenny.  In fact, there is an argument that Carlow should have its own women's refuge.  Currently, it does not, but for various reasons, including family reasons, women in Carlow should be able to stay in Carlow.</p>  <p>  The question is specifically on the counselling budget.  To date, Amber has been running a fantastic service.  I cannot say enough good things about the service being run.  Women do not come from a domestic violence situation and wake up the next morning for everything to be okay again.  They have to go through a process and counselling is a key part of it.  Obviously, children who have been affected by or who have lived in a domestic abuse situation need counselling, which is often in the form of play therapy.  Currently, that is coming from a charitable organisation and there is no ring-fenced funding.  I know the organisation gets funding from Tusla, but there is no ring-fenced funding for counselling.</p></speech>

One of the precise recommendations that I made to Tusla, which is being taken up, was for the hiring of additional outreach support workers by refuges throughout the country.  I made the recommendation because I met domestic, sexual and gender-based violence service representatives from throughout the country, especially those working outside the main urban settings.</p> <p>I asked whether they would recommend that the women go to their service or the service go to the women and they suggested outreach workers.  Carlow-Kilkenny has already hired an additional one out of the 12 for whom I have provided funding.  I understand the hiring of a second outreach worker is in process.  It is important to state there are additional resources in that regard.  I will come back to the final question at the end.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-10a.410" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1266" speakername="Kathleen Funchion" time="17:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121000024#W00200"><p>I was speaking to them today.  That second outreach worker was finalised only yesterday or today.  It is good.  I welcome it.  That is to service Carlow.  Obviously, there are many people who must travel, as well as school issues, and it is not an ideal situation.</p>  <p>  Part of the reason for the question is that services dealing with domestic violence are often asked to undertake a needs analysis.  They spend a considerable amount of time, take it very seriously but then are still waiting on an answer or for those additional resources two years later.  In fairness, there was one granted either yesterday or today.  It is coincidental but is good news.</p>  <p>  I specifically emphasise counselling and play therapy because these are so valuable.  One cannot flee a domestic violence situation.  One will keep returning to it, unless one has the proper supports, and counselling is key to that.  At present, a voluntary charity is providing the counselling for them.  If that runs out, which it will at the end of this year, it will put the whole counselling budget in jeopardy, although that is such a vital part of the work that they do.</p></speech>

She has put it on the record and Tusla will be aware of that.  I hope and anticipate that counselling forms part of its negotiations, especially for 2020, to see whether there is any more scope for support for that particular aspect.  My information, however, is that it has not raised the issue of counselling and additional resources for counselling on an ongoing basis.  That is merely my information but I certainly hear the Deputy raising it.</p>  <p>  Second, in respect of the children, one way we spent the additional funding in 2019 was that Tusla began to roll out what is called the TLC Kidz programme, which is a healing programme for children, in a number of Tusla areas for children who witnesses domestic violence.  Facilitator training to support the roll-out was delivered in March and September of 2019.  There were very high levels of interest and participation.  I understand provision of that is coming to Kilkenny in January.</p>  <p>  Finally, in terms of the second outreach worker, I did not have that information and I am happy to hear it.  That recruitment process took longer than anticipated but it is good to know they have two in place.</p></speech>

I strongly believe that childminding has an important and distinctive role to play in the future of early learning and care and school-age childcare in this country and this is why I appointed an expert group, chaired by Childminding Ireland, in 2016 to revert to me with recommendations.</p>  <p>  Childminding is different from centre-based provision.  That is why regulation of childminding must be proportionate and appropriate to the home setting in which childminders work, and that is why it was important to have a consultation process in which the views of childminders themselves would be heard.</p>  <p>  At the heart of the public consultation was a series of 31 focus-group meetings across the country with childminders.  These were organised at county level by childcare committees.  They took place in the evenings to make it possible for childminders to attend.  In addition, one meeting of stakeholders took place during the working day to enable other stakeholders, such as parents or parent-and-children representatives, to take part, and I am delighted that some childminders were also able to attend that meeting.</p>  <p>  The consultation also involved an online survey and a call for submissions.  There were 471 respondents to the online survey, of whom nearly 60% were childminders.  In addition, there were 14 responses to the call for submissions.</p>  <p>  All aspects of the consultation are important and each will be fed into the final plan.  The views of those who attended the focus groups were carefully noted and will make a significant contribution to the analysis of the consultation that officials in my Department are now undertaking.</p>  <p>  If there are specific issues which the Deputy feels have not been reflected in the extensive consultation to date, my officials would be happy to consider them.  However, given the scale of consultation already undertaken, rather than extending the consultation I believe the priority now should be to review the childminding action plan in light of the views childminders have shared, and then to begin the processes of reform that they have called for.  My Department will continue to engage with Childminding Ireland and other relevant representative groups as the process continues.</p></speech>

One child in ten aged between zero and 12 years of age is cared for by a childminder.  When one looks at the preschool children where non-parental care is used, almost one third of these children are cared for by childminders.  If we want childcare to be affordable and accessible, childminding must be part of the solution.</p>  <p>  At present, a parent can only available of the affordable childcare scheme by using a registered childcare facility.  A big part of the reason that fewer than 100 childminders in Ireland are registered is that the current regulations are written with centre-based setting in mind.  Taking into consideration everything the Minister has said, there is a fear within the childminding sector that we will see a cutting and pasting of whatever has been done already for centre-based settings with standards and regulations to be forced upon childminders.  That is why they are looking for an extension of the consultation.  They do not feel that they were represented because they were not registered.</p></speech>

The Deputy's points are well taken, which is why I listed all the different ways in which we tried to have the consultation with childminders to inform the finalisation of that plan.</p>  <p>  In fairness, we have done extensive work in including, enabling and supporting childminders to drive what will be in that plan.  It is true to say that, ultimately, those are decisions for Government but it is not the case that we have not been asking or listening.  There are several issues that the childminders are particularly concerned about, particularly what level of qualification will be required, but we certainly are hearing those issues.  I agree the childminders need a bespoke set of regulations that are appropriate and proportionate for the childminding setting.</p></speech>

They felt that they had not enough time to engage on it.</p>  <p>  The childminders do not want academia to write the report.  They want it to be childminding-child led.  Childminding, as opposed to a centre-based setting, is a completely different animal.  The childminders want to be in control of their own rules and regulations with everybody else because it is a completely different setting.  I think the Minister would agree with me on all of that.</p>  <p>  Can the Minister give me details of the appointments to the various working groups and expert panels?  Can the Minister assure me of some of the names that come from the childminding sector that would reassure the childminders that their voices and representations are at the core of this?</p></speech>

In fairness, it was Childminding Ireland that led that first piece of consultation out of which the draft action plan was put in place ultimately.  I absolutely agree with the Deputy.  It will not happen under my leadership.</p>  <p>  On the Deputy's second question, I do not have specific names in front of me.  However, in terms of the steering committee that will be appointed to drive and oversea the implementation of the action plan once it has been finalised, I can state there is an explicit commitment that it will include representatives of childminders, parents and other key stakeholders within the sector.  The role of the steering committee will including monitoring and reviewing of the implementation of the plan.  During phase 1, it is proposed four advisory groups will be established and they will work with officials on regulation and inspection, qualifications and training, funding and financial supports and consultation and communications.  I can only say that I expect and anticipate that, of course, some childminders will be part of that.</p></speech>

Since this is a regulatory issue, my Department does not have a direct role in the processing of registration applications or maintenance of the register.  Tusla was given additional powers in 2016 which included the registration of services.  The deadline for re-registration has been known to providers since then and indeed it appears on their registration certificate.  Over the past 18 months, Tusla has been engaging with providers on requirements for re-registration, including through a consultative forum of stakeholders.  Tusla issued further guidance to service providers in August 2019 on specific documentation required on planning permission as part of the re-registration process.</p>  <p>  In order to be registered on 1 January 2020, providers must submit an application for re-registration by midnight on 12 December 2019.  Providers were urged to submit their applications in advance of this date, given the large volume of applications expected.  The deadline of 12 December was necessary in order to give Tusla time to process all applications.  To minimise uncertainty for providers, last week, on 5 December, Tusla issued a further letter to all providers, offering assurance that any provider who submits a completed application with the specified essential documents by 12 December will be re-registered.  All providers who submit a completed application will be issued a further individual confirmation of re-registration by 20 December and will be able to continue operation of their service in January. </p>  <p>  I am informed by Tusla that the total number of early years services that are due to re-register by 31 December 2019 is 4,117.  As of Monday morning, 3,752 services had commenced the application process on the Tusla portal.  Of these, 3,081 applications had been submitted via the online portal for assessment.  Therefore, 671 applications are commenced but not yet submitted and just 365 have yet to start the application process.  I have a further update to add to that in the supplementary reply.</p>  <p>  Submitted applications are currently being processed in batches through a series of specially convened registration panels.  My Department has been working closely with Tusla to ensure there is adequate staffing in place to process applications on time, and to assist with effective communications with providers.  In addition, my Department has supported city and county childcare committees to give advice and assistance to providers that need help with re-registration.  In recognition of the difficulties many providers were experiencing in completing re-registration, as the Deputies know, Tusla decided to revise the timeline for submission of supporting documentation for re-registration.  Under the revised arrangements, while providers must apply to Tusla by 12 December, they have until 30 June 2020 to provide some of the supporting documentation required, including on fire safety and planning requirements.  On 27 November, my Department issued a letter informing providers that Tusla has revised the timeline for submission of supporting documentation for re-registration.  That letter provided clear guidance on what is required by 12 December and what can be submitted up until 30 June.</p></speech>

I take her point about the consultative forum with stakeholders.  Is that with county childcare committees?  Dealing with early years providers in Kildare, I find that there seems to be a disconnect in terms of communication.  I presume it is because they are very busy running their facilities on a day-to-day basis.  They are the backbone of our childcare system and provide a safe environment for our children to learn, play, grow and develop.  It is really important.  We should look at communication.  There has been a lot of stress and concern and some of the information may not be getting down to the individual childcare providers.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the additional time that was notified recently on it, which gives an opportunity to childcare providers that are under pressure.  It is a significant burden on many of them.  They want to be compliant and have everything in order and are making every effort.  The time and cost of bringing in a chartered surveyor and expensive skills are a burden on the childcare providers.  Those skills may not be readily available.  Of the 365 providers that are not engaged, which is a large number of people, how many of them are from Cork?  On the 600 that started and did not follow through, almost a quarter is in question there.  Can the Minister clarify how many of those are Cork-related?  Will these operators be in a position to access further funding, given that they will not be fully registered and fully compliant?  Parents applying for the new affordable childcare scheme will want to know that the provider and operator will be accessible to them.  What is their status in that regard?</p></speech>

They have to submit an application by 12 December.  There is a certain set of documentation that is required for 12 December.  Most of that documentation should be pretty much on hand, such as Garda vetting for the registered provider, two references for the registered provider, a certificate that it is registered, the registration number of companies from the Registration Office, a statement of the provider's purpose and function, a safety statement, signed declaration and so on.  Those are pretty straightforward but they have to submit them by 12 December.  Other documents on planning permission and fire safety that may be more complicated are not required until 30 June.  They need to put in their application by 12 December in order to be re-registered.</p>  <p>  I have just received a note today.  Tusla put out a press release stating that more than 94% of the service providers have applied for re-registration ahead of the deadline.  There are 230 remaining.  That is a pretty strong and exceptional result.  It is just a few days out and I urge the remaining 230 to put in to re-register because they cannot get funding if they are not re-registered.  I do not know the number for Cork but I can see if I can get that information for the Deputy.  </p>  <p>  In response to the question about ongoing consultation, I hear that in respect of Kildare particularly.  I think that is what the Deputy is raising and we can pass it on to Tusla.  I have information on the consultative forum and ongoing engagement with the stakeholders, which I am happy to share with the Deputy.  His general point is something I will take back to see if that can be improved.</p></speech>

I am not aware that there is a telephone line.  Maybe if childcare providers had a direct line that they could use to call Tusla and ask specific questions, it would be most helpful and might take some confusion out of the process.  I do not believe there is a helpline number for them.  The Minister might follow up on that as well.</p>  <p>  I am aware, from having talked to the childcare providers, that this potentially has knock-on impacts on their insurance, which is very serious, in addition to the need for them to get that application and the registration in for funding.  On the re-registration, how long will it last and when will they have to renew it?  Is it a once-off or an annual thing?  Is the registration in any way linked to the national childcare scheme or is it completely different and only to do with the funding for the early years school providers?</p></speech>

If the Minister can get those and forward them to me, I would be pleased.  What will be the position of the 230 who have not engaged next Friday?  What will happen?  Will funding be turned off if they are not registered and where do parents stand?  Can the Minister clarify that?  There is a real concern about what the status of the not-engaged people will be.  Will the many families who use these services be made aware and what is their position going to be on Friday in the event that some or many of these 230 are not registered?</p></speech>

I will put a request in for a dedicated phone line, to see if that is possible, especially for these last few days.</p>  <p>  What I have been trying to outline in the answer to this question and at a couple of other points is that they were communicated with from the time that they registered initially about the requirement to be re-registered in a three-year period.  I have outlined the ways that Tusla has had some ongoing communication with providers in that regard.  I have run small organisations and businesses so I understand that one gets to that point when one needs to do something when there is very little time left as distinct from way ahead.  There are some people who have not gone on to the portal and put in the registration process.  I call on them to do that.  If they are not registered, if they do not do that, the Department will not be able to provide funding.  I think the time that people have been given is very reasonable.  We have been communicating that it is important to do.  If people are having real difficulty in finding paperwork or understanding how to do it they should phone my Department and ask for assistance.</p></speech>

Those parents are still asking to meet the Minister.  I appreciate that she gave me a response recently but they are not happy with it.  They are concerned not just about their plight but about the wider issue that has emerged that the highest childcare costs in this country, which are higher than in most of Europe, are in our area, and about the lack of places.  They also do not accept Tusla&rsquo;s contentions about the circumstances which led to 20 places effectively going in that facility.</p></reply>

Investment in the sector has increased by 138% over the past five budgets.  This investment has helped to bring about a doubling of capacity and a doubling of the number of children receiving State subsidies.  However, I recognise that there are continuing capacity issues in parts of the country.  Pobal data has shown a vacancy rate of 4% across all services, but these vacancies are not necessarily in the localities where parents are seeking childcare places.  </p><p>Staff of 30 childcare committees across the country can provide practical assistance to any parents who have difficulty finding a service.  Their contact details can be found at <i>myccc.gov.ie</i>.  I am committed to further increasing the capacity of sector and I will be launching a capital grant programme for 2020 shortly.  I will be inviting providers to apply for grants to expand capacity where demand exists.  I also ensured that the national development plan committed &euro;250 million for the expansion of high quality childcare.  This funding will come on stream in 2023 and will provide a significant opportunity to develop further capacity.</p><p>Many parents opt for home-based or childminding provision.  To this end, I have recently consulted on a draft action plan for childminders which, when finalised and implemented, will see increased capacity in that part of the sector also.</p><p>With regard to affordability, I am aware that this is a concern for many parents, particularly in the Deputy's constituency, which has the highest childcare costs in the State, as the Deputy has identified.  I am very pleased that the national childcare scheme has now been commenced.  It provides significant financial support to parents for childcare expenses.  It provides subsidies on a sliding scale, so those who need most help will receive the highest subsidies.  </p><p>In addition, I have recently established an expert group to examine the current model of funding for childcare, its effectiveness in delivering quality, affordable, sustainable and inclusive services.  One of my key objectives since becoming Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has been to address the affordability and availability but I recognise that this is an ongoing agenda, with more to be done.</p></speech>

The increase in the cost for the cr&egrave;che I mentioned, because of Tusla&rsquo;s requirements for that cr&egrave;che, is greater than that.  The cost is now up to about &euro;1,200 a month, which is mind-boggling.  On that specific issue the parents would like to meet the Minister because that cr&egrave;che was registered for 70 children in 2016.  Now the parents have been told in the middle of the year that is too many.  That is a specific problem.</p>  <p>  They also want to discuss the wider issue of the cost which is not sustainable.  The lack of places in our area is shocking.  For example, as part of the planning permission for the huge residential development on the site of the old D&uacute;n Laoghaire golf club where there are thousands of new residences, there was to have been a major childcare facility.  That never appeared.  Cr&egrave;ches are full to capacity, too expensive and there are not enough places.  We really need quite radical and urgent action to address that.</p></speech>

It is exactly the same in my constituency.  Only yesterday I met some residents, some of whom are commuting to Dublin with their 18 month old babies.  There are buggies on the trains from Meath into Dublin because the parents cannot find a cr&egrave;che.  Several housing estates have been built and last week the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection said that all the facilities were in place.  There are 250 houses occupied, 900 to go and no cr&egrave;che.  It is in the plans but there is nowhere for these children to go because the capacity is not there.  I have raised this in previous questions about Dunshaughlin and Ashbourne.  Another constituent cannot take up a job in Ashbourne because there is no childcare.  There is no childcare in the commuter belt and it is not right that children have to go on the trains to Dublin.  Parents stress out about this.  It is a major failing of Government and it is time that a grip was got on it.</p></speech>

If they are on an industrial wage they are entitled to further additional supports.  Have they applied for the national childcare scheme which determines how much of a subsidy they will receive?  They should be entitled to more, particularly on an industrial wage.</p>  <p>  The Deputy raised the issue particularly of afterschool places.  Is that correct? </p></speech>

We have to follow the regulations.  I refer to the Deputies' questions about plans for new housing developments, whether there are childcare plans and the fact there are no childcare facilities.  That is a difficulty.</p> <p>Difficulties arise when new housing developments include childcare facilities in their plans but such facilities are not made available.  I will seek to examine the specific areas identified by the Deputy to determine why those facilities are not in place.  The capacity issue is challenging but I have identified the different initiatives we are undertaking to try to increase capacity, although it is not always the case that such an increase will happen.  It is too much of a charge to say that we just do not have the capacity and that this is a problem for Government.  We are doing different things to address the capacity issue.  That said, I hear what the Deputy is saying in terms of promises being made in the context of childcare places in new housing developments that did not materialise.  I do not disagree with his point in that regard.  </p></speech>

Costs are already unaffordable and there has been a failure to deliver new cr&egrave;che places as part of major residential developments.  The fact that those places were in the plans and were a condition of planning permission but were not provided is absolutely unacceptable.</p>  <p>  I ask the Minister to consider meeting this group of parents.  They are not looking for a fight with her.  They want to explain the issues to her from their point of view.  They want her to understand the question of affordability, the specifics of their case and the problems more generally being faced in the entire south Dublin area.  They would appreciate the chance to engage with her.  I am sure that Deputies from other areas would want to make the same case but south Dublin has the highest costs and the biggest capacity problem in the country.</p></speech>

There is a universal entitlement as well as a legal financial entitlement to a subsidy for childcare costs that is means-tested and based on the age of the child and how long the child will be in childcare.  That is why I cannot believe that the people to whom the Deputy refers are only entitled to a subsidy of &euro;20.</p>  <p>  On the issue of fees, he is right to be exercised given the area he represents.  I appreciate and understand that south Dublin has the highest childcare costs.  However, under the scheme, it is not necessarily the case that costs or fees will increase.  We will continue to monitor that.  The expert group to which I referred is currently looking at ways in which we can link fee increases to improvements in quality.  I have a list of vacant childcare places in Deputy Boyd Barrett's constituency.  For children up to one year old, there are 13 vacant places; for children between one and two years of age, there are 14 places; while for children between two and three, there are 16 vacant places.  This list, dated June 2019, shows that there are places available in his constituency.  However, given the fact that he represents people from the area with the highest costs, I will meet the group of parents to whom he refers. </p></speech>

Tusla has identified significant numbers of unallocated cases in five of its 17 areas.  In September 2019, these five areas accounted for 56% of all unallocated cases.  I assure the Deputy that where a child has not been allocated a social worker, he or she is supported and monitored by the duty social work team until a social worker is allocated.</p>  <p>  Tusla has advised my Department that special measures have been put in place to improve performance in the five areas.  Staffing is the main reason unallocated cases are higher in these areas.  There is an insufficient number of social workers on the teams carrying out the child welfare and protection tasks and this point has also been made by HIQA in its inspections of these areas.  One of Tusla's specific initiatives is a bespoke recruitment campaign to fill the existing social work vacancies across these areas.  Tusla has also put in place business support staff to free up social workers to focus on core child protection work.  </p>  <p>  With regard to rapid responses to urgent cases, Tusla operates an urgent system across all parts of the country.  Section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991 permits An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to remove a child from a situation of acute risk.  The child is then transferred to Tusla, which undertakes an assessment of the child's situation.  Tusla may return the child home, if the environment is deemed safe, or apply for an emergency care order.  Tusla also operates an out-of-hours social work service.  This service provides access to an on-call social worker at regional or area level who can go the scene of an incident in specific cases of a serious nature.</p></speech>

I just indicated to the Deputy that a recruitment campaign is being run specifically for the five areas where there is the greatest problem of unallocated cases because of a lack of social workers.  Tusla is also conducting a number of other campaigns to recruit the number of social workers required.  It is also putting in place a number of new retention initiatives on foot of a survey of staff throughout the organisation.  I believe that some of those initiatives are happening now.  Tusla is trying new things to increase the number of social workers and in that context, I am satisfied.  The Deputy will be aware that a shortage of social workers is not exclusive to Ireland but is also an issue in many other jurisdictions.  I am satisfied that Tusla is being innovative in its efforts to increase the number of social workers in the agency.</p></speech>

It is difficult to retain social workers because the work is intensive, responsible and urgent.  In that context and given the urgency of the situation, is the Minister satisfied that sufficient resources have been made available to her Department to deal with this issue?  Our population is growing, with almost 500,000 more people living here than ten years ago.  In those circumstances, is she satisfied that adequate provision is being made to address the issues that are arising and that are likely to arise in the future?</p></speech>

The next question deals with what we have been doing to change the latter.  There have also been difficulties with retention which Tusla is attempting to address.  It has a new workforce development strategy that it is beginning to implement.  I am satisfied that this is not a resource issue.  There are other issues at play here but Tusla is coming up with new ways of ensuring that it moves beyond the stasis of the recent past.</p></speech>

I would like the Minister to outline the measures being taken to increase the recruitment and improve the retention of social workers in Tusla.  I would like her to specifically address the low numbers of social workers being trained in the country and to outline what can be done to increase the numbers entering the profession.</p></reply>

We made modest progress during 2019.  Tusla has had a net increase of 65 social workers since the start of the year, and the turnover rate for social workers has fallen from nearly 9% in 2018 to 7.5% by 31 October this year. </p> <p> It has been clear to me for some time that we must identify ways to increase the supply of social work graduates in Ireland.  Our social workers are the linchpin of so many of our essential front-line services for the most vulnerable in our society.</p> <p> For some time I have been encouraging Tusla to develop a strategic multi-annual workforce plan, which would reflect the realities of the labour market and the current limited supply of social workers.  I am pleased that Tusla finalised a strategic workforce planning model in 2019 which I understand will be rolled out over the coming years.  The model will seek to deliver on a strategic focus for Tusla, with a gradual transition to multidisciplinary teams consisting of the optimum mix of skills across social work, social care, therapeutic staff, family support, education welfare, and administrative support.</p> <p> I welcome the focus on recruitment and retention as part of the roll-out of the strategic workforce implementation plan, assisting staff well-being through the assessment of workplace stressors and critical incident exposure in the workplace.</p> <p> My Department has also taken the initiative to establish a social work education group which provides a forum for Tusla and other stakeholders, including the HSE and the Probation Service, to explore and take possible actions to influence the future supply of social workers. </p> <p> A key initial priority identified by the group is the streamlining of student placements which does not happen at the moment.  My Department has commissioned research to identify ways and alternative approaches to streamline this process through working with stakeholders.  The final research report will be discussed at the next meeting of the group in January of next year.</p></speech>

Tusla CEO, Mr. Bernard Gloster, appeared before the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs a few weeks ago and explained to us how it is going to try to transition some of the agency staff on to the payroll of Tusla.  I advocate this because children need continuation and support.  When one considers that there are 6,200 cases of unallocated social workers at the moment, there is an urgency to this.</p>  <p>  What have we done with the universities?  Mr. Gloster mentioned Maynooth at the time of his visit.  What programmes are in place so that we can increase the intake from 250 upwards to meet the demand?</p></speech>

The grades to be included are social work, social care, family support and administrative staff supporting front-line teams.  Tusla has had productive discussions with F&oacute;rsa trade union on the proposed conversion which could potentially result involve up to 400 agency staff.</p>  <p>  As Bernard Gloster said to the committee, 389 agency posts selected for conversion have now commenced offers from local Tusla management.  The offers were started in recent days and are expected to be substantially completed by next week.  A short turnaround is envisaged and subject to take-up rates by the workers, expected to be known to large degree by the week of 20 December, there will be a commencement of the conversions in January 2020.  In the event that the offers are refused - some may be refused and worker choice is a big factor - by the same token 389 post are being offered, which is substantial progress.</p></speech>

We cannot survive on agency staff as it is not good enough for the families or for the children.  The figure of 389 conversions starting on 1 January 2020 is a great start for Tusla.  May it continue because there are many more staff who hopefully we can bring on to the conversion programme.</p>  <p>  Can the Minister address the issue of Maynooth or whatever other colleges may be involved?  Has she worked with the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, or the Minister for Education and Skills on other courses where we can expand opportunities to recruit and to train and develop people in the sector?  There are not enough spaces there, so how can we increase the figure of 250 upwards?</p></speech>

This is happening and I expect this will produce some results as well.</p>  <p>  We have been engaging directly with the Department of Education and Skills and there are officials from that Department on the working group established by my Department to look at how to increase the number of places at third level.  The first thing that has to happen, as indicated in the first part of my response, is that we need to have a streamlined placement services for the students which has not happened yet.  This makes it more difficult for universities to increase their supply of spaces unless it is easier for them to place students, as we do for doctors and nurses etc.  That will happen.</p>  <p>  There are some changes in the retention.  The survey of workers identified that if they are supervised and supported by a stable management team, and, in particular, a team leader, they will want to stay.  If they have a manageable caseload, they will want to stay even more.  If they work alongside a fully-staffed, stable and experienced team, they will want to remain longer again.  All those issues are being addressed.</p></speech>

Funding provided by my Department for playgrounds is limited to capital spend, namely, the capital grant funding scheme for play and recreation.

The funding of supervisory posts such as those referenced in the Deputy&rsquo;s question would not meet the criteria for this funding scheme, or indeed any other funding scheme operated by my Department.</p>  <p>  I understand that the supervision currently in place is being delivered by Crosscare until the end of the year and that the supervision relates to supervision of play equipment, rather than direct supervision of children or young people.  I further understand that the playground is currently open and will remain open in the future.  I can again assure the Deputy that I continue to place a very high priority on ensuring that our children and young people have access to the best possible play and recreation facilities as one way to promote their physical and social development.

These are old terraced council houses.  It is an area with a DEIS school and is a pocket of disadvantage in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Many of the children who go there, from the ages of three and four up to 13, are children who would frankly not go to the other open playgrounds.  There are a number of children with special needs.  This is a community amenity and facility which caters for children with special needs in an area of disadvantage.  It is not unique to have such a thing.  I talked to Barnardos, for example, which runs such a facility in Waterford city.  This is a good thing that works and is a glue for the community.  It is very good for children.  We often talk about early intervention and this is a form of it.  The people who are there are trained and have Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, qualifications.</p> <p>To remove the supervision would be retrograde and many of the children who go there will not return to it if there is no supervision.</p></speech>

They have worked there for more than a decade.  In Pauline's case it is probably about 20 years.  Many of the children who go there now will not go anymore if the supervision is removed.  Some agenda is operating here.  I believe somebody else wants the building that they partly use, to be honest.  That is what is happening and it is wrong and retrograde.  Crosscare runs it and employs them and before that it was run by Catholic Youth Care, CYC.  That indicates there is a childcare component to it.  Why else would Crosscare have employed them for the last ten years?  Now Crosscare is saying the children are too young for it because it deals with teenagers.  The playground caters for children who are between three and 14 years old.  It is retrograde that Crosscare is pulling out; I am disappointed with Crosscare.  It is also retrograde that the council seems to think it should get rid of something that is working.  The community and the children in the area will suffer consequences if the supervision is removed.  I am seeking proactive intervention with the council, Crosscare or the ETB so we do not lose a good facility that works for the community.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister's commentary on the targeted youth funding scheme.  How can one apply for it?  Must one be a member of the major groups?  What are the 30 other national groups?  I am trying to understand this because there appear to be many groups and this follows up on where Deputy Boyd Barrett concluded.  Who works with the Department?  Is it the education and training board, the city and county childcare committees or the county councils?  Who is submitting some of these funding applications and how can one get advance notice that one can access this funding so one might not be left behind?  That might have been the case in Deputy Boyd Barrett's area.  I am asking on behalf of Tuam and Ballinasloe.  We are trying to get a bus that can be part of the Irish youth justice system.  I see the Minister smiling at that-----</p></speech>

The targeted youth scheme was reviewed a couple of years ago.  There were four types of schemes and different groups could apply to them to get grants and funding.  The review recommended bringing it into one scheme as that would be more efficient and effective.  Three years of consultation took place with the youth sector in many different ways.  That is not to say that there was not some criticism and concern as to whether the groups currently getting funding would continue to get it.  It is built into the scheme that they will be given time to reach the criteria for the scheme so they can continue to get funding, while new groups can also access it.</p>  <p>  It will be administered through the ETB.  I will launch it at the end of this year and the information will go out in the new year.  If there are new groups that have not accessed funds, I expect that the information will be made known and available.  If it is not, I ask the Deputy to refer back to me in that regard.</p></speech>

Is that the full allocation of &euro;11 million for the year?  Will people know that is the pot of money and how to make an application to access the funding?  What recommendations does the Minister think she will give to some of the groups?  Some of them might never have applied previously.  They might think they are too small or they might not be managed under a particular heading.  Will it be driven through the ETBs, the county councils or other youth work organisations?  I am trying to flag in advance for all the youth groups that there is funding coming and that this will be the main mechanism for accessing it for 2020.</p></speech>

I anticipate that most youth organisations and services that are currently getting funding will continue to get it, but through a new vehicle.  The Deputy's question about awareness raising and communications is a good one.  To be straight, I am not sure if it is my Department that will do it or the ETB, but I will raise that question.  As to whether the &euro;11 million that is available is for the targeted youth scheme, we have moneys for the targeted youth scheme, which I am describing now, and for the national youth organisations.  I do not have the figures with me regarding how much is for one and how much is for the other.</p> <p>As I indicated, there has been an increase of an additional &euro;8.5 million, or some 16%, for the targeted scheme since 2016, when I took over the Ministry, and a 10% increase for the universal scheme.</p></speech>

While it is not possible to remove every risk, Tusla makes every effort to assess thoroughly all people who wish to be foster carers.</p>  <p>  The approval process for general foster carers can take several months.  The assessment is carried out by a qualified social worker under the supervision of a social work team leader.  The assessment focuses on the capacity and suitability of the applicants to provide safe, secure care to a child.  An essential part of the process is to undertake safeguarding checks on potential foster carers, to include references, medical assessments and Garda vetting.  This information is included in the report prepared for the foster care committee to assist them in making a decision regarding approval.  Children are not placed with the foster carers until they are approved.  The process includes ongoing Garda vetting for foster carers and adult family members, including their own children when they reach 16 years of age.  An important part of the assessment process is that potential foster carers attend at information and training sessions, which include sessions on how to keep children safe in foster care.</p>  <p>  In the case of children placed with relative foster carers, the child care regulations state that for an emergency placement in foster care, the assessment must take place as soon as is practicable.  This is in recognition of unanticipated situations for some children, where their best interests may be met, at least initially, by placing them with relatives.  However, the standards are clear that safety checks, including Garda vetting, must take place before the child is placed.</p>  <p>  As many of the children who are placed with foster carers have previously been neglected or abused, foster carers are advised on ways to be particularly mindful in how they care for the children in this respect.  Foster carers have a link social worker, which is separate to the child&rsquo;s social worker, who provides support and supervision and is attentive to the impact of the fostering situation on all members of the foster carer&rsquo;s family.  The protection of children in foster care from harm is of the utmost importance in all circumstances.</p></speech>

We have a history in this regard in this country.  A first ever national fostering week was recently organised by the Child and Family Agency.  While I do not have a difficulty with this, it obviously led to a huge increase in the number of inquiries.  This is a good thing, on the one hand, because we definitely need good foster parents, who do an excellent and difficult job, one I do not envy and I do not know how many of them do it.  However, we need to ask the questions, not just about background checks, but also about supports for those foster parents and whether those supports are ongoing.  Other Deputies also raised the question of resources.  For example, if we do not have enough social workers and aftercare workers, are we really in a situation where we can monitor foster care on an ongoing basis and do we have the resources to do that?  That is the crux of the matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-10a.511" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="18:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121000030#CC00600"><p>The Deputy mentioned the recent campaign Tusla conducted to see if it could get more people interested in providing foster care.  As the Deputy indicated, it resulted in some 350 inquiries, which are now being followed up.  That is substantial and I congratulate Tusla for doing that, in particular as it was the first time.</p>  <p>  One of the reasons it did that was in regard to resources and the best way to spend them.  The Deputy and others have raised previously the difference in cost between private placements for children in care and the cost of public foster carers, who are supported by Tusla.  Given that difference in cost, Tusla ran this campaign to see if it could get more people interested in becoming foster parents.  While it was not necessarily just cost driven, it was conscious of that.  Obviously, the more foster carers or parents there are who are providing that service with Tusla, the more resources will be better spent in supporting those providing foster care. </p></speech>

Particularly when people have been foster parents for a long time and they are well known as a good placement, they get asked to take emergency cases with very little support, and an emergency case can then turn into months and the children are still with them.  People are often left with a lot of unanswered questions.  I am always conscious of our history and how much we have failed children in the past.  I hope we are starting off on the right foot.  If it is going to have these types of fostering weeks and information sessions, this would always need to be followed up robustly and it has to be ongoing, not based on one check.  First, foster parents themselves need support and, second, we need to always ensure that the most vulnerable children in our society are in a totally safe environment.  That is my concern.</p></speech>

I hear the Deputy's point that some foster carers may be making representations to her that they feel they could use more support.  I will communicate that to Tusla.  However, that should not stop Tusla from going out and looking for more.  At the same time, it should be integral that if are increasing the numbers, we need to ensure there is additional support.</p></speech>

My Department engages with the services regularly through a number of organisations and representative groups.</p>  <p>  Insurance costs and risks associated with this area for early learning and care and school age childcare services have very recently been flagged with my Department, and my officials are looking into this and engaging in a process.  Information suggests that while insurance costs are a concern, to date they are not as significant an issue in this sector as in others.  However, my officials have just been informed that one of the two underwriters currently in the Irish early learning and care sector insurance market has decided to withdraw from this jurisdiction.  The broker involved has written to the services affected noting that, although the insurance market is at present restricted in this area, it is working hard to organise a smooth transfer to a new insurer.  My officials are carefully examining the current situation and any challenges that may arise in the short to medium term.  My Department has not entered discussions with the organisation mentioned, but will consider the suggestion of the Deputy as this work progresses.</p>  <p>  Early Childhood Ireland, a national organisation representing about 80% of early learning and care and school age childcare services in the country, operates an insurance scheme for its members.  Many avail of it, and my officials will be engaging with Early Childhood Ireland as this work progresses. </p>  <p>  My Department oversees a case management system through which Pobal and local childcare committees offer assistance to services experiencing financial or governance difficulties.  There have been some individual cases in which insurance costs have been a factor, but it has not been a primary focus to date.  These services continue to be offered supports by my Department, tailored to their individual circumstances through a case management process.  I will be happy to report back to the Deputy when my officials have completed their consideration of the issues raised.</p></speech>

It is a reality that there is a higher cost of insurance, unless all of these issues just happen to be in the constituency I represent.  This was raised on Leaders' Questions today.  We know it concerns childcare, preschool, adventure centres and many other places that involve children and that have children moving and active, which we know is important.</p> <p>None of these things happens overnight.  Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh's Bill is being progressed, but other Bills could have been progressed before it.  There is a link between spiralling claims and spiralling costs.  Childcare is just so important, and the Minister knows that better than anyone.  She knows the invaluable service it provides, not just for the children but also for the parents who can go back to work.  It is certainly very important to those parents in Dublin Central who are in addiction and trying to get out of it and into recovery.  As the Minister mentioned, the other insurance broker is pulling out now.  If there will be only one insurance company left, it will have the market to itself.  It is important that there is engagement with the remaining broker in order that it does not further increase prices.</p></speech>

As she will be aware, the Government is pursuing insurance reform, although perhaps not in the way in which Deputies opposite want it to.  Another Minister is in charge of that.</p>  <p>  I will add to my initial information further information specifically about the childcare sector.  My understanding is that the broker that was working with the underwriter that has pulled out of the market has informed its clients that it is actively seeking a new underwriter with which to partner.  I mentioned Early Childhood Ireland, which I commend on its work in this area.  It has a group scheme for insurance and has worked with us very closely to ensure that is the case.  I encourage any childcare organisations that may have been impacted by the pulling out of the other broker to contact Early Childhood Ireland to see whether this group scheme represents another way for them to move forward with their work, at least in the interim.</p></speech>

The cost of insurance working group and the Judicial Council Bill may have some effect, but in the meantime there are increasing costs for childcare facilities, particularly community facilities.  The private ones have other resources they can use that community ones cannot.  The ones I know have been told their commercial rates could increase by 3.5% this year.  They have had insurance cost increases of several hundred euro.  Those few hundred euro mean a lot to small community preschools.  They are also complying with all the fire safety work, which, of course, they agree with, but, again, that is a further cost on them.  The other cost issue is payment to the staff.  The pay is very low.  Someone who has done a degree in early childhood care will not get the wage commensurate with holding a degree.  This is part of a picture of early childhood care.</p></speech>

This is putting the childcare organisations in her constituency to the pin of their collar in terms of sustainability.  The Department is available to work with, and support, these organisations through some kind of sustainability plan.  If they have not asked, they should reach out.  I have indicated that we have not heard concerns from many providers.  If, however, the Deputy has identified a number that have concerns, I could meet her later and we could look at them and some of the ones within her constituency and see what the challenges and difficulties are in moving forward.  As I said, I do not know the fees or the numbers.  If, however, Early Childhood Ireland is offering a group scheme, I encourage providers to move in that direction.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister her and the Government's plans to support women's refuges and networks such as Women Together Tallaght Network in the context of some of the facts we have heard highlighted over these 16 days.  One in two women murdered in Ireland is killed by her partner or ex-partner, but Ireland only has one third of the refuge space recommended by the Istanbul Convention.</p></reply>

I strongly value the hard work and community spirit of the people of Tallaght.</p>  <p>  I understand that the networks to which the Deputy refers receive funding from the Department of Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  Tusla has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of domestic violence and provides funding for the provision of specialist front-line services.  These networks do not currently fall under the remit of Tusla's funded services for domestic and sexual violence.</p>  <p>  Younger people are particularly vulnerable to abuse.  It is important that negative attitudes to women and girls are addressed early on.  The National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020 is a cross-Government initiative in which many Departments, including my own, are involved.</p>  <p>  Tusla has led on the delivery of the Manuela programme for 15 to 17 year olds.  This six-week educational programme equips young people with the skills and behaviours to promote consent in personal relationships.  More than 1,500 young people have participated in the programme to date.</p>  <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of refuge accommodation.  This is also important to me as part of the services and supports for victims of domestic violence.  Refuge should be temporary.  The Deputy will have heard the Taoiseach express in this House his views that the perpetrator, not the victim, should leave the home.  I agree with that.</p>  <p>  Responsibility for investment in new refuges falls under the remit of a number of Government bodies.  The planning and resourcing of additional refuge accommodation requires cross-Government support.  Future developments will be informed by Tusla's review of emergency refuge accommodation nationwide, which will be completed in early 2020, as well as the identified needs of service users throughout the country.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that five additional refuge spaces will become available in south Dublin this month and three additional refuge spaces will be available in Galway in January 2020.</p></speech>

I am sure it is the same throughout the country.  I welcome the fact that a new refuge is being opened, and I accept that this is not purely the Minister's responsibility.  However, the fact that Saoirse Women's Refuge, for example, must do all this fundraising to fill the centre with furniture, equipment, etc., demonstrates a problem in that it is not sufficiently funded.  Even with the opening of the new centre, does the Minister accept that compared with the Istanbul standards, for example, we still have significantly fewer spaces than we need?  What long-term plans exist to keep refuge centres afloat in order that they not be forced to engage in all this fundraising from local communities as opposed to funding being provided by the State?</p></speech>

I will answer the Deputy's questions in a couple of different ways.  Regarding the ongoing resources they require, since the beginning of my Ministry, I have increased the resources to this sector by more than &euro;5 million in recent years.  I understand that is limited, but there has been an increase based on priority in the past year as well as this year, I expect.  What is the best way to target the money?  I have asked the sector and pulled together representatives of it to identify how best to use the resources to meet the greatest need.</p>  <p>  I would like to address the issue of the standard of the Istanbul Convention in my final reply.</p></speech>

Safe Ireland has reported that housing instability is four times more likely to affect women who have experienced domestic violence and that one in four homeless women cites intimate partner violence as a major contributor to her homelessness.  This was illustrated by a woman who recently contacted me for assistance.  This, again, does not directly relate to the question of refuges.  This woman lives very close to her former partner, who is abusive and violent towards her.  South Dublin County Council refuses to treat her as a priority for a transfer because she is a tenant of an approved housing body.  The approved housing body has tried to assist but does not have appropriate alternative accommodation.</p> <p>She is left in limbo between the council and the approved housing body because the approved housing body said it does not have anywhere appropriate and the council simply refuses to treat her as a priority despite letters from Saoirse Women's Refuge, the Garda etc.</p></speech>

I am aware of the interface between housing, homelessness and domestic and sexual violence.  That is clearly an issue.  Safe Ireland is one of our greatest organisations in this area and does excellent work.  I am also aware of the issues that it raises and shares with the Deputy and I seek to address them.  On the standards of the Istanbul Convention and how many refuge spaces we have, as the Deputy is aware, the Istanbul Convention recommends two standards.  Tusla is following one.  Safe Ireland and other organisations want us to follow the other, which would require us to increase the number of refuge spaces by significantly more than we have now.  With the standard currently in use, we are almost providing the number of required refuge spaces.  Space is available in five units in Rathcoole for five adults and 15 children.  Nine units will be available in Rathmines in 2020 for nine adults and 27 children.  There will also be additional spaces in Galway.</p>  <p>  Tusla is reviewing what is required throughout the country.  Those standards are going to be reviewed.  I have indicated my preference for a standard that requires more refuge spaces.</p></speech>

Non-aligned Deputies do not get any guaranteed speaking rights at all in this Chamber.  As any speaking rights that we get are purely on the basis of a lottery, when we manage to get a lottery question or Topical Issue addressed to the Minister for Health, it would be very useful for that Minister to be in the Chamber to answer it.  In fairness, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, has his own portfolio and objectives and may not be able to answer all of the questions.  If we are going to have this idea of a Topical Issue where questions are asked of the Minister, it would be really useful if the Minister would show up and answer the questions.</p>  <p>  For years, the Government has spoken about getting patients out of hospitals and into primary care.  Pharmacies can play a significant role in the delivery of primary care.  It is very obvious that pharmacies are not being utilised to the full extent in what they can deliver to patients.  If we can get doctors' surgeries to take patients out of hospitals and pharmacies to take patients out of doctors' surgeries, it would make it far easier for the system to work.  The Irish Pharmacy Union, IPU, was given a commitment by the Minister for Health that he would enter into negotiations and that a new contract would be signed in 2020.  He also committed to unwinding the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, among pharmacists.  Pharmacy is the only sector in which FEMPI is not being unwound.  Every other sector is in the process of unwinding FEMPI.  Why is the pharmacy sector excluded?  In October this year, the IPU was told at a meeting with the Department that &euro;40 million to &euro;50 million of cuts would be expected from the sector.  No justification for that was given.</p>  <p>  Given that we are looking for the pharmacy sector to take a bigger role in the delivery of primary care, why are we going down a route of threatening &euro;40 million to &euro;50 million of cuts for the pharmacy sector?  If one contrasts the pharmacy sector with the dental sector, the dental profession was not told that cuts were expected from it.  The pharmacy sector is equivalent to the GP and dentistry sectors combined in numbers employed.  I recently heard that there may be some rowback with regard to these cuts and some preparation for negotiations and a contract.  Are these cuts completely off the table?  Is it the case that the Government will not proceed with the cuts in this sector?  Will the Minister of State guarantee that?  Has the Government taken a new position just because there is a general election in the offing and it realises that the Government will be gone before any contract or negotiations are complete at all?  The nature of the pharmacy sector has changed radically in recent years.  Pharmacies are doing more administration and dispensing than they did ten years ago but with less money.  Business costs, including rates, rents and insurance are radically increasing.  We heard from a Deputy earlier that insurance costs are affecting many different parts of society.  The Government's inaction in this regard also has contributed to it.</p>  <p>  The cost of full-time security is increasing for pharmacies around the country, especially in Dublin with the cocaine epidemic there.  There is demand-pull inflation because workers are dealing with higher rents and they are forced to look for higher wages to be able to cover those rents.  Pharmacists are anxious to engage with the Government to reduce wastage in drugs, especially with the new higher costs of drugs that are absorbing increasing amounts of the drugs debate in the State.  This can be done in negotiations too.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n for raising this important matter.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Health values the important role community pharmacists play in the health service in the delivery of holistic patient care.  The Minister is obliged, before the end of this year, to put in place a new framework to maintain a statutory basis for contractor fees as the existing regulations will be revoked from the end of this year, in accordance with the Public Service Pay and Pensions Act 2017.  Prior to the making of new regulations, the Minister for Health is required to consult the representative body for pharmacy contractors, the IPU.  To that end, engagement between the Minister, the Department of Health and the IPU has to date been consultative in nature.  Department officials wrote to the IPU on 10 October inviting it to discussions on the making of the new regulations.  Subsequently, meetings were held in the Department on 24 October and 7 November, following which a detailed submission was received from the IPU.  The consultation process has now concluded.</p>  <p>  The Minister, Deputy Harris, met the IPU on 5 December and indicated his intention to commence a substantial review of the pharmacy contract in 2020.  In this context, the Minister also communicated his intention to maintain the current fee structure from 1 January 2020.  The comprehensive review of the pharmacy contract in 2020 will address the role to be played by community pharmacy in the context of Sl&aacute;intecare.  It will consider all aspects of pharmacy service provision, including delivery of a multidisciplinary model of service delivery for patients, ensuring clarity of roles and achieving optimum value for money.  However, any publicly funded pharmacy service expansion should address unmet public healthcare needs, improve access to existing public health services or provide better value for money or patient outcomes.  Accordingly, any measures to be considered must be evidence based.</p></speech>

I asked specific questions and the Minister of State has a script which does not deal with any of the questions that I asked.  We are unfortunately talking at cross-purposes.  There is no commitment with regard to the threatened cuts of &euro;40 million or the unwinding of FEMPI.  The Government and HSE have pointed out many times that there needs to be investment in primary care to deliver lower costs.  Sl&aacute;intecare talks about 70% of healthcare being delivered in the local community without a need to go to an acute hospital.  The Government is only investing about 4.5% of its current health budget in primary care.  If the Government seeks to pivot the healthcare system away from overdependence on the acute system, would the Minister of State not agree with Aont&uacute; that at least 10% of the health budget should be invested in primary care and communities?</p> <p>GPs are in a great space to do that.  They should be at the heart of a responsive, proactive, cost-effective healthcare system and should be incentivised to offer a wider range of services, either in a direct fashion or as part of an integrated group practice.  In order to do that, we need pharmacists to take patients out of GP surgeries.  Pharmacists must be given a greater role in providing services in the healthcare system.  They can, for example, carry out blood pressure tests, blood readings and many other practical services for patients.  We are asking for a broad negotiation and a redesign of the pathways between doctors, pharmacists, and hospital services in primary healthcare.  We need to make sure FEMPI is unwound, that there are no threats of any cuts, and that further money is given to primary healthcare provision as a proportion of the total healthcare budget.</p></speech>

I reiterate the Minister for Health's appreciation of the contribution of community pharmacists in delivering care to patients and re-state his intention to commence contractual discussions early in the new year.  The issues the Deputy raised within the debate will be dealt with during that process.  However, the Minister is also very cognisant of the fact that the regulations made under the 2009 FEMPI Act expire at the end of 2019, and that a new set of fee regulations will be needed in order to maintain a statutory basis for pharmacy payments from 1 January 2020.  The issues the Deputy raised are very important.  He spoke of wastage, insurance, security, and primary care, on which I agree with him.  Those matters have to be - and are - a huge part of Sl&aacute;intecare, as is the redesign and reform of all services.  I will bring the Deputy's concerns back to the Minister.</p></speech>

I have been told that nobody from Indecon visited that track and that the survey was conducted by email.  That is getting off to a very bad start.  It is a typical Irish thing to try to fix something that is not broken.  Only two greyhound stadiums are making money at the moment.  The Youghal stadium is making &euro;4,500 to &euro;5,000 a night because it was the first to introduce the Sports Information Services, SIS, betting scheme, which it piloted for two years for free - <i>gratis</i>- for the Irish Greyhound Board, IGB.  Now there is talk of closing the stadium.  It is also home to the oldest track supporters club in the country, which was founded in the 1950s.  The closure of this track will be detrimental to the area and would be similar to the closure of Youghal Carpets when I was young.  I do not know whether the IGB or Indecon - although it said it is not liable - will make the decision, but I appeal to the Minister of State to please not close this track.</p></speech>

To be sharp with the Minister of State, last Friday was a black day for Irish sport.  One other sport made major headlines, while this report was released without much coverage.  In the last three or four days, it has gained momentum, particularly in east Cork, through breeders, supporters and tourism activists.  Earmarking this stadium for closure is a bad blow for east Cork and Youghal.  I do not think the Indecon report has done it any justice in its comments and recommendations.  The Youghal track has a good income, which is not all from spectators because many of them gain free entry during the summer.  It also has the great facility of SIS TV coverage with the bookmakers' association, which has gone from one night a week to two and generates automatic revenue of almost &euro;10,000 per week.  Taking the greyhound track out of Youghal is like a village losing its post office.</p></speech>

I welcome the report's recommendations regarding care home facilities for animals to be opened next year, a fostering programme for dogs and the introduction of a 100% traceability programme involving microchipping.  Animal welfare must be at the centre of this report.  Anyone who abuses a dog or any other animal is less than one.</p>  <p>  The closure of the Enniscorthy track comes as an economic blow to the town, which is only now getting back on its feet.  The track makes a significant contribution to rural employment and developing the town of Enniscorthy.  It is a profitable track, which makes it difficult to understand why it is being targeted by Bord na gCon.  It makes little or no sense for the region.  Between 30% and 70% of the dogs raced in Waterford are from Enniscorthy, so when those dogs leave Waterford, Waterford will come under pressure as well.  It is difficult to comprehend this decision when so many other tracks are making a loss.</p></speech>

I am aware that this past year has been a challenging one for the greyhound sector.  However, I believe that 2019 will be remembered as a key turning point.  The Greyhound Racing Act was signed by the President on 28 May 2019 and this legislation strengthens the legal basis for the industry, with a view to fortifying the integrity of the greyhound racing sector and improving provision for greyhound traceability.  The board of Bord na gCon remains committed to the protection of the integrity of the greyhound industry and to promoting the welfare of greyhounds.  With the new legislation, together with the maintenance of the horse and greyhound racing fund for Bord na gCon at &euro;16.8 million for 2020, the industry will have the tools to reform and to be strengthened.</p>  <p>  According to the 2017 Power report, the greyhound sector provides and supports considerable employment both directly and indirectly throughout the country.  It is estimated that in 2016, the industry supported 5,058 full-time and part-time jobs in the economy.  In addition, there are 7,313 active greyhound owners in Ireland.  The total number of people deriving economic benefit from the sector is estimated at 12,371.  The welfare of greyhounds is a cornerstone of the greyhound industry.  I am assured that Bord na gCon is striving to ensure the highest standards for the sport and its participants both on and away from the race course.</p>  <p>  I refer to the enactment of the Greyhound Racing Act 2019.  The greyhound industry has undergone a series of reforms in recent years, informed by several key reports into the sector which led to the enactment of new legislation this year.  The future of the industry is dependent on a strong governance platform and on the industry having the highest standards of integrity and welfare.  On this basis, I am confident that provisions in the new Act, which came into effect last May, will make a significant difference.  The Act reflects recommendations for legislative change made in the Indecon report, the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine's report on the greyhound industry and the Morris review of anti-doping and medication control.  This new legislation strengthens the legal basis for the industry, with a view to fortifying the integrity of the greyhound racing sector and improving provision for greyhound traceability.  It will also improve the governance of Bord na gCon, strengthen regulatory controls in the industry, modernise sanctions and improve integrity.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Indecon review of greyhound stadia, a fully independent, systematic review into the sustainability of individual stadia and the wider industry footprint forms a key element of Bord na gCon's current strategic plan 2018-2022.  Bord na gCon released an independent report undertaken by Indecon Economic Consultants on 6 December 2019, which reviewed the future needs of its 16 licensed stadia and made recommendations regarding the industry's footprint into the future.  The recommendations of the report, which have been accepted by the board of Bord na gCon, provide a road map to underpin a sustainable long-term future for the industry.  The brief for the study included the assessment of infrastructure and services available at all 16 licensed greyhound stadia in Ireland, an assessment of financial sustainability at each track, analysis of population catchments and motorway access, and detailed recommendations regarding each individual stadium.</p>  <p>  The report has recommended restructuring the footprint of the greyhound sector; ongoing cost efficiency measures; targeted investment in animal welfare, marketing and infrastructure; and the ceasing of funding for four stadia, namely, Enniscorthy, Lifford, Longford and Youghal.  These four tracks have a long and distinguished history and have been focal points for recreation and enterprise in their respective communities.  The impact of their closure will be acutely felt, and I am cognisant that people's livelihoods will be impacted.  The Indecon report highlighted several challenges facing the industry which are a threat to its long-term viability.  Bord na gCon has already taken steps to address these challenges.</p> <p>I will leave it at that and I can come back on a supplementary as my time is up.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, Youghal was only mentioned once in it.  It does not really deal with the detrimental effect of this.  There is a thriving industry in Youghal.  Again, I am asking why we are trying to fix something that is not broken.  It says that the recommendations of the report, which have been accepted by the board of Bord na gCon, provide a road map to underpin a sustainable long-term future for the industry.  If something is working, please do not try to fix it again.  If we lose that industry in Youghal, it will affect our tourism.  Many of the issues in this are slightly flawed because they are all about population, numbers and people coming in.  In 2018, 1,016 races were held at 101 meetings.  On top of that, the two months they do every year - July and August - that are free are not even in the report.  This is a thriving business.  I again appeal to whoever is dealing with this not to close this track because it will have a massive knock-on effect on local industry such as restaurants and hotels and the transport system.  The caravan park behind it is jammed for the two months.  It is probably the only outdoor sport that brings everybody in, including children.</p></speech>

I wholeheartedly supported it but I did not know I was signing the death warrant for Youghal or the likes of Enniscorthy.  I ask the Minister of State to take on board our concerns.  I know submissions can be taken up to 10 January but I ask him to take on board the concerns that have been raised.  As indicated by my colleague, Youghal is a tourist town.  We may as well use the facility during the vacation period in summer, particularly when the weather can sometimes be inclement.  Youghal greyhound track has seen an increase in the number of race nights because of the SIS supports.  There was recent adverse publicity regarding greyhound racing and the greyhound industry.  We need to give things time to level out so that they improve again.  We saw a massive response in Curraheen Park when a meeting was held to generate sponsorship for the Irish Laurels.  The response was tremendous.  Youghal plays a large role in local communities and fund raising up as far as my own backyard regarding St. Catherine's GAA Club in Conna.  There are tremendous race nights and fundraisers in Youghal greyhound track.  I ask the Minister of State to take on board submissions that come forward because it is a big issue of concern.</p></speech>

It is a profitable track.  Many of the other tracks that are to be left open are losing money hand over fist so the fact that Enniscorthy is one of the tracks to be closed makes no sense.  I call on the Minister of State and Bord na gCon to meet with the track operators, an independent track in Enniscorthy, to review this decision.  I hope this track will not close.  If it is to close, we should remember that when a factory in any town closes, the Government springs into action with a support plan for that town.  I ask that a similar support plan be put in place for Enniscorthy, Youghal and any other town that will lose a track because those towns depend on those tracks for their economic well-being.  I also hope that the welfare plan in the Indecon report is not only implemented but that there is proper oversight to ensure it is implemented and these animals are properly cared for.  What we saw on "Prime Time Investigates" was disgraceful and I hope we never see the likes of that again.</p></speech>

I met some members of the Oireachtas Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport in Youghal and could see their progressive thinking.  Regarding the Indecon report on the footprint and structure, pillar three of the strategic plan was to carry out an independent review so I had nothing to do with it.  Bord na gCon had nothing to do with it other than with regard to the terms of reference.  I urge people, including the tracks themselves, to make robust submissions before 10 January.  When the Indecon report on the future of the greyhound sector, which involved among other things the closure of the Harold's Cross track, appeared, I as Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine asked Bord na gCon to appear before the committee to explain the rationale behind what it was doing.  Not everybody agreed.  Doing this again would probably be a worthwhile exercise.  I will admit to being somewhat surprised that these two tracks were chosen, not because I have visited them but because I am aware they are both profitable.</p></speech>

Regarding the closure of the greyhound track in Youghal, I think Youghal is being sacrificed on the altar of expediency.  It is a profit centre that is washing its face.  The terms of reference set out with regard to the Indecon report seem to have worked unfairly against centres like Youghal.  There will be a good fight by the people of Youghal regarding the proposal to close this track.</p>  <p>  I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the lack of school places in east Cork.  The Minister for Education and Skills will be aware of the proposal regarding Carrigtwohill community college.  The people of Carrigtwohill are now being told that it could be 2023 by the time the school opens there and that a process is being gone through with Cork County Council.  We have had some engagement with the education and training board.  As late as last Friday, we were told that a certain number of places for the Carrigtwohill area for the 2020 intake up to 2023 will be provided.  Notwithstanding that, I wish to put to the Minister the fact that we are receiving many emails and phone calls from parents who find themselves falling foul of the enrolment policy as instigated by the community college in Carrigtwohill through no fault of their own.  They are bereft at the fact that notwithstanding the proposal to put in place new classes for September 2020, there is no guarantee that a certain number of those parents will have places for their sons and daughters for September 2020 and onwards.  It applies not only in Carrigtwohill but in Midleton.</p>  <p>  I know the Minister is a person of deep empathy who would be very mindful and conscious of the needs of families and will appreciate that at this juncture, there is no guarantee of places for those students in Carrigtwohill, which causes a massive amount of stress for those families.  I wish to bear witness for those families because they are being told that by dint of the enrolment policy, particularly where there are two siblings, one girl and one boy, if the girl has received a place in another all-girl school, the boy who may wish to enrol in Carrigtwohill community college is not guaranteed a place.  This is a function of the enrolment policy.  I have been told by the education and training board that this position is entirely legal.  I understand that to a certain extent but in an era where equality matters, it must be the case that the Government does everything it can to ensure that families are not divided in towns like Carrigtwohill by dint of an enrolment policy where there is no guarantee of a place notwithstanding the efforts of the education and training board to provide extra classrooms and the fact that the education and training board is engaging with the Department of Education and Skills as of 18 November regarding future provision of places.  We must still ensure that no young student is without a school place so I ask the Minister to do his level best on this.</p></speech>

This is a matter that the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, has raised with me on a number of occasions.  It is an issue that Deputy Sherlock and his colleague from east Cork, Deputy O'Keeffe, continue to keep on the radar.  I realise and understand the importance of this issue.</p>  <p>  Major new residential developments in a school planning area have the potential to alter demand in that area.  In that regard, as part of the demographic exercises, my Department engages with each of the local authorities to obtain the up-to-date information on significant new residential development in each area.  This is necessary to ensure that schools infrastructure planning is keeping pace with demographic changes.  For school planning purposes, Carrigtwohill is located in the Midleton-Carrigtwohill school planning area.  Where demographic data indicates that additional provision is needed, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, the delivery of such additional provision can be provided through utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools, extending the capacity of a school or schools, or the provision of a new school or schools.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in April 2018 the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years, 2019 to 2022, including three new primary schools and one new post-primary school in County Cork.  While the announcement did not include a new school for the Midleton-Carrigtwohill school planning area, or the wider east Cork area, the requirement for new schools is kept under ongoing review and, in particular, has regard for the increased roll-out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040.</p>  <p>  The following new schools were established in recent years to serve the Midleton-Carrigtwohill school planning area.  Carrigtwohill community college, a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school was established in temporary accommodation in 2016.  Scoil Chl&iacute;odhna community national school, a new 16-classroom primary school, was established in temporary accommodation in 2015.  A campus development in Carrigtwohill, when complete, will accommodate three new schools: Carrigtwohill community college, with 1,000 pupils plus a three-classroom special education needs base; Scoil Chl&iacute;odhna, with 24 classrooms plus a three-classroom special education needs base; and Scoil Mhuire primary school, with 24 classrooms plus a three-classroom special education needs base with a total population of approximately 2,200 pupils.  The site is over 10 ha in size which includes a road network.  This will be the single biggest and most expensive schools campus ever built by the Department.</p>  <p>  The building project for the Carrigtwohill campus is being delivered under the Department's design and build programme.  This delivery programme uses a professional external project management team to progress the project through the stages of architectural planning, tendering and construction.</p>  <p>  Carrigtwohill community college is currently in interim accommodation and a planning application for the permanent accommodation campus was lodged in May 2019.  A request for further information was received in August 2019.  The Department's project management team is actively working on this request for further information.  It is expected that a response to the local authority's request for further information will be submitted shortly.</p>  <p>  In February 2019, the school was approved for rental of additional temporary accommodation of a 1 x 100 sq. m science lab and three mainstream classrooms to cater for additional enrolments.  All of that accommodation has now been installed.</p>  <p>  Planning has also been secured for an additional two classrooms to facilitate enrolments for the 2020-21 academic year and these will be installed during the summer holiday in 2020.</p>  <p>  Representatives of Cork Education and Training Board, ETB, which is patron of Carrigtwohill community school, recently met with officials from my Department regarding the provision of further additional accommodation.  The ETB and the Department will continue to engage regarding the provision of this further accommodation.  I understand that officials of Cork ETB met with parents on 21 November 2019 to update them on the accommodation position for the school and I understand that a further meeting is due to take place in  December 2019.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the facts about the additional two classrooms and ongoing engagement between his officials and the ETB that the Minister has laid before the House, there remains the problem that, even when that capacity is achieved, there will still be unmet demand from parents and students in the east Cork area.</p>  <p>  It should be taken into account that 2020 is the timeline for the delivery of the school campus.  I should respectfully correct the Minister and say that this has been on the agenda since 2012.  Even when that temporary infrastructure is built and the demand for places is met through the new campus, parents will still not know where their children will be going to school and that might be the case into May of next year.  We cannot countenance a situation where we have uncertainty that is causing major stress and strain for parents.  Parents would be reassured if that could be looked at.  There is no guarantee from the ETB that demand can be met at present.  That is what the ETB is telling us.</p></speech>

Frustration builds if proper information is not given and communication channels are not kept open.  That is why it is so important that Cork ETB and the officials in Tullamore continue to liaise with one another and continue to ensure that relevant information and updates are put out there.  I am confident that is already happening.</p>  <p>  I am also confident that this major project is being treated with seriousness.  There are some important areas to address and examinations that need to be done before moving onto the next stages, including the procurement of additional topographical surveys and further liaison with Cork County Council to firm up the extent of revisions to the public road areas once the topographical surveys are complete.  These surveys have been commissioned and were due to take place on 29 November.  Project managers have liaised with the electrical department of Cork County Council and also continue to liaise with Cork Count Council on flood alleviation works.  It is a big project.</p>  <p>  The Deputy expressed concerns about September 2020.  If there is outstanding demand for school places in September 2020, we have vigilant officials who will deal with that.  They will stay in touch with the different people and bodies, including principals or, in this case, the ETB.  It is really important that we continue that conversation.</p>  <p>  We are now in December 2019 so we have time to deal with the outstanding issues and I assure the Deputy that we will continue to be vigilant in that regard.</p></speech>

On the issue raised by Deputy Sherlock, Deputies from all across the country, including myself, are raising the issue of the lack of places at second level, week in and week out, in this Chamber.  The Minister needs to take that matter very seriously.  Deputies, including myself, have raised such concerns and it is a worrying situation in all parts of the country.  That is a considerable challenge for the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  As the Minister is aware, there is currently a campaign under way calling on him to reduce class sizes for delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, band 1 schools.  The campaigners argue that it is unfair and that the smaller class sizes achieved under the confidence and supply agreement in recent budgets have not seen corresponding reductions in class sizes for DEIS band 1 schools and this needs to be rectified.  I agree with those campaigners.  When the pupil-teacher ratio reduction was negotiated, it was assumed that it would be passed on correspondingly to DEIS band 1 schools but it was not and we have not seen those reductions.</p>  <p>  I am proud that the DEIS scheme was established by Fianna F&aacute;il to provide the supports needed to ensure that every child can reach his or her potential.  The DEIS scheme works and it should be protected and enhanced so that children from disadvantaged backgrounds can have a greater opportunity to reach their full potential.  The DEIS scheme appears to be working.</p>  <p>  The Minister will know that the evaluation of DEIS schools at the post-primary level shows that the achievement and attainment gaps between DEIS and non-DEIS post-primary schools continue to narrow in the performance of students in the junior certificate and in retention rates.  There has been a rise in the percentage of students in DEIS schools taking English and mathematics at higher level.  The evidence is that the scheme is working and results and school completion rates are going up in key areas.  The issue is the rate at which it is improving.  It is not improving at a rate that would allow pupils to compete at the same level in the very near future.  While I accept that the additional supports that have been provided will take time to appear in data, there is a need to continue increasing support to speed up this process.</p>  <p>  There is already a recognition in DEIS band 1 schools that a reduced class size is of significant value and smaller class sizes are already included in the original specification.  However, the pace at which progress is taking place needs to be accelerated.</p> <p>As the pupil-teacher ratio has been lowered considerably in the general national school system, the competitive boost given to DEIS band 1 schools is being eroded.  This could result in the comparative progress which has been made in this area also eroding.  Is the Minister considering the proposals raised previously in this House and that are currently being raised by the INTO in particular?  I thank the INTO and all the teachers involved in the INTO campaign.  It is refreshing that, as they have always done, teachers took time out of their own day to try to advocate for their students.  I look forward to hearing the response from the Minister.</p></speech>

It is the main policy initiative of the Department of Education and Skills to address educational disadvantage at school level.</p><p>The DEIS plan is based on the findings of an extensive review of the DEIS programme, which involved consultations with all relevant stakeholders.  It sets out the vision for future interventions in the critical area of educational disadvantage policy and builds on what has already been achieved by schools that have benefited from the additional supports available under the initial DEIS programme introduced in 2005.</p><p>This year, my Department will spend in the region of &euro;125 million on the DEIS programme providing for smaller class sizes in urban band 1 schools as well as other supports, including DEIS grants, enhanced book grants, home school community liaison co-ordinators, curriculum supports, priority access to continuing professional development and the school excellence fund for DEIS.  Evidence from the various evaluations of the DEIS programme demonstrates that it is having a positive effect on tackling educational disadvantage and is succeeding in improving educational outcomes.</p><p>Within the DEIS programme itself, in the 2019-2020 school year there are 891 schools serving in excess of 185,000 pupils.  This represents approximately 20% of the overall school population, with 231 of the total number of schools being DEIS band 1 schools and availing of smaller class size.</p><p>The DEIS programme allows for a reduced class size in urban band 1 primary schools, with the application of a preferential staffing schedule to these schools of 20:1 at junior classes and 24:1 at senior classes to support those students at the highest risk of educational disadvantage.</p><p>The DEIS plan acknowledges that the allocation of teaching resources to DEIS primary schools with the highest concentrations of children at risk of educational disadvantage has served to improve learning outcomes and commits to the evaluation of the level of teaching resources for schools participating in DEIS to be undertaken to inform future policy in this area, and work has been undertaken in this regard.</p><p>To progress this, a class size working group was established comprising representatives from the education partners, the Educational Research Centre and the relevant units within my Department.  A report on the work of this group is currently being finalised and will take into consideration the feedback and observations of the working group members.  It is my intention that this will inform future policy in this area.</p></speech>

The changes required are comparatively small compared to the changes that would be required across the entire education system.  Fianna F&aacute;il wants to see lower class sizes.  That has been our stated objective for a number of years and we succeeded partially with the lowest class sizes on record as part of the confidence and supply agreement.  That work has to continue in the general national school system but it also must be extended to DEIS.  We will be strongly advocating that that would happen and that the Minister would make arrangements for it to happen.</p>  <p>  The INTO has reported that many DEIS schools are facing growing mental health and literacy challenges.  There is also the challenge in some parts of the country of organised crime affecting children in schools, sometimes in DEIS schools but at other times, as the Minister is aware, in non-DEIS schools also where criminal activity is influencing the way children behave and how they develop later in life.  The extra supports DEIS band 1 offers are one way of helping to tackle criminality spreading to very young groups.  People may say that is an exaggeration but I am speaking from the experience of teachers in junior primary schools.  What is going on is frightening.  The Minister's officials graciously met a delegation from a particular school affected by this which is looking to get DEIS band 1 status.  It sees the lower pupil-teacher ratio in DEIS band 1 as potentially being of significant help in dealing with challenges it faces due to criminality in its area.  That pupil-teacher ratio must be reduced further.</p>  <p>  I accept that consideration is taking place in the context of the broader DEIS review.  The review has been ongoing since last year and will provide important details on progress.  It is my understanding that all schools are considered in the context of the review of DEIS.  Can the Minister confirm that the pupil-teacher ratio for DEIS band 1 is being considered and that a reduction in that is being considered by the group?  If not, will the Minister commit to a short review to be published at the same time or soon after the DEIS review and the working group review also?</p></speech>

That is the reason the working group was set up.  It includes representatives from the social inclusion unit, the special education unit, the teacher allocation unit, the statistics unit, education stakeholders such as the INTO, the Irish Primary Principals' Network and the Catholic Primary School Management Association.  Education and Training Boards Ireland and An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta were also represented on the working group, as was the Education Research Group, so it is a fairly extensive group.  It has done a lot of work.  That work is almost complete.  We will be producing that report in a few weeks' time.  All aspects of class size will be examined.</p>  <p>  There is a twin-track approach.  While that is going on we are reviewing the DEIS scheme.  We are at a significant stage now in respect of that.  I am aware it is an area of interest to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in terms of the value of DEIS, its impact and the history of DEIS.  It was introduced in 2005, very much on a geographical basis due to the socioeconomic indicators, but life has got much more complex.  The Deputy raised issues to do with crime and other pressures on the system.  We have to be very targeted in respect of the support.</p>  <p>  Regarding the working group, that work is almost complete.  We will be following through on that in a few weeks' time.  Significant progress has been made in respect of the review of DEIS as a collective.  It is more nuanced and complex but we have to ensure that it is targeted.  There is a massive amount of work involved in that.  That is not to take from anything we have already but to build upon the momentum because there has been massive gains in respect of tackling educational disadvantage through DEIS supports.</p></speech>

The Credit Union Restructuring Board, ReBo, played an important role in the restructuring of the credit union movement.  It is fair to say that only a fraction of the overall fund that was put in place has had to be used.  Are all the arrangements now in place to give effect to the measures in this Bill?  I assume that ReBo is essentially stood down at this stage.  I presume the transfer of the remaining fund into the central fund provided for in the Bill will now happen immediately.</p></speech>

Sinn F&eacute;in will support this legislation.  The Bill will wind down the Credit Union Restructuring Board, also known as ReBo.  When the board was established many feared that the credit unions would be the next to collapse on foot of the banking crisis.  While many difficult years followed for the credit union movement, credit unions got through that difficult period less damaged than many people expected at the time.  By utilising their own resources and harnessing the voluntary commitment and social ethos of their members, they came out the other end.</p>  <p>  I am proud to be a member of a credit union since I was a child.  The first voluntary work I did was in the credit union movement.  It is a fantastic organisation across the State.  As Members are well aware, it allowed ordinary people to access funding to pay for Holy Communions, holidays, school books and so on.</p>  <p>  While at the time the Government put the banks first, the credit union movement had to rely on its own members.  Credit unions showed their resilience with only &euro;20 million of the ReBo fund being utilised.</p> <p>The restructuring board enabled nearly 100 restructuring projects in more than 150 credit unions, all on a voluntary basis.  This is testament to the efforts of the credit union movement, which has secured its sustainability into the future.  This is only a good thing for the many communities who rely and can depend on their credit unions.</p> <p> While ReBo is no longer required and has been dissolved it is essential that the future sustainability of the credit union movement is supported by the Central Bank.  Sinn F&eacute;in has for a long time called for reform of the lending limit rules that are applied to credit unions.  Therefore, recent changes made by the Central Bank are welcome.  We encourage further changes to allow credit unions to become bigger players in many sectors, including the housing market.  Given the current housing crisis and difficulties of so many mortgage holders with the banks, the credit union movement is in a unique place to offer sustainable solutions for mortgage holders and those looking for a home.  Sinn F&eacute;in also understands the challenges the credit union movement will face in competing with retail banks as they seek to attract younger members.  It is crucial that credit unions are supported as the financial landscape continues to change.  As I said earlier, credit unions have served communities well for decades.  They are not like other financial institutions.  Their social ethos and voluntary ethic provide services to communities and families that can be trusted.  As the Bill winds down the restructuring board, I commend the credit union movement on its perseverance.</p></speech>

I wish to reinforce some of the comments made by Deputies.</p>  <p>  The Credit Union Restructuring Board, ReBo, which was established under Part 3 of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012, has completed the performance of its functions and has been operationally wound down since 31 July 2017.  I trust that answers Deputy McGrath's comment.  The contracts of all ReBo employees expired on or before 31 July 2017 and board members have also resigned from that date.  I wish to put on record that my brother served as a member of the board.  Legislation is required to dissolve the legal entity and to effect the transfer of all assets and liabilities of ReBo to the Minister for Finance.  A caretaker board consisting of two Department officials and the Central Bank nominee will remain in place until dissolution is effected.</p>  <p>  In its short lifetime, ReBo has facilitated 82 restructuring projects involving 156 credit unions with assets totalling approximately &euro;6 billion across 24 counties.  The Government provided &euro;250 million in the credit union fund specifically for credit union restructuring, with only approximately &euro;11.6 million of this fund used.  The lower than anticipated spend on restructuring is essentially due to the fact that the majority of credit unions participating in restructuring financed the projects from within their own resources.  Moreover, in certain cases where there was a shortfall financial assistance was provided by the Irish League of Credit Unions using its savings protection scheme.</p>  <p>  The Act provides that when the Minister for Finance is satisfied that ReBo has completed the performance of its functions under Part 3, he may by order dissolve ReBo.  Prior to dissolving ReBo, section 43(2) requires that the Minister conduct a review of the operation of Part 3 to determine whether ReBo has, in the Minister's opinion, completed the performance of its functions.  In accordance with section 43(2), a final review of the operation of Part 3 was carried out in June 2017.  Following an in-depth examination by Department officials the review concluded that ReBo had completed the performance of its functions with positive results.  On foot of this review, the Minister for Finance decided to proceed with the orderly wind-down of ReBo.  Advice from the Office of the Attorney General stated that while the Act provides for the dissolution of ReBo by ministerial order, it does not provide for specified sections of Part 3 to remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the dissolution of ReBo.  As a result, for the relevant provisions to continue in full force and effect post-dissolution, the Office of the Attorney General has advised that the safest approach to adopt is to proceed by way of amendment to the Act.  Therefore, it was required to bring this Bill forward to formally dissolve ReBo.  I thank the Deputies for their co-operation and the co-operation of all parties in the House.</p></speech>

I appreciate the opportunity.  I welcome that the Bill is passing Final Stage.  It was a significant tranche of work, as has been mentioned by Deputies who have spoken.</p>  <p>  I saw this up close in my constituency of Kildare North, where we had significant restructuring.  What was Naas Credit Union expanded into Maynooth at the time of the trouble with Newbridge Credit Union.  Then the Cro&iacute; Laighean Credit Union incorporated much of north-west Kildare.  There was fear, uncertainty and doubt among the members of those credit unions and the general public at the time.  I imagine that was mirrored in many other parts of the country.  However, there is a happy ending.  It has got to a stage where those credit unions are stronger, better resourced, better funded and on a stronger footing with the fitness and probity and compliance regulations now in place.  The board members were typically people of good character and ethos and the work was voluntary in nature.  The extra scrutiny and vigilance now in force benefits everyone.  It is a credit to the boards and to people like William O'Donovan and Peter Fullam in Naas Credit Union as the credit union expansion across the county was met with some trepidation.  However, it was the right thing to do.  I credit the board and all involved.  The fact that it is now at the stage where its work is done and it can be stood down is a success in itself.</p></speech>

This is an issue regarding model 2 hospitals, including those in Roscommon, Nenagh, Ennis and Bantry.  Following the reconfiguration of acute services in the country, these hospitals are supposed to be the workhorse of the health system.  They are supposed to deal with routine surgeries, day surgeries, day cases and inpatients that had traditionally gone to model 3 and model 4 hospitals.  They do not deal with urgent or emergency cases but the conditions treated can become chronic conditions if left over time.  The work includes colonoscopy and urology appointments, computed tomography scans, X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging scans and so forth.</p><p>All these hospitals have urgent care centres and patients stay over in hospital as a result.  These patients do not end up in our accident and emergency departments, many of which, sadly, are chaotic at the moment.  Two hospitals in particular hit the headlines on a regular basis, namely, University Hospital Galway and University Hospital Limerick.  Funnily enough, those two hospitals are serviced by the hospitals in Roscommon, Nenagh and Ennis.</p><p>The difficulty arises because we have one cowboy insurer in the country.  It has decided under one of its policies that it will not cover patients with health insurance who are going into model 2 hospitals.  This issue needs to be nipped in the bud now.</p><p>We took decisions in the House to ensure everyone has equality of treatment in terms of access to health insurance.  I was one of the Members who brought through the legislation at the time.  The intention was to provide everyone with equal access to private health insurance if they could afford to pay for it.Whether a policyholder was 18 or 80 years of age, he or she would pay the same as others for the same policy.  Now, we have one insurer which has decided to undermine the health structure in this country, even though the health structure is about encouraging as much work as possible in the local hospitals.</p><p>I see the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, in the House.  The hospital in Monaghan is another one affected.  This insurer has decided that people cannot go to the hospitals in Monaghan, Roscommon, Ennis, Nenagh or Bantry.  Yet in these hospitals, patients do not have to wait for months to get a colonoscopy or access to X-rays or CAT scans; they can have the service within a few hours.  If this particular organisation gets away with this, I have no doubt others will follow.</p> <p>I want the Minister to amend the minimum benefit regulations here and ensure that all the insurance companies provide cover in every one of the model 2 hospitals in this country.  That is in the interests of putting work through those smaller hospitals.  It is in the interests of taking pressure off the waiting lists in the larger model 3 hospitals, such as Portiuncula, Sligo and Castlebar, and the model 4 hospitals, such as Galway University Hospital, where people have been waiting for years to get access to care.</p> <p> Thankfully, smaller hospitals, such as Roscommon, are dealing with the backlog of waiting lists.  We are trying to move more work from the bigger hospitals to the smaller hospitals.  This is an issue I raised with the Minister recently regarding the charges for accessing the urgent care centres, which I firmly believe should be less than for people attending an accident and emergency department.  If our policy is to encourage people to attend the smaller hospitals with less complex needs, then we should clearly define that in both the policy and the charges, and similarly in respect of health insurance.  We are saying that we will encourage people to go into Galway University Hospital, Portiuncula Hospital and Castlebar and Sligo hospitals, where patients are lying on trolleys at present.  While we are saying that we will incentivise those hospitals to take a private patient instead of taking someone off a trolley, yet we are not prepared to ensure that such private patients can access what probably would be better care in the model 2 hospitals, such as Roscommon and Nenagh, where there is less pressure in emergency departments and admissions.  We are saying "No" and that this insurer can have a blank cheque in this regard.  This cannot be allowed to happen.</p> <p> I came across a constituent who, unfortunately, had a policy with this company.  The constituent went for an inpatient procedure in the local hospital, Roscommon hospital, only to find out that the insurer will not cover that person.  I found out that my own policy was the same and that I was not covered.  Unfortunately, I was with the same insurer, as are many other people, because it has a strong standing in other areas in Ireland and has now got involved in the health insurance area.  It should not be allowed.</p> <p> I ask the Minister to give me a commitment today that an amendment will be brought forward to the minimum benefit regulations, rather than dividing the House on this particular issue.</p></speech>

The elective procedures of the type Deputy Naughten mentioned and the prolificacy of urgent care centres for such admissions, which are springing up nationwide, is an important part of the health service.</p>  <p>  The point on model 2 hospitals is well made, particularly in regard to the minimum benefit regulations.  The Deputy has talked about community rating, which is the pillar underpinning the health insurance system we have had for decades.  It is important that it is protected.  The point has been made that whether one is eight or 88, one pays a common price regardless of health status, age or other factors that may be priced into a risk market where that would be brought to bear in a competitive pricing model.  We do not have a competitive pricing model for reasons of public policy.  For that reason, we cannot discriminate against those insurers that apply the principle properly, equally and fairly across the country and across all benefits.</p>  <p>  The minimum benefit regulations were introduced at a time of the minimum benefits legislation.  Health insurance policies initially were extremely comprehensive and covered almost every ailment under the sun.  With the advent of competition in part and of risk pricing and of the greater risk profile, it was becoming far more expensive and health insurers were put to the pin of their collars to fund those.  Even with community rating, they could not afford to keep paying for all benefits all the time and they began to scale back the plans.  It was in response to that scale-back, in which benefits such as outpatient cover were removed from health insurance plans, that the minimum benefit regulations were introduced to provide that there is a certain bar below which an insurer cannot drop in terms of provision of cover.  If one is an insurer providing a health insurance plan, one must have a certain minimum level of cover.  There are certain anomalies in that cover but at the same time, the principle is good.  The principle of community rating is good.  Deputy Naughten's point is well made.  That applies to the universality of cover geographically as much as it applies to the benefits themselves and to the procedures covered.</p></speech>

I will not be able to support it at this Stage but I will explain what action I intend to take following on from his request.</p>  <p>  First, it is Government policy and the policy of the Oireachtas to drive more patient traffic through the smaller hospitals.  It makes sense to fully utilise our hospitals.  I visited Roscommon hospital with Deputy Naughten, where we worked together to make that hospital busier in recent years and that is and must be the direction of travel.</p>  <p>  While it is fair to say that there are significant capacity pressures in the Irish public health service, it is not entirely fair when others suggest that there is no capacity because there is underutilised capacity in some of our smaller hospitals.  My colleague and friend, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, brought me to Monaghan Hospital, where there is a capacity to do more.  We are using the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, as a vehicle to drive more procedures through the smaller hospitals, such as, for example, the cataract theatre in Nenagh.  The NTPF should no longer be merely a vehicle for outsourcing to private hospitals but we should be using it as an access tool to make our smaller hospitals busier.  That is Government policy.</p>  <p>  Second, Deputy Naughten made a fair and timely point on urgent care centres and minor injury clinics.  The Deputy suggests the fee for them should be lower than the fee for attending an emergency department.  I agree with the Deputy.  I was intending to make this announcement tomorrow but I will make it this evening.  I will be signing a statutory instrument within the next week to reduce the fee to attend a minor injuries unit from &euro;100 to &euro;75, making it a little more costly than going to the GP if one does not have a medical card but lower than going to the emergency department, ED.  I hope that will particularly help during the winter pressure period.  I very much accept the Deputy's counsel in that regard.  That is probably the quickest resolution the Deputy has ever got to an issue.</p></speech>

My officials were in a degree of provisional contact with Deputy Naughten in this regard.  My officials have also consulted with colleagues in the Health Insurance Authority and with the Department's internal legal advisers.</p><p>I very much understand and accept the Deputy's motivation.  It does not seem to make sense to the Deputy, to me or to this House that where the fee for providing the procedure would be the same in one hospital versus another, why a specific public hospital would be excluded, particularly a level 2 hospital.  Indeed, on Committee Stage Deputy Naughten stated:</p> <blockquote> 	insurance companies should not refuse cover in small hospitals such as those in Ennis, Roscommon, Mallow or Bantry.  People should automatically get cover in these hospitals. </blockquote>  <p>For the record of the House, I need to clarify today that many insurance companies provide cover in these type of hospitals.  The Deputy acknowledged that as well.  Insurers operating in the Irish market are required to provide services according to the Health Insurance Act 1994 (Minimum Benefit) Regulations 1996.  All of the plans available on the Irish market have been approved by the Health Insurance Authority, which is, as the House will be aware, the statutory regulator of the private health insurance market.</p><p>Pursuant to Article 9 in Part VI of the 1996 regulations, insurers may exclude specified services and specified providers in their policy.  Therefore, it is the law of the land, through those regulations, that an insurance company can exclude a certain service or a certain provider.  The Deputy is asking me tonight if I would review those regulations in respect of the specified provider and should that be looked at in the context of level 2 hospitals.</p><p>The information relating to the services covered by any policy is contained in the policy document provided to the consumer when purchasing such a policy.  Insurers can, of course, have many reasons that they do not cover certain services or providers.  One of them can be that not all hospitals can or should provide the full range of health services available in the State.  I take it that is not the point Deputy Naughten is making.</p><p>Notwithstanding the exclusion clause allowed under the minimum benefit regulations, there are policies available on the market that explicitly provide coverage in many model 2 hospitals across the country.  To be clear, it is the view of my Department and me that there is no need to legislate for insurers to cover model 2 hospitals because some insurers already provide this coverage.  Consumers obviously have a choice when they go to purchase an insurance policy to purchase one that meets their healthcare needs.  The current insurance regime allows insurers to provide policies at a range of prices and different rates as well.</p><p>However, in response to Deputy Naughten's request, I will ask my Department, in working with the Health Insurance Authority, to review those regulations, specifically, the exclusion clause relating to service providers, and I will report back to this House on that matter.</p><p>I appreciate the fact that Deputy Naughten stated that he did not wish to divide the House on this.</p> <p>Were I to accept this amendment, my fear, based on legal advice, is that we could accidentally and entirely unintentionally interfere with the risk equalisation scheme.  I acknowledge that is not Deputy Naughten's intention.  The amendment would interfere with the scheme and policies that do not include this type of cover as envisaged by the amendment would have to be excluded from calculations and projections that the Health Insurance Authority, HIA, carries out, therefore invalidating the other recommendations the Bill makes.  I ask the Deputy to consider not pressing his amendment on Report Stage.  I will work with my Department and the Health Insurance Authority to undertake that review of the regulations, specifically insofar as it pertains to the idea of excluding specific public service providers and I will report back to the House.</p></speech>

I welcome that most positive development, which shows the direction we should be taking in terms of accessing healthcare.  I was in this House when the whole issue of community rating was crumbling around us and we were obliged to bring forward legislation to protect that principle.  I never thought we would be in a situation where community rating would not apply to people from Roscommon, Tipperary, west Cork, Monaghan or Clare because one insurer, Irish Life, has decided it does not want to cover the level 2 hospitals.  It is wrong that this is allowed.  There is absolutely no justification for it.  Now that the Minister has made the decision on the injury units, which I welcome, we are saying that public policy is to encourage people to attend the injury units.  However, we also are telling those who have private health insurance with this insurer that we do not want them to go to the urgent care centre.  If they go to such centres and the doctors wants to keep them overnight, their policy will not cover that.  It is wrong.  It is bizarre that an insurer like Irish Life would sell policies to people living in County Roscommon while not covering their own local hospital.  I was caught the same as everyone else.  A stop needs to be put to this and it must be nipped in the bud straight away.  The regulations need to be changed.</p></speech>

I also am concerned that a particular insurance company would sell these policies.  People are presenting at a hospital and they are not being covered.  We have the same situation in South Tipperary General Hospital as that in Roscommon.  It may be unintended but there are all kinds of issues around insurance.  Surveys have shown that only 22% of people ever change their insurance provider and only 20% of people with health insurance said that they regularly shop around.  There is a lucrative market out there.  It should be a case of buyer beware but they are not getting fair play and they are not getting proper upfront information.  It is a worse situation when they are on a policy, end up in hospital and find they have no cover.  Something needs to be done to change that because it is not fair on people.  They are unsuspecting.  They think they have a policy and they trust the insurer but they cannot trust them.</p></speech>

We do listen in this House when good suggestions come forward such as that on the minor injury units.  We will have that statutory instrument formalised in the coming days.  It is currently with the drafters.  I hope to be in a position to sign it by next week.  On the reviewing of the regulations, I have already made my position clear.

While things in this House change and Ministers and Deputies change, if I am lucky enough to be here this time next year, I will be putting this forward unless the change is brought about.  It is wrong and unfair.  It is undermining the principle of community rating and stated health policy, which is about bringing more work into the local hospitals and ensuring that as many patients as possible use those injury units, rather than ending up in accident and emergency departments for hours and hours.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-10a.604" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="19:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121000039#MM01100"><p>Before I start, it would be useful to set the scene by explaining the rationale behind the OECD review and the Government's focus on improving SME productivity in our whole-of-government plan, Future Jobs Ireland.  As we know, the financial crisis tested our people and businesses, sometimes to the limit of their endurance.  However, our country has made great strides since the dark days of the recession.  Through resilience, talent and determination, we overcame enormous challenges.  Unemployment has fallen from 16% to 4.8% and there are more people working in Ireland today than ever before.  Exports by Enterprise Ireland companies increased by 6% last year to &euro;23.8 billion.  According to the IMD business school, we are the seventh most competitive economy in the world and the second most competitive in the euro area.  Today, the UN has ranked us the third best country in the world for quality of life.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, with global challenges facing us, there is no room for complacency.  Every generation needs to shake up its enterprise and jobs model, otherwise it falls backwards.  Through Future Jobs Ireland, the Government wants to nurture entrepreneurship and support our businesses and workers to prepare now for tomorrow's world.  Some 70% of our workers are employed by an SME, which highlights the crucial importance of Ireland's indigenous businesses to stability and growth in every region.  That is why I commissioned the OECD to undertake a detailed review into Ireland's SME and entrepreneurship policies in March 2018.  That review, which I published on 31 October last, is about looking to the future from a position of strength and deciding what we can do better.  The OECD review has provided a very useful contribution to the policy direction of my Department in the vital areas of SMEs and entrepreneurship.  We have always supported Irish businesses and we have excellent agencies like Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices, which work hand in glove with thousands of indigenous small firms to help them scale and grow. </p>  <p>Our strengths include the whole-of-government approach we take to SME policy and how actively we involve stakeholders in decision-making.  We now need to bring all of those supports, policies and programmes together and drive forward one comprehensive unified framework for Irish businesses.</p> <p> The OECD's recommendations will not sit on a shelf.  Instead they will form the building blocks of an ambitious new national SME and entrepreneurship strategy, which I intend to bring forward in the coming months.  That strategy will set out key targets and performance indicators across a range of areas such as targeting a 50% increase in the number of SMEs exporting, achieving a step-up in financial skills and knowledge among our SMEs, ramping up supports so that Irish businesses can embrace the digital revolution, simplifying the process for accessing the R&amp;D tax credit so that more SMEs can benefit and supporting our small firms in the transition to a low-carbon economy.  It goes without saying that SMEs are fundamental to regional development.  That is why we will also broaden the remit of the local enterprise offices, LEOs, to ensure that no ambitious Irish company is left behind, because they find themselves falling between their LEO and Enterprise Ireland.  It is also why I launched nine new regional enterprise plans earlier this year and it is why I have announced &euro;60 million so far under the regional enterprise development fund to foster a collaborative approach in each region.  Indeed, the OECD has specifically identified the example of the go-cluster initiative of the German Federal Government which focuses on the development of local clusters.  The Boyne Valley Food Hub, which received support through the regional enterprise development fund last year, is a great example of the strong local networks that we want to develop.  That kind of regional dimension is vital to our enhancing the capability of SMEs across Ireland.</p> <p> I hope to support more projects like that under the next round of the fund which I hope to announce in the coming weeks.  Typically in Ireland our foreign-owned firms are highly productive while our indigenous SMEs lag behind.  The Government wants to close that gap and strike a better balance.  I absolutely value the crucial role that foreign direct investment, FDI, plays in Ireland's economic success and how indigenous companies can leverage that investment.  For every ten jobs that are created in FDI firms, there are eight spin-off jobs in other companies here.  For that reason, the question should never be about FDI or indigenous, but rather how we can maximise the benefits for both.  There are many great examples of partnerships between domestic companies and foreign multinationals to everybody's benefit.  This is something I want to see more of into the future and it is why I have made SME involvement a prerequisite when applying for the Government's &euro;500 million disruptive technologies innovation fund.  I am acutely aware that our indigenous Irish companies are the engine of our economy and I want to ensure we are doing everything in our power to support them.  In the past, smaller firms have sometimes felt overlooked by governments and I want to change that narrative.  Abraham Lincoln said "the most reliable way to predict the future is to create it".  Our new SME and entrepreneurship strategy will focus on creating the future we want by ensuring that Irish SMEs are given the red carpet treatment they deserve.</p> <p> Again I thank the Business Committee for the opportunity to speak on the OECD review and roadmap.  They are excellent documents which include best practice examples from countries facing similar challenges to Ireland's, whether Malaysia's masterplan for SMEs and entrepreneurship or Germany's go-cluster initiative, which increases collaboration between mittelstand companies and research institutions.  I look forward to hearing the views of all Deputies on what they feel is working well and what we can do better as my Department and the Government works to develop a robust and enduring framework for Irish SMEs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-10a.606" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="19:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121000040#NN00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute and thank my colleague, Deputy Michael Moynihan, who pushed it at the Business Committee to ensure the OECD report would be debated here.  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement that she is going to start listening to SMEs.  She acknowledged that she felt they have not been listened to and said she will extend the red carpet to them.  It is worthy that after nine years the Government realises how important this sector is to the economy.  Over 250,000 SMEs in the country account for 99% of all business enterprises in Ireland, employing in excess of 1 million people.  They are the backbone of this economy but unfortunately over recent years they have not felt that their concerns have been listened to or addressed.</p><p>This report confirms that Ireland is less innovative, productive and export-oriented than foreign-owned counterparts.  Alarmingly the OECD states that Ireland lacks a unified SME and entrepreneur policy document, that despite there being 1 million employed by SMEs we do not have a business strategy at Government level.  Without that strategy it is hardly surprising that Ireland has fallen to its lowest ranking, 24th of 190 economies in a 12-year history of the World Bank's rating for ease of doing business.  Among our competitor countries the UK ranked eighth, Denmark fourth and Sweden tenth.  Ireland lags behind top performing economies: in enforcing contracts it is 91st; registering property, 60th; and getting credit, 48th.  One of the biggest challenges facing not just SMEs but businesses and the community sector are the spiralling insurance premia.  My party leader raised this on Leaders Questions today.  We have no concrete data collected on public liability insurance but the anecdotal evidence presented to me and my colleagues in all political parties is that premia are increasing by between 100% and 300%.  In reply to a parliamentary question on the completion of the action plan the Minister said that of the ten actions none has been completed.  They are all &quot;in progress&quot;, &quot;in train&quot; and &quot;yet to be completed&quot;.  That shows the <i>laissez faire</i>attitude of this Government to dealing with the high cost of insurance.  In 2017, Ireland's energy costs ranked among the top ten most expensive countries in the EU.  Despite their quantitative dominance and employment creation record SMEs are struggling in many respects and delivering very poor productivity according to wide research.</p><p>This report is not reinventing the wheel.  SMEs want to know when the key recommendations of this report will be implemented and whether they will be implemented in a timely manner.  Critical to this is the first action, the need for a unified strategy across Departments.  When can we expect that strategy to be published?  I understood it was to be published before the end of this year.  In her contribution the Minister said it would be published within months.</p></speech>

The Minister said months.  This Government may not have months to publish this.  It is coming belatedly, after nine years in government and failure to produce a comprehensive strategy.</p> <p>Many pre-budget submissions by ISME and SFA have called for reform of our research and development regime.  The OECD report points out that between 2011 and 2015 the research and development tax credit to large firms increased by 300% but only by 14% for SMEs.  I hope that whoever is in government when the next budget is being prepared will make comprehensive changes to the research and development tax credit so that it is less cumbersome for SMEs to avail of it.  The action taken to introduce a pre-approval procedure is very welcome and is something that will be of benefit to SMEs.</p> <p> Skills shortages are identified in financial management, IT capabilities, marketing and professional development.  I am sure the Minister has read the report prepared by Mr. Jim Power on behalf of ISME which deals with the issue of introducing QQI accredited courses for people working in the SME sector.  In order to incentivise people to go down that route, we must introduce tax incentives or tax credits, similar to what is available to people in the agriculture sector when they complete a green certificate.  We must ensure that people working in the SME sector have the required skill sets and the only way to do that is to provide courses for them to complete.</p> <p> On the issue of the LEOs, the Minister spoke about what she is doing from a regional perspective but the OECD report is clear that the current LEO model is not fit for purpose.  That is not to say that the LEOs do not do great work for many small businesses but as the OECD points out, many SMEs are falling between the two stools of the LEOs and Enterprise Ireland.  It identifies a gap for established firms with between ten and 249 employees that are not export driven and that gap must be addressed by the Department.  I hope the Minister gets an opportunity to correct the record of the House and clarifies exactly when she will publish her strategy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-10a.610" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1344" speakername="Eamon Scanlon" time="20:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121000041#OO00200"><p>I should state at the outset that I own a small business and have a good understanding of how small businesses operate in this country.  I welcome the fact that the Minister will roll out the red carpet for SMEs.  It is hard to believe that over 1 million people are employed in the SME sector in Ireland.  We must see full tax equalisation for the self-employed, with PAYE credits.  We must also ensure that our capital gains tax rate is competitive.  Our employment and investment incentive scheme, EIIS, regime must be capable of competing with the UK equivalent.  We need a State-backed enterprise bank for small businesses, many of which are finding it very difficult to secure credit from high street banks.  An enterprise stabilisation fund must be made available to the worst-affected and most exposed firms in the context of a hard Brexit.  I know that a fund of &euro;300 million is in place but just over 15% of SMEs have applied to it, which indicates that it is not working.  More support must be provided to SMEs to enable them to benefit from that fund.</p>  <p>  The biggest problem facing SMEs today is the cost of insurance.  This was raised in the D&aacute;il earlier today by my party leader, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, and it has been mentioned in this debate.  I understand that the Perjury and Related Offences Bill 2018 has been through the Seanad and is due to be introduced in the D&aacute;il.  While that legislation is probably years too late, at least it is coming.  The quicker that Bill is brought into this House, debated and passed, the better.  Currently there is nothing to deter people from making false insurance claims.  We all know that there are genuine claims being made but there are also a lot of fraudulent claims being processed.  Claimants can just walk away and those paying insurance premiums have to bear the cost.  It is time for the Government and this House to stand up for small business owners, community groups, hall owners and so on who are struggling to survive in rural Ireland.  We must stand up for once and for all and do whatever we can as quickly as we can to ensure that this nonsense stops.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-10a.611" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1333" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="20:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121000041#OO00300"><p>This OECD report outlines serious deficits in this Government's policies <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the SME sector.  It draws attention to the fact that our over-reliance on foreign direct investment, FDI, has led to disparities in regional development.  Our tax system is also over-reliant on a small number of multinational corporations, with 45% of the total corporation tax take in 2018 coming from just ten companies.  Foreign-owned multinationals paid 77% of the &euro;10.4 billion corporation tax intake last year.  This has left our economy heavily exposed to changes in global markets and in the international political climate.</p><p>SMEs are a critical pillar of the Irish economy.  The OECD report points to a 2016 estimate of approximately 250,000 active enterprises in Ireland, virtually all of which are SMEs.  These firms account for 56% of manufacturing employment and 74% of services employment in Ireland but currently both wages and productivity are lower for domestic SMEs.  Clearly we need to redress the balance because the current set up is unsustainable.</p><p>A key issue that must be addressed is strengthening the LEOs.  This was identified in the OECD report which said that LEOs have an important role to play but that we need to provide additional supports to them, including building local enterprise networks, particularly in remote regions.  We must increase the scale and ambition of the LEOs and my colleague, Deputy Quinlivan, and I have devised a plan to do just that.  We propose to establish a new Irish enterprise agency which would incorporate the existing LEOs, with a national headquarters, board and executive committee established.  We propose to recruit 100 additional staff for the agency's head office which would co-ordinate activities across all 31 regional offices.  This new organisation would provide the Government with advice and guidance on what SMEs, retailers and other enterprises need in order to grow their businesses.  The agency would ensure that the uptake of State support and assistance is of an equal standard across the State because currently there are significant variations across LEOs.  We also propose to introduce 100 mobile business advisors who would travel to businesses to provide on-site advice on business plans, grants, investment strategies and so on.  The reality for many small business owners and entrepreneurs is that they cannot afford to take time off to visit LEOs so this would ensure access to services for all businesses.</p><p>The OECD report identified key areas that must be addressed including increasing productivity growth, the business start-up rate and business dynamism in the SME sector.  It also makes reference to facilitating entrepreneurship among women, young people and migrants; scaling up microenterprises; generating more medium-sized firms; and increasing SME activity in foreign markets.  The report identifies the need for a strengthening of SME internationalisation and this is clearly an urgent priority in the context of Brexit.  Our direct SME export levels are very low by international standards, with only around 6% of Irish SMEs directly trading across borders.  On top of this, a high share of SME exporters trade only with the British market.  This is the most exposed sector in the State, namely small exporting businesses for which Britain is their main or only market.  We must support these businesses to expand their markets beyond Britain.</p><p>The Government's current policy of offering loans to businesses has not been a success.</p> <p>We need to take the reality of SMEs into account when creating solutions for the challenges of Brexit.  For many, taking on additional debt in a time of uncertainty is simply not feasible.  Many SMEs have reflected this and this is also reflected in the low uptake of loans.  We also need to incentivise start-ups.  The Minister needs to change her priorities.  Instead of lobbying for tax breaks for millionaire CEOs of foreign companies, perhaps she could consider lobbying for incentives and support for small start-ups.  </p> <p> Finally, I refer to the Border region, which I represent.  The report notes strong disparities in the regions.  Approximately 30% of the State's employees live in Dublin and income per head is substantially higher in Dublin than in the rest of the State.  According to the figures presented in the report, disposable income per person in Dublin is 15% above the State average, and the Border region is 13% below this average.  The Border region has the lowest rate of disposable income per person - 28% below Dublin.  This, again, demonstrates the disparity between Dublin and the rest of the State.  Given that the Minister represents a Border constituency, I ask that she might give special attention to business and enterprise along the Border.  Amendments I tabled to the business section of the Brexit omnibus Bill have ensured that the Border gets priority in the allocation of business supports.  The Government needs to take a similar position to ensure the region will weather the storm of Brexit, and outside of that, grow and thrive to improve the living standards of people living along the Border.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-10a.613" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1327" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="20:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121000042#PP00200"><p>The OECD report highlights how vital SMEs are to our economy, outlining the fact that 92% of enterprises operating here had fewer than ten employees, which shows that microbusinesses are the engine of our economy.</p>  <p>  However, one would not know this from the approach of Ministers, who focuses all their attention on cutting big ribbons at multinational headquarters.  Multinational investment in this State is important, but it should not come at the expense of neglecting small indigenous businesses that are the engine of the economy.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed a policy that would begin a process of rebalancing the State's industrial strategy by supporting and growing indigenous businesses.  I launched that policy recently with my colleague, Deputy Munster.  We propose to reorganise the current LEO structure into a larger centrally-led national agency, with the scale and ambition to help grow indigenous businesses.  The purpose of this new jobs agency would be to grow domestic businesses, providing balance to our economy, our workforce and our public finances.</p>  <p>  With the prospect of a no-deal Brexit still in the mix, it is vital that we strengthen the domestic economy now in order that it can both withstand the impact of Brexit, but also continue to expand under the new circumstances.  A new jobs agency focused on our domestic businesses can help achieve this.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in recognise the importance of FDI, but we also recognise the risks an over-reliance on this sector alone brings.  Some 45% of the total corporation tax take in 2018 came from just ten companies, while foreign-owned multinationals paid 77% of the &euro;10.4 billion corporation tax take that year.  That is just is not sustainable.  While we are still supportive of maintaining FDI and export-led growth as key pillars of our industrial strategy, it is imperative we grow our indigenous and co-operative sectors to provide balance to our economy and to our public finances.  A new stronger jobs agency focused on micro and small businesses can lead that change.  In addition to providing business support to SME owners, this agency would encourage good pay and working conditions for employees and develop remote working hubs on derelict sites to address the decline of many town centres, giving workers the option of working from their own communities, if they so wish.</p>  <p>  LEO staff have done excellent work to date with the resources they have been given, and we believe an opportunity now exists to build on their experience and knowledge by creating a larger, more ambitious State body focused solely on indigenous Irish businesses.  </p>  <p>  We have also proposed re-establishing the co-operative development unit in the Minister's Department.  We encourage her to consider that, as the unit would encourage the growth and development of co-operatives that are currently rare enough in this State.  I also encourage her to examine our proposals, which aim to build on the good work of LEOs and increase the level of support to micro and small businesses.</p></speech>

We need the recommendations to be implemented.  I welcome the fact that the Minister intends to publish her plans soon.  Could she define what "soon" is?  We are all aware that we may not be in the current D&aacute;il for all that much longer and it is important that this be addressed.</p>  <p>  By and large, the report points to many strengths in SMEs but also to challenges and issues that need to be addressed.  As has been said, they represent a large sector of our economy and employ a large number of people in the workforce.  As the Minister said, 70% of our workers are employed by SMEs.  This does not always get the attention they deserve.  Job announcements in large multinationals receive a great deal of attention whereas the same number of jobs may be provided by in a large number of SMEs in the same area but they are seldom mentioned.  It is important to stress the large role they play in our economy, particularly in local economies and in the regions.  We need to redress the balance between the small number of large companies, primarily multinationals, and SMEs and provide the opportunities that are recommended in this report for small businesses to scale-up.  That is central to many of the recommendations.  </p>  <p>  They point to a number of issues and one of the key findings is access to finance.  This should not be such an obstacle, given the presence of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, for example.  The commercial banks have been put on a healthy footing, thanks to the people, at a huge cost.  They should be more proactive in providing funding.  Many pension funds are investing but they do not always invest in productive economic activity.  There needs to be more of an effort to address that.  As has been mentioned, the cost of insurance is a significant barrier as well and progress has been far too slow in addressing that issue.  We have had opportunities to debate that but it is a key factor.</p>  <p>  Small businesses are particularly worried about taking risks and taking out loans.  Wherever it is possible, loans should be guaranteed or it may be preferable to provide grants rather than having the risk of a small company being worried about being able to pay such loans back.  If loans are the option, these should be issued on favourable interest rate terms.  All of these issues are important to small companies willingness to invest in developing and becoming larger.</p>  <p>  An issue that is clearly highlighted, which has been referred to by previous speakers, including the Minister, is the gap between the LEOs and Enterprise Ireland.  We will be aware of this in our local areas.  We all know people who are trying to get a small company up and running and are trying to get certain support from the LEOs.  They then find, as they try to scale up, that they are not big enough for Enterprise Ireland but too big for the LEOs.  That is a problem.  Some practical measures need to be put in place in that context.  Consulting people in the sector is crucial as they know exactly the challenges that are facing them.  They can often identify exactly what kind of supports would be suitable to help them to grow.</p>  <p>  If a large number of small companies can grow, that would make a major difference in respect of employment opportunities in local economies and generally in respect the economic health of the country.  We do not want to be as dependent as we currently are on multinationals for jobs.</p> <p>We have a healthy jobs economy, but it is over-dependent on large multinationals.</p> <p> Brexit uncertainty is an obvious issue.  We have had the opportunity in parliamentary questions and so forth to raise the concerns and uncertainties that still exist about the effect of Brexit.  Perhaps there will be more clarity by the end of this week in that regard.</p> <p> Regarding spin-offs, many of the smaller indigenous companies are set up as a result of people working in multinational companies and seeing an opportunity to start their own business.  I see it in my region where a large number of companies have been established in that way.  They need support.  The ones that start in incubation settings in higher education institutions tend to have good support due to how they start and where they are situated, but those that start outside that setting and in the community are probably more exposed.  Perhaps there is a way they can get greater support.  The Minister referred to clusters.  My area has both a university and an institute of technology which are good at supporting and incubating companies that develop out of the institutions.  I am sure that is the case in other parts of the country.  However, there are many entrepreneurial individuals in Ireland who set up companies and do not have that type of structure.  If possible, they should be linked into the higher education sector that is already doing that type of work.</p> <p> The Minister mentioned the need for us to move to a low-carbon economy.  That is a crucial requirement and it obviously must be on a large scale.  There are opportunities in that regard and many of them are locally based because, by definition, one wishes to produce things in the local area rather than having transportation costs and the effect that has on the carbon footprint.  We must put more emphasis on supporting businesses operating in that sector, and this is mentioned in the report.  There are many such businesses.  By and large, they are highly motivated but they need specific supports.  They can potentially make an enormous difference to our economy and, indeed, to the air we breathe and the future of our planet.  There should be a particular focus on those companies.</p> <p> I looked at the selected recommendations in the executive summary.  They have largely been covered in all the contributions this evening.  They refer to identifying local cluster challenges and bringing together a network of regional enterprise network managers.  We also have regional skills organisers in the eight regions.  They come through the Department of Education and Skills and link local businesses with higher education institutions.  They have an important role to play.  There is also a reference to building up apprenticeships.  I have often spoken about apprenticeships.  There is huge potential in that regard.  Again, it is driven primarily by the Department of Education and Skills, but there are now apprenticeships across a variety of sectors in the economy.  They provide an opportunity for SMEs to develop their workforce and give opportunities to people in a variety of sectors to develop very good careers as well as stronger businesses.</p> <p> It is important that these recommendations are implemented and in a way that involves consulting widely with the people directly involved in the businesses.  They know more than probably any Member of the House what the challenges are and what would help them to scale up their businesses and be sustainable for the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-10a.616" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1361" speakername="Tommy Broughan" time="20:25:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121000043#QQ00200"><p>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak briefly on the OECD report on SME and entrepreneurship policy in Ireland.  I welcome that it has been put before the D&aacute;il.  Hopefully, the Minister will move forward quickly and publish her unified strategy document for the future.</p>  <p>  Small and medium-sized enterprises are a vital part of our economy and employ over 70% of the workforce of 2.3 million people.  That is quite typical of the European Union where approximately two thirds of all workers work for SMEs.  Even in the UK, approximately half the workforce is in SMEs.  Medium-sized companies have 250 employees or less, small companies have fewer than 50 employees and microenterprises have ten or less.  Like many Deputies, I have worked in small and medium-sized enterprises in the past.  I was a director of a community enterprise centre and was involved in training local entrepreneurs on the north side of Dublin for more than three decades.  Throughout that time there have been many initiatives by organisations such as area partnerships, which in the case of Dublin Bay North include the Northside Partnership, Pobal, SOLAS, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and local enterprise offices in Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council.  They have all played a vital role over the years in supporting the development of small business.  What the Minister must do in the new unified strategy is try to address some of the deficiencies in the sector, particularly with Brexit looming over it. </p>  <p>  It is welcome that the Minister commissioned this report last year.  I looked through the various themes and actions and there are many common-sense initiatives that could be taken.  I welcome that the Minister has established the interdepartmental consultative group, which is chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Breen.  The 11 actions under the six themes refer to the work that has already been put in place to develop small and medium-sized enterprise.  For example, action 2 calls for an online business diagnostic tool, to be able to benchmark small businesses and improve their access to finance and their skills in recruitment and marketing their products.  One of the areas where SMEs are sometimes squeezed out, and other Deputies have referred to this, is with regard to tax credits in the research and development area.  Action 3 recommends a simplified pre-approval process.  It is skewed towards the large companies at present and this would give smaller companies, partnerships and even small co-operative businesses a chance in this regard.</p>  <p>  Action 5 refers to the slow rate of digitisation and the fact that the LEOs could play a strong role in helping small businesses in that area.  There is also reference to clusters, which have been successful not only in this country but also in Germany and in some sister jurisdictions in the European Union.  Obviously, there must be access to credit.  The trading online voucher programme is mentioned, as well as the fact that SMEs need better resources to be able to pursue such implements to develop their businesses.  Action 9 refers to access to finance through the microenterprise loan fund and so forth.</p>  <p>  Action 10 refers to tax reliefs for non-domiciled new hires by Irish SMEs.  That involves the special assignee relief programme, SARP, but there are many concerns at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, and I indicated them in my budget submission, about how SARP works, how it discriminates, how the programme has expanded and how it has been taken advantage of by some larger companies.  I am not sure if it is the right implement for SMEs.  Another area highlighted in the report is the levels of productivity.  The National Competitiveness Council mentioned this in its productivity statement in 2019.</p> <p>We need measures and supports to boost productivity in SMEs and the National Competitiveness Council has also drawn attention to this.  There is more than enough evidence to show that Irish SMEs must be supported better in the future and we have a roadmap in this report to help us to do it.  I welcome the report and urge the Government to implement its key recommendations as soon as possible.</p></speech>

It is interesting that in Ireland, the idea of an SME among members of the public is not an enterprise with up to 250 people employed.  In the Donegal context, that would be looked on as a very large employer.  When we talk about this, we should talk about small enterprises because that is the reality in rural Ireland.  In regard to the supports that are available to such companies, we should concentrate on that level because it is those indigenous industries which can grow and develop and perhaps get to the point where they can contribute and compete.</p><p>We are caught by the fact we have a very small population so businesses and enterprises cannot grow internally to a stage where they get the critical mass that allows them to export or grow internationally.  This happens in other countries, such as Belgium, which has a population of 11.5 million, or the Netherlands, with a population of 18 million or 19 million, but Ireland has a population of just 4.5 million.  Small industries here do not get the chance to grow and develop internally and then be able to export abroad and grow.  We should focus on very small industries - we should drop the M and just talk about SEs.  This would be very important from a policy point of view and is something that could happen.</p><p>I carried out a business survey in the last couple of years in County Donegal.  There were 105 responses to the survey and 75% were businesses that employed between one and five people.  Some 75% of them were online and depopulation and the threat to rural services were of concern for 83% of them, given that is what impacted on them and on their ability to survive and keep going.  More worrying, and this is a point that should worry the Minister, is that more than 80% of the businesses were unaware of any Government support for them.  That was their response to the survey I put out, which is very worrying for us.  Since the recession, almost 50% of businesses have seen their business decline or not improve.  We should be targeting our resources to ensure those businesses can grow.</p><p>The first of the report's key findings is telling.  It states:</p> <blockquote> 	...business dynamism and the start-up rate are relatively low, Irish SMEs are not very active in international markets, and SME productivity growth is stagnant.  There are also weaknesses in SME management skills, capital investment levels and technology adoption. </blockquote>  <p>This is vital.  It shows the difficulties with Ireland Inc., as we do not have the critical mass of population to allow SMEs to develop and grow due to the domestic environment.  This is what we are missing.  We need to find a way to replace that and ensure SMEs can develop and grow.  We need to drop the M altogether and focus on SEs.</p></speech>

SMEs are a critical part of our overall economy, as the Minister said.  While corporation taxes and the high visibility of the multinationals get almost all of the attention, it is our SMEs that generate most of the work in this country.  SMEs are particularly important for the labour market in Ireland, no more so than in the Minister's county of Monaghan.  They generate more than 70% of all jobs in the non-financial business economy and this is approximately four percentage points more than the EU average, which is a good thing.</p>  <p>  That said, it is clear, and has been clear for some time, that Irish SMEs still face significant challenges, especially around bureaucracy, red tape and high costs, in particular the cost of insurance, which the Government has failed abysmally to deal with in any way.  The OECD report accepts that while Ireland is a successful generator of SMEs and the sector is innovative, business dynamism and the start-up rate are relatively low.  Irish SMEs are also not very active in international markets and SME productivity growth is reported as stagnant.</p>  <p>  Two of the greatest challenges for SMEs in the last number of years have been the commercial rates system and the rejection level for bank finance applications from SMEs.  The rates are crippling and people get nothing for them.  They pay the rates but the whole appeals system is bureaucratic.  With regard to the rejection level for bank finance applications, the banks are d&uacute;nta, they are closed.  They are not operating for small businesses or for anyone else, except big business.  This is after we bailed them out, which is ridiculous.  It is rejection after rejection.  They are not open for business, whether it is for business loans, for householders or for people trying to buy homes.  It annoys me that they have these big campaigns, with 300 people in a hotel, talking about all the money they are going to roll out.  They are d&uacute;nta, they are shut for business, they are not working.  However, the Government is blind to that, like the last Government and the one before that.  The Central Bank, in its report on this matter earlier this year, highlighted the rejection rate as being about 15%.  The experience of many SMEs, however, is that the rejection rate is well above this.</p>  <p>  As for the current commercial rates system, we know that in the last two years alone, local authorities collected more than &euro;4 billion in rates.  What do small business people get back for that?  Zilch.  There was a time when they would get services, such as refuse services and the salting of the roads, but they get nothing now.  The county councils have literally abandoned the people.  Just like it banished big Phil the destroyer, the Government has banished all the local town councils.  It has taken away democracy from the people and given nothing back.  They get nothing for the rates, and the Minister knows that better than I do.  They have to pay them, whereas bigger businesses can put up a sign to say a business is for rent or for sale, and they get back a massive rebate.  Tipperary County Council acknowledged this and tried to change it at its most recent budget meeting.</p>  <p>  Small businesses like those in Tipperary town have literally been facing ruin because they cannot get exemptions or decreases in rates, even when there is a collapse in business due to the activity of the local authority with roadworks.  They spent the last year digging up the streets in Tipperary town.  Would the council contact or notify people, or listen to them?  No.  It is pure arrogance.  They can get these rates like a punitive tax and people get nothing in return.  Despite the fact businesses are closing down or staying open by the skin of their teeth, there is no support for them.  SMEs need support.  They must be listened to and respected for what they do.  They are the key provider of employment in towns and villages in rural Ireland, and they include many small farms, which are also SMEs.  They need less Government interference and the adoption of measures that can make a difference in the real world but they are bogged down with endless red tape or complicated application processes for grant support.</p>  <p>  We have all of these roll-outs.  The Minister, Deputy Ring, is great at announcing money for this, that and the other, but getting it is another thing.  Live horse and you will get grass, it is said, but the money is going back unspent.  Self-employed people are getting tired of the bureaucracy, of Revenue, of the sheriff and of punitive charges.  They are fed up with the banks because the banks are not functioning for them.  We all paid our taxes to bail out the banks and our grandchildren will be paying for that but we get nothing back from the banks and they are not even listening.</p>  <p>  Ministers are heedless of the situation for small businesses but they will know when they go to the election because the people are waiting for them.  Some of them are waiting with pitchforks and any other weapons they have to make sure the Government will not come near them.  Ministers do not understand, do not listen and are not interested in the people, good, bad or indifferent.  The Minister can shake her head all she likes but that is the fact of the matter.  They are asleep at the wheel.  Businesses are under savage pressure and there is mental illness and everything else because of the pressure of trying to compete, pay PRSI, pay this new charge, that new charge or this new course.</p> <p>If it is not hazard analysis and critical control point, HACCP, it is something else coming down on top of them - not HIQA, which operates in the hospitals, although it will not look at the trolley crisis.  It is bureaucracy.  There are legions of people going around with briefcases.  They cannot help the businesses.  There is the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, as well as everything else.  These bodies are there to close down and punish businesses.  They never come in and ask whether they can help them, whether there is any way an open day could be held or whether they could give a little advice on the problems the businesses have.  These bodies tell the businesses what is wrong and when to get it fixed.  If they do not get it fixed, they face heavy and punitive fines.  These struggling people are the backbone of our business, our industry.  Of course I welcome the multinational businesses coming here but the small business people do not get the huge enticements to come here yet they stay here.  They have been here for the long run but they are growing very tired now.  You can bring the horse to water but you cannot make him drink.  If the Minister does not wake up and do something, many of these businesses will disappear.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-10a.623" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1263" speakername="Michael Collins" time="20:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121000045#SS00200"><p>I do not know how I will follow that.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter.  As we know, SMEs are a critical part of the Irish economy.  The OECD report tells us, &quot;There were approximately 250 000 active enterprises in Ireland in 2016.&quot;  It states that SMEs make up as much as 56% of manufacturing employment and 74% of services employment in Ireland.  Unfortunately, however, Ireland's direct SME export levels are very low by international standards, with only 6% of Irish SMEs directly trading across borders and with a high share of SME exporters trading only with the UK market.  However, SMEs may contribute to exports indirectly by providing multinational firms with components and services.  This is of particular concern to these companies with Brexit fast approaching.  Many companies have invested heavily to support exporting over recent years.  These companies need reassurances that the State will stand by them and provide assistance in the event of a hard Brexit.</p><p>The report's executive summary outlines in its key findings, &quot;Ireland offers a favourable regulatory environment, low taxation, extensive R&amp;amp;D support and good physical infrastructure.&quot;  I am not sure about the last one.  In rural Ireland we are constantly fighting for investment in our roads, public transport and broadband.  I have continuously pleaded with the Government since I was elected a Deputy for investment in our roads in west Cork.  It is a fine thing I talked to Shep, the dog at home, because no one here listens.  The report seems to contradict itself in chapter 3, calling Ireland's physical transport infrastructure sub-par.</p><p>The report also states:</p> <blockquote> 	access to finance remains problematic and incentives could be strengthened for investment in SMEs and entrepreneurship.  Skills shortages are also rising, implying a need to monitor the success of recent apprenticeship and skills development policies. </blockquote>  <p>I brought up this issue of skills shortages in November of last year and nothing has changed since.  There is no doubt but that we have a lack of young people taking up apprenticeships.  The 2018 Construction Industry Federation, CIF, report entitled the Trades &amp;amp; Apprenticeships Skills Survey identifies a lack of skilled tradespeople and apprenticeships as small firms struggle to take on apprentices.  In the report the CIF states this is a clear warning sign to the Government and that the shortage is so severe that there exists the potential for long-term problems.  If the Government wants to see more people taking up trades, it will have to better support young people.  The report goes on to state, &quot;Many firms in the past employed apprentices, however currently do not due to firm downsizing, lack of government incentives and onerous legislative obligations.&quot;  All this has caused a shortage of qualified construction tradespeople across the construction trades and apprenticeships.  This is a big concern that needs to be addressed.  Contractors feel that the legislative and Government requirements surrounding apprenticeships are burdensome and put them under pressure.  The Government needs to tackle this crisis now, not wait for things to escalate further.  We have many thousands of talented tradespeople and professionals who emigrated during the recession.  The Government should be doing all it can to make moving back to Ireland more appealing.  However, with rising rents and shambolic health services, this would seem an uphill battle.  Without Government action on this, we cannot expect the trend to change.</p><p>The OECD report outlines that the higher education system plays an important role in providing skills that are relevant to the labour market.  The report also outlines, however, that the Irish economy would benefit from wider participation in lifelong learning programmes.  I would like to see more incentives for people who have left the education system to return to it or take up a trade.  I would like to see those who are in full-time employment and who want to continue upskilling given more opportunities to take part in short-term courses.  When holding down a full-time job and supporting a family, many people cannot commit to courses that run for years.  There should also be more incentives for companies to send their employees on upskilling courses in the form of tax relief for the employer, incentivising companies to invest continually in their employees, in turn benefiting both.</p></speech>

My colleagues, Deputies Troy and Scanlon, dealt with some of the details of the report earlier.  I wish to refer specifically to the needs of the Border region.  Through parliamentary questions and other debates in this House, we have discussed the particular challenges facing small and medium-sized enterprises in the Border region due to Brexit.  As we know, such enterprises are the backbone of our economy and our region, on both the southern and the northern side of the Border.  I know that some supports have been put in place but I again appeal to the Minister to ensure that additional supports are put in place to assist our companies through the transition that will happen post Brexit.  That uncertainty, unfortunately, has not gone away.  Brexit has been out of our daily vocabulary for some time because of the British general election, but we must deal with the reality that there will be adverse impacts of Brexit and, unfortunately, no benefits for our region.</p>  <p>  In the past I have advocated, as have other public representatives and Members of this House, an all-Ireland industrial policy and business policy.  It is a shame we have not established additional all-Ireland implementation bodies.  In 1998, with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, six all-Ireland bodies were established.  The premise at the time was always that additional bodies would be established in the area of trade promotion and health education.  Sadly, we have not developed on that maximising of the potential of the Good Friday Agreement.  In the areas the Minister, the Acting Chairman, Deputy Breathnach, and I represent, we know very well that many of our companies are cross-Border, all-Ireland bodies.  They should be assisted by agencies that have an all-Ireland remit.  There is a great case to be made at this time, due to Brexit, that we have all-Ireland industrial, business and trade promotion policies.  This can only do good for business in the North and in the South and all-Ireland businesses.  I would love to see this issue moved on.</p>  <p>  Again, our economy, be it in Cavan, Monaghan, Fermanagh, Armagh, Tyrone or that general area, is very heavily dependent on small and medium-sized enterprises.  Thankfully, with the assistance given in the past by the county enterprise boards and more recently by local enterprise boards, some of our small and medium-sized enterprises have become international corporations still based in our region.  I note that at one point in the report the OECD states that the local enterprise offices are not fit for purpose.  I have a great rapport, as I know the Minister does, with our local offices in Cavan and Monaghan.  They have had great personnel working in them over the years.  I sincerely hope, whatever additional systems or restructurings are put in place, that those personnel are given the resources to ensure they can continue to assist employment, generate jobs and grow the economy in our region.</p>  <p>  With those few words, I appeal to the Minister to give further consideration to the points I have outlined in the past as well as this evening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-12-10a.625" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="20:45:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019121000045#SS00400"><p>I thank all the Deputies who spoke, particularly those who had very constructive contributions.  To respond to Deputy Brendan Smith, I fully understand, as he does, the difficulties Border businesses face in the context of Brexit.  We have been working very hard in the Border region to provide all the supports and information we can.  We have had a number of meetings in the Border counties specifically to inform businesses in the region of the challenges Brexit presents.  Deputy Smith mentioned an all-Ireland trade policy.  He and I both hope the Northern Ireland Executive will get up and running as quickly as possible.  When it does, I do not see any reason why we should not look at trade on an all-island basis.  He is absolutely right: jobs created in Armagh and Fermanagh benefit people in Cavan and Monaghan and, <i>vice versa</i>, jobs in Dundalk, such as the ones we announced in WuXi only a couple of weeks ago, another 200 jobs on top of 400, will benefit people in Northern Ireland.  There is an all-island approach to this and it is something we can pursue when the Northern Ireland Executive is back again.</p><p>I have been listening to SMEs since I took up this job.  I regularly meet them.  I engage with all the representative bodies regularly.  I also chair the retail consultation forum and have held Brexit meetings with businesses right across the country.</p></speech>
