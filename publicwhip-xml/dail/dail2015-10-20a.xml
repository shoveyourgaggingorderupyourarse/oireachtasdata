This matter has been discussed in the Chamber on many occasions.  The review mechanism, which is examining the cases of more than 320 persons who have submitted documentation to the Minister, has been in place for more than 17 months.  I ask the Minister to provide an update on the matter.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-20a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000003#A00600"><p>The Deputy is referring to the mechanism established for the independent review of certain allegations of Garda misconduct or inadequacies in the investigation of certain allegations, which have been made to me, as Minister for Justice and Equality, the Taoiseach and other Deputies.  The decision to establish the independent review mechanism was an unprecedented process initiated by the Government to bring an independent examination to bear on allegations of wrongdoing.  The initiative went far beyond anything that any previous Government did to address the types of issue raised by these allegations.</p>  <p>  As I have repeatedly emphasised, the independent review mechanism was not established to act as a commission of inquiry or investigation, nor was it designed to make findings.  Its purpose was to triage allegations to determine whether further action was needed and, if so, what that further action should be.</p>  <p>  As will become obvious, the range of matters covered by the cases referred to the panel was very wide.  It included property disputes, including some that were referred by Deputy Niall Collins, probate issues, disputes between neighbours and dissatisfaction with the outcome of civil and criminal court actions, as well as decisions of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  These are all matters in which I, as Minister, do not have a role.  Nevertheless, they were considered by the panel despite the fact that, at face value, they were outside the remit of the independent review mechanism.</p><p>I am happy to confirm to the Deputy that the panel has provided recommendations to me in all 320 cases submitted to it and has therefore largely concluded its work.  The issuing of notification letters to complainants commenced on 29 June.  To date, 216 complainants have been notified of the outcome of the review of their cases.  Letters will continue to issue to all complainants until the process is completed.  I am clear and mindful that all complainants are anxious to know the outcome of the review of their case and every effort is being made to conclude the process.  Given the figures, I am confident that it will be concluded shortly.  In each case, a summary is prepared together with a draft letter to the complainant.  Mr Justice Roderick Murphy is continuing to review the summaries and the draft letters of notification to ensure that they are a fair and accurate reflection of the recommendations made by counsel.<br/><br/><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i><br/><br/>I have previously assured Deputies that where further investigation is recommended by the review then that will occur.  Where cases have resulted in recommendations for further action, including, for example, referral to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, or requesting a report from the Garda Commissioner in accordance with section 41(2) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, I have accepted those recommendations.  The issues involved in the cases also range considerably, from tragic deaths to property disputes.  With respect to the cases for which the panel has recommended no further action by the Minister, it should be noted that the reasons for this recommendation vary greatly but include the fact that the complaint disclosed no allegation of any wrongdoing by the Garda; the case related to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution which is independent of the Minister in relation to decisions as to whether or not a prosecution is warranted; or the case related to the courts which are also independent and it would be improper for the Minister to interfere in any way with their decisions.  Furthermore, it should be noted that there are many cases which have already been through some form of process whether it was in the courts, GSOC or some other body.<br/><br/>To conclude, I note that there has been considerable media coverage recently concerning the review process.  Some of the reporting has been quite inaccurate.  Nevertheless, I recognise the genuine concerns raised by those whose complaints were forwarded to the panel for review.</p></speech>

I want to raise those issues with the Minister now.  Before I mention them, the Minister will recall that there was a great deal of disquiet about the structure of the independent review mechanism and, among some, about the lack of opportunity to engage directly and face-to-face with the panel.  They felt that disadvantaged the work.  During the RTE programme, the following people had their cases discussed: Patrick Nugent, Adrian Moynihan, Shane Tuohey, Catherine Davis, John Kelly and Shane O'Farrell.  None of those people was happy with the structure and the outcome, at least in so far as RTE "Prime Time" portrayed.  Indeed, some of those people have been in touch with me to confirm that position.</p>  <p>  The Minister said the 320 cases had now concluded.  Will a proportion require some follow-up action and, if so, what will it be?  The Minister has concluded that no further action will be taken in some cases, which have been referred back to GSOC.  I am sure there are a cohort of cases, however, that will require further investigation.  How will that be done?  Will there be a catch-all commission of investigation to take on the block of cases which the Minister deems to merit further investigation independently?</p></speech>

In fact, I am not going to make any comment as to what stage of the process some of the cases that were referred to in the RTE programme were or were not at; one could make the assumption that they were all at different stages of the process.  The process is not complete.  I will make a full statement when the process is complete and give all the details of the recommendations.  I am accepting every recommendation that has come to me.  To answer the Deputy's question, of those recommendations, there will be a percentage, and there has been already, where there are further recommendations.  Those recommendations can vary from asking the Garda Commissioner, for example, to investigate a case further and to meet with families to recommending a formal report under section 41(2) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.  If that is recommended, I will accept it.  It is equally open to recommend a commission of investigation in relation to cases.</p>  <p>  I emphasise that many of these cases go back ten, 20 and 30 years.  They are historical cases that have been in the system in a variety of ways.  I have set up an objective, independent process.  It is totally objective.  It is not a commission of investigation, rather it is a view of the written evidence that has been submitted by the complainants.  As I said in the House previously, over 200 people submitted further details in relation to their complaints and that has all been taken into account in arriving at decisions.</p><p>In all instances, I am accepting the recommendations of the independent panel.</p></speech>

The Minister stated that many people had submitted additional written evidence to the panel.  Given the fact that many people have expressed dissatisfaction with the procedure, its outcome and their inability to engage with the panel, is the Minister open to establishing a commission of investigation that would capture their cases if that is merited and recommended by those who are informing her in her decision?</p></speech>

I have asked for a full report to analyse the process and describe the types of case that the supervising counsel considers appropriate to be brought to my attention in terms of recommendations.

To tackle criminality, one of the BIPA's key recommendations was for a cross-Border task force involving the policing and revenue services on this island and with a dedicated all-Ireland focus.  Does the Minister support this proposal and will she work with her counterpart in the North, Mr. David Ford, to bring it about?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-20a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000005#C01100"><p>Combatting organised crime in whatever guise is among the policy priorities that the Government set out this year and is an operational priority for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners.  It is well recognised that organised crime seeks to exploit the Border.  Cross-Border crime and the people involved pose serious issues.  I have held many discussions with the Northern Minister, Mr. Ford, about the challenges presented by cross-Border organised crime as well as our responses to same.  Recently, we discussed these challenges at a seminar in Sligo on cross-Border organised crime, where I was impressed to see the staff of the Garda and the PSNI working closely together to target this problem.  Down the years, many initiatives have resulted from such discussions.</p>  <p>  I support the valuable contribution made by the BIPA's report on cross-Border crime.  Well done to all involved.  A key feature of the ongoing work is the inter-agency nature of law enforcement co-operation, in that it involves the two police forces and the two customs services on the island as well as the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, and the UK's National Crime Agency.</p>  <p>  Two cross-Border enforcement groups that target fuel fraud and tobacco fraud, respectively, have been in operation for some years and have made a considerable contribution to operational co-operation in the area.  Recently, at the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence, I put into the public arena some of the up-to-date figures on, for example, fuel smuggling and recent successes.  Given the fact that 131 garages have been closed around the country, this is a serious issue that requires attention.  The Revenue Commissioners are active in this regard and have made combatting fuel laundering one of their priorities.  It is implementing a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem, as Deputy Collins knows.  However, I am open to considering any further action such as that recommended in the report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-20a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/998" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000006#D00100"><p>I am pleased to hear the Minister is open to the suggestion on diesel laundering, cigarette smuggling, cattle rustling, petrol stretching and other types of criminality.  Wherever there is a border in Europe, never mind on the island of Ireland, there is an opportunity for criminals to take advantage of it.  The fact that we have good co-operation between the PSNI and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and between the two revenue organisations on the island means it would not be a considerable step to set up a joint task force with a dedicated focus on criminality across the region.  As the Minister knows, this criminality has extended to murder and attacks on republicans across the Border region. Mr. Frank McCabe, a senior republican, was targeted by criminals.  His son was seriously injured and almost killed; he lost an eye and is still recovering.  There are many others.  As Sinn F&eacute;in justice spokesperson, I can speak with authority on the fact that when we stand up to these people, we put our lives on the line.  The Government should establish a joint task force to tackle once and for all these people who are profiteering and taking advantage of the Border.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-20a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000006#D00200"><p>Obviously, it is important that there be absolute clarity from all of us on how we view these issues.  Cross-Border crime continues to be a very significant issue.  These matters are kept under constant review at an operational level in light of the various changing operational demands and the analysis of crime trends.  Certainly, it is an operational decision as to whether another task force is necessary.  There are two already.  We need to ensure we make the very best use of the resources in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and also the cross-Border resources.  There is a clear need to identify this issue as a priority on both sides of the Border.  I have no doubt but that it is identified as an absolute priority.</p>  <p>  Let me put on the floor of the House the facts on the Revenue Commissioners, which show the success of some of the operations.  We do not hear enough about this sometimes.  The statistics also show the scale of the problem.  In 2014 alone, there were 1,109 detections of marked fuel oil, and two oil laundries were detected and shut down, resulting in the seizure of 50,340 litres of oil.  There were 5,852 seizures of cigarettes by the Revenue Commissioners, with 53 million cigarettes seized, to a value of &euro;25.5 million.  Very significant operations are being carried out in the Border area to tackle fuel and cigarette smuggling and other illegal activity, which must be dealt with head-on.</p></speech>

I met senior garda&iacute; and PSNI officers in my role as justice spokesperson and strongly believe that we need a joint task force.  We need to join up the capacity on the island to tackle the problem.  I do not need to remind the Minister that the problem has cost us hundreds of millions of euro over the years, which money could be invested in our health service or education system.  The illegal activity damages legitimate businesses which have struggled through the austerity era.  I would like to see a dedicated focus.  Every single Deputy and Senator in these Houses would be supportive of such a proposal.  The Minister should consider joining up the resources on this island, working with her counterpart in the North and delivering a clear message to those on both sides of the Border that there will be zero tolerance of the tiny minority who are taking huge amounts of money from our revenue and plaguing communities in the Border area.</p></speech>

Is the Minister happy with the protected disclosures process?  These two investigations have been ongoing for the past 18 months, at enormous personal cost to the two individuals involved.</p></reply>

In the first instance, I again make the point that all of us in this House must be careful, and the Deputy has not mentioned individual names, in discussing individual cases of whistleblowing.  Protection for whistleblowers rightly prioritises the confidentiality of the process, which is central to the efficacy of that process.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is familiar with the confidential reporting process that was in place previously, which provided for the appointment of an independent confidential recipient.  That confidential recipient was required to transmit each confidential report to the Garda Commissioner.  Only where a confidential report contained an allegation which related to the Garda Commissioner was it transmitted to the Minister.  In transmitting a report, the confidential recipient was obliged to protect the identity of the whistleblower, etc.  I will not go into further detail on that.</p>  <p>  This was replaced by the Protected Disclosures Act 2014, which came into operation on 15 July 2014 as part of our comprehensive response to enhance the protection available to whistleblowers.  Under the Act, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may now communicate their concerns to the Garda Commissioner, as their employer, or to GSOC as a prescribed body, and are entitled to the protections provided by the Act.  I am satisfied that the legislative provisions now in place under the 2014 Act, including the protections afforded for whistleblowers, will prove to be an effective remedy for Garda members who wish to report their concerns regarding potential wrongdoing.</p>  <p>  As I have previously advised the Deputy in regard to these particular cases, I have no function in regard to criminal investigations and the submission of files to the Director of Public Prosecutions, or in regard to the investigation of complaints by GSOC.  Those are independent processes that go on.</p></reply>

In terms of one of them, the initial internal investigation was corrupted by a leaking of information to one of the people the allegations were made against.  Subsequently, as the Minister is aware, the same Assistant Commissioner was involved with the other garda.  It beggars belief that the Commissioner would make that decision.</p>  <p>  Zero tolerance is what the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, says it is getting from the garda&iacute; in trying to address one of the cases.  In terms of the other one, it has been an unmitigated cover-up for a long time in regard to drugs in the Athlone area, and it leaves so much to be desired.  The Commissioner's handling of the situation has been nothing short of a disaster.  There are repercussions, and they are very sad.</p></speech>

Cases that are currently active are involved in that process.  That is the first point I would make.  The process is not completed.  Deputy Wallace has made claims in regard to cover-up and drugs offences.  If he has that evidence about drugs in the Athlone area, as he has now quoted, I ask him to please provide that to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  At the end of this process, if issues arise regarding the procedures that have been brought in for dealing with whistleblowers under the new statutory arrangements, I will examine them and review how the legislation is working, if that evidence is brought to my attention at the end of this process.</p></speech>

As for the other case, the Minister suggested I should give the information about the drugs, but the Commissioner has it.  The person alleged to have protected the individual involved in the drugs happens to be in the Phoenix Park now overseeing the implementation of the Garda inspector's report.  The Commissioner has not dealt well with the matter by any measure.  A person has lost his life recently in Athlone because of drugs.  I would have thought the Government should take this seriously.  The fact is that this has not been dealt with for a long time and someone has now lost his life.  There are serious questions to be answered.  What is happening to that individual in Athlone is shameful.</p> <p> We went to see him last Saturday morning because we were concerned about his health and what is happening to him.  He is being bullied and intimidated by a senior member in his barracks.  There has been no feedback on the investigation.  I cannot believe the Commissioner can stand over this or that the Minister can stand over the Commissioner's role in it.</p></speech>

In reaching these conclusions, Garda management reviewed all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.  The programme supports the provision of 21st century policing services for urban and rural areas and allows front-line garda&iacute; to be managed and deployed with greater mobility and flexibility and in a more focused fashion, in particular with regard to various targeted police operations.  As a result of the programme, communities have benefitted from increased Garda visibility and increased patrolling hours have been enabled.</p>  <p>  In tandem with the rationalisation of stations the Government has been determined to ensure that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources to deliver highly mobile and responsive Garda patrols in rural and urban communities.  A total of &euro;29 million has been invested.</p>  <p>  I wish to inform the House that today I am announcing the allocation of a further &euro;5.3 million to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the purchase of 260 vehicles between now and the end of the year.  This new investment will provide the Garda with additional high-powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, cars for surveillance and covert operations, motor cycles for high-visibility road policing and vehicles for public order policing.  This investment in a modern effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the capital programme, under which a further &euro;46 million has been allocated for Garda vehicles over the lifetime of the plan.  That will facilitate what is needed in communities today, which is additional funding for Garda surveillance, special operations and targeted intelligence-led policing.</p>  <p>  That will be accompanied by the continued renewal of Garda personnel with 600 new garda&iacute; to be recruited next year on top of the 550 by the end of this year.  The totality of this investment will ensure that the Garda has the necessary tools and manpower to tackle the scourge of highly mobile gangs and to disrupt crime, particularly burglaries in rural and urban areas.</p></speech>

They are welcome and needed.</p><p>We should go further in many areas that we have previously discussed, such as recruitment, mandatory sentencing and a camera network along our motorways and at motorway junctions. </p> <p> The Minister and I have a different perspective on Garda stations.  The Government feels it made right decision in closing 139 Garda stations.  Everybody else is on the other side of the argument, including the political establishment, community-based organisations, the IFA, members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the GRA and the AGSI.  They all feel it was the wrong decision to remove the presence of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na from many communities.  In my constituency in Doon, County Limerick, a man died.</p> <p> The proof that it was the wrong decision, along with everything else, is the fact that we have a detection rate of 13% in respect of burglaries.  I know the Government will be very slow to back down on this, but in order to move the debate on and to bring a degree of realism to it, would the Minister not ask the Garda Inspectorate to carry out an impact analysis of the areas where Garda stations were closed to see how the level of policing diminished and crime rates varied arising from that?  We were supposed to have an independent An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na review of the decision following its implementation.  I do not know why that did not happen, but in the absence of that could we please have an independent panel?  Could the Minister ask the Garda Inspectorate to consider it?</p></speech>

That is the reality of the situation.  What we need is what I have outlined, namely, increased Garda visibility and patrol hours, increased mobility and flexibility within an area, resulting in an improved policing service for the public, enhanced co-ordination of Garda activity and more garda&iacute;, as we are providing by recruiting 1,150 extra garda&iacute;.  </p>  <p>  Fianna F&aacute;il stopped investing in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2009 until it left government, which led to many of the current difficulties.  This Government has started the kind of investment that is needed and it will be ongoing, which is what will lead to reduced difficulties and get the best results.  On the Deputy's figures on burglaries being solved, if he examines Operation Fiacla he will find the numbers of people arrested and charged are not the percentages he quoted.</p></speech>

That is not what communities are telling us.  I have attended about 40 public meetings around Ireland and a common message came from all of them, namely, that people want the presence of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in their communities, which can be provided when there is a base and presence in an area.  None of the compensatory follow-up actions promised by the Minister's predecessor, such as Garda clinics or the roll-out of mobile Garda services, was ever followed through on.</p>  <p>  People need reassurance and to know that a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is in the community.  Unfortunately, that is not happening.  The Government pointed to decisions taken in 2009.  We know the facts of what happened then.  It was this Government which kept the moratorium in place, while at the same time recruiting into the Defence Forces and other parts of the Civil Service and public service.  Could we have an honest referee regarding this?  Could the Minister ask the Garda Inspectorate to carry out an impact analysis of the areas to which I referred?  It is a reasonable request which should be considered.</p></speech>

That legislation will ensure repeat offenders will have difficulty in getting bail and will serve consecutive rather than shorter sentences, which is what is happening at the current time.  The Judiciary will have the legislation in place to allow that to happen, which is extremely important.</p><p>The mobile resources garda&iacute; need, the cars and the vehicles and the numbers, will be there.

It is an independent review mechanism carried out by independent lawyers who are given access to the data they require and to the material submitted by the complainants.

The summary of this recommendation which came to me was overseen by a judge.  I call this independent.  I have accepted the recommendations in all the cases.</p>  <p>  It is not a statutory investigation.  It is not a commission of investigation.  It was never intended to be a commission of investigation.  It is an assessment of complaints, many of which go back 30, 20 and ten years, and some are more recent.  They have been through a variety of assessments by garda&iacute;, the District Court, the Circuit Courts right up to the Supreme Court.  They have examined the papers to see if they can recommend any particular further action to me in my role as Minister which would help the complainants and bring closure for them, because obviously many of these cases involve appalling events for the families concerned.

It is outrageous to call it independent.  There is no opportunity for people to engage and no feedback.  There is no recourse to appeal.  One case was referred by the Taoiseach to the independent review mechanism.  This involved the shooting of a civilian, where the Garda who witnessed it was told to say he was not there.  The person involved has not even been asked about the shooting.  How will the panel make a recommendation if it has not even asked a question?  I do not understand this part.  Initially, the Minister said this would be returned in September 2014 but it has dragged on for another 13 months with bugger all satisfaction.  It does not look as if the Minister has a political appetite for dealing properly with these cases.  The people are bitterly disappointed with how it has been handled.</p></speech>

It would not have been rocket science for people to have gone through them quickly early in the process to pick out the most serious in order that they could have been put before a commission of investigation.  They could even have been included with the examination of the Maurice McCabe issue.  Perhaps it is planned to do that down the road but given that it is almost a year and a half since this was set up, it is difficult to see where the Minister is going with it.  It is difficult to see where people can possibly find any solace at all in how the process has been handled.  Does the Minister have any concept of how disappointed these people are?  It beggars belief how this has been handled.</p></speech>

My response to burglaries and crime generally is focused on two key objectives: strengthening of the law to get tougher on serious and repeat offenders and investing in the capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to enforce that law effectively.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year I called together the heads of all of the criminal justice agencies to devise a new approach to tackle burglaries.  One important factor that emerged was the finding that a large proportion of domestic burglaries are committed by serial offenders.  Figures from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na analysis service indicate that 75% of burglaries are committed by 25% of burglars.  As I noted earlier, that is why I brought forward the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill, which is targeted at repeat burglars with previous convictions.  That will allow for consecutive sentencing where a burglar is being sentenced for multiple offences and allow courts to refuse bail.</p>  <p>  Legislation on its own is not enough and we want proper operational policing responses.  The Deputy asked about figures.  The Garda strategy to counter burglaries and related crimes has been co-ordinated under Operation Fiacla, which has led to 14,672 arrests and 8,358 charges brought to date.  I am providing the Commissioner with the means to enhance this operational response.  I have already spoken about the investment and recruitment, and this will facilitate further operations, including surveillance.  We have also upgraded the surveillance capacity of Garda aircraft.</p><p>Taking all of these together, it will make a substantial difference in terms of what we will see and have seen.  I am working closely with the Garda Commissioner to finalise details of an enhanced operational response to burglaries and related crimes.  I expect to be in a position to make that announcement shortly.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that she has to strengthen the law and that she is taking some measures in respect of that, but they do not go far enough.  My party has submitted proposals regarding, for example, mandatory sentencing for those who assault elderly people or who engage repeatedly in burglary.  A small number of people carry out a large proportion of the burglaries, so there will not be a prison capacity problem.  In regard to the many public meetings taking place throughout the country, what is the Minister's view on a proposal from the meeting in the Anner Hotel in Tipperary to tag people who are on bail and who have multiple convictions, particularly for burglary?  Also arising from such meetings, what is her view on the allegation that free legal aid favours the criminal too much, given the constitutionality of people's right to a fair trial?  Could she also speak about the requirement for closed circuit television cameras on motorway junctions and the proposal for a national directorate to co-ordinate the IFA, which has hired its own crime prevention officer, Muintir na T&iacute;re, the neighbourhood watch schemes, and all the other voluntary organisations?</p></speech>

The president of the Garda Representative Association, speaking on the radio today, clearly linked the closure of 139 Garda stations with the increase in burglaries.  He is in a position to know about this.  Does the Minister accept his assessment that those station closures have impacted on the rise in burglaries or would she contest it?</p></speech>

People have raised the issue of bail.  This is an important area and I am addressing it in one piece of legislation.  I have further legislation coming out.  I will be making changes in that legislation regarding electronic tagging in order that the prosecution and the Garda can request this.  That is an important initiative.</p>  <p>  I would put a fact to the House, that the increases in offences committed by people while out on bail peaked in 2009 and 2010 and have been reducing since.  It is important to have a sense of perspective on it.  I sympathise with every individual who has been the victim of these heinous crimes and I want to interrupt them and ensure the Garda has the resources to deal with it.  That is what we are doing and this is the most effective way to deal with these issues.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding these statistical trends, the impact of these crimes is quite serious and I assure the Deputy that I am in ongoing contact with the Garda Commissioner on a wide range of crime and policing concerns, including knife and other violent crime.  This is a challenging situation for the Garda every day of the week, as we know.</p>  <p>  A comprehensive and robust legal framework is in place with respect to knife crime, including heavy penalties for breaches of the laws concerned.</p><p>Under the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the maximum penalty for possessing a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority has been increased from one to five years.  The Garda also has an extended power of search without warrant in relation to knives and offensive weapons.</p> <p> Deputy Niall Collins will also be aware that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na proactively targets public disorder and anti-social behaviour through the strategic deployment of Garda resources.  The night-time economy is a big issue in the context of the kind of offences that take place late at night.  The detective units and divisional crime task forces are utilised to provide a high-visibility presence.  The CCTV that is available in Garda stations around the country is used to ensure that garda&iacute; are deployed where crowds are gathering and where there is anti-social behaviour late at night.  The increased recruitment will help with that visible policing as well.  This is the way to deal with this issue.</p> <p> Although knife crime is obviously very serious, and can have dreadful consequences in individual cases, it is important to note that the figures are decreasing.</p></speech>

We know, for example, because we discuss burglary so often here, that many burglaries are aggravated burglaries in which a knife is used, and there have been incidents of car-jacking and other types of theft associated with knives.</p>  <p>  The reason I raise it here on Question Time is that there is a subculture in Irish society within a small community of criminals who feel it is acceptable to carry and use knives in the commission of crimes.  What I am asking is whether the Minister thinks we need to send out a more robust message about the carrying of knives in public places, which in many instances unfortunately leads to the commission of a crime resulting in death, and whether we need to have more robust legislation, including, for example, the possibility of a mandatory sentence for the carrying of a knife in a public place.</p></speech>

Of course, there are very serious individual incidents of the kind described by Deputy Collins, for which heavy sentences have been imposed where such cases were brought to court.  At present, the law allows for mandatory sentences where those cases, for example, have resulted in the murder of an individual.  I share Deputy Collins's view about such crime.  There have been strong public information and awareness campaigns over the years.  Indeed, that is something An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na could consider further, because we need to continue to get the message out about the approach to this type of crime, how unacceptable it is, and the dangers of carrying a knife in a public place where persons may use them when provoked.</p>  <p>  Deputy Niall Collins mentioned mandatory sentencing on a number of occasions.  A considerable amount of work has been done on that, both in Ireland and internationally.  As the Deputy will be well aware, the comprehensive review of penal policy which was carried out by an expert group, the independence and expertise of which would be recognised by everyone, did not recommend any further mandatory sentencing.  I note mandatory sentencing is a key part of the Deputy's approach, but all of the evidence that has been presented to me is that it is not an effective way of dealing with crime, except in very limited circumstances which we have provided for already.</p></speech>

As part of the Garda inquiry, a file is currently with the Director of Public Prosecutions following the arrest of a person in October 2014 in connection with the disappearance.  The case has also been the subject of an investigation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission on foot of complaints to that office.  Within the past two weeks further statements have been made to the Garda regarding the case, and these will now be examined by the review team.</p> <p> I am very conscious of the ongoing distress for the families and friends of persons who go missing, and I met with the mother of the missing child in this case at last year's annual national missing persons' day.  I was grateful to have been able to speak with her on that occasion and to hear her moving address to those present as to the lasting impact these events have had on her and her family.  All in this House would wish to ensure that nothing we say adds to the distress the family has experienced.  We recognise that the examination of allegations concerning the disappearance are matters for the relevant investigatory agencies.

The case has been very harrowing and has destroyed the lives of the family involved over the years, particularly Mary Boyle's twin sister, Ann Doherty, who justifiably feels the person she believes is the prime suspect was never interviewed by the investigating garda&iacute;.  There have been allegations of political interference to ensure the person was not considered a suspect.  This is the nature of the statements the family has made in recent weeks.  It raises very serious questions about the conduct of the investigation.  Given that a review has been ongoing since 2011, it is timely that the person who they believe to be prime suspect be questioned by the Garda and treated as a suspect in the case in order to try to achieve some closure for the family.</p></speech>

I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that Operation Mizen was established by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a national co-ordination office to provide appropriate policing responses to maintain public order and to ensure the safety of all involved in protests against water charges.</p><p>In this context, one of the approaches adopted by the Garda authorities involves making use of open source information that is generally and publicly available on the Internet and on social media platforms.  The Deputy probably uses this information when he wishes to locate a convenient water protest at which to appear.  I mean it is open source information that is effectively involved.  Obviously, I fully support the right of people to protest.  I understand that Operation Mizen does not engage in technical surveillance or interception.  This is very important.  I am further informed that no public representative or member of the public is subject to such surveillance by Operation Mizen.</p> <p> The Deputy is aware that the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 provides the legislative basis for the carrying out of covert surveillance in this State.  Under that Act, authorisations for surveillance are granted on application to a judge of the District Court.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I have no role in that process.  The 2009 Act makes provision for independent judicial oversight of its operation by a serving judge of the High Court.  The designated judge is independent in his functions and reports to the Taoiseach.  His reports are made public.  There is also an independent complaints mechanism for individuals who believe they have been the subject of an authorisation under the relevant provisions of the Act.  The complaints referee is a serving Circuit Court judge who may investigate any complaints made.</p></speech>

People understand that this hated austerity burden, which is part of the bailout of bankers and bondholders, is a precursor to commodification and privatisation.  Hundreds of thousands of people have been actively involved in campaigning against this aspect of austerity.  Some 57% of the population boycotted their first bill because it did not have their consent.  Garda&iacute; have flooded into communities to help a billionaire's company and others to ram water meters down people's throats.  It now appears that a special unit of the Garda has been spying on this movement.  That is the reality.  According to media reports, the senior garda heading up this spying operation is the spouse of the Commissioner.  Will the Minister confirm whether that is the case?  The Minister has said that open source information is used.  Can she tell us exactly what this means?  Will she acknowledge that under section 8 of the 2009 Act that she mentioned, a garda can get permission from a senior officer to conduct tracking and so on for four months without having to go to court?  Is that the case?  Are elected representatives the subjects of this activity just as are water charges activists?</p></speech>

I said, "I am happy to confirm for the House that Operation Mizen is not a surveillance programme operated by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, contrary to assertions that have been made recently in commentary on water protests".  I also answered the Deputy's question about whether public representatives are being monitored when I made it absolutely clear that this is not the case.  That was very clear in my answer.  The statutory functions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na include the preservation of peace and public order, the protection of life and property and the vindication of the human rights of individuals.  As we all know, in the context of these functions it has been necessary for the Garda authorities to deploy garda&iacute; routinely at water meter installations and protests.  That is the reality of what has been happening.  We know that when we look at the number of arrests, for example.  The Garda authorities have confirmed that there have been 188 arrests in relation to water protests since November 2014.  It should be noted in that regard that some individuals have been arrested on multiple occasions.  That, and not the way the Deputy characterises this operation, is the reality of the job the garda&iacute; are doing out there.  This is a routine operation in terms of managing protests and ensuring the safety of protestors.</p></speech>

However, I am grateful to the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for facilitating the safe and orderly conduct of many large protests in cities and towns throughout the State and for the other work they have done, often in extremely difficult circumstances, as we have seen in many video clips on various social media.  I am very grateful to the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the way they have done this work in recent months and the way they have carried out their functions.

Most international groups agree that the decriminalisation model is the only one that actually protects sex workers.  Sadly, however, this Government has decided to push ahead with an agenda which will push the industry further underground, making it even less safe for the people involved.  We are dealing with a decision that affects the human rights of vulnerable groups and I ask the Minister if she has undertaken any research into alternative legal models, such as the one in New Zealand.</p></reply>

The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 is currently before the Seanad and will be coming before this House in due course, when I have no doubt that we will have a full opportunity to debate this issue.  Clearly, there are different views on the management and handling of these issues and we will have an opportunity to discuss them.  I do not want to prejudge the debate but I am sure it will be an interesting one.  The debate has already started in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p>  <p>  The proposals in the legislation have been developed following extensive consultation, initiated by my Department, dating back to 2012.  The new offences implement the recommendation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence which called for the introduction of an offence criminalising the purchase of sexual services.  The purpose of introducing these provisions is primarily to target the trafficking, which is very extensive, and sexual exploitation of persons through prostitution.  There is a very strong association between the trafficking of young women and girls into this country and prostitution and this legislation is targeting that situation.  </p>  <p>  I have considered all sides of the debate and my Department has examined the research.  We have engaged in extensive consultation and there is very successful implementation and research to prove it.  I have met people who have been involved in the implementation of similar legislation in Sweden.  I have also met the rapporteur who completed an extensive report on the issue in Sweden.  She visited Ireland recently and addressed a seminar on the matter.  Both the Council of Europe and the European Parliament have made recommendations in this regard too.  On the basis of that research I have decided that this legislation is the way to go forward.  We need to combat trafficking and its drivers, as I am sure Deputy Wallace will agree.  There is a lot of evidence of wider exploitation of persons involved in prostitution, outside of those trafficked, such as those coerced or otherwise forced through circumstances, to engage in it.  </p>  <p>  I accept the point the Deputy makes about the vulnerability of sex workers which is why I have increased the funding for organisations working directly with them.</p><p>Interestingly, these organisations also recommended this type of legislation.  For example, Ruhama, the group which has done most of the work in this area, recommended and strongly supports the actions I am taking in the Bill.  I agree with the Deputy on the issue of vulnerability and the need for additional action and work to support women who wish to exit prostitution.</p></speech>

Did she speak to sex workers?  It is important she does so because I understand they were not properly consulted.  If she insists on proceeding with the legislation, I implore her to ensure it is based on proper research.  I do not believe proper research has been done in this jurisdiction.  Research done in Belfast found that sex workers did not believe that the criminalisation of the purchase of sex would do them any favours in any circumstances.  This legislation needs to be carefully considered before it proceeds.</p></speech>

I also examined all the research on this issue.  The Council of Europe and European Parliament, for example, did a large amount of research and the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality examined and made recommendations on the matter.  While I accept that there are different views and reports on the issue, I have outlined the reasons I have taken my decision.  The Assembly in the North introduced similar legislation which was supported by a large majority.  This is the right direction in which to move in terms of an all-island response.</p></speech>

The only conclusion to be drawn about this process is that it is possibly a deliberate attempt to deflect public anger surrounding issues of Garda malpractice rather than an effort to address the issues.  The process was supposed to be a short-term paper review to recommend what action should be taken next rather than an end in itself.  No serious action has been suggested in any of the 200 cases reviewed to date.  Will the position change in respect of the remaining 100 cases on which there have not been communications?</p></reply>

I do not know how she could possibly make that assumption as she does not have all the facts.  It is open to the group to make a recommendation, the seriousness of which will be judged in the first instance by the complainants who submitted the information.  As I stated, in more than 200 cases, the complainants submitted extra information.</p>  <p>  The recommendations are, in the assessment of the independent panel, a potential way forward for dealing with the cases in a more satisfactory manner, dealing with unanswered questions or making recommendations for further investigations, including very serious investigations under section 41(2) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act.  I consider such recommendations to be serious.  I have not yet published the outcome in all the cases because the process is not complete.  Inevitably, the group assessing the cases will make a variety of recommendations.  It was always intended to assess all the information and see what recommendations would emerge.</p>  <p>  The process has taken longer than anticipated because we accepted more than 300 cases and, as I indicated, they are highly varied.  Some of them date back 30 years, some are more recent, others have been through the courts and decisions have been the subject of decisions in the courts, while others arise from decisions made by the Director of Public Prosecution and Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  There is, therefore, significant complexity involved.  I am accepting the recommendation in all cases where there is scope for a recommendation to be made to me that would help deal more effectively with the complainant's circumstances.</p></speech>

My point about no serious recommendations being made must be seen in the context of the decision by the review panel to recommend that the Garda make a report on serious complaints about malpractice in the Garda.  After 18 months, the panel recommended not that the case be re-investigated but that the Garda issue a report.  I have in mind cases such as the murder of Baiba Saulite, the anniversary of which will take place next month.  One of the garda&iacute; involved in the complaint made repeated requests to the review mechanism seeking to furnish it with corroborative evidence to support his contention that this young woman and mother would not have been murdered if the Garda had acted appropriately and joined the dots in the previous crimes committed against Ms Saulite and her solicitor, Mr. John Hennessy.  Serious and well-substantiated allegations were made, yet the panel did not even ask to see this corroborative evidence.  How could this possibly be a serious investigation to have something done?</p></speech>

The Secretary of State has spoken to the British Parliament about the report which deals with the structure, roles and purpose of paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland.  Its conclusions are of concern.  It concludes that all of the main paramilitary groups remain in existence, including the UVF, the UDA, the Red Hand Commando and the Provisional IRA.  It states, &quot;Seventeen years after the 1998 Belfast Agreement, paramilitary groups remain a feature of life&quot; in Northern Ireland and &quot;all of the paramilitary groups maintain a relatively public profile in spite of being illegal organisations&quot;.  These groups have &quot;leadership structures and subgroups across Northern Ireland&quot; and are organised along militaristic lines, using labels such as &quot;brigade&quot; and &quot;army council&quot;.  The report further states:</p><blockquote>Members of these paramilitary groups continue to engage in violent activity, both directed by local leadership and conducted without sanction.  Violence and intimidation are used to exercise control at community level.</blockquote><p>It states that members of all groups have carried out murders since 1998 and it is further stated that members are involved in other serious criminal activities, which harms communities and damages the financial prosperity and reputation of Northern Ireland.  The report goes on to say that this includes large-scale smuggling operations, fuel laundering, drug dealing and extortion of local businesses.  It also says, very worryingly, that some weapons have not been decommissioned and that all groups have retained capacity in relation to weaponry.  While the report points out a number of positives in the work of the leaders of these various paramilitary groups, it states that despite these positives, "we judge that individual members of paramilitary groups with a legacy of violent activity still represent a threat to national security, are engaged in organised crime and undermine Northern Ireland's post-conflict transformation".  The report says that the structures of the Provisional IRA remain in existence, albeit in a much-reduced form.  It includes a senior leadership, the provisional army council, which has an overarching strategy.</p> <p> I put it to the Taoiseach that both Governments have taken their eyes off the ball with regard to comprehensively resourcing their intelligence capacity, particularly on the Garda side, and in terms of what has been going in on organised crime and racketeering.  Will a comprehensive, well-resourced joint agency be established at British-Irish Government level to focus on organised crime, particularly by members of paramilitary groups, including fuel laundering and other criminal activities?  Quite some months ago, the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly called for such a joint agency to be established on foot of the assembly's report.  Will the Taoiseach work with the British Government to re-establish the International Monitoring Commission, given the conclusions of the report under discussion that the PSNI does not have the same level of intelligence that it once had and, as such, there is now a need for such a body to be reinstated?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-20a.139" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000018#Q00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for his comments.  It is important to note that the report states at the end:</p><blockquote>We judge that the other paramilitary groups on ceasefire will continue to exist and that they will continue to pose a threat to national security and engage in serious crime ... [W]e believe that the level of intelligence coverage is proportionate to the threat posed by these groups.  We are confident in our judgements and that these accurately reflect the best intelligence available to us.</blockquote><p>The report was commissioned by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on paramilitary groups following the comments made by the Chief Constable of the PSNI.  It was also commissioned following the recent horrific murders in Belfast and the very significant fallout for the political institutions that arose from them.  Governments here, in Northern Ireland and in Britain will examine the assessment very closely.  It clearly raises matters of very serious concern.  There are issues with regard to the existence of illegal organisations and command structures, access to weaponry and widespread criminality.  These things have no place and can have no place in our democracy.  They never did.  The future of the peace process depends on their being removed from life on this island once and for all.  I acknowledge that we have come a long way over the last 15 to 20 years along the road of peaceful resolution of differences.  Everybody can understand that.  We need to complete that process.  I made the Government's position very clear when I spoke in Cambridge some time ago on the matter; 21 years after the IRA's ceasefire, it should no longer carry any capacity for threat.  Statements to the effect that the IRA has gone away or left the stage are simply not credible.  There may have been a time when living with constructive ambiguity helped the peace process, but that time has now passed.  Paramilitarism in all its vestiges must be removed.  I addressed those issues in Cambridge.  I repeat in the House today that after 21 years of the IRA ceasefire and ten years after decommissioning and the IRA announcement, it is past the time when it should carry any capacity for threat.</p><p>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI will continue to work closely together to combat criminality in all its forms on both sides of the Border.  For the information of the House, the Minister for Justice and Equality will publish today the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assessment of paramilitary activities in so far as this jurisdiction is concerned in order that there is a full picture of the respective assessments of the law enforcement agencies on the island.  For his part, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will continue to engage with all parties in Northern Ireland to address these issues.  I note, with regard to what Deputy Martin said, that the issue of dealing with criminality, including criminality as a result of the legacy of paramilitarism, is one that the State takes very seriously.  I note that 134 filling stations have been closed in respect of fuel laundering.  Tobacco smuggling and other issues are a serious priority for the Garda and law and order activities here.</p><p>For the information of the House, the DUP has confirmed that its Ministers will be reappointed next Tuesday and that they intend to go back to the talks.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has made it clear that the place to deal with these issues now is these talks, if we are serious about having the institutions work.  For normal politics to apply, one cannot have situations such as those I mentioned.  The place to deal with these is around the table where all parties are involved.  I hope the talks can be very clear, straightforward and frank, and that they will deal with the issues I addressed in Cambridge and that are referred to in the report from the PSNI to the three-person body and in the report to be published later this evening by the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p></speech>

The report is very clear that members of these paramilitary groups - the UVF, UDA, Provisional IRA and others - continue to engage in violent activity directed by local leadership and conducted without sanction.  Violence and intimidation are used to exercise control at a community level.  We know this because after the murder of Paul Quinn, not one person came forward.  After the murder of Robert McCartney, no one came forward despite the presence of so many people in a public house.  Why is that?  It is because control is exercised in a very brutal way.  That is not acceptable 17 years after the Good Friday Agreement, and something needs to change.  I put it to the Taoiseach that the Provisional IRA army council still exists despite all the denials we have had.  The investigation into the murder of Kevin McGuigan is ongoing, but it is judged that the assessment put forward by the chief constable in his public statement on 22 August remains accurate.  It also says that all of the groups have committed murders since 1998.  As we know, no one came forward and no one was prosecuted or convicted.</p>  <p>  There is a problem here, and both Governments, particularly ours, took their eyes off the ball.  I am told that in the last three to four years the intelligence capacity of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with regard to what is going on along the Border and cross-Border area is not as strong as it should be.  It is under-resourced and not up to speed.  There is a sense that these groups have been allowed to act with impunity.  There are individuals ruling the roost in these areas on a continuing basis and there is a well-established organised criminal network involving individual members of paramilitary groups.  There is a twilight zone there that we cannot get at.  People might not like my saying that, and they may nod their heads, but that is the reality and it is what the report is saying.  I put it to the Taoiseach that a joint body, as recommended by the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly some time ago, is needed.  That body said more determined action was required North and South of the Border to eliminate the activities of organised crime gangs involved in cross-Border illicit trading, including the establishment of a permanent full-time multidisciplinary task force.  Our own parliamentarians from Britain and Ireland are saying that something of that order is required.  Will the Taoiseach agree to doing that?  Deputy Brendan Smith has published a fuel laundering Bill and is calling for such legislation.  Will the Taoiseach give consideration to that at a later stage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-20a.141" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000019#R00100"><p>First of all, there is an extensive degree of co-operation between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI in regard to smuggling and criminal cross-Border activities.  For instance, there are two cross-Border joint task forces at the moment between the PSNI and the Garda.  The cross-Border tobacco enforcement group includes representatives from the Revenue Commissioners, CAB, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the UK's HM Revenue and Customs, HMRC, and the National Crime Agency.  Obviously, co-operation also takes place with other revenue administrations, such as the European Anti-Fraud Office, or OLAF, as it is called.  Changes were made to the Finance Bills here in 2012 and 2013.  For instance, in February of this year, a joint operation was carried out with HMRC in which 14 premises on both sides of the Border were searched.  It resulted in a total seizure from both jurisdictions of almost 2.5 million cigarettes, 12 tonnes of tobacco and a manufacturing plant, and the arrest of five individuals.  There have been 99 individuals up before CAB, with over &euro;28 million taken from persons in that regard before the Special Criminal Court.</p>  <p>  I would also mention that the extent of smuggling and fuel laundering is an issue that has been very much to the fore for the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda and the PSNI.  One hundred and thirty-four filling stations have been closed.</p>  <p>  To answer Deputy Martin's question, I am not opposed to it, but I think we should wait for the publication of the report from the Garda by the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the PSNI should speak.  We should examine in the talks in Belfast the two cross-Border anti-fraud, anti-smuggling, anti-criminal joint task forces that are there at the moment, and if I deemed it necessary or it was deemed appropriate that we should have a further joint operation, then I would not be opposed to it, but what we do need to say very clearly is that the rule of law has to apply, and what has happened, as Deputy Martin well knows, is that the legacy of the Provisional IRA has poisoned society in many cases along the Border.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-20a.142" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1066" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000019#R00200"><p>Society in the North has been on a journey from conflict to peace, and it is the responsibility of all political leaders to help to complete that journey.  It is clearly not a task for a hurler on the ditch like the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il.  I wish he would do everyone a service and for once engage positively on the North and the necessary process across this island.</p>  <p>  Today, I attended the funerals of Willie Lynch and Tara Gilbert, of their children, Kelsey and Jodie, and their unborn baby, and of Jimmy Lynch, all victims of a fire that killed ten citizens in the Travellers' halting site in Carrickmines.  There were widespread expressions of sympathy after that, which provided some hope that the treatment of Travellers, not just in terms of housing, could begin being addressed in a serious way.  Unfortunately, that hope was dented by the familiar negative attitudes as attempts were made to rehouse the families of the Carrickmines victims.</p>  <p>  This underlines the need for a fundamental review of the treatment of Travellers and their community in Irish society, which should be Government-led.  In the past seven years, funding for Traveller accommodation has been cut by 93%.  Some 1,536 families are in overcrowded or unsafe conditions.  Many Travellers have no access to basic facilities such as sanitation, water and electricity.  They fare badly on all key indicators of disadvantage, including unemployment, poverty, health, infant mortality, life expectancy and education.  At the root of all of this are the prejudice, discrimination and social exclusion experienced by these citizens.  Public representatives of political parties in this Chamber have campaigned against the housing of Traveller families in their constituencies.</p>  <p>  I have raised this matter with the Taoiseach a number of times.  Will he consider establishing a genuinely island-wide forum at a State level with a Northern appendix as a matter of great urgency, involving Travellers, political parties, the Government, local authorities, the health and education sectors and media organisations, which would make recommendations on how this major issue of inequality could be tackled and addressed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-20a.143" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000019#R00300"><p>First of all, our sympathies go to the families again.  The national flag flies at half mast on all public buildings today as a mark of sympathy and solidarity with the families that have lost their loved ones, all ten adults, children and an unborn baby.  Clearly, the issue of Traveller accommodation has been very much to the fore.  An audit is now being carried out of all Traveller halting sites throughout the country.  Deputy Adams will be aware that accommodation is provided for Travellers through a range of measures, including the standard local authority housing financed by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government; Traveller-specific accommodation initiated by the Department; private housing assisted by the State, including local authorities and voluntary organisations; and Travellers' own resources.</p>  <p>  The 2014 annual count of Traveller families showed that, of the 10,226 families that were accounted for here, the majority, 35%, were accommodated in standard social housing, 26% were in private rented accommodation, 5% were in assisted private housing, and 6% were housed under their own resources.  Thirteen percent were in group housing, 9% were in shared accommodation, just 1% were in transient sites, and 4% were in unauthorised sites.  Clearly, accommodation is an issue.  I find, having dealt with this over the years, that where communities are engaged with and have the situation explained to them, be it an emergency or not, generally - although not in all cases by any means - there is a willingness to work with local authorities.</p>  <p>  Deputy Adams is aware that the Government will provide funding for Traveller accommodation, but it is best delivered through the local authorities, where the local representatives know the local people and engage with Traveller families that may be accustomed to or have lived in a locality for quite a long time.</p>  <p>  As to the point that the Deputy raises about the cross-Border issue, I do not think it is necessary to set up a new forum here.  Both sides of the North-South forum - the ministerial forum - could actually have fed their views to the Traveller accommodation personnel, who would prepare a report on that.  Maybe Deputy Mac Lochlainn does not agree.  I am not sure that having another separate administrative operation is the way to go here.  We have a system that does address a whole range of problems.  I do not see why the Cena group or the Traveller accommodation groups down here could not work with their counterparts and feed in their views through the various Ministers for local government, the environment or whatever.  Perhaps at the next meeting we might have an item on the agenda dealing with this to see how it might proceed.</p>  <p>  I take the point about inequality and the treatment of individuals who happen to be Travellers, along with other groups that might be deemed to be fringe groups also.  It is a serious challenge.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-20a.144" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1066" speakername="Gerry Adams" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000019#R00400"><p>With respect, the Taoiseach does not take my point about inequality.  These people are treated in a shameful way.  Babies on the side of the road, no toilet facilities, no water, no beds, no prospects and no hope.  That is how they are treated.  It is good that the flag is flying at half mast, but this week the Connors family will bury loved ones: Thomas, Sylvia and their children Jim, Christy and Mary.  There is nowhere to live.  The masses will be on Thursday, the burials will be on Friday and the families will still be homeless.  That is our responsibility.</p>  <p>  On other issues in the past, the Taoiseach has shown leadership.  He stood up and said that this was what we needed to do.  Our society can be defined by the treatment of these citizens.  The talks with the residents of Rockville Drive continue without resolution ten days later.  It is time for an intervention.  These families will only start to pick up the pieces when the funerals are finished, yet they still have nowhere to go to try to heal, mourn their loved ones and rebuild their lives.</p>  <p>  I am suggesting a forum in this State, as there is none.  I suggest that it be an all-Ireland forum, because at least some Travellers are nomadic.  In the North, they have the status of an ethnic minority.  In England, Scotland and Wales, they have the same status, but not here.  I am not suggesting that this would be a cure for all of the problems, but the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality made a number of recommendations that still have not been acted upon 18 months later.  I ask the Taoiseach to intervene and act on this issue.</p><p>I will return to what I was suggesting, namely, the bringing together of whomever the Taoiseach believes is appropriate.  I have just made suggestions.  The consultation must clearly involve the Travellers themselves, along with all the other responsible agencies and the Government, to deal with what the Taoiseach said was an issue of inequality.  Some good can come out of these ten dreadful deaths, but only if the Government acts.</p></speech>

The carrying out of a national audit will bring its own revelations, I would expect.</p>  <p>  A new housing approval body, Cena, has been set up and is to be in operation shortly.  Every local authority has a five-year rolling programme in terms of what it proposes to do about Traveller accommodation, be it through the provision of social housing, private rented housing or halting sites.  There are local Traveller accommodation consultative committees in every local authority area.  They comprise people elected by the people to discuss the question of Traveller accommodation, education, social services, etc.  They assist in the preparation of the five-year programmes that are to be set out and implemented by every local authority.  The National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee is in place.  Its members are appointed by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government under the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998.  It has an independent chairman and comprises representatives from the various Departments and the County and City Management Association, and it is the national platform for Traveller accommodation consultation.  It supports the local Traveller accommodation committees, it commissions relevant research on Traveller issues, such as those raised by the Deputy, and it provides an advisory role regarding national policy and strategy issues.</p>  <p>  With regard to the unfortunate tragedy that occurred in Carrickmines, the programme to review fire safety and Traveller accommodation is always of particular importance.  Some authorities have held initial meetings about the plan to prepare for the review or to take appropriate action to improve the position in halting sites or other forms of Traveller accommodation.  That is not yet finalised.</p>  <p>  There is a national body but the point is that while it is all very well to talk in here, it is the making of decisions that will allow for Traveller accommodation to be provided that meets resistance.  I would have believed that, following this horrific tragedy in Carrickmines, the local authority wanting to put in place temporary accommodation for a six-month period in a location close to where the temporary halting site has been in place for eight years would have been acceptable under the conditions set out.  I regret that has not happened.  There are probably still discussions ongoing between the local authority and the people living there.  I assure the Deputy that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, devoted considerable time to trying to achieve closure on this in the hope that the matter might have been sorted out before the funerals.  Unfortunately, it has not been.  Therefore, it is a question of being able to make decisions that will allow for appropriate accommodation and the provision of all the necessary facilities for Traveller people.  After all, they are of the same nationality as ourselves.</p></speech>

Yesterday, I asked An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate, under section 19 of the Criminal Justice Act, why NAMA did not report the discovery that US investment fund PIMCO had been requested to pay &pound;5 million to a former member of the NAMA Northern Ireland Advisory Committee, Mr. Frank Cushnahan.  Despite this, NAMA told the Committee of Public Accounts on 9 July that if PIMCO did not withdraw, NAMA could not permit it to remain in the sales process, yet it refused to report the matter to the relevant authorities.</p>  <p>  For the life of me, I do not understand how the Government can still be comfortable with the idea of NAMA selling Project Arrow to Cerberus.  Cerberus is under criminal investigation in the United Kingdom and United States.  When I queried NAMA on this issue last week, Mr. Frank Daly replied to me, "I am not aware that Cerberus is under criminal investigation in any jurisdiction".  The same Mr. Daly admitted to the Committee of Public Accounts in July that the purchase of Project Eagle was being investigated but now he is not aware that the actual purchaser, Cerberus, is being investigated.  Is it not little wonder that the people have serious questions about NAMA?  They would like the Taoiseach to initiate a commission of inquiry.</p>  <p>  Aside from the investigation by the National Crime Agency in the United Kingdom, in the United States the Department of Justice is investigating the role of American companies in the Project Eagle transactions.  The investigation involves the Attorney General's office in New York, the New York office of the FBI and the US Securities and Exchange Commission, yet NAMA believes Cerberus is not being investigated.</p></speech>

A serious amount of assets, over half of which are residential, are in the Republic.  God knows, we could do with them to address the housing crisis.  They will be sold for a fraction of what it will cost NAMA to build units.  The agency is saying it will cost &euro;225,000 to build each of the 20,000 units.

NAMA has appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts on several occasions.  The matter has been discussed on at least three occasions.  The Deputy himself was invited to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts and, for his own reasons, has refused to do so.  I have said to him before that I acknowledge he is properly elected to the D&aacute;il and has the rights and privileges that go with that but he should go before the Committee of Public Accounts.  He was invited to do so by the Chairman, Deputy John McGuinness.  If Deputy Wallace has further information, or other information, the committee is the place for him to give it.  It is through the Committee of Public Accounts that NAMA is responsible to the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  The question of the American company that withdrew was made clear.  The Deputy said on the last occasion that I was involved in a cover-up myself over this.  He now tells me that I am a friend of Mr. Daly.  He makes these allegations without any foundation or backup.  If he has something to say, I advise him to say it to the Committee of Public Accounts, which is the duly elected and appointed body in which to do such business in here.</p></speech>

I have gone to the Garda, I have been interviewed by the National Crime Agency and I have offered to go to New York.  I do not actually believe the Taoiseach could possibly try to make out that the Committee of Public Accounts has more teeth than those three organisations.

When I asked NAMA about this, Mr. Frank Daly replied, "Our advice is that such fee payments are not illegal".  Could the Taoiseach confirm for me who NAMA received the advice from?  Did that advice cover the laws of the United States and the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland?  If NAMA was so sure this was not illegal, why did its board decide that if PIMCO, one of the largest investment funds in the world, did not withdraw from the process, NAMA would force it out?  How could it possibly have decided this if everything was rosy in the garden?  Can the Taoiseach explain that to me?</p></speech>

It provides leadership and strategic direction in fulfilling the Department's broad range of business and corporate responsibilities.</p>  <p>  In addition to supporting the constitutional functions of the Taoiseach and the Government and assisting the Chief Whip and three other Ministers of State, the Department of the Taoiseach is heavily involved in the formulation and implementation of Government policy across the full range of domestic, EU and international agendas.</p>  <p>  For example, in 2014, the Department dealt with 58 Government meetings involving 952 Government memoranda, 76 Cabinet committee meetings, 20,000 pieces of correspondence, 805 parliamentary questions and 173 freedom of information requests.  It also provided support for speeches, 220 functions, 190 meetings, 25 overseas trips and more than 100 press events attended by me.</p>  <p>  The Department's MAC comprises senior managers in the Department at Secretary General and assistant secretary level as well as the Department's head of corporate services and personnel officer.  The minutes of the Department's MAC are circulated to all staff and also published quarterly on the Department's website.  There is also regular and ongoing interaction on management issues between me, the Ministers of State in the Department and the senior management team, including through the Cabinet committee structure and other forums.</p>  <p>  Following the publication of the Civil Service renewal plan in 2014, the Civil Service Management Board was established.  The board is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach and comprises all Secretaries General and heads of major offices.  It is overseeing implementation across the Civil Service of all the actions in the renewal plan.  The board meets monthly and the minutes of its meetings are available on the website of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has responsibility for Civil Service renewal.  Last July, he published a report setting out progress achieved on Civil Service renewal in the first 200 days, including in the following priority areas.  First, the accountability board has been established to bring together Civil Service, ministerial and external perspectives on Civil Service performance.  It held its first meeting in July and will meet again in November.  Second, a performance review process for Secretaries General has been approved and will be introduced for the next performance year, 2016.  Third, options to strengthen the disciplinary code have been identified and a revised code developed, which is currently subject to the normal staff consultation process.  Fourth, open recruitment campaigns have been held across most Civil Service grades.  Fifth, the first Civil Service-wide staff engagement survey, involving more than 38,000 employees, commenced in September to get staff input and to provide a benchmark to measure and compare different Departments.</p>  <p>  Work is continuing on delivery of all the actions in the three-year plan with the focus for the next 200 days on the priority areas of strengthening the performance management process for all grades; implementation of a new programme of organisational capability reviews to review the capacity and capability of each Department; publicly recognising staff excellence and innovation, including holding the first Civil Service excellence and innovation awards event later this year; expanding career and mobility opportunities across the Civil Service; improving the delivery of shared whole-of-government projects; strengthening Civil Service communications; and the roll-out of a common corporate governance standard for all Departments and offices.</p>  <p>  As part of the Civil Service renewal plan, a draft corporate governance standard for Departments has been developed and published for consultation.  Once finalised and agreed by Government, this will require each Department to produce a governance framework setting out the Department's standards of conduct, values and principles of good governance by which it operates.  The governance framework will also formally document the role of the management board in Departments.</p></reply>

I believe the opposite is the reality.  Ireland's civil servants rank highly in international terms and, generally speaking, they show great dedication and commitment to public service and to their country.  There is a need for ongoing reform but the programme announced last year by the Taoiseach will not, as he said, transform the Civil Service.  It will implement many important improvements, just as many other programmes have done.</p>  <p>  The Civil Service Management Board has announced that it will publish a code of practice for special advisers and one element of that is supposed to be a cooling-off period following departure from political service.  Will the Taoiseach explain if he is happy with the idea that political special advisers are now eligible to be appointed to permanent senior Civil Service jobs?  We have just seen the situation arise where a person who served as a political adviser in this Government up to the middle of last year, and before that for nine years worked directly in a political party, has been appointed as an assistant secretary, a permanent post carrying a starting salary of &euro;120,000 per annum.  Is the Taoiseach happy with that?  Is he comfortable with the idea that, notwithstanding the code of practice the management board is coming up with, someone can go from a senior political job to a senior Civil Service job while the Government he served is still in office?</p>  <p>  In addition to that, in the programme for Government there is a commitment to introduce a reformed incentive system for all grades in all Departments to reward cross-departmental teams that deliver audited improvements in service delivery and cost-effectiveness.  Most disability groups will confirm that is not working and that commitment has not been delivered upon.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would also say whether all delegation orders to spell out functions of Ministers are in order?</p>  <p>  Is it acceptable or reforming that minutes are still not being taken at meetings the Taoiseach and other members of Government attend?  When the Minister, Deputy Kelly, met former Vice President, Dan Quayle, president of Cerberus, no minutes were taken then either, because we asked for them.  There are other incidents which I deal with in Questions Nos. 3 and 4.</p></speech>

I will have that checked for Deputy Martin.</p><p>If there is a particular one that Deputy Martin has information about or that is of concern to him, I would be happy to have it checked as a priority.</p> <p> I understand that the person who had worked in a political capacity went away and worked abroad for a period.  The person then applied in the normal way for a position in the public service and came through the process for appointment.  The public appointments process is rigid and robust.  Choices are made following interviews conducted individually with people who apply.</p> <p> I am unsure whether Deputy Martin has read the last report from July of this year.  The report sets out the progress achieved in the first 200 days in implementing the Civil Service renewal plan.</p></speech>

In this sense the plan is something akin to the Action Plan for Jobs, whereby actions are time-lined and reported and all of these matters are published on the website of either the Department of the Taoiseach or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which has responsibility in this area.  The measures cover the range of Departments, with persons at senior level sponsoring and seeing that these actions are actually applied.</p>  <p>  Deputy Martin asked about the minutes taken by Departments.  These come through in memoranda for Government and are recorded as formal minutes.  The minutes of these management advisory committee meetings are published on a quarterly basis and are on the website of the Department for everyone to read.  I am unsure whether that deals with Deputy Martin's question.  I will check the question about delegation orders which Deputy Martin raised and come back to him on it.</p></speech>

The minutes of the board are available on the website of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, but I can only find records up until May.  Were any meetings held after May?  If so, when can we expect the minutes of these meetings to be posted?</p><p>The Taoiseach made the point that this Civil Service management board has a key role in the Civil Service renewal plan and in the reform under way.  The nub of this is contained in an earlier response from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, when he stated:</p><blockquote>Public Service Reform is a key element of the Government's overall strategy for recovery.  Led by my Department, the reforms delivered over the past four years have enabled us to maintain and improve public services in the face of the necessary reduction in staff numbers and budgets, at a time of increased demand for public services.</blockquote><p>That is the nub.  I agree that the public service - the Civil Service, in particular - is generally speaking a good service and that the people who work in it do their very best.  However, the Government's austerity programme has reduced staff numbers, cut budgets and cut the funding for public services significantly.  Is that not at the nub of some of the difficulties?</p><p>We have some of the highest rates of low pay in the developed world.  To put it better, we have some of the lowest rates of pay in the developed world in this State.  Given that the Government is the largest employer in the State, has the Taoiseach considered introducing a living wage of &euro;11.45 throughout the Civil Service?  Would that not increase morale and ensure greater productivity by civil servants?</p></speech>

While not every expectation could be met, the Government has, within the resources available to it, tried to prioritise the areas involved in this case.</p>  <p>  One of the first decisions made by the Government was to reverse the cut in the minimum wage, which brought another 300,000 back into that.  We followed that with the setting up of the Low Pay Commission.  This was the responsibility of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Nash.  There was a reason for this.  Previously, we had a haphazard and uncertain system of determining wage increases for lower paid workers.  The Low Pay Commission did a good job in pointing out the critical points where consideration should be given for an increase in wages.  When the commission was launched earlier this year by myself, the T&aacute;naiste, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, we said that when it reported the Government would respond through the budget.  That has happened.  By way of balance we know that, for example, when lower paid workers reach the level of &euro;352 per week, they would be worse off getting an increase to the minimum wage unless they received an adjustment in PRSI.  Clearly, in that regard we need a balance for employers in order that the burden does not fall unduly on the employer and we responded to that in the budget.  I would like to think that the best opportunity to deal with lower wages and increase a person's potential is to have upskilling, retraining and a better job.  The living wage is something that I accept in principle, of course.  However, I would like to think that we could give greater opportunity to those who work and demonstrate that work actually pays - for them that is the way it should be.</p>  <p>  Some points may be of interest to Deputy Adams.  In the first 200 days of the plan a number of things have changed across the Civil Service.  Open recruitment campaigns were held for principal officer, assistant principal officer, administrative officer, executive officer and clerical officer grades in the Civil Service.  They have built on existing arrangements.  Options to strengthen the disciplinary code were identified and a revised code was drafted as a consequence.  A total of 11 town hall events were held throughout the country, including in Dublin, Wexford, Kilkenny, Galway, Sligo, Cork and Athlone.  Events for Dundalk and Limerick are scheduled.  The primary purpose of the meetings held, and to be held, is to take observations and suggestions from members of the Civil Service and build confidence and trust.  These events facilitate regional input into the Civil Service renewal plan and allow staff an opportunity to network outside their normal office space.  A panel consisting of senior civil servants facilitated discussions with audience questions.  The issues raised included mobility within the Civil Service, open recruitment, learning and development and where opportunities exist for self-betterment.  The first mobility policy for senior managers at principal officer level was agreed and the first moves are expected shortly.  This builds on the existing mobility programme at assistant secretary level.  A chief human resources officer was appointed.  A total of 13 open policy debates have been held to date.  These have involved policy networks, practitioners, academics and experts in a range of policy areas.  The topics covered include education reform, national risk assessment, a labour market symposium and future investment in early years education.</p>  <p>  A Civil Service customer satisfaction survey was completed by 2,000 people and published in May 2015.  The survey results highlighted strong and stable satisfaction levels.  The first Civil Service engagement survey involved 38,000 people.  A proposed model for learning and development to improve capability through enhanced procurement and shared delivery of training throughout the Civil Service was agreed.  The Civil Service excellence in innovation awards is a new annual event to recognise staff excellence and innovation in the Civil Service.  As Deputy Martin pointed out, the reputation of our Civil Service is exceptionally high.</p>  <p>  A common corporate governance standard for all Departments has been developed for the first time.  This will be finalised following public consultation.  The approach for a new programme for organisational capability to review capacity and capability has been agreed in respect of every Department.  An information and communications technology strategy to deliver more online services and better outcomes in efficiency through innovation and excellence in ICT was published in the first quarter of this year and implementation is under way.  An enhanced performance review process for assistant secretaries has been developed and is being piloted by four Departments in quarter 3 of 2015.  That is progress and represents active engagement from the Civil Service in respect of how things might be improved with a view to services being provided more efficiently and so on.</p></speech>

Minutes are taken of meetings held in my Department where judged appropriate.  For example, records are kept of all decisions taken at Government meetings on the basis of memoranda submitted by Ministers.  Records are kept of all Cabinet committee meetings and circulated to relevant Ministers and a note is normally taken of meetings I have in the Department with delegations or interest groups.</p>  <p>  My Department has a designated member of staff who is responsible for managing the Department&rsquo;s records and a designated certifying officer who is responsible for compliance with the National Archives Act 1986.  National Archives staff assist with work relating to the annual transfer of Departmental records to the National Archives.  These staff maintain a central registry record-keeping system, comprising a registry file tracking system and a central repository for the storage of departmental records.  The location of files in the Department is monitored from the time of their creation until they are transferred to the National Archives for permanent preservation.  In-house workshops on the creation and maintenance of records have been provided for staff by relevant officials from the Department and the National Archives.</p>  <p>  The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has been established to give guidance and leadership in the development of an ICT and record management strategy across the Civil Service.  My Department will actively engage with this work.  This Government has also introduced a range of legislative reforms to increase transparency, including a restoration and enhancement of the freedom of information legislation, a new protected disclosures regime and ground-breaking legislation to regulate lobbying.</p>  <p>  Members will be aware of the move from a 30-year to a 20-year release of records.  The British Government did this and, clearly, one does want to see a situation whereby papers relevant to one Government in respect of, for instance, Northern Ireland would be released many years earlier than would normally follow here.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, is examining the issue and the Government has given its approval to move to that system.</p></reply>

It would seem to suggest that there is wriggle room for him and others to decide the taking of minutes may not be appropriate.</p>  <p>  In his constant drive to avoid being accountable, the Taoiseach has, of course, refused to answer detailed questions in the House about his role in the departure of the former Garda Commissioner.  Central to the evidence heard by Mr. Justice Fennelly is that not only did he not keep minutes of his discussions, he did not even record a decision, in particular a crucial meeting at which the Taoiseach was present along with the Secretary General of his Department, the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Attorney General.  A serious decision was taken at that meeting to send the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality to the Commissioner's house with a message that the Taoiseach may not have confidence in him the following morning.  The judge is absolutely scathing of the fact that there is no record or minutes of the meeting or of the decision taken.  No one took minutes of the discussions.  I suggest that is how one can end up with the situation whereby the majority of those present at the meeting end up disagreeing with the Taoiseach's evidence.  One person went as far as to describe the Taoiseach's story as a fantasy.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach's failure to keep a single record of what he admits were a gravely serious set of meetings goes 100% against the statement he has just made and he has repeatedly made during Question Time over the past four years.  He said to me that under him every meeting would be minuted, even if he was talking to a constituency delegation.  He used a colourful phrase at one stage.  A delegation from a constituency came to speak to him, during which he thumped the table and he said even that was recorded.  He said no meeting would be too small to record everything in minutes. </p>  <p>  Some three or four years ago he made a nasty slur against his predecessor and used innuendo to the effect that records could have been disappeared and so on.  He belatedly withdrew that statement two years later and said he should not have said it, even though the decision his predecessor took had 149 documents backing it up.  The Taoiseach has said consistently that he wants the full minutes of everything that was discussed.</p>  <p>  Can the Taoiseach explain why, at the meeting between him, the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Secretaries General of his Department and the Department of Justice and Equality and the Attorney General, the standards upon which he insisted were not met?  Can he accept that his failure to ensure any record was kept leaves us a conflict of evidence, whereby a member of his party has said his evidence was fantasy?  Surely that is a real step backwards rather than the proper reform which he advocated.  Does the Taoiseach regret that no minutes were taken or record kept of what was an extremely important meeting, leading as it did to a commission of investigation having to be established?  Mr. Justice Fennelly is absolutely scathing in his report about the absence of any record of the meeting.  Does the Taoiseach apologise for no record being kept and regret the fact no minutes of meeting exist?</p></speech>

Mr. Justice Fennelly is absolutely scathing of the failure to record the meeting.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach referred to note takers.  There were two Secretaries General present, namely, the Secretary General to the Department of the Taoiseach and the Secretary General to the Department of Justice and Equality.  Why did the Taoiseach not instruct them to take notes of the proceedings?  Will he acknowledge that he did not do so, that no note was taken at the meeting, and will he explain why?  Does he regret it?</p>  <p>  It is nothing to do with the decision to decide on a commission of investigation.  The Taoiseach tried to slip that in as an answer, but it is not an answer and has nothing to do with it.  A judge, in his conclusion, cannot believe that there are no minutes of the meeting.  Why is that the case?  Will the Taoiseach accept that no minutes were taken?</p></speech>

In these times of crisis, full of many unknowns, honesty is not alone our best policy but our only policy.  The new Government will tell the people the truth regardless of how unwelcome or difficult that might be.  We will tell it constantly and unreservedly.</blockquote><p>However, there has been no effort to keep this in spirit or in practice or to bring it into law.<br/><br/>There are a number of controversial examples of this, including the one which has just been cited of the crucial meeting involving the Taoiseach and the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality before he was dispatched to the home of the former Garda Commissioner.  There are various takes and versions of what happened at that meeting.  The T&aacute;naiste of the day, Deputy Gilmore, stated the Taoiseach told him it was his position that he may not be able to express confidence in the Commissioner at the following day's Cabinet meeting.  The Taoiseach denies this.  There is no minute to verify which one of them is telling the truth.  Was it a deliberate act that no minute was taken?  Was a decision taken, even informally, that it would not be minuted or was it just bad practice?  Did someone forget to do it?  We also have the 23 meetings on Irish Water that took place between Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government between April and September 2012.

I make the point that the commitment was given by the Taoiseach that he would end the practice up until then of not minuting meetings, whereby no record was kept of ministerial involvement in an issue and resulting decisions.  Famously, this was the case over a range of meetings between Ministers and, in this particular case, the former Minister, Mr. Hogan, and Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann officials.</p>  <p>  Coming to my point, we are advised that the election will not be until spring so there is still time to bring into law what the Taoiseach committed to do in the programme for Government.  We still have time to introduce legislation, in consultation with Opposition parties and with their support.  There is still time to bring in new practices and rules in the Government and Civil Service to ensure proper minutes are kept by Departments.  Perhaps this would save this issue being perpetually flung at the Taoiseach in the last throes of the Government.  Will he do this?  Will he use the next short period to introduce the legislation required?</p></speech>

I am quite sure there are meetings on a regular basis between public servants about issues of progress, and they are probably not deemed to be formal meetings.  In the case of the meeting referred to, the people who were present at it, including myself, made written statements to the commission of investigation and proceeded to give oral evidence at the committee of investigation.

As a Cabinet committee, confidentiality of discussions at the Economic Management Council are protected by the Constitution and, in line with long-standing practice, it is not appropriate to answer questions about proceedings at the council and the agendas of past or future meetings.</p><p>The council provides a forum to discuss strategic issues before they are presented to Government for consideration and decision.  This may include issues of a budgetary nature.</p><p>Like other Cabinet committees, it does not replace the role of Government where all Ministers have an opportunity to contribute to decision-making.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-20a.241" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/992" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000024#W03700"><p>I have tabled two of these questions.  The Taoiseach has frequently praised the work of the Economic Management Council because it supposedly keeps a very close eye on all economic and fiscal issues.  Does he not agree that given the lack of progress on homelessness and housing it seems the Economic Management Council, despite having 15 meetings in more recent times, is not in as much control of the situation as the Taoiseach might have thought previously?  Despite economic growth, more than 1,500 children, an 80% increase, live in emergency accommodation and up to 5,000 people are homeless.  There is policy chaos around housing and homelessness.</p>  <p>  The Economic Management Council must keep a close eye on the fiscal situation, but on the Friday before the budget approximately &euro;700 million was allocated to health on top of last year's &euro;600 million supplementary budget.  There seems to be either gross mismanagement or deliberate fraudulent estimates in health at the outset of the year, where clearly the budgets allocated are not realistic, adequate or robust enough, despite what the Minister says at the beginning of every year.  Last year, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, stated he had received enough.  Clearly he did not and neither did he get enough the previous year.  Does the Taoiseach believe the model of the Economic Management Council is adequate, because the health services are in chaos?  There is no stability in our health services at present.  They are in chaos.  Morale is very low.  Staffing and supports have been under-resourced.  We pointed out to the Taoiseach four key areas where savings revenue could be raised to support health services, including the recouping of fees from private medical insurers, agency staff, drug procurement and a tax on sugar sweetened drinks.  We backed this up with research from the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Fiscal Advisory Council, the Department of Finance's report and the Revenue Commissioners with regard to a tax on sugar sweetened drinks.</p>  <p>  The Economic Management Council's grip and impact on policy seems to be less and less influential.  We have no idea about the extension of free GP care to 12 year olds because the money allocated does not go anywhere near a full extension.  One wonders if it is like the promises made five years ago, in that they are not real in the sense of any commitment to implement them over the coming 12 months.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, has already clarified that not every child will be covered by the child care commitment in the budget and that it will be September at the earliest before the programme is introduced.  Is the Economic Management Council overseeing all of this?  The money needed to fulfil commitments made by Ministers is not provided, with the result that we have budgetary figures which are best open to question and, in some instances such as health, are in my view clearly very dishonest.</p><p>I do not know how the Economic Management Council of the Cabinet can stand over what has happened in health budgets over the past three years, particularly their inaccuracy, dishonesty and falsity.  False figures are being given to the D&aacute;il every year for health services.</p></speech>

We were given a phrase along the lines of "probity controls" and nobody knew what it meant.  To be fair to the Minister at the time, Deputy Reilly, he said he could not stand over the figures the day after the budget was announced.  The Economic Management Council and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform stood over them.  What happened?  When we went forward seven or eight months, it transpired that those figures were never going to be anywhere near meeting the need.  That caused chaos and distress for many families, and the same has happened over the past 12 months.  There has been much distress caused to front-line workers in the health area because they were told to operate within a budget.</p>  <p>  Late one night, a white paper or a Supplementary Estimate was produced, releasing an extra &euro;1.5 billion, and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council was not even told about it.  There was much hype on a day when &euro;1.5 billion was given out, involving presentations and media handlers, but in the previous four or five days, another &euro;1.5 billion was given out and there was not a word about it in that we cannot get information about it.  We had to go searching for that information about what it is for and what Departments would be affected.  Over the past three years, the Government's handling of the fiscal position in health has been disgraceful.  I am very clear that it has been dishonest, in my view, as the Government wanted to get its figures right on the tax front.  It was a certain political operation for the budgets for the past three years and health was getting in the way.  These were never real figures for the health sector.</p>  <p>  That has been going on and there is a need for a very honest debate about our health services, particularly about what they need.  The HSE has not got the required level of funding to perform the level of services that the Government wanted it to perform over the past three years.  Nobody can dispute that reality, as there has been a chronic mismatch between the level of services that people want and which the Government has ordained should happen against the resources put to that end.  Despite meeting 15 times, the Economic Management Council has allowed chaos to reign in health, as well as in housing and homeless policy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-20a.257" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000025#X01600"><p>I thank the Deputy.  When the Government was elected to office, the economic position was very precarious.  We were blocked from international markets, interest rates were 15% and we were haemorrhaging jobs by the hundred thousand.  Unemployment was at 15.2%, with national debt rising and the deficit at &euro;22.5 billion.  Given the changes, decisions and sacrifices accepted by the people, we are now in a very different position and we hope to have the deficit eliminated by the end of 2017 or early 2018.  That will bring about a very different scenario for the country, whoever the people decide to elect in the mean time.</p>  <p>  I have always considered that the operation of the Government in this case involves two parties, the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party.  With respect, one of the important issues at a time of crisis was that the leaders of the parties - with a Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform working in the financial area - had regular contact, updates and dialogue, meaning that everybody knew, as the issue evolved from day to day or week to week, what decisions needed to be looked at and made.  I have said it before publicly that the Governor of the Central Bank said to me that it was quite likely that in a particular week it could have been necessary to put the Army around automated teller machines and tell people that capital controls would have to be introduced, which would have been absolutely disastrous for people in Ireland.  That was avoided.  The purpose of the Economic Management Council was to have continuous engagement where it was necessary and appropriate.  In its own way, it had an impact on keeping the discipline and character of the Government very much focused on the job we had to do.</p>  <p>  The Deputy has raised a couple of serious issues, including homelessness.  It is not acceptable that 1,500 children should not have a home to go to.  It is unacceptable.  The problem is that the total collapse of the construction sector meant we were coming from a very low base.  As Deputies know, we were building 90,000 houses per year and that dropped to approximately 8,500 per year.  It needs to be approximately 20,000 or 25,000 for a number of years in order to deal with the issue, so it will not be sorted out in the short term.  Through Cabinet sub-committees and the Ministers responsible for the environment, finance and others, there have been a series of decisions about what needs to be done.  Decisions were made at the Cabinet sub-committee and referenced through the Economic Management Council to the Cabinet last year in respect of homelessness and rough sleepers on the streets.  These dealt with the purchase of the night caf&eacute;, extra resources given to homelessness housing agencies and so on.  That made a big difference but the matter is now very challenging and it must be dealt with through the social housing scheme, which is nationwide, with money on the table.  With regard to private rented accommodation, the Department of Social Protection is in a position to assist in each individual case where there is pressure on a tenancy.  There is also the restoration of what are called "voids", or places that were not habitable; they are being done up and made comfortable for people.  The Minister is proceeding to use his authority under the Acts to expedite modular housing in two tranches of 150 and 350.  I hope he will have a modest number in position by the end of the year.</p>  <p>  This is not an acceptable position.  The construction sector can give a response that must be practical and incentivised, and there should be a return in that case.  We have spoken about development levies and the building regulations, as distinct from planning regulations, which are completely independent.  There are questions, for example, as to whether one needs two or three car spaces per bedroom in units and other issues also must be addressed, such as requirements for fire safety conditions and so on.  Getting this moving is a multi-edged challenge.  It is not a question of money but managing the resource to make it happen.  We can consider the thousands of planning applications that contractors will not commence because there is no return because of development levies and the extent of building regulations etc.  These issues must be examined.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly; his Minister of State, Deputy Coffey; the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin; and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, are working very hard in that area-----</p></speech>

Each year the Minister would approve a budget and he or she would refer it to the HSE, which would then prepare a health service plan.  That would come back to the Minister for approval and be sent back to the HSE for implementation.  In many cases, as the Deputy is aware, the plan was never followed, either because something else happened or money was not ring-fenced for particular areas, such as mental health.  That was pointed out on many occasions.</p><p>This resulted in a very unsatisfactory position.  Of course, it is always difficult with demand-led services where a population is growing at the more senior level and where there is a greater demand for health services.  Next year, as Deputy Martin is aware, we are out of the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.  There will no longer be an opportunity to have Supplementary Estimates.  If money falls short in any Department, it will have to be made up either from savings in another Department or within the Department itself.  That is a very changed situation.  In respect of the allocations made in the Supplementary Estimates going into each Department, obviously the growth in the economy has been very strong.  Many of these were commitments in any event, and for 2016, Ministers were able to stay within the terms set out in the spring statement.  Having said that, there are still clearly pressures and demands in many Departments and it has not been possible for Government to meet all the demands.  So-----</p></speech>

It was originally established, as the Taoiseach has outlined, with the status of a Cabinet committee to manage the Government's programme on economic planning, budgetary matters and banking policy coming out of the crash.  I can understand, to a certain degree, the logic of that and the need to have a focus on those matters.  However, it appears that its power and influence have grown, in so far as it is possible to tell from the opaque answers we sometimes get to questions to establish this.  It appears that the EMC acts almost as a Government within the Government and then brings forward its decisions to the Cabinet, and also that some of the senior people - civil servants and political advisers - who attend these meetings may well have more influence on the decisions taken than do members of the Cabinet itself.  There is a question about whether the role, the decisions and the actions of the economic council are replacing the constitutional responsibility of the Cabinet.</p>  <p>  There are also big issues that need to be dealt with.  There are hundreds of citizens on hospital trolleys.  Has the economic council discussed that?  There is the issue of rent certainty or the lack thereof.  Has the economic council discussed that?  There is an ongoing issue around the lack of Government plans to tackle the housing and homelessness crisis.  The Taoiseach says that homelessness is not acceptable.  With absolute respect, let me say that homelessness is a direct consequence of his Government's policy and it is acceptable to the Government.  It would not be happening if the Taoiseach decided to stop it happening and if he got houses built for those people who need them.  I raised the plight of the Traveller community earlier.  Its accommodation funding was cut by 93%.  Imagine - a 93% cut.  Did the Economic Management Council take that decision?</p>  <p>  I asked question No. 7.  I do not recall the Taoiseach answering it, although he may have and I may have missed it, and if so, I apologise.  I asked him to confirm whether the Governor of the Central Bank briefed the EMC on the possible implications of a Greek exit from the European Union and the euro.  If he has not answered that, I would be obliged if he would tell us whether that happened.  Could he tell us what meetings, if any, the EMC has had with the banks in the last year?</p></speech>

Whoever they are should be sacked.  We are facing the worst housing and homelessness crisis in the modern history of the State.  No matter how much the Government talks about it and makes announcements, it gets worse on a daily basis.  Under the Taoiseach's stewardship, the housing lists have gone from 96,000 to 130,000.  That is a disastrous failure by any definition.  The number of children and families living in homelessness increased exponentially.  Waiting lists have gone from approximately eight or nine years, which was bad, to 18 years.  The wait is 18 years in D&uacute;n Laoghaire if one joins the housing list now.</p>  <p>  This is an index of disastrous failure, which is now not just affecting people who would traditionally have had difficulty affording a home, but is reaching up into every sector of society.  Nobody who is not very rich can afford to put a roof over his or her head.  That is where we are at.  Anybody who finds themselves, for whatever reason, without a roof over their head and looking for one, is, by definition, in trouble, unless they are earning &euro;70,000 or &euro;80,000 a year, which most people are not.  We now have the phenomenon of the working homeless, people who are going out to work and are sleeping in different hostels on different nights, trying to do a full day's work while not knowing where they will be sleeping that night.  That is what is going on.  It is beyond belief.</p>  <p>  I am asking what advice the Economic Management Council is getting on this.  The Taoiseach made a very telling statement on budget day: when asked about rent controls, he said that while he was looking at the matter - we keep looking at these matters but doing nothing about them - he would not be doing anything that would interfere with the market.  In other words, it was an economic decision that was informing his refusal to introduce rent controls.  As he well knows, one of the major contributory factors to the homelessness and housing crisis is spiralling rents that are unaffordable and consequent evictions, or the inability of people to access affordable housing, because we are essentially dependent on the private sector.  Is this not the problem?  Whatever advice or economic doctrine the Taoiseach is working on is telling him we must not interfere with the market, and that is the fundamental problem; in fact, we absolutely must interfere with the market.  He needs some advice from somebody who will tell him that we desperately need to interfere with the market and that we must not allow the market to dictate this issue or imagine that the market is going to solve it, when he has pursued this policy of hoping the market will sort the problem out for the entire duration of this Government and the market has self-evidently not sorted the problem out.  Does the Taoiseach accept that?  Does he accept that the advice is wrong, the policy has been wrong and the problem is continuously getting worse?  If we do not get that admission, we are on a hiding to nothing in terms of a chronic situation.</p>  <p>  Finally, on the economics of housing, the Taoiseach keeps saying that we need to increase supply.  First of all, it has not happened.  He keeps referring to the fact that we built 90,000 houses during the boom and now building has dropped to abysmal levels, so what we need to do is get supply up.  Would he acknowledge the basic economic point, and does the EMC even discuss this point - that even when we were building 90,000 houses per year, mostly private, during the boom, the housing crisis was still getting worse?  The numbers on the housing list were increasing even then.  The idea that supply equals demand - this economic notion - is just nonsense.  Is the Taoiseach getting any contrarian advice, to use the Nyberg phrase, in the aftermath of the analysis of economic crash?  Is he getting any contrarian advice that is challenging the orthodoxy-----</p></speech>

It is not.  The Economic Management Council, if it discusses an issue of financial control or whatever, must present its recommendation to the full Cabinet.</p><p>It is not the Cabinet.  It is not assuming any constitutional responsibility beyond its remit and any recommendation from the Economic Management Council has to be validated, verified and accepted by the entire Cabinet.</p> <p> The sub-committee on health discusses the issues surrounding health with the relevant Ministers from different Departments on a cross-departmental basis and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform would have met each of the Ministers individually in regard to their proposals for what they required in regard to the final decision to be taken as to what they would be allocated.</p> <p> I cannot recall at which meeting, if any, that the Governor might have briefed on the Greek exit, although on a number of occasions the Cabinet discussed that matter as to what might happen.</p> <p> There were 15 meetings of the EMC last year and while the EMC worked with the banks, there were three meetings with the banks.  I do not have the dates to hand.  If Deputy Adams wishes, I will get them for him.</p> <p> In response to Deputy Boyd Barrett, the EMC is not advised by anybody in respect of housing.  It is not a housing committee.  The social policy committee, on construction, deals with the question of housing at Cabinet sub-committee level and all of the relevant Departments and all of the senior personnel attend there.</p> <p> I agree it is not acceptable that this 18 year waiting list applies.  D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown is an area well known to the Ceann Comhairle.  I note the burgeoning pages of some of the newspapers with lots of superior houses in locations there for sale, and some of them appear to be moving a far distance from those who are homeless or who need housing now.</p> <p> On what I stated previously about the rent, there are multiple and complex reasons for all of this: the recovery in the economy, the growth in the numbers at work, delayed home ownership, the reduction in the traditional bed-sit accommodation in Dublin because of new regulations and the exit from the rental market of landlords for a range of reasons.  Many of the problems stem from the chronic lack of supply of housing which causes a knock-on problem across the property market and wider society, from renters to first-time buyers to low-income households, and the only sustainable solution is to increase the supply of affordable housing generally.</p></speech>

One of the areas that has been raised is the introduction of new laws pertaining to bail.  The Minister has given a commitment in that regard but there is a sense of urgency attached to it.  The majority of the gangs which are breaking in to homes are out on bail, as was clearly illustrated in the horrendous and very violent armed burglary of the Corcoran household in Tipperary.  There has been neglect of the area for the past number of years and the Garda is under resourced, but the bail law reform commitments would be one important step that could be taken.  Can the Taoiseach indicate whether the Bill will be brought forward and will we have it in the House before Christmas?</p></speech>

Obviously, Government has made a decision to reopen Templemore.  Next year, 600 garda&iacute; are to be recruited and there will be &euro;27 million for the vehicles and facilities that garda&iacute; need to do their job.  We witnessed the terrible murder of Garda Tony Golden only last weekend.</p>  <p>  The case Deputy Martin mentions was horrific and leaves a traumatic effect on families for many years.  There are a number of issues here that the Minister will address this week.  The Deputy will have seen reports of further facilities for garda&iacute; to do their job, which can be very dangerous in some of these particular circumstances.  The Minister for Justice and Equality will deal with elements of this this week.</p>  <p>  There are two bail Bills.  One will be before the House on Thursday next at Second Stage.  That is dealing with burglary of houses and consecutive sentencing.  Then there is a second bail Bill, the heads of which were approved in July last, which is a more general Bill.  Obviously, that is proceeding.</p>  <p>  In respect of re-offending on bail, there have been a number of offences here.  The number of sexual offences recorded as being committed by persons on bail has fallen by one third, from 32 to 22 in 2014.</p><p>The number of robbery offences has decreased from 556 to 476, burglary offences from 1,957 to 1,865 and weapons offences from 571 to 457.</p></speech>

The Government believes serious and serial offenders should be imprisoned.  This approach underlines the Minister for Justice and Equality's proposals to introduce tougher sentences for repeat burglars and to strengthen the bail laws to protect the public from offences by repeat offenders out on bail.</p>  <p>  In July, the Minister published a new Bill to strengthen the law to protect the public against crimes committed by offenders out on bail.  This is the first comprehensive review of the law since 1997.  The new reforms will include placing clear, new requirements on the courts considering bail applications; providing that courts must give reasons for bail decisions; providing garda&iacute; with new powers of arrest without warrant for breach of bail conditions; giving the District Court power to refuse bail where there is an appeal against a sentence of imprisonment imposed by the court; providing for restrictions on post-conviction bail; giving the courts the power to prohibit an accused person from driving where the person has been charged with a serious road traffic offence and the court considers it necessary to prevent the commission of a serious road traffic offence; and updating and extending the legislative basis for the electronic monitoring and tagging of persons out on bail under particular conditions.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is examining the question of codifying and updating all the legislation on road traffic offences where drink is concerned.  Myriad pieces of legislation make it difficult to implement it effectively, and he is working on it.</p></speech>

It is also intended to replace the Lunacy Regulation (Ireland) Act 1871, which is the basis for most of our system.  We need a clear legal framework which guarantees that citizens with impaired mental capacity have rights.  The 2013 Bill would bring the State into greater agreement with international best practice.  D&aacute;il Committee Stage of the Bill was completed in June and it is due before the D&aacute;il this week.  Does the Taoiseach expect it to be enacted before the end of the year?</p>  <p>  The Government has given a very clear commitment that it will incorporate the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities into domestic law.  However, in order to do so, other regulations have to be put in place.  Standards the convention demands include legislative changes on mental capacity, sexual offences, mental health legislation and reasonable accommodation.  Given that it is five years on, does the Taoiseach expect the necessary legislative work to be completed and does he realistically expect the programme for Government commitment to sign up to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities will be achieved?</p></speech>

I do not say this as a clich&eacute;; it is an important point.  Ireland signed the convention in 2007 but has been unable to ratify it because pieces of legislation must be put through.  This morning, the Government approved the road map for those pieces of legislation.  The first one, Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill, is on Report Stage tomorrow.  It should be finished tomorrow and then be referred to the Seanad.  It is important to mention the other related pieces of legislation.  The Department is working on a general scheme of a mental health Bill which will be published next year.  Work is under way on replacing section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 and enactment is expected in early 2016.  The amendment to section 4 of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006 to address the discriminatory treatment of persons whose decision making capacity is in question.  On the deprivation of liberty, legislative clarity is required on nursing homes and similar residential care facilities which have statutory responsibility for a decision that a patient should not leave for health and safety reasons and the appeals processes that should be in place.  Section 42 of the Electoral Act 1992 regarding the ineligibility of a "person of unsound mind" to stand for election will require careful consideration and the position must be published.  Given that the term "person of unsound mind" is gone, the legislation must be dealt with.  Ireland has taken the view that we should publish and deal with the necessary legislation before we ratify the convention, and this is set out in the road map we approved today.</p></speech>

Personal budgets also introduce greater transparency and efficiency in funding services.</blockquote><p>Given that people were picketing the House two weeks ago because of the absence of any commitment to those behind the independent living movement and the absence of any resources, can the Taoiseach indicate when we will have an outcome in terms of the comprehensive spending review, as outlined in the programme for Government?

We need to see more of that.  As the Deputy knows, not every person is in a position to avail of such funding because of the particular challenges they might have.

Above all, it focused on the complex challenge of migration.  It is clear that major problems remain on the ground.  This has been underscored in the past few days.  However, significant progress has been made in a short period.  A structured and comprehensive approach is now in place to deal with the many urgent challenges that lie ahead.  Last week's meeting began with short discussions on the five presidents' report on completing economic and monetary union and on the United Kingdom's plans for a referendum on EU membership.  It was agreed that we will return to both issues in December.  President Hollande made a presentation in advance of the global conference of the parties on climate change, which will open next month in Paris.  The European Council also noted the publication of the international and independent report into the downing of flight MH17 over Ukraine.  I have asked the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, to touch on elements of the discussions on Syria, climate change and Ukraine in his wrap-up remarks.  As I have noted, the European Council spent an overwhelming amount of its time on migration.  Therefore, I will begin by speaking about that issue.</p><p>The European Council has dealt with migration on a number of occasions this year, including in March, April, June and September.  If further reminder of the scale of the challenge were needed, it came when the <i>LE Samuel Beckett</i>rescued 102 people off the coast of Libya on the morning of the Council meeting of 15 October. The achievements of the Naval Service in the past six months are a source of great pride for the Irish people.  I know I speak for the entire House when I express our deep thanks and admiration for their wonderful work.  Nevertheless, the challenge remains.  The European Commission came forward with a comprehensive range of important proposals in September and October.  They provided the framework for the Council&rsquo;s discussions.  Ireland has consistently argued that the Union&rsquo;s efforts must be comprehensive and must balance practical measures with a compassionate response.  Our calls for solidarity and responsibility are reflected in the Council&rsquo;s conclusions, which aim towards a comprehensive strategy and a determined and sustained effort over time.</p><p>One of the central components of last week's discussions was the need to co-operate with third countries.  Turkey is paramount in this regard.  The Commission has accelerated co-operation in recent weeks.  On the eve of the European Council, it negotiated an action plan which aims to support Turkey in its current challenge of hosting over 2 million refugees from Syria and to enlist its assistance in reducing migration flows.  The Turkish Government has spent some &euro;7 billion in this area.  The European Council gave its support to the Commission by welcoming the action plan and signalling its openness to helping Turkey to work within existing frameworks towards visa liberalisation and a range of forms of enhanced political and economic co-operation.  It was recognised that the accession process needs to be re-energised in accordance with the negotiating structures.  The relevant Council conclusions which set out the accession procedures and criteria must also be respected.  The Council underscored that the comprehensive co-operation agenda must be based on shared responsibility, mutual commitments and delivery on both sides.  I do not think anyone is under any illusions about how challenging it will be for all concerned to achieve the substantive step-up in relations that is now envisaged.  As Turkey plays a geographically and politically central role in its region and is an EU neighbour and candidate country, it is hard to imagine solutions to the current crisis that do not substantially involve it.  Therefore, we hope rapid progress can be made over the coming period on the issues set out in the action plan.</p><p>Discussions also touched on the recent conference on the western Balkans migratory route and on the upcoming Valletta summit.  This latter summit will aim to find agreement with African partners in a fair and balanced manner on how to tackle the root causes of the crisis, how to support development, how to provide for effective return and readmission and how to dismantle the criminal networks that are exploiting this situation and putting lives in danger.  The European Council noted the importance of funding for international efforts to support refugees in Turkey and other countries.  The WFP and the UNHCR were specifically mentioned in this regard.  Ireland is a significant donor and partner to both of these organisations.  The European Council also discussed strengthening and protecting the EU&rsquo;s external borders.  This was a matter of serious discussion.  The measures discussed in this context dealt largely with building on the Schengen system and enhancing the borders agency, Frontex.  Although it co-operates closely with its European partners, Ireland is not a member of the Schengen area or of Frontex.  Many of the issues raised, such as the possibility of a European border and coast guard system, are for other member states to consider in the first instance.</p><p>When the Council looked at the response to the influx of refugees in Europe, there was a focus on contributing member state personnel to support Frontex and the European asylum support office in the so-called &quot;hotspots&quot;, or emergency processing centres, in Greece and Italy.  Ireland recently decided to commit six experts to the European asylum support office.  Preparations are under way for their training and eventual deployment to the member states where they can be of most assistance.  The Council did not discuss any specific further relocation initiative, but instead resolved to keep the whole issue under review.  The Commission has proposed a permanent relocation system.  Under Protocol 21 to the Lisbon treaty,  Ireland can choose whether to opt in to relocation measures.  As this House knows, we have agreed to accept approximately 2,450 people on relocation within the EU.  However, there is no obligation on us to participate in further relocation decisions if they are proposed.  Ireland will monitor the situation carefully with a view to considering any further national response as and when the issue arises.</p><p>There was also some discussion of the Dublin system under which asylum seekers are supposed to register and make applications in the first EU country they enter.  This is a cornerstone of the whole common European asylum system and Ireland strongly supports it.  It is clear that it has been under intolerable strain in the face of the immense pressure of recent weeks and months, but equally there is a view that much can be done to improve its operation and that any reform must be carefully analysed before change is contemplated.  Again, this is a matter to which I am sure we will return on the basis of European Commission analysis and proposals.<br/><br/>The Council discussion also included a consideration of the political and military developments in Syria which have such a dominating impact on migration.  I want to draw attention to the Council&rsquo;s clear statement that the Assad regime bears the greatest responsibility for the 250,000 deaths and the displacement of millions from Syria.  There are, of course, other actors such as UN-designated terrorist groups who bear responsibility as well but in the end it will only be a political process on the basis of the Geneva Communique of 2012 that will move matters towards a resolution.  The EU remains fully engaged in working to find a political solution in close co-operation with the UN, with special representative Staffan de Mistura and with the countries of the region.  I would reiterate again, as the European Council did, that there cannot be a lasting peace in Syria under the current leadership and until the legitimate grievances and aspirations of all components of Syrian society are addressed.  In the context of discussing regional conflicts, the European Council also noted developments in Libya and called on all parties to swiftly endorse the agreement negotiated by Bernadino Le&oacute;n.  The EU stands ready to provide political and financial support to the Libyan Government of national accord as soon as it takes office.<br/><br/>I would like to recall again that Ireland has been active in ongoing efforts to tackle the migration crisis.  The Government and the Oireachtas have voluntarily agreed to accept around 4,000 asylum seekers and refugees under resettlement and relocation programmes.  This is well in excess of any notional quota that might have been attributed to us by the European Commission.  This includes 520 refugees whom we have offered to resettle from refugee camps, some of whom have now started arriving in Ireland.  Approximately 2,450 people will be relocated from Italy and Greece and possibly other member states under the Commission proposals from June and September.  A further 1,030 people will be taken on resettlement or relocation, with the final breakdown between these two categories still under consideration.  As I noted earlier, we have deployed a naval vessel and full crew in the Mediterranean since June; initially the <i>LE Eithne</i>, then the <i>LE Niamh</i>and now the <i>LE Samuel Beckett</i>.  The total number of people rescued by our naval vessels since May now comes to 7,848 and I commend the Naval Service again on its very admirable work.<br/><br/>The European Council discussions touched upon the work of two UN agencies.  This year, Ireland&rsquo;s core funding to the UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, came to &euro;5.8 million.  Furthermore, at the start of September, we committed to doubling our annual contribution to the World Food Programme from &euro;10 million to &euro;20 million per annum for the next three years.  We also provide other supports to areas most affected by instability and conflict.  By the end of 2015, Ireland will have provided a total of &euro;41 million over the last four years towards assisting those displaced as a result of the Syrian crisis.  The Irish Government provides over &euro;80 million each year to humanitarian relief efforts around the world.  So far in 2015, Ireland&rsquo;s targeted humanitarian funding has reached people in countries such as Iraq, South Sudan, Somalia, the Central African Republic and Yemen.  All of these measures have been supported by a swift response at home led by the Department of Justice and Equality.  The establishment of the Irish Refugee Protection Programme and a new inter-departmental task force, chaired by the Minister for Justice and Equality, are important steps in the Government&rsquo;s contribution to this crisis.<br/><br/>I would now like to turn to the issue of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s membership of the European Union.  As expected, at last week&rsquo;s meeting President Tusk provided Heads of State and Government with a brief update on the progress of the technical work that has been under way in Brussels between British and EU officials since June.  In addition, he outlined how the process will advance in the weeks ahead before the European Council returns to this issue in December.  Much of the recent focus has been on the need to move forward to more detailed debate on concrete issues.  I welcome, therefore, Prime Minister Cameron&rsquo;s undertaking last week to write to President Tusk in early November setting out the reforms that Britain will seek.  This should provide a basis for the UK&rsquo;s EU partners to engage more fully with the issues and to allow for collective discussion.  Ireland will play a full part in this process, which is expected to start at senior official level, and I look forward to discussions at the December European Council.<br/><br/>As I have said many times in this House and in other fora, the matter of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s membership of the European Union is one of real national importance for Ireland.  Indeed, this issue is a strategic priority for the Government.  In my own discussions with Prime Minister Cameron, I have been unequivocal about how much value we attach to the fact that both our countries are members of the European Union.  Given the importance of the issue, it is worth stressing once again just how closely developments are being monitored.  In addition to my own discussions with Prime Minister Cameron, there are regular meetings between Government Ministers and their British equivalents.  Indeed, the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs will meet with his British counterpart this Friday.  At official level, the engagement is equally regular, with officials in my Department, our permanent representation in Brussels and our embassy in London in frequent contact with British and other colleagues.  In all of these exchanges we remain clear and consistent on our position that Ireland will be open and pragmatic.  We are mindful of specific UK concerns and we will be supportive where we can but we are also fully conscious of our own national interests and of the views of other member states.  During the next phase of the discussions, Ireland will work constructively with the British Government and all our EU partners.  Our common goal remains the same, to find a consensual basis for the UK&rsquo;s continued membership of our Union.<br/><br/>Given the European Council's focus on the pressing migration issue, there was only a very brief consideration of the report by President Juncker and the heads of other institutions on completing the Economic and Monetary Union, EMU.  The completion of banking union is a vital part of the EMU process but, disappointingly from Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, there was no specific reference to this in the final conclusions.  On the report itself, several member states from outside the euro area were keen to have it spelled out that future EMU debate must take place in an open and transparent manner and in full respect of the Single Market.  We would sympathise with and support this approach which was reflected in the conclusions.  The European Council is to revert to the issue of EMU in December.  We very much favour a pragmatic and gradual approach which focuses in the first instance on steps that can be taken to more effectively implement existing instruments.  The Commission is expected to publish a first set of concrete proposals this week and it is expected that these will address reinforcing the economic governance framework, including an in-depth review of the six pack and two pack and reorganising the European semester, as well as on the external representation of the euro area at the IMF and other international organisations.  We look forward to examining these proposals in detail when they are published and as they are considered by Finance Ministers.<br/><br/>Many commentators have suggested that it will be our response to the massive waves of people who are now seeking refuge within our borders that defines what the Union will become in the years ahead.  I recall that the EU was born from adversity and has always managed to survive it.  While the solutions which are negotiated between 28 separate individual member states are often complex and while progress can be slow and difficult, I have great faith that with solidarity, responsibility and compassion, we will again manage to guide the Union to a prosperous and stable future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-20a.325" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/992" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="17:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000030#CC00200"><p>After years of unprecedented financial and economic crises, the European Union is today dealing with the largest humanitarian crisis it has ever faced.  However, its leaders continue to fail the basic test of responding with urgency, imagination and generosity.  This summit slightly nudged along a response but achieved little else.  With winter closing in and people about to be caught in desperate circumstances as border after border is being closed to them, what was needed was an agreement to do whatever it takes to help them.  This did not happen and therefore the summit has to be seen as a failure.  The fact that hundreds of thousands of people are risking everything to seek shelter in Europe shows that it is still seen as a place of hope and safety for many.</p><p>While the basic values of Europe are under attack in many places, they remain an inspiration for others.  The last thing we can do is allow the values of extremists to triumph.  We cannot allow them to make us fail in our obligation to do all that we can.</p> <p>  The Council President, Mr. Donald Tusk, has done good work in identifying the different elements which need to be addressed to provide a comprehensive response to the crisis.  Unfortunately, other leaders have been willing to identify the problems but unwilling to commit to the solutions.  There is a refugee crisis because millions of people are fleeing vicious conflicts.  They do not want to be refugees but want to live in their own homes.  The worst impact has come from the war in Syria, which was started by President Assad through his determination to hold power at all costs.  The early resistance to him was overwhelmingly from moderate communities, which have borne the brunt of his savage repression.  They offered talks, built coalitions of moderate forces and tried to find an end to the misery faced by the Syrian people.  In response, they experienced some of the most brutal actions ever undertaken by a state against its citizens.  The use of chemical weapons and the systematic clearing of cities caused millions to flee to neighbouring countries.  </p> <p> The Assad regime has been a client state of, first, the Soviet Union and now Russia for nearly half a century.  The efforts of some, both here and elsewhere, to claim the United States and Europe are responsible for the war are ridiculous and show again their double standards.  The emergence of the ISIS group has made the position worse.  It represents no one but the most fanatical religious hard-liners who are seeking to ethnically cleanse the entire region.  The systematic expulsion and murder of Christian communities and other religious minorities and the brutality shown towards non-Sunni Muslims are something most of us thought belonged to a different era. </p> <p> It says something very significant about both Assad and his Russian military backers that the majority of their effort is going into attacking the moderate opposition, rather than ISIS.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party strongly agrees with the basic position of the European Union that there can be no long-term peace with Assad in place.  There is too much blood on his hands and he has rejected too many opportunities to end the conflict for him to be a credible leader of a people which has never fully supported him.  No one has yet come up with a credible route forward, especially given Russia's ongoing veto threat against any United Nations resolution which could threaten Assad's position.  The first priority must be to continue the search for a way through this, achieve an agreed international position for a transition in Syria and create a united front against the barbarism of ISIS.  However, the most immediate concern must be the millions of people in camps in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.  Every person in these camps who is capable of leaving is rightly considering doing so.  They offer shelter but little else.  Even basic employment and education services are not available and medical facilities cover little more than the bare minimum. </p> <p> I welcome the call by the Council on member states to give more as it also recognises the problem.  The appalling budget deal means the European Union simply does not have the resources to step change its response.  It is, therefore, up to member states to do so.  We need an urgent commitment by states to give whatever it takes to bring facilities in the refugee camps up to basic standards and to do so before the full force of winter sets in.  The Government has spent the past week talking about how we have the opportunity to be generous.  Let us show generosity by taking the lead and immediately announcing a major increase in support for the Syrian refugee camps.</p> <p> For those who have decided to seek refuge in Europe, the immediate danger is now acute.  As we could all see from television reports yesterday, the weather is causing an acute crisis on the European Union's south-eastern borders.  There is no alternative to the core principle of solidarity and sharing responsibility between members.  Ireland must continue to reject the base populism of extremists and accept its shared role in helping the people concerned.  If there is no material improvement in the position in the next fortnight, Ireland should seek to have an emergency summit called.  There is no more time to waste.</p> <p> The summit's conclusions are vague on the deal being discussed with Turkey on seeking to prevent people from leaving camps in Turkey to travel to Europe.  As I stated, making conditions in the refugee camps bearable is an essential first step.  However, the idea that membership of the European Union, or at least access to core policies, should be bartered away in an emergency is not acceptable.  If leaders go too far, there will be an inevitable public backlash.</p> <p> Just as important is the issue of whether the European Union is agreeing to turn a blind eye to all actions by the Turkish Government in return for help.  As I stated previously, the position in Turkey is of great concern.  A drift away from essential democratic norms is evident in a number of important areas.  These include the pressure on independent media and a growing indifference to minority rights.  The Turkish Government appears to have been eager to escalate the conflict with the PKK and has pushed aside earlier, highly encouraging progress towards peaceful reconciliation.  Our sympathies should go out to all those affected by the bombing in Ankara, which was directed against a democratic peaceful movement dedicated to finding a place for the Kurdish people in Turkey.  Whatever is ultimately proposed as an agreement with Turkey, it must be based on humanitarian and democratic principles.</p> <p> A clear failure of the summit was its backing away from an essential component of the much needed banking union.  The lack of a shared regulation and resourcing of banks in the eurozone has been identified as one of the causes of the financial crisis which ultimately caused so much economic damage.  The creation of a banking union has been agreed as an absolute requirement of learning the lessons of the past and returning the eurozone to secure long-term growth.  Unfortunately, the Taoiseach and his colleagues have tried to muddle through with a policy which leaves in place key weaknesses.  To maintain confidence in the banking sector and its ability to lend to businesses and the community, a credible deposit guarantee mechanism is required.  In the context of the eurozone, the experiences of Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Cyprus have shown that the required confidence will only be established if guarantees extend beyond national economies.  This is one of the only ways of breaking the implied link between financial and sovereign debt.  The draft conclusions for last week's summit included a strong statement about a common deposit guarantee system.  In the face of inflexible resistance from Germany, however, this was removed and replaced with a banal statement about something being done at some point in future.  This is foolish in the extreme and undermines the very idea of a banking union. </p> <p> As a result of German resistance, we have a regulatory framework which does not extend to many systematically important banking sectors.  We have a recapitalisation fund which covers a tiny fraction of potential need and we now have a deposit insurance system which is basically the current failed model in new clothes.  We are nearing the end of the entire process of reform of economic and monetary union and the outcome is not encouraging.  There is no provision for fiscal transfers between states at times of need, no credible banking union and only a limited lender of last resort.  Not one of the identified weaknesses which led to the crisis has been addressed.  Instead, we have more talk about fiscal control as if this was the answer to everything.  Unfortunately,  Government policy has been solely driven by short-term domestic politics.  The Government has not set out a policy on the necessary reforms, has refused to ask for relief for debts incurred by Ireland as a result of what are now accepted to have been failures of European policies and has instead encouraged the view that Ireland was to blame for everything.  </p> <p> Statements on European Council meetings will probably not be held more than once or twice before the next general election.  It would be worthwhile for the Taoiseach to take time to examine the overblown rhetoric he used in previous contributions.  He should look at how often he spoke of everything being fine and described issues that are still in crisis as having been sorted.  He will see a Government that ignores what it said in its first years.  Let us not forget the billions of euro in retrospective recapitalisation the Taoiseach told us he would apply for before quietly abandoning that position without explanation.  Let us not forget his claim that Europe had been reformed and all was fine.  Let us not forget that instead of going to Europe with a clear agenda, time after time his only approach has been to wait to see what was agreed and then claim it as a great victory.</p><p>That is how he returned from one summit: claiming to have moved mountains to win a major interest rate reduction for Ireland when, in truth, he had asked for one quarter of what Greece secured and which was automatically extended to Ireland without discussion.  Time and again, other countries negotiated while the Taoiseach sat back with a public relations team ready to spin.</p> <p> The Taoiseach's relationship with the UK Prime Minister, David Cameron, has delivered nothing discernible for Ireland.  Their joint approach to Northern Ireland has been hands-off and, therefore, very damaging.  On Europe, it has meant meetings which were long on rhetoric and devoid of detail.  Five years after Mr. Cameron's announcement that he wanted an in-or-out referendum and two years after the renegotiation of British membership of the European Union was launched, we still have not heard from the British what they actually want.  We have not heard from our Government what we are willing to support.  It appears that the Prime Minister was finally forced last week to agree to say what he is looking for.  The first demand is for an opt-out from the concept of ever-closer union.  This is part of the treaties which has no specific legal effect and is of no concern.  The second demand is for an explicit statement that the union is a multi-currency union.  This is intended to separate the workings of the Union from those of the eurozone.  In practice, this could be very damaging.  The completion of a real fiscal and banking union requires a central entity to develop, enforce and administer policies.  This can only credibly be the institutions of the European Union.  What we urgently need in this regard is a proposal for the long-term governance of the eurozone, without which the British idea is risky at best.  The third demand is for a means to re-nationalise areas that have been subject to joint decisions within the Union.  If this is a Trojan horse for the Tory agenda of removing basic worker protections and other regulations implementing equality and safety policies, we should not accept it.  Finally, there is a general demand to protect the City of London and give it guaranteed access to all eurozone opportunities.  This is basically Britain saying that eurozone countries must bear all constraints of membership but share all the opportunities.  This is of particular concern for Ireland, as the return of certain euro markets to the eurozone is standard policy and one from which we might significantly benefit.</p> <p> Taken together, the list is a vague one that is more about English nationalist concerns than improving the European Union for other member states or even other parts of the United Kingdom.  Britain's remaining in the European Union is important for Ireland, but not at any price.  We need to know exactly what it is looking for and we need a debate on how far it is in our national interest and the interest of the European Union as a whole to make concessions.</p></speech>

T&aacute; siad ag d&eacute;anamh s&aacute;robair.  T&aacute;imidne uilig agus t&aacute; muintir na h&Eacute;ireann f&iacute;orbhu&iacute;och agus f&iacute;orbhr&oacute;d&uacute;il as na mn&aacute; agus na fir ar an long seo.</p><p>Before the last European Council meeting, I raised the ongoing refugee crisis with the Taoiseach.  As his statement outlines, that dominated the Council meeting.  It is worth repeating that we are in exceptional times.  In the face of such a humanitarian crisis, our collective response must go above and beyond the bare minimum.  Hungary has now sealed its border with Croatia and thousands of refugees are stranded in inhuman and dangerous conditions, as Slovenia has limited the numbers it will allow in.  In human terms, this means that men, women and children who are literally fleeing for their lives are stuck in freezing and wet conditions as winter approaches.  The congress of the European People's Party, EPP, will take place on Wednesday and Thursday in Madrid.  I do not know if the Taoiseach is attending that cruinni&uacute;.  If so, will he discuss Hungary's criminalisation of refugees with Hungary's Prime Minister, who is a fellow member of the EPP group?  Will the Taoiseach condemn his atrocious comments that refugees are terrorists and that somehow Hungary is defending Christian or European ideals by criminalising refugees?  I am sure that, as a decent man, the Taoiseach does not subscribe to these baser instincts.</p><p>Slovenia and Croatia have both indicated that they will keep the present corridor open as long as Austria and Germany keep their doors open, but it is clear that EU states are incapable of formulating a common and humane position despite facing the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War.  More than 615,000 people, most of them Syrians, have reached Europe so far this year, compared to just over 200,000 for the whole of 2014.  More than 475,000 people made it to Greece from Turkey in 2015.  Despite these figures, the EU has agreed to resettle only 160,000 refugees so far.  This is not good enough.  It is unacceptable, and EU Governments need to show greater leadership.  We have witnessed violent demonstrations by far-right elements and attacks on refugee centres in some EU states.  Over the weekend, a candidate for the mayoralty of Cologne, who works with refugees and has promoted policies which would assist them, was stabbed in the neck.  I have heard that she is in a serious but increasingly stable condition and has won the election.  I wish her a speedy recovery.  Additionally, an Afghan man trying to make his way into Bulgaria last week was shot by border guards and killed.  This must be the first time in a very long time that an EU border guard has shot and killed a refugee attempting to enter the EU.</p><p>Before the Council meeting, I asked the Taoiseach to argue for a humane and moral approach to the refugee crisis.  However, the conclusions of the meetings do not represent such a position.  The only agreement seems to be one to provide Turkey with &euro;3 billion in aid, ease visa restrictions for Turkish nationals, and offer a prospect of granting Turkey safe-country-of-origin status in return for that state's co-operation.  This completely ignores Turkey's deplorable human rights record, especially against Kurds, and Turkey's own role in the Syrian conflict.  Additionally, the EU's support for the Turkish Government is a political boost for the AK party ahead of the elections in Turkey on 1 November.  Peace rallies have been attacked by suicide bombers, most recently in Ankara, when 102 people lost their lives.  Our sympathy is with them and their families.  Some say the Turkish Government is deliberately failing to provide adequate protection for these rallies.  We must be mindful that many of the refugees fleeing Turkey are Kurds and that sending them back, as appears to be contemplated, could allow for major human rights violations.  The EU is offering a carrot to the Government of Turkey and a stick to refugees.  This is not a morally sustainable position.</p><p>Before the Council meeting, my colleague Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe raised with the Taoiseach the issues in Palestine and Israel.  I see nothing in the meeting's agreed conclusions to indicate that this was raised by the Taoiseach as requested by my colleague.  Did the Taoiseach raise that issue?  If not, why not?  If so, what was the consequence?  The death toll from political conflict in this region is rising and Israel is continuing to seal off neighbourhoods in occupied east Jerusalem.  While the Palestinian question may sometimes be submerged by the awfulness of other crises in the region, it remains a constant.  It is constant in terms of the suffering of the people involved and in terms of the destabilising effect that this unresolved issue between the people of Israel and the people of Palestine has on the wider region.  The Israeli Government is using violence against Arab residents while continuing military operations across the West Bank and Gaza.</p><p>According to the UN, last week was the deadliest for Palestinians in the West Bank and Israel in ten years.  Thousands of people have been injured by live and plastic bullets and hundreds have been arrested for protesting.  The Palestinian people need international protection as the situation in occupied Palestine deteriorates at an alarming rate.  I have been there and talked to some of the older people in its civic society.  They believed that they were losing influence over their younger people.  They almost predicted what is now happening.  Will the Taoiseach raise the blatant violations of international law and human rights that we are witnessing with his European counterparts?  Will he call for immediate international protection for the Palestinian people who are living under this violent and brutal occupation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-20a.330" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/981" speakername="Sandra McLellan" time="18:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000033#FF00200"><p>As my colleague, an Teachta Adams, has spoken at length about the refugee crisis, I will not reiterate his comments.  However, I wish to stress the urgency of an agreed humane and united solution.  The world was shocked and shamed into action after photographs of Aylan Kurdi's dead body were shown around the globe.  We promised that no more children seeking refuge would die as he did, yet four people, three of them children, drowned after their boat sank off the Greek coast last Saturday.  According to reports, 44 children died at sea trying to cross the Mediterranean last month, but none of them made the world headlines.  While European countries differ and argue, children are drowning in the Mediterranean.  The collective failure of the EU to stop children who are running for their lives from dying on its doorstep is a horrible reflection of its priorities.</p>  <p>  This is not just a refugee crisis, but a crisis of humanity.  There is no easy solution to it.  There is no magic formula.  However, the core solution is to end the war in Syria.  Europe wrongly believed that it could contain the war in Syria, that some countries could support its rebels, that these could topple Assad's Government and that there would be no consequences for Europe.  It continued with this even as the war grew more violent and deadly.  It largely turned a blind eye when millions of people escaped to Lebanon, Jordan and Syria seeking refuge.  All sides continued to fail to do anything concrete to end the war.  Now, more and more refugees are fleeing to Europe as the conditions in Syria and neighbouring countries deteriorate further.  Despite repeated urgent appeals, the UN has only received 43% of the funds that it needs to respond to the humanitarian crisis in Syria.  The situation has become so bad that the World Food Programme has been forced to cut rations for refugees in Jordan and Lebanon.  This issue needs to be to the forefront of the political agenda in Europe.  European leaders cannot pander to those who seek to divide and spread fear and hate.  All international efforts must be made to resolve the conflict in Syria, not escalate it.</p>  <p>  Was the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, discussed at the European Council meeting?  It seems like a significant issue to leave off the table.  Mr. John Hilary, the executive director of the campaign group War on Want, which has been vocal on the threats that TTIP presents, met the European Commissioner for trade, Ms Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m, to discuss it recently.  According to reports, when challenged on why she insisted on continuing with the TTIP negotiations when so many EU citizens were against it, the Commissioner stated: "I do not take my mandate from the European people."  Is the Taoiseach concerned that the Commissioner for trade, who is negotiating a large agreement that will have an impact on Europe's democratic institutions, environmental standards, workers' rights and the future of the agricultural sector, is not taking her mandate from the people?  It should come as no surprise, given that almost all of the documents and details of the negotiations are kept secret and those that have been released have only become public through leaks or pressure from bodies such as the European Ombudsman.  Some other documents have been released but are kept in a secret reading room that only some MEPs can enter upon signing an agreement that they will never divulge what they read, and after having their mobile telephones, papers and pens confiscated.  A security official even stays in the room while an MEP is present, and these are only some of the documents.  The rest are still top secret and kept under lock and key.  This is undemocratic.  TTIP's potential effects are too important and dangerous for details to be kept from European citizens.  Will the Taoiseach stand up for democracy, transparency and the rights of Irish citizens and demand that the TTIP negotiating documents be made public?</p>  <p>  The European Council has given the Commission a mandate to negotiate TTIP, yet hundreds of thousands of citizens are mobilising against it.  Eleven days ago, nearly 250,000 people marched against TTIP in Berlin.  More than 3 million people in Europe have signed a petition against the deal.  Surely in the face of such opposition the Council should seek a suspension of the negotiations.  Will the Taoiseach listen to the people of Ireland and the EU and join in the call for a suspension?</p>  <p>  As my colleague, an Teachta Adams, mentioned, the congress of the European People's Party, EPP, begins in Madrid tomorrow.  A leaked version of a new declaration to be launched at the congress states that the EU should move towards the creation of a common army.  Is this the Taoiseach's position?  Is this the formal position of Fine Gael, or will the Taoiseach seek to change such a declaration?  This and successive Fianna F&aacute;il Governments have notoriously undermined Irish neutrality, but is the Taoiseach formally agreeing with his right-wing European colleagues that there should be a standing European army?  It is no wonder that the Government failed to support a neutrality Bill proposed by my colleague, an Teachta Crowe, that would have necessitated a referendum to enshrine neutrality in Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, thereby giving the Irish people a say on the issue.  Sinn F&eacute;in will continue opposing the further militarisation of the EU, the EPP's efforts to create a standing army and the erosion of Irish neutrality.</p></speech>

That is starting to happen.  The barriers are being raised again against refugees who are fleeing desperate circumstances.  Fortress Europe is being re-established.</p>  <p>  There are many aspects to this issue, but something that was of concern in the European Council's discussions was the talk of enlarging the mandate of FRONTEX.  That mandate and FRONTEX's resources have increased exponentially in recent years.  I wonder about FRONTEX and its approach to desperate people fleeing desperate circumstances.  Its record is not good.  I will cite a few instances.  Recently, inflatable dinghies carrying refugees on the River Evros at the Turkish-Greek border were shot at by FRONTEX.  Border officials have also stated that German police stationed there were involved in incidents in which refugee boats were shot at.  In 2012, a Spanish patrol boat co-ordinated by FRONTEX and travelling at great speed off Lanzarote deliberately overran a refugee boat that had 25 people on board who were waiting to be picked up by the coast guard.  Seven refugees were killed.  In 2011, 63 refugees died of thirst after being at sea for 15 days in the Mediterranean even though FRONTEX and NATO ships that were involved in the assault on Libya at the time were aware of their presence.</p><p>In recent days, a refugee boat was shelled by Libyan soldiers or militia.</p> <p> This raises the question as to what precisely FRONTEX is doing when mandated to go into the countries of origin of some of the refugees with the aim of what is described as stemming the flow of refugees.  I am deeply concerned, and there is widespread criticism, that there is no transparency in FRONTEX.  We cannot get real information about what it is doing but its record is not good.  As we further expand its mandate, it is not clear precisely what it is doing.  Certainly, signs are that Europe is trying by various means to close the door further on desperate people looking for refuge in Europe.</p> <p> A particularly worrying example of this is the attempt to offload the problem onto Turkey and to co-operate with the Turkish regime.  The Turkish regime has an appalling record on treating some of its own minority groups, especially the Kurds.  It is widely believed Mr. Erdogan and the deep state in Turkey are behind the recent bombing directed at peaceful protesters in Turkey, yet it seems we are willing to do deals with, co-operate with and give resources to the Turkish regime, which has a very questionable record on human rights within its own borders and on the treatment of its own people.  This is because we want to keep the problem out of Europe.</p> <p> This speaks to the fundamental problem.  I heard Deputy Martin state earlier &mdash; I presume he was directing his comments at some of us on the left &mdash; that it was completely wrong to blame Western policy for the rise of ISIS or the conditions that led refugees to flee from north Africa, Syria and Iraq to Europe.  Of course, the Deputy could not be more wrong on that.  The Turkish example highlights this.</p> <p> In one way or another, Europe consistently co-operates and trades with, talks to and supports ruthless, vicious, despotic, brutal regimes right across the north African and Middle Eastern region.  Now we are co-operating with Mr. Erdogan.  We have done so with successive regimes in Iraq and are doing so with Israel in terms of its brutal persecution of the Palestinian people.</p> <p> Another important example concerns the el-Sisi regime in Egypt, which is engaged in a vicious campaign of persecution, oppression, mass imprisonment and execution of its political opponents, to the extent that an election took place in the country in which there was no electorate.  Nobody is voting.  Some 16% of the electorate turned out for the elections in Egypt because no ordinary Egyptian believes they are anything other than a sham and rigged.  They believe the el-Sisi regime is a brutal dictatorship, yet we are doing beef business with Mr. el-Sisi, and the Taoiseach recently met him.  No voices are being raised in Europe about what Mr. el-Sisi is doing to his own people and the political opposition in his country.  Similarly, no voices are being raised demanding sanctions against Israel for what it is doing, including in respect of the escalation in the number being thrown out of their homes in the West Bank and east Jerusalem.  I include the Palestinians who have been killed by Israelis and settlers since the beginning of this month.  No serious voices are being raised over these matters.</p> <p> What does this do?  Is it any wonder that against the background of Western hypocrisy and co-operation with these brutal regimes, people are driven into the hands of extremist groups such as ISIS?  In some cases, we are actually doing business with regimes that finance groups such as ISIS.  We must first show compassion and allow people into this Continent who need refuge.  We must not try to stop people.  Also, we need to change our hypocritical policy on dealing with the brutal regimes in the areas from which the refugees are fleeing.</p></speech>

That is an amazing statement.  I do not believe for a second that the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, would agree with that.  I believe he would have a more open-minded approach than to come up with that notion.</p>  <p>  The refugee crisis in Europe has been incredible.  It is outrageous if we do not try to determine why it has happened.  Of the 60 million people who have been displaced, 33 million have been displaced by war.  Never in the history of mankind have so many munitions been manufactured.  Never in the history of mankind have so many munitions been sold.  Never in the history of mankind has so much ammunition been poured into the Middle East.  In 2012, Europe alone sanctioned &euro;9.5 billion worth of arms for the Middle East.  This figure pales into insignificance by comparison with the value of the arms the Americans have sent to the region.  It is totally disingenuous if we pretend this does not have an impact.  When one drops bombs on people's houses, there is a fairly good chance they will move because they have no house left to live in.  Obviously, the Western powers are not the only ones dropping bombs.  Russia is just as culpable and Iran does not help the situation.  Surely we should be able to adopt a neutral position and wash our hands of the whole lot of them and say that under no circumstances should we have anything to do with anyone who uses munitions, including bombs and guns, to settle disputes.  This is because we are not innocent.</p>  <p>  A considerable number of military planes have been refuelling in Shannon.  We wonder whether they are on their way to war zones to refuel fighter jets.  Many of the planes are currently engaged in ongoing aerial refuelling sorties in support of Saudi-led bombings in Yemen.  One hardly hears Yemen being discussed.  If one turns on one's television tonight, it is unlikely that it will be mentioned.  Nobody is interested in talking about it here.  Since March, 2,300 civilians have been killed in Yemen, 400 of whom were children.  It is a mad war.  The Saudis could not even carry it out without the United States, and they have the United Kingdom to support them as well.  What is occurring in Yemen is mindless.  Refugees are being created every hour there but no one seems to be interested.  The United States and United Kingdom are giving munitions and logistical support to those concerned.  The United States is selling to the Saudi-led forces cluster bombs, which are banned in most countries.  It is selling cluster bombs to drop and US-made fighter planes are being used to drop them, and we are okay with that.  We are not giving out about it to those responsible.</p>  <p>  We are still allowing US military planes to pass through Shannon.</p><p>We still give permits for civilian aircraft to come from America with arms.  We have not seen yet what they have allowed in 2015, but in 2014, serious amounts of munitions came through Shannon and went to the Saudis.  We give out about ISIS, and so we should; they are a mad lot.  However, does the Minister of State realise that in the first half of 2015, the Saudi Arabian Government cut off the heads of 102 people, and still we have no problem trading with it?  I do not understand that.  If it does not matter what someone does because it has nothing to do with trade, we might as well sell them to everyone and facilitate all war efforts.  When will an Irish Government have the courage to say that while it likes doing business with America and it is great that American companies come here and provide jobs - although it is unfortunate that they do not pay much tax - we do not want them using Shannon as a military air base to travel on and kill many people in the Middle East?</p> <p> More than 2.5 million troops have come through Shannon since 2001.  The Americans do not do body counts but a reputable organisation in America did one recently.  It set out to count the number of civilians, not people carrying guns, who were killed in Iraq and Afghanistan alone by American military hardware since 2001.  The figure is 2.1 million, and we help them do it because we do not search the military planes but give permits for the civilian planes to carry such hardware.  The Minister does not need me to remind him, but when the Labour Party was in opposition it wanted those planes searched.  Why does it not want them searched now?</p></speech>

My first question is about the summit meeting and the Government's view on the position of the Hungarian Government, which, from the outset of this refugee crisis, has been seen to be, to put it mildly, very much removed from the core values of the European Union.  The action and the language articulated by the Prime Minister of Hungary and the sense of putting up the wall to stop genuine refugees fleeing war seems to fly completely in the face of the Geneva Convention and strains the idea of European Union solidarity to its very core.  It seems there has been a reluctance on behalf of the Government to call it as it is.  I do not get a sense of that within the European Union summits or the various meetings that have taken place.  I accept that people have to focus on helping the refugees, but Hungary seems to have set a standard and a pattern that has been very negative in terms of the way the crisis is unfolding, and particularly how Europe's response to the crisis is unfolding.</p>  <p>  My second question relates to the Irish State's support for the camps in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.  As I said earlier, the European Union budget was so restrictive that it has reduced the capacity of the Union as a whole to make substantial provision to improve the quality of life in those camps.  If we did that, it could reduce the need for people to leave the camps for a better quality of life.  Very basic services are not up to standard.  I accept that those countries have taken in millions of people.  How much funding to date have we given to the camps in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey?  Have we a figure for that?  Is the Government considering providing a much greater level of financial support, over and above what we have done to date, to those camps to reduce the numbers fleeing into Europe and to try to improve the overall quality of life, given the difficulty at a European Union budgetary level?  The Taoiseach gave a general figure of approximately &euro;5 million to the UNHCR, but I take it that is ongoing Irish Aid funding.  What is required is an out-of-the-ordinary allocation to deal with the quality of life in the camps.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Turkish situation, is the Minister of State comfortable that we should barter EU membership or access to core policies in return for Turkey's acquiescence in facilitating a better quality of life in the camps?  There is a major geopolitical issue here in terms of Turkey and the European Union, but in more recent times, Turkey's attitude to an independent media, for example, has been worrying.  There is a drift from democratic norms within Turkey, with very little regard for minority rights and so forth.</p>  <p>  Comments were made earlier that I ignored any role of responsibility on the part of Western powers, the EU or the United States in the Middle East.  That is not an accurate depiction of what I said, but I stand over what I said in terms of the reluctance of many to criticise Russia's role in supporting the Assad regime.  There is a tendency in this House to always blame the US to the exclusion of anybody else.  Deputy Wallace spreads the blame around, but there is always a tendency here to do that.  On a range of issues - the partition of Ukraine by the Russians and so on - there is an extraordinary silence on the part of Sinn F&eacute;in.  Obviously, it is developing a very strong relationship with the Russian authorities.</p></speech>

The official position is that it is not helpful in a European context to comment on a position adopted by any particular partner because each member state will have its own national challenges and concerns from its own perspective.  We should understand that, just as we expect Irish views to be respected by others.  However, all actions by the authorities in any member state should respect and reflect the high human rights standards we have in Europe.</p>  <p>  I hear the Deputy's comments in regard to Turkey.  Turkey is a hugely important partner for all of us in the European Union, a point that has come into even sharper focus as we formulate our collective response to the current crisis.  It plays a geographically and politically central role in its region, and as an EU neighbour and candidate country.  It is currently host to well over 2 million refugees; therefore, it is hard to imagine solutions to the crisis which do not involve it substantially.</p>  <p>  The importance of the EU and Turkey working together was clearly recognised in a joint EU-Turkey action plan, which was welcomed at the European Council last Thursday.  No one is under any illusion that it would be anything less than challenging to step up our co-operation, but it is important to engage with Turkey and to help bring about change in that country.  Many of the issues the Deputy raised are relevant.  We hope that rapid progress can be made over the coming period on the issues set out in the action plan.</p>  <p>  It is worth recalling that Turkey is an EU candidate country which has been in accession negotiations since December 2004.  Fourteen out of 34 chapters have been opened for negotiation, of which one has been provisionally closed.  We must also remember that enlargement is a conditional process.  The October European Council endorsed the action plan and called for the accession negotiations to be re-energised.  However, this will only be in accordance with a negotiating framework and the relevant Council conclusions.</p><p> Our funding for refugee camps is handled mainly through the UNHCR World Food Programme.  We have already decided to donate an additional &euro;30 million to our core funding over the next three years.  We are also actively considering additional contributions in the various new EU funds.</p></speech>

We went down to the Syria-Jordan border and we visited the refugee camps there.  There was something rather striking about the whole thing.  There are three different refugee camps in Jordan.  The camp in Amman is where the 1948 Palestinian refugees were put up.  Further south there is another Palestinian refugee camp dating from 1967.  Then there is the Syrian-Palestinian refugee camp on the Syria-Jordan border.  One thing that struck me was that the conditions in the refugee camp there, as bad as they were, were far better than those in the camps dating from 1948 and 1967.  This has been allowed to continue in relative silence and without anything being done, either by Europe or anyone in the so-called developed world.</p>  <p>  Last year, I went to Turkey.  I went on my own.  What struck me most about Turkey was the fact that there are 800,000 Syrian refugees in Istanbul alone.  That was the figure I was given.  I travelled for 17 hours down to the Syrian border where there are more than 1 million people in camps at the moment.  These camps are certainly being used to some extent as a source of recruitment by ISIS and other anti-Assad forces in Syria.  Worse, they are being supported and financed by people who have another agenda.  Obviously, American hardware is being supplied to them.  Some weeks back, while Americans were bombing ISIS in Syria and Iraq, Turkey decided to start bombing the Kurds because they were fighting ISIS, having been supported by the Americans to do so initially.  What is being allowed to happen is absolutely and totally disgraceful.  I suggest we should use whatever influence we have within the EU to try to promote and push an agenda to demilitarise the entire area.  We cannot have a situation whereby we have weapons being supplied by America and its allies to Kurdish fighters to fight ISIS while Turkey, a friend of America, is bombing the same people.  What is happening is absolutely disgraceful.  Growing numbers of refugees are coming from Syria and Iraq.</p>  <p>  Let us not forget that the invasion of Iraq set the whole place alight.  We need to remember that.  At the time, tens of thousands of people took to the streets to oppose it.  The Labour Party vehemently opposed it at the time and I imagine members of the Labour Party were among the marchers.  We now have a situation whereby the Government is silent despite what is happening with Shannon Airport being used for rendition fights and so forth.  The Government silence is deafening.  From a humanitarian perspective, I trust the Minister of State will use his influence to try to ensure the demilitarisation of the area by the superpowers, as they call themselves.  They are only using the Syrian people and refugees throughout the region as cannon fodder.</p></speech>

That is to the credit of the House and the political parties operating within it.  As Deputies will know, throughout Europe there is major resistance and growing xenophobia.  However, in Ireland the pressure and lobbying is for a humanitarian response, with people wanting us to be more generous.  There is no political capital to be gained from the opposite point of view, and that is to our credit as a political collective.  No general election or any election has ever been dominated by the issues of migration, emigration or refugees.  I hope that continues in future.</p>  <p>  Deputy Ferris asked a direct question in respect of Shannon.  This was referenced before by Deputy Wallace.  Foreign military aircraft may be permitted to land in the State on condition that they are unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives, do not engage in intelligence gathering and do not form part of any military exercise or operations.  The US is granted blanket permission for overflights by unarmed military aircraft.  Civil aircraft are prohibited from carrying weapons or munitions through Irish airspace and airports unless an exemption has been obtained in advance from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p>  <p>  I am aware of a recent press release regarding the landing at Shannon Airport of an armed aircraft similar to a type of aircraft which took part in an airstrike.  This took place in September 2013.  Contrary to notification the aircraft was found to be armed with a fixed weapon and did not, therefore, comply with the normal conditions that apply to foreign military aircraft overflying or landing in Ireland.  As the then T&aacute;naiste informed the D&aacute;il on 15 October 2013, this case was raised at the highest possible level with the United States Embassy.  The embassy official explained that this isolated incident had taken place as a result of an administrative error.  Assurances were given that steps had been taken to prevent any recurrence.</p>  <p>  I neglected to answer Deputy Martin's direct question about economic and monetary union and banking union.  We welcome the focus in the report on completing banking union, backstops, bridge financing and revisiting a common deposit reinsurance scheme.  It was regrettable that the reference to a banking union did not feature in the conclusions.  However, we will continue to push for this in further discussions.</p></speech>

It is to the credit of the political class and to Irish society, more to the point, that the overwhelming response to the refugee crisis is one of compassion and solidarity.  I accept that point.  However, the thrust of many of the questions and contributions directed at the Minister of State is to ask why Ireland does not raise its voice more loudly and decisively against the double standards, hypocrisy and sordid manipulation by Western powers in the Middle East and north Africa.  This behaviour created these crises in the first place and they are continuing.  This is not simply an interesting historical point.  However, there is a historical point with regard to the US bombing of Iraq.  Does the Minister of State not accept that, undoubtedly, the bombing of Iraq destabilised the region and unleashed these forces?  Does the Minister of State not accept that the arming, supporting and financing of the Saudi regime has been a contributory factor to the growth and prevalence of some of the worst, most vile and extreme forces in the region which have helped to tear Syria apart?  Does the Government accept that?  If it does, why are we not speaking out more loudly?  Why are we not a voice in Europe calling for the European Union to refuse to do business with Saudi Arabia or sell that country arms?  Why do we continue to trade with these regimes?</p>  <p>  A total of 40 Palestinians have been killed in the past month in an escalation of Israeli and settler violence against the Palestinian population.  Why do we not declare that it is time to say enough is enough, stop treating Israel as a normal state and demand sanctions on Israel?  Why can we not be that voice in Europe?  Why are we afraid to do that?  I suspect that those occupying much of the political spectrum in this country agree with this privately, even if they do not say it publicly.  They know these things to be true.  Why are we doing business with the el-Sisi regime when he is busily crushing all political dissent?  Is it because we can make money out of the beef trade?</p><p>Is that it, with human rights concerns going out the door?  He crushes democracy and civil rights go out the door because we are doing business with him.  If that is not it, can the Minister of State please explain why we do not raise our voices? </p> <p> One of our citizens, Ibrahim Halawa, is suffering in Egypt, but many others are also suffering. It is not just the Muslim Brotherhood.  People involved in campaigns for secular and civil rights, lawyers and people on the left of the political spectrum in Egypt, are in prison because they organised peaceful protests against the el-Sisi regime and face possible execution.  What about the Turkish regime and what it is doing to the Kurds?  We now seem to be willing to shut up about all that because we want to unload the refugee crisis onto Turkey rather than having to deal with it ourselves.

Deputy Boyd Barrett asked me whether I accept that the invasion and bombing of Iraq destabilised the whole region.  On a personal basis, I do, and the question now is what we do from here on.  </p>  <p>  I do not think we have seen anything near the peak of this crisis.  This is the largest movement of human beings across Europe since the Second World War.  In terms of our voice, we raised it within the corridors of power in the EU and will work as a collective within it.  I would not want the Deputy to be under any illusion that we do not do that.  As a collective we are stronger and our voice within the EU will be heard.  </p>  <p>  I am conscious that our response stepped up to the mark and went beyond what was expected of Ireland in terms of our acceptance of 4,000 refugees.  It focused the attention of other countries which were not doing as much as they should have been doing.  I accept that part of the issue in that region is an historic reaction to what happened in the past and that is why we cannot make same mistakes again.</p></speech>

It will be with us for quite a long time.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputies for their comments and questions.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to wrap up the debate on the outcome of the October European Council and touch on some of the issues on the agenda, including some that the Taoiseach did not have time to cover.  </p>  <p>  Many of the contributions focused on the migration crisis, or the refugee crisis, as it should be more appropriately termed.  It is an issue of major concern to everybody in this House and in Ireland.  I reiterate a point made by the Taoiseach, namely, that we want see a comprehensive EU response based on solidarity which balances a compassionate approach with practical measures.  I am pleased to say that Ireland is playing a full part in this response.  In addition to our humanitarian assistance, development aid and the provision of naval vessels for search-and-rescue efforts in the Mediterranean, the Government agreed on 10 September to establish an Irish refugee protection programme and to accept up to 4,000 refugees and asylum seekers overall under the EU resettlement and relocation programme.</p>  <p>  This will not come at any cost to the ongoing issue of addressing the direct provision scandal in Ireland.  Anybody living within those centres should not be under the impression that they will be at a disadvantage because of our humanitarian response to the refugee crisis.  The report of the direct provision working group is being implemented.</p>  <p>  A new cross-departmental task force is being established and is working with NGOs, religious bodies, local authorities and the Red Cross to deal with the operational and logistical aspects of the support programme.  A network of emergency reception and orientation centres is being established for the initial reception of asylum seekers arriving under the relocation programmes.  The Government is also engaging with the public on their generous pledges of support and has tasked the Red Cross with drawing the offers together.  A website has been launched to enable members of the public to formally register their pledges.</p>  <p>  I will move on to a different international issue which the Taoiseach did not have time to touch on.  The European Council took note of the publication of the official Dutch report on the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight airline flight MH17 over Ukraine.  While there was no detailed discussion at the European Council, Ireland underlined the conclusion to reiterate the EU's commitment to hold to account those responsible for this appalling tragedy.  The situation in Ukraine remains one of concern, although there have been signs of some stabilisation recently.  While this is to be welcomed, Ireland's position is that all parties must adhere to the terms of the agreement set out in Minsk if there is to be meaningful progress in addressing the conflict.</p>  <p>  Turning to climate change, the French President updated his colleagues on the conference that will start in Paris on 30 November, bringing together the international community to agree new and enhanced commitments to address climate change.  The EU has already set out an ambitious position in advance of this conference, which is known as COP 21.  Ireland strongly supports an ambitious, legally binding and global agreement with broad participation as the core outcome of the Paris COP.  As part of the EU, Ireland is committed to playing its part in reaching that historic agreement.  I note budget 2015 includes a contribution of &euro;2 million to the green climate fund, which represents the first step in Ireland's longer-term financial engagement.  This is in addition to our Irish Aid activities which involve working closely with developing partner countries on resilience to climate change and to which we contributed some &euro;33 million last year.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputies for their questions and contributions and for the attention of the Acting Chairman.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for the changes made to the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015, which exempt community child care facilities from paying commercial rates to local authorities, a major advantage to these very valuable child care facilities that provide great services to local communities.  Many members of the House, including me, have lobbied on this issue for some years.  </p>  <p>  The Valuation Office is currently implementing the new provisions contained in the Act.  From now on they will be of great benefit to voluntary community child care groups.  However, they do not come into place until 2015 for 2016 rates.  The Minister of State will appreciate the large amount of voluntary work that went into setting up and running these facilities.  The expenses incurred have put significant financial pressure on these groups, yet despite this local authorities are still pursuing the collection of rates arrears. </p>  <p>  The changes made in the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 imply that these facilities should not have been rated in the first instance.</p><p>Considering the major contribution made by the voluntary sector to child care, and in light of the recent budget and the new emphasis on expanding the service, we should consider issuing guidelines to all local authorities which would immediately allow them to write off outstanding rates.  I understand this would have to come from the Department, and clarification on this matter would be of major assistance to these groups.  It would allow them to get their finances in order and help them improve and expand their services.</p> <p> Many of these facilities employ local women, who might work part-time, and they give back a significant amount to their communities.  They also help women get back to work through providing affordable child care.  The cost of these child care facilities is probably a little less than the cost of other child care facilities.  They provide an all-in-one service as they are usually open very early in the morning and also provide after-school care for children.  This is a great facility for parents who work, many of whom travel long distances and are not home until 7 p.m.  It is a significant onus on them.</p> <p> These are not-for-profit organisations which are barely keeping going.  Some of them are looking at expanding in light of the budget announcement last week and will do so over the coming years.  Many of them throughout the country are in arrears with rates and while they are trying their best to pay them, it would be a great relief and a major burden off their shoulders if we could address this issue and give clarification on it to the local authorities.  I am sure they would be happy to do it, but it is outside their remit in some regards because all they do is collect the rates.  Will the Minister consider giving clarification to the local authorities that it would be acceptable for them to allow these facilities not to pay their arrears in light of the new valuation legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-20a.361" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1092" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="19:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000038#LL00200"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and I am replying on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Kelly.  Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001.  The Commissioner of Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters.  The Valuation Act 2001 comes under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  I am aware the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform included an amendment in the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 to provide for an exemption from rates for properties occupied by parties that provide early childhood care and education on a not-for-profit basis.  This extension of the child care and education exemption removed an anomaly that existed whereby those that provided child care and education on a charitable basis were exempt but those that did so on a not-for-profit basis were not.</p>  <p>  I understand the Valuation Office is in the process of updating valuation lists to give effect to this extension of the exemption so it will be effective for qualifying providers in 2016.  The Valuation Offices interpretation of paragraph 10 of Schedule 4 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 means that those that only provide the early childhood care and education scheme are also exempt from rates.</p>  <p>  The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.  In accordance with section 29 of the Local Government Act 1946, as amended, local authorities are obliged to make one rate for the whole financial year.  This must be levied upon those liable for rates according to the valuation of each premises contained in the latest valuation list transmitted by the Commissioner of Valuation at the time of the adoption of the budget by the council.  The annual budget is adopted before the start of each financial year.  Rates bills issued to ratepayers in the current year are not subject to amendment by any alteration of valuations within that year.  These remain a liability for the business under ratings legislation and it is a matter for the local authority to manage the collection of any outstanding debt.</p>  <p>  Commercial rates income makes a significant contribution to the current funding requirements of local authorities.  However, local authorities recognise that these are difficult economic times for many businesses, and they work closely with ratepayers experiencing difficulty in the payment of commercial rates.  In this regard, local authorities are facilitating the payment of commercial rates by instalments and will work with businesses to put in place flexible payment options that reflect the capacity to pay.</p></speech>

I also compliment the local authorities, which are very flexible, and I understand that rates make a significant contribution to paying for the cost of footpaths, lighting and all of the other great facilities our local authorities provide.  However, my understanding is that according to the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 there was an anomaly and these facilities should never have been rated.  While I appreciate it is the job of local authorities to collect the rates, they can only collect those covered by legislation.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister consider writing to the local authorities to state that where community child care facilities are in arrears, they should not have to pay them because of the extra strain?  I am very much aware the local authorities are very flexible in helping businesses to pay their rates, particularly in light of the economic times we have all come through, but these are not-for-profit facilities which are now exempt from rates.  There was an anomaly in the legislation which unfortunately took quite a number of years to rectify.  I appreciate what the Minister has done in clarifying this, finally, after much lobbying.  I again ask whether it is possible for the Minister to consider writing to the local authorities and asking them to waive these arrears.</p></speech>

The Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015, to which Deputy has referred, is under the remit of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  It provides for an exception from rates for properties occupied by parties which provide early childhood care and education on a not-for-profit basis.</p>  <p>  The Minister welcomes the extension of the exemption to not-for-profit child care, as it will bring a consistency of approach to a subset of the child care sector while respecting the principle that those who operate with the intention of making a profit remain rateable.  As I stated, this exemption will be reflected in the ratepayers' bills from 2016.  With regard to the outstanding rates to which the Deputy referred and the liabilities which accrue and are owed by businesses which will become exempt or partially exempt in future, the management of the collection of this debt is entirely and solely a matter for the local authorities.  This is the situation.  The Minister and the Department do not have a direct role in this.  It is a matter for the local authorities.  While I am sympathetic to what the Deputy has outlined, those businesses should engage with the relevant local authority in respect of the liabilities.</p></speech>

This is a very important issue.  Kerry Flyer has done excellent work in County Kerry over many years in providing much-needed transport which would not otherwise have been provided.  Unfortunately, over the past while it has begun to tender and compete for work which had been done for decades by other private contractors.  There have been instances in our county involving family businesses which have had school runs for 30, 35 or 40 years and were highly regarded in the locality.  We feel it is unfair that Kerry Flyer can come in and take this work by tendering at a lower price, quite simply because it is subsidised.  The Minister of State cannot get away from this fact.  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission must look at it closely.  If someone is being subsidised to do work and someone else receives no subsidy, grant or assistance it is a no-brainer that the subsidised person will be able to be more competitive, but it is not fair.  Somebody must look at this.</p>  <p>  I thank Deputy Martin Ferris very much for his strong interest and work on this issue along with myself.  We are highly concerned about what is happening in County Kerry.  We really appreciate the private contractors for the work they have done.  They have given excellent service.</p><p>Now, all their hard work is being taken away from them.  I want Kerry Flyer to continue working and running its service but I also want our private bus contractors to continue running their services.  Surely common sense can prevail.  I again thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this debate.</p></speech>

These people lost their jobs as a result of the tendering process, and they argued very eloquently that the process took place on an uneven playing pitch.  Kerry Flyer, which has entered the market, tendered for eight bus runs and it was successful in five of those.  That means five operators lost their jobs.  I say it was an unequal competition because the State has subsidised Kerry Flyer with considerable funding over the years, particularly in the past two years, with &euro;180,000 in 2014 and &euro;174,000 this year; it will get &euro;174,000 next year.  This money has been awarded and some of it has been paid.  The company may use some of the money for drivers, insurance, diesel, running costs such as maintenance and servicing and motor tax.  One must also consider that Kerry Flyer has another advantage in its charitable status, meaning somebody must compete with that.  Five operators are gone out of business as a consequence.</p>  <p>  We suggested that these people should go to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  They did so and received a straightforward reply that from the information available, it did not find in the operators' favour.  The commission indicated its "considerable" interest from the advocacy perspective and that it is currently preparing practical guidelines for policymakers to assist them in assessing proposals that may have implications for competition.  It is clear that the commission is indicating that the policymakers - those of in the Chamber - are not living up to our obligations and responsibilities.</p></speech>

As they know, Bus &Eacute;ireann operates the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department and it is a matter for Bus &Eacute;ireann to make suitable arrangements for the procurement of contractors to provide services on its behalf for school transport purposes, taking cognisance of public procurement requirements.</p>  <p>  Almost 90% of the vehicles used to deliver school transport services are provided by private operators under contract to Bus &Eacute;ireann, which consist predominantly of smaller vehicles and includes over 800 taxis.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is obliged to tender all works, goods and services in line with the European directives on public procurement, including the services provided on its behalf under the school transport scheme.  The procedure is a two-stage pre-qualification, PQQ, and tendering process separated out with different closing dates and times, conducted in accordance with the negotiated procedure under EU Directive 2004/17/EC.  A contractor that satisfies the criteria set out in the PQQ will be invited to tender stage.</p>  <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann has confirmed that on the basis of legal advice, the recipient of Government funding cannot be automatically excluded from participating in a public procurement tender competition.  In these circumstances and with respect to Kerry school bus contractors, it is not open to Bus &Eacute;ireann to exclude Kerry Flyer from this public procurement competition on the basis that it receives Government funding.  I understand from Bus &Eacute;ireann that Kerry Flyer was awarded five operating routes for the provision of school transport services for children with special educational needs in the tender competition for the provision of school transport services, fifth cycle.  Bus &Eacute;ireann further advise that these services are currently operating successfully.</p>  <p>  I know a number of people have raised concerns but we must work this within procurement rules.  Receipt of Government funding does not preclude the company from the process.</p></speech>

I am asking, in a very straightforward way, if it is right that one group of people which is tendering is State-subsidised, leaving the group with an unfair advantage over private operators.  In the tender document, did that group declare if it was in receipt of State funding, as it was required to do?  The Department has stated that no funding was used but the funding provided goes to support the salaries of the manager and staff, who in turn support the administration of the school contracts.  The question must be asked as to whether the company will employ additional drivers to deliver these services or use drivers who currently deliver its own programme.</p>  <p>  If the latter is the case, the company has an unfair competitive edge over private operators, which cannot subsidise employees without State funding.  It is wrong.  The Minister of State is a fair-minded man and can see the point we are making.  What is happening now is not fair or right.  There must be a rule somewhere that illustrates how this is not on at all.</p></speech>

Money has been supplied to Kerry Flyer, such as &euro;180,861 in 2014, for staff, including a driver.  I do not know if the driver was driving the bus.  It is noted as "operational funding" and it is clear that this can be used for motor tax, insurance, diesel and maintenance and repairs of the vehicle.  In 2015, some &euro;174,000 was allocated, and this will be repeated in 2016.  That is the current position.</p>  <p>  Many of the private contractors borrowed money to upgrade vehicles, in some cases making them wheelchair accessible, etc.  They invested much money but these people are out of work because State funding is being used by an organisation.  It is unfair competition at the very least.  Having charitable status means the company is not obliged to pay tax but private companies must do so.  They cannot compete as a result.</p></speech>

There is no issue in that regard and I understand what the Deputies are trying to say.  They have asked about specific tender details but I do not have those documents and am not privy to them.  I can try to see if I can get some information to enlighten the Deputies on the policy.</p>  <p>  The difficulty is that Bus &Eacute;ireann must operate within the rules, as the Deputies can appreciate.  Those rules currently do not allow Bus &Eacute;ireann to exclude Kerry Flyer or any other social enterprise solely because it has received Government funding.  The procurement issue is that it cannot be prevented from tendering, and the company won the tender.</p>  <p>  I will certainly get some of the answers to the Deputies' questions.  Deputy Healy-Rae asked if there is some rule against this somewhere but there is none of which I am aware.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has taken strong legal advice and it is within the rules.  The company can also see the points being made and everybody can appreciate the logic.  The rules allow for this and Bus &Eacute;ireann has no choice but to allow Kerry Flyer and other groups to tender for the routes.  The rules are implemented in the same way throughout the country, and there are many rules concerning school transport that people may not like in a local area.  They are the same throughout the country and they must be implemented in a standard way across the board.</p>  <p>  I see the point made by the Deputies and I will certainly try to get the information they seek.  I have not seen the contracts and that is not something that would come across my desk.  It is the job of Bus &Eacute;ireann to analyse the tenders within the rules of the policies set out.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-20a.376" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1071" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="19:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000039#MM01000"><p>I thank Deputy Keating.  This evening, we note the loss of Mr. Hugh Cooney, the former chairman of Enterprise Ireland, who did massive work for this country in that role and, more particularly in the past number of weeks, as an advocate of better health care particularly for men.  I pay tribute to him and mark his passing.  We had the Enterprise Ireland management team with us today at the enterprise committee and they reflected on a very successful 2014.  Many of the initiatives that drove that success were ideas or visions that Mr. Cooney, as chairman, put in place.  It is a very sad night and we wish his family, friends and colleagues every good wish at this incredibly difficult time.</p><p> The coverage of last week's budget focused on some welcome initiatives for the self-employed, namely, the tax-free allowance and some other issues, but it gave the impression that it was a bumper budget, particularly for the self-employed, when the reality is very different.  A comparison of the likely outturn of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation's budget this year versus what is promised next year shows a &euro;44 million cut.  There is no increase in the budget for the new local enterprise offices, even though they have all hit the ground running in their localities and are generating more activity.  That was some of the feedback from our meeting today.</p> <p> There has also been a cut in capital funding for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta and there is significant confusion and frustration in Gaeltacht communities regarding the role of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s, its interaction with other agencies and the lack of support available to Gaeltacht areas from other enterprise agencies.</p> <p> The capital gains reduction for entrepreneurs is welcome, but it is still far off the mark compared with what is happening in Northern Ireland and in England.  We are increasingly in competition with the Six Counties and with England, Scotland and Wales for people to establish businesses.  The tax arrangements in those other jurisdictions are far stronger and more encouraging than those here.</p> <p> The employment investment incentive scheme continues to be a drag and continues not to work.  We are continuing to tinker with it, but it is still not taking hold.  The Minister of State knows that too.</p> <p> There is the whole issue around the credit guarantee scheme amendment Bill.  The credit guarantee scheme was first independently identified as having issues in October 2012, even though we had been pointing out those issues for some time.  We are three years in now.  I know the delay is not in the Department, but, apparently, in the drafting office in the Attorney General's office.  However, it is not good enough, because there are specific provisions within the credit guarantee scheme amendment Bill to allow businesses that are restructuring their finance because the banks are exiting the market to access the guarantee fund.  They cannot do that until this legislation is passed.  Many businesses - the Minister of State and the Chairman do not need to be told this - are being forced into a position of refinancing their packages because their banks are exiting.  There are so many issues.</p> <p> The changes to employer PRSI go nowhere towards covering the increase in the minimum wage and many employers are going to be out of pocket.  We welcome the increase, but the manner in which the changes to PRSI are being made will leave many employers out of pocket.  I encourage the Minister of State to look at that in the context of the Social Welfare Bill.  Finally, when we look at the range submitted by the Department and the Minister of State as part of the ministerial team to the Department of Finance, we have to ask about the influence of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation at the Department of Finance.  Given that many of the proposals the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation submitted came from our committee or from its engagement with businesses all over the country, an engagement that has not been had in the Department of Finance, there is a great deal of frustration at issues like finance and supports within the business community at the moment.  There is a need for a signal that those frustrations will be taken seriously.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-20a.378" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1078" speakername="Damien English" time="19:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000040#NN00200"><p>I join Deputy Calleary and other members of the committee in offering condolences to the family of Mr. Hugh Cooney.  The impact he had when it came to enterprise development and job creation goes without saying.  He had a major influence on policy in that respect.  I agree with Deputy Calleary and second his good wishes to his family at this time.  It is a difficult time for them, but we recognise the work carried out by Hugh over the years.</p>  <p>  The initial topic of debate was the supports and measures taken to encourage start-ups and entrepreneurship.  That is a key part of what we are trying to do in Government.  The first entrepreneurship strategy was produced by this Government.  There were many Governments that went before it, made up of all the parties represented here tonight, which did not bother producing an entrepreneurship strategy, plan or policy statement.  The idea of that is to focus the needs and concerns of all Government Departments, including the Departments of Education and Science and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, on what needs to be done to drive a new culture of entrepreneurship.  That will feed into successful start-ups now and in the future.  It is an important step and there is an implementation body behind that, chaired by the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton.  There were 96 actions across that policy statement and we are making progress on all of them.  They are all part of the wider drive to support entrepreneurship.  I know the Deputy also wants to focus on the budget, so I will come back to that, but there is a recognition that we have to do that and change the culture.  I recognise that too.  The enterprise committee had a role in some of the actions.  Mr. John O'Sullivan chaired an initial forum to fit into the strategy that produced that document.  Many key actions in that have been implemented, and rightly so.  Key parts of that are mentoring, access to finance and a culture change to encourage people to think of being an entrepreneur.  That is why we had the start-up gathering in early October, to drive that thinking and to advertise what is available to the start-up community, both locally and internationally.  The start-up gathering had a big impact throughout the country, with over 400 events to get the message out that we are supporting start-ups.</p>  <p>  The budget must be seen in context.  I see it as a step in the right direction.  It does not do enough for anybody in any sector, but it is a show of intent, to start pointing in the right direction that we want to do much more for entrepreneurs and for those who are in business.  We had the new tax credit and we have committed to closing that gap over the next three years.  Maybe if the economy allows it, we will close it more quickly.  Why was it there in the first place?  This is the first opportunity the Government has had to correct it.  It is a signal of intent.  It is worth &euro;550 this year and we are committed to changing that in the next two years, so it is a very clear issue.</p>  <p>  On capital gains, we know it does not go far enough to compete with our competitors.  However, one must also review how it started in the UK.  The tax percentage was higher, but there was always a &euro;1 million level as well.  That has increased in the UK.  Likewise, I would see it as something we want to progress here.  It starts at &euro;1 million.  We have a finance Bill and we can discuss it then and hopefully we can increase it over the years ahead as well.  The 20% rate is a big improvement on the 33% rate.  I understand what Deputy Calleary is saying, that it is not enough when compared to the UK or across the Border, but we have to accept that, again, this is a budget that tries to put us on the right footing.  There is no magic pen to do everything we want to do in one year and one budget.  We are signalling our intent of where we are hoping to go with this.</p>  <p>  There are many offerings available to start-ups and existing businesses to encourage them to increase employment.  Over 70% of businesses say they are confident they will increase the numbers they employ this year or next year.  Supports are in place to encourage them to do that, including JobsPlus.  There were different schemes over the years.  Recommendations came from the committee to make it simpler and more straightforward and now it is quite straightforward for companies to say: "We will employ somebody off the live register.  There is a grant for that and we will avail of it."  There are many supports there.  There have been 1,000 actions over the past three and a half years on the Action Plan for Jobs process.  Over 90% of them are directly useful to SMEs, start-ups and companies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-20a.379" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1071" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="19:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000040#NN00300"><p>I welcomed the policy statement on entrepreneurship at the time, but when another wing of the Minister of State's Department, the National Competitiveness Council, published the Irish competitiveness scorecard in 2015, it said that "elements of Ireland&rsquo;s environment for entrepreneurship are relatively poor in an international competitiveness context; in particular, reducing the time and complexity of procedures associated with enterprise start-up".  That was published some nine months after the enterprise strategy was published.</p>  <p>  Second, the small business review group identified several issues.  One of them, as the Minister will remember from his time as chairman of the enterprise committee, was the whole area of personal guarantees and the continued insistence of banks on personal guarantees from entrepreneurs who want to start up a business or grow a company.  Has there been any action on that?  I recall the Minister of State once described as archaic the fact that we are one of the few countries in the world that still insist on people doing that.  What is the position on the proposed change in bankruptcy laws?  Will it be done before the Government finishes up?</p>  <p>  The Minister of State will know that I am really passionate about the area of entrepreneurship in education and I welcome the young entrepreneur programme.  That has taken off very well and I see it invading schools in the same way the green flag project has done for the environment in schools.  In terms of the curriculum review of entrepreneurship in schools, it cannot be taught; it must be fostered.  The practicals, the encouragement and the experience of entrepreneurship cannot be learned from a book or learned by rote.  It must be fostered and created.  What supports are both the Minister of State's Departments putting in place to get some sort of cohesive sense of fostering an entrepreneurship culture in our schools?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-20a.380" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1078" speakername="Damien English" time="19:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000040#NN00400"><p>A couple of issues were raised there.  First, I want to go back to the credit guarantee scheme.  It is a priority of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to bring that in.</p><p>On the issue of entrepreneurship in education, the entrepreneurship strategy singled out very clearly six top priorities, of which education is one.  It cannot just be addressed in second or third level; it has to start at primary level.</p><p>A proper strategy will be put in place.  I am very interested in getting this correct at primary and secondary levels and in third level education as well because, as Deputy Calleary correctly stated, we want to develop a culture of entrepreneurship.  One cannot merely teach it.  It must be part of one's ecosystem and education as well.  That is a key priority also.</p> <p> There were two other key questions.  Deputy Calleary mentioned the regional plans but he failed to mention the local enterprise offices, LEOs, which are doing great work.  There is funding to continue the great work LEOs are doing and to increase and expand their services also.</p> <p> Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, is also doing great work and encouraging more SMEs to get involved in the research community.  That also brings me back to the knowledge patent box, or "knowledge box".  There is an impression that the knowledge box is not for small Irish companies.  That is completely untrue.  Over 2,000 companies on a yearly basis avail of the research and development grant and they are well able to use the knowledge development box to add to what they offer and increase their products and services, and sales.  That is to encourage start-ups.</p> <p> We are very much focused on start-ups and supporting businesses.  The supporting SMEs online tool goes through in detail the 80 different Government supports that are available.  I keep stressing to companies that it is difficult to give financial supports to companies that compete with each other on the high street.  This is why many supports are directed to companies which export, and that is what we are trying to do.  The internationalising agenda is our major focus and most companies understand that now.  However, there is a range of soft supports available to encourage those companies to grow.  Even the online tool is available in that regard.  There are many issues there.</p> <p>  There is a competitive fund set up under the regional plans.  Local areas, counties or regions can come together to avail of and compete for those funds to be able to back up something that they are doing well locally.  That is another major area that we will be funding.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-20a.383" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="19:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000041#OO00300"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the payment by the Minister for Finance, pursuant to section 46(1) of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014, from the Central Fund to the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund of &euro;335,272,562.50 (three-hundred and thirty-five million, two-hundred and seventy-two thousand, five-hundred and sixty-two euro and fifty cent) being the amount of the funds derived from the proceeds of the sale of the State's shareholding in Aer Lingus.</blockquote><p>In May, the Government decided to sell the State's minority shareholding in Aer Lingus.  This decision was made on the basis of it being the best means of securing and enhancing Ireland's connectivity with the rest of the world and also to help maintain a vibrant and competitive air transport sector in Ireland.  The sale also served the interests of the travelling public, Aer Lingus and its employees, the tourism sector and the economy as a whole.  The sale culminated with the lodgement of the &euro;335 million proceeds with the Exchequer on 2 September last.  Today, we are not here to debate the decision to sell but rather to debate how these funds will be used.</p><p>It has been the consistent policy of the Government that proceeds received from the sale of assets should be used to support and sustain economic recovery and employment creation.  However, under EUROSTAT rules, the proceeds arising from the sale of the State's shareholding in Aer Lingus, representing the sale of a financial asset, will have no beneficial impact on Ireland's general Government balance and, therefore, will not provide any capacity for additional Government expenditure on a general Government balance neutral basis.</p><p>It is for this reason that the Government also decided as part of the decision in May to allocate the proceeds to a special connectivity fund, which will operate on a commercial basis and, therefore, will not constitute Government expenditure, but will facilitate the re-use of the proceeds for productive purposes under the connectivity rubric on a general Government balance neutral basis.  The connectivity fund will be a sub-portfolio of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  Given that the proceeds came from the sale of the State's stake in a transport asset, the fund will be dedicated to enhancing connectivity both within and for the State.</p><p>ISIF will continue to develop and refine the definition and range of investments suited to investment by the connectivity fund.  A working definition for the initial stage of deployment is that connectivity assets are those that &quot;enhance, develop or sustain the physical and virtual connectivity of Ireland as an island nation&quot;.  The connectivity fund will operate on a commercial basis, providing support for commercial investment projects with a connectivity theme, such as the development of ports or airports, including access to these transport assets.  It will also be open to provide support for projects that involve a wider definition of connectivity, including, for example, data connectivity such as broadband, fibre optic cables and interconnectors, and energy connectivity such as energy inter-connectors and other energy related projects.  These wider connectivity requirements are becoming increasingly important elements of our core infrastructure and will be extremely important to a more balanced regional development.</p><p>The decision to set up the fund within the ISIF is a sensible one as the fund already has the appropriate governance arrangements in place.  The investment criteria used to assess investment opportunities for the connectivity fund will be entirely consistent with the ISIF mandate, which is to invest on a commercial basis in a manner designed to support economic activity and employment in the State.  The success of the connectivity fund will be measured by both investment returns and economic impact achieved.  The connectivity fund, like the ISIF, will be a long-term fund deployment on a phased basis, driven by the investment opportunities identified, and returns are likely to accrue over the medium and longer term.</p><p>As a small and open economy, Ireland is dependent on the international market place to sell our goods and services.  The connectivity fund can be used as an important tool to provide links with our international trading partners.  The fund will also be used to improve regional infrastructure to promote balanced regional development.</p><p>The decision to use the proceeds from the sale of Aer Lingus for productive investment in connectivity-related projects will provide an opportunity to: enhance our regional connectivity; improve our attractiveness and competitiveness in the tourism sector; and promote investment and enhanced opportunities for growth.</p><p>Under section 46 of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014, I am empowered to bring a resolution to the Houses of the Oireachtas setting out the proposed payment to the ISIF.  I urge the House to support this resolution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-20a.384" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="19:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000041#OO00400"><p>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion related to the establishment of a connectivity fund within the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund using the proceeds from the sale of a stake in Aer Lingus.</p>  <p>  I must reiterate at the outset that Fianna F&aacute;il opposed the opportunistic bid by IAG for Aer Lingus which was tabled just after the restructuring of the company's pension scheme.  It is important to recall that the retired and former staff members in the IASS pension scheme were treated very badly.  No sale would have been possible without the pushing through of the restructuring of the pension scheme.  My colleague, Senator Darragh O'Brien, has worked with others in leading the fight on behalf of the current and deferred pensioners and he has consistently made the important point that the State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014 was the first time in the history of the State that a Government introduced legislation to change a specific private pension scheme.  The legislation reduced pensions and payments to retired members by six weeks per annum and long-term deferred members' pensions by up to 60%.  It also transferred existing members to an inferior pension scheme.  The Fianna F&aacute;il Party will continue to push for a fair and equitable solution to the IASS pension dispute.</p>  <p>  In addition, there remains serious doubt about the Government claim to have extracted legally binding connectivity commitments.  It remains to be seen if these stand up in practice, particularly if the IAG group runs in to future difficulties.</p>  <p>  I agree with the Minister that this is not a rerunning of the debate on the sale of the stake in Aer Lingus.  However, today's debate can change neither the reality of the sale of Aer Lingus nor the fact that the Aer Lingus sale price of &euro;2.55 per share was 15% less than the &euro;3 per share value suggested by independent analysts.  This follows similar poor outcomes in terms of value for money in the sale of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, Irish Life and the partial disposal of Bank of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Government has consistently sought to avoid scrutiny of the impact of this privatisation programme on consumers, employees, the long-term interests of the State and how the proceeds are deployed.  The Oireachtas needs to be able to evaluate the impact of the sale of State assets once the dust has settled.  For example, the sale of the national lottery licence was notionally to fund the construction of the children's hospital but this has been subject to one delay after another.  We cannot allow this to happen again on this occasion.</p>  <p>  Now that the Aer Lingus sale has been completed, it is imperative that the funds raised are put to the best possible use.  We probably should be grateful that EUROSTAT rules do not permit the Government to spend the proceeds in one fell swoop.  Were that possible, they would surely be tempted to engage in pre-election spending.</p><p> Investment in our national infrastructure is vital to sustaining economic recovery, particularly at regional level.  The capital budget has been cut too far and has been reduced to dangerously low levels.  The proposed connectivity fund will go a small way towards addressing this.  The fund is limited by the commercial mandate to which it must operate and, therefore, is not a replacement for direct Exchequer funding for much needed communications infrastructure projects.  It will, therefore, be important to establish the evaluation process which the fund will use for projects.  In so far as possible, clear investment guidelines are needed to ensure stakeholders clearly understand what can and cannot be done by the fund.  It cannot be allowed to turn into a fund to re-elect any party or Government.</p> <p> The fund should report as regularly as possible on the projects it is undertaking and the returns they are generating.  The fund will make commercial decisions independently.  We need never forget that the value of Aer Lingus was built up over generations.  The proceeds must be used responsibly and accordingly.  The regional airport network is particularly important to balanced regional economic development.  The sheer dominance of Dublin Airport has put other airports, including Cork and Shannon, at a serious disadvantage.  The fund should be deployed as strategically as possible to give these airports and Knock Airport a fighting chance of competing commercially.  This will enhance the ability to attract and retain industry throughout the country.</p> <p> The national broadband network also has significant problems particularly in rural areas and 4G mobile phone coverage needs to be considerably improved.  This should and can also be addressed in a commercial manner by the connectivity fund.  While it is not a life changing amount of money, it is a significant sum.  It is important that it be spent wisely.  It may be some years before we know for sure if this has happened.  I wish the NTMA and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund well in its endeavours and I am sure they will use the fund wisely to improve on our connectivity across a number of different aspects.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-20a.386" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1022" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="19:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000042#PP00200"><p>First, I will comment on how the debate has been scheduled.  The provision of just five minutes per speaker on such an important topic is very disappointing, particularly given that it will pass through the Seanad without even any nod to a debate.  The discussion on the distribution of &euro;335 million from the controversial sale of the State's share in Aer Lingus warrants a real debate.  Aer Lingus was, and remains, an important link with the rest of the world.  Aer Lingus is a strategic asset which the Government chose to sell for a fraction of its true value.  The decision was made well before any real offer was made back in 2012.  From then, it was a matter of time.</p>  <p>  Connectivity is essential for Ireland as an island nation.  The idea that a one-time pay off into a fund will do the same job Aer Lingus did for many years is hard to swallow.  It is particularly hard to swallow now that we know it was not true that Aer Lingus's Heathrow slots were protected indefinitely.  It was said to have been a major success in the negotiations over the sell-off of the State's stake.  Although we were told Ireland's connectivity through Aer Lingus was secured by the agreement, it is clear that the retention of the slots is time limited.  Ireland will still be an island nation in seven years.  That it will be a nation with access to slots in Heathrow and other airports on which we depend is less certain.  Given Willie Walsh's desire, which he repeatedly stated, to have more Heathrow slots for the Far East and South America routes, it is very doubtful that we will retain the slots.</p>  <p>  Any assurances on the future use of the Heathrow slots will disappear when the seven-year period has elapsed.  When IAG shareholders' interests become paramount, the interests of the Irish people will take a back seat, at best.  This also causes grave concern among Aer Lingus workers, who fear the prospect of compulsory redundancies.  Registered employment agreements, REA, legislation has still not been put through the House, and I wonder whether it will happen before the D&aacute;il is dissolved.  The Nyras report still hangs over workers' heads in the context of new management, who have a history of mass sackings, as was seen in the case of Iberia.  They are also, understandably, worried about the inevitable restructuring that will take place in Aer Lingus under the IAG umbrella.</p>  <p>  We have seen in recent years how the private profit interests of shareholders left deferred pensioners reeling as they were forced to accept massive cuts to their pensions.  The Government's applause is not enough to distract from the continuing unjust treatment of the deferred members of the Aer Lingus pension scheme.  They have had no resolution, hope or recognition in this whole situation.  The Minister is well aware of the issue, having met with representatives of the 1,500 deferred pensioners who had received letters of comfort from Aer Lingus.  After great service, they were told their pensions and entitlements were secure, only to be betrayed.  Their pensions have been halved, and this has been underpinned by legislation penned by the Government in the State Airports Act.  These workers deserve better than this treatment, better than the Government.</p>  <p>  The matter is unresolved.  This unjust treatment goes on while the Government schedules for the House to plan the distribution of the spoils of the betrayal of the workers and Ireland's strategic interest in Aer Lingus.  While there is no resolution to the deferred members pension scandal, there should be no move to spend these proceeds elsewhere.  I oppose this and will call a vote.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-20a.389" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="20:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000044#RR00200"><p>I move:</p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:calls on the Government to establish a Commission of Investigation under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 with regard to the sale of Project Eagle by the National Asset Management Agency.</blockquote><p>There is simply no room whatsoever for any question marks when we talk about the sale of a State asset with a face value of over &euro;5 billion, but shocking allegations have been made regarding NAMA's disposal of its Project Eagle portfolio.  NAMA's Project Eagle sale of loans with a face value of &pound;4.5 billion, or &euro;5.4 billion, linked to Northern Ireland borrowers was announced in April 2014 and was the biggest sale since the agency was established in 2009.  NAMA had paid &euro;2 billion for the loans originally, and despite the fact that they were acquired at such a substantial discount on their face value, NAMA nevertheless agreed to sell them on at an even lower price of &euro;1.6 billion, representing a further loss of &euro;400 million for the taxpayer.  </p><p>The US private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management bought the Project Eagle portfolio of loans secured on around 850 property assets, ranging from development land to state-of-the-art office blocks.  The loans had been grouped together based on their connection to 55 Northern-Ireland-based debtors.  Around half of the assets securing debts in the portfolio are in Northern Ireland, with the rest spread across this jurisdiction, the UK and the rest of Europe: 7% of the assets disposed of are located in the Republic, 50% in Northern Ireland and 37% in the rest of the UK.  Clearly, therefore, Project Eagle did not just relate to Northern Ireland properties, which has often been said.  </p><p>The law firm Brown Rudnick had been expressing a client's interest in purchasing the portfolio since at least June 2013.  In September 2013 the firm made an unsolicited approach to NAMA to express the interest of its client, Pimco, in acquiring the portfolio.  Pimco wanted a closed sale without an open tendering process, and in December 2013 it submitted a bid for the portfolio.  The reaction of the board of NAMA was to decide to sell the portfolio but in an openly marketed, competitive sales process.  Up until this point, Mr. Frank Cushnahan had been a member of NAMA's Northern Ireland advisory committee, stepping down on 7 November 2013.  It has been alleged in this House that he had confidential information regarding Project Eagle and that it was discussed in detail a month before his departure at a meeting on 7<sup></sup>October 2013.  Four months after the decision had been made to offer the portfolio for sale, Pimco disclosed to NAMA that its proposed fee arrangement with Brown Rudnick included payments to Belfast firm Tughans but also to Frank Cushnahan, who had just stepped down from the NAMA advisory committee.  NAMA acted immediately and the next day decided at the highest level that Pimco must withdraw from the sales process voluntarily or be removed unilaterally by NAMA.</p><p>Over the course of the sales process, a list of nine potential bidders was narrowed down to just three: Pimco, Cerberus and Fortress Investments.  Pimco stepped back from the process and Cerberus won the sales process.  This was announced on 4 April 2014.  Cerberus submitted a bid of &pound;1.24 billion sterling and Fortress Investments offered &pound;1.1 billion sterling.  Remarkably, the successful bidder Cerberus also used the services of Brown Rudnick, which was to share its fee for this with Tughans.  The fees were in part for what has been described as &quot;strategic advice&quot;.  Fees of almost &euro;8 million were also paid to Tughans as payment for legal work relating to title documents and due diligence.  NAMA received confirmation from Cerberus that no fees were to be paid to anyone with a connection to NAMA, but somehow &pound;7 million sterling of fees was diverted from Tughans to an offshore account in the Isle of Man, under the sole control of Tughans' former managing partner Ian Coulter.  Allegations have been made in this House that these funds were earmarked for a prominent Northern Irish politician, but no evidence has been advanced to back this up.  Mr. Coulter has denied that the funds were destined for either himself or a Northern Ireland politician, but has not disclosed whom they were to be paid to.  Intriguingly, Mr. Coulter has stated that the money had been diverted for &quot;a complex, commercially and legally sensitive&quot; reason but has not yet offered a more detailed explanation, at least in public.  Mr. Coulter has now left Tughans and the money has been transferred back to the firm, which has reported the matter to the Law Society of Northern Ireland.</p><p>It has further been alleged in this House that &pound;45 million sterling was paid over to so-called &quot;fixers&quot; who would give developers the opportunity to purchase back their loans at half their face value, something that NAMA would be legally precluded from facilitating.  A further allegation is that Frank Cushnahan also organised a secret meeting between Pimco and the North's First Minister, Peter Robinson, while he was still an adviser to NAMA.  The National Asset Management Agency Act does not permit NAMA to sell assets back to borrowers where those borrowers are in default.  There is a disturbing inference from some of these allegations that investment funds purchasing NAMA assets would seek to profit from exploiting the fact that they would not be bound by the provisions of the aforementioned Act.</p><p>All of this will be a cause for concern for the unsuccessful underbidder, Fortress, which I understand may be contemplating possible litigation relating to the Project Eagle sales process.  While it is not directly related, an example of similar litigation is the case that I understand was lodged in the High Court today, whereby Patrick McKillen is suing IBRC, NAMA, the Minister for Finance and a number of other individuals, alleging misfeasance in public office <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the handling of his loans.</p><p>NAMA has ultimate responsibility for the integrity of the entire Project Eagle transaction, both North and South.  Its role must be the subject of a commission of investigation in this jurisdiction to ensure no question marks hang over NAMA's largest sale of assets to date.<b></b>In its evidence before the Committee of Public Accounts and its public commentary on Project Eagle, NAMA has argued that no issue has arisen regarding the sales side of this transaction, but, to perfectly honest, that is not an adequate answer.  Ultimately, the decision to proceed with the sale of Project Eagle was made by NAMA in Dublin, and NAMA must account for the entirety of that transaction.  That is why we believe a commission of investigation is warranted in this case, if for no other reason than to either prove or disprove the very profound allegations that have been made about the integrity of the single largest commercial transaction entered into by NAMA since its foundation approximately six years ago.</p><p>NAMA has been a cornerstone of Ireland's response to the banking crisis.  It has been funded by taxpayers and is under a mandate to act in their interest.  Any suggestion that taxpayers are not receiving the return they should be getting, or that a transaction has taken place in a manner that is not entirely above board, must be thoroughly investigated.  While there may have been no wrongdoing whatsoever on the part of NAMA, the agency must still accept responsibility for anything done by its advisers or former advisers relating to a transaction to which it was party.  Serious questions will be asked about the policies and procedures NAMA put in place to avoid conflicts of interest and about how closely NAMA monitored its advisers and others with access to key commercially sensitive information or relationships with NAMA.</p><p>Unless the National Asset Management Agency is exonerated by an independent commission of investigation, a shadow will be cast over the agency and its entire approach to asset disposals.  It is only fair to the individuals who have managed NAMA that a thorough investigation is instigated in which members of the public can have faith, as it is only through such a process that the reputations of the individuals in question will be fully protected.  Specifically, we must ensure there is no information held by NAMA or any other party in this jurisdiction on the &pound;7 million that was inexplicably transferred offshore to an Isle of Man account.  Only a commission of investigation would have the power fully to exonerate NAMA in respect of that revelation.</p> <p> It is also essential for the integrity of the House that a commission of investigation is established to find out the truth about the entirety of Project Eagle.  The ability of members of parliament to communicate freely is an important privilege in all democracies.  With this privilege comes great responsibility, however.  When serious accusations are made in this House, it is important that they are subjected to close scrutiny to ensure they are not entirely baseless and parliamentary privilege has been used responsibly.  I would have expected the Government to be happy to join the Fianna F&aacute;il Party in calling for a commission of investigation into this matter given the promise it made in its programme for Government to "insist on the highest standards of transparency in the operation of NAMA".  The allegations made in regard to Project Eagle are so serious and the integrity of the National Asset Management Agency so important that a commission must be established to investigate them. </p> <p> It is also important that the ongoing investigations in the North are not hampered by their limited scope.  Decisions made in Dublin should not escape scrutiny on the basis that the investigations being carried out by the Assembly Committee for Finance and Personnel and Police Service of Northern Ireland do not have jurisdiction to consider matters that took place South of the Border.  Ideally, a commission of investigation in the Republic would adopt a collaborative approach with any Northern investigation, allowing for the sharing of information and the most comprehensive results possible.  It is undoubtedly the case that a commission assessing what took place in this jurisdiction would be of great assistance to the various investigations under way in the North.</p> <p> The primary civil investigation in the North is being undertaken by the Assembly's finance committee.  It is deeply disappointing that the National Asset Management Agency has chosen not to send representatives to appear in person before the committee.  I repeat my call for NAMA to co-operate fully with that investigation.  Such co-operation must include NAMA officials attending the hearings at Stormont.  If they will not attend of their own volition, the Minister should exercise his powers under section 14 of the National Asset Management Agency Act to direct them to do so.</p> <p> To date, NAMA has suggested that, as it is not legally answerable to the Stormont Assembly, it will not require its staff to appear as witnesses before the committee's hearings.  While this is strictly true, it is not in keeping with the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement, which envisaged closer co-operation and the development of an all-Ireland economy.  I can understand the reason key political figures in the North would be reluctant to co-operate with a commission of investigation or the Committee of Public Accounts in Dublin at a time when NAMA was refusing to co­operate fully with the Stormont finance committee inquiry.  NAMA's stated position that it will endeavour to provide answers to written questions from the committee falls well short of the level of co-operation which could be reasonably expected by citizens on both sides of the Border.  Senior NAMA personnel should, if requested, appear in person before the committee to provide whatever information they can.  This would be evidence of a partnership approach to an important economic and political issue affecting not only the Six Counties but the whole island of Ireland.  I understand the reasons NAMA executives would take the conservative approach of not taking a politically sensitive decision to attend the Stormont committee in person without a clear direction or signal from the Minister to do so.</p> <p> Representatives of the National Asset Management Agency informed the Committee of Public Accounts that the agency's decision to accept the winning bid from Cerberus was not influenced by pressure from any source.  They also told the committee that each bidder had equal access to relevant information and that members of the Northern Ireland advisory committee had no access to confidential NAMA information.  It is important that members of the public can have full faith in NAMA's position.  This will only be possible after a thorough, independent, statutory commission of investigation review has taken place.  Calling for a commission of investigation does not undermine the important oversight function of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The simple reality is that the powers of a commission of investigation would allow it to look beyond the narrow focus of the Committee of Public Accounts.</p> <p> Many questions need to be answered and only a commission of investigation in this jurisdiction will provide the necessary answers to the following questions, which are only a sample of the many questions that must be answered.  What influence did NAMA's Northern Ireland advisory committee have on its decision to offer the Project Eagle portfolio for sale at a time when PIMCO wanted to buy it?  Did the board of NAMA decide it was a good time to sell the portfolio because of the intense interest of PIMCO?  What influence did Mr. Frank Cushnahan, as a member of the advisory committee until November 2013, have on that decision?  Was Mr. Cushnahan privy to a detailed discussion of Project Eagle on 7 October 2013?  Did he have access to any other confidential or sensitive information about Project Eagle?  When exactly did Mr. Cushnahan become engaged with PIMCO?  How extensive was the overlap in time, if any, between his involvement with PIMCO and his role as an adviser to NAMA?  What information, if any, was given to PIMCO?  Did Mr. Cushnahan give any advice to Cerberus given that Cerberus engaged Brown Rudnick, or did Brown Rudnick already have information which it could provide to Cerberus?  Why did NAMA permit Cerberus to use the services of Brown Rudnick and Tughans when the reason PIMCO was ejected from the process was that part of Brown Rudnick's fees was to be paid to Mr. Cushnahan?  Why was &pound;7 million from Cerberus diverted into an offshore account in the Isle of Man and for whom was the money ultimately destined?  Is there any substance to the allegation made in this Chamber that tens of millions of euro were to be paid to so-called fixers?</p> <p> Many of these questions fall to be answered by NAMA or call into question the agency's performance and the conduct of its advisers.  They are not questions that arise only North of the Border.  Simply put, a cloud will hang over NAMA until all of the questions we have raised are answered by an independent and credible commission of investigation, working in close co-operation with the investigations under way in the North.</p> <p> Given the seriousness of the allegations made and the fact that the value of the Project Eagle sale is measured in billions of euro, there can be no room for any questions to be left outstanding about any aspect of NAMA's dealings with this substantial portfolio of loans.  A commission of investigation offers the best chance of getting to the bottom of these issues.  The absence of a commission on this side of the Border means a cloud will remain over the Project Eagle transaction and the integrity of NAMA's approach to asset sales.  This matter cannot go unaddressed.  I commend the motion to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-20a.391" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1101" speakername="Barry Cowen" time="20:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000045#SS00200"><p>I thank my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, for tabling the motion calling for a commission of investigation into the sale of Project Eagle.  Simply put, allegations have been made in this House and Deputies need to provide a mechanism by which they can be upheld or otherwise.  The National Asset Management Agency must be above reproach.  Procrastination on the part of the Government allows these allegations to be made repeatedly without being refuted.</p>  <p>  The amount of money involved in Project Eagle is stark.  Assets once valued at &euro;5.7 billion were sold for &euro;1.6 billion.  The difference between these two figures equates to the amount the Government has allocated to housing for the next four to five years.  That indicates the scale of the project.  The money purportedly provided to address the housing crisis for the next four years will only tackle 30% of the housing lists.  This morning, I received information from my local authority that the provision of 2,338 units, as envisaged over the next four to five years, will only address 30% of the housing list.</p>  <p>  We were informed when the Government took office that the State would receive a dividend from NAMA, yet we have not seen any such dividend.  In the recent budget, the Government informed us that NAMA would build 20,000 new houses.  We were informed four or five years ago that the agency would provide 6,000 housing units, yet it has only provided 1,000 of them thus far.  It is against the background of such promises and the current housing crisis that my constituents learned of the allegations concerning Project Eagle.  It is in this context that the Government, in its recent budget, placed all of its trust and faith in NAMA to solve the housing crisis.</p><p>While those allegations remain in the ether, there is no way to believe that NAMA is above reproach.  I hope it is and expect it will be found to be so, but it is incumbent on the Minister to ensure that is the case and that there is no ambiguity whatsoever.</p> <p> I am also conscious of the fact that there exists another project in the hands of NAMA, Project Arrow, which is currently the subject of negotiations in relation to its proposed sale.  The assets have a face value of &euro;6.3 billion, and 50% of them are residential units.  It is alleged that the portfolio may be sold for less than &euro;1 billion, which amounts to less than &euro;100,000 per unit.  Offaly's local authority and many others have been given funding to provide units to meet the demand for housing from the waiting lists in their areas.  They will be paying well in excess of that for residential units and distorting the market into the bargain.  I cannot understand how the Minister for Finance can sit idly by when the prospect of that sort of write-down is imminent, in addition to what we have had previously in terms of what is before us in this motion.  I heard the Minister speak yesterday about his negotiations with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, with regard to proposals for the short-term situation.  We will see how that lands.  How is it landing in people's minds that there is an imminent sale for less than &euro;1 billion of &euro;6.3 billion worth of assets, 50% of which are residential, when that could allow the State to have units available to house people on housing lists in this and every other city and county local authority area for less than &euro;100,000 per unit?  It is disappointing that this has been left on the long finger and that there is no effort to use those assets to meet the demand that is there.</p> <p> We are told that there is a surplus of up to &euro;2 billion - a dividend - owing to the State in the forthcoming years in relation to NAMA's activities.  We are led to believe there will be a dividend for the State.  There is no dividend for my constituents on the housing list.  There is no dividend for homeless people throughout the country.  There is no dividend for many people who say to us that the Government will not treat the issue as seriously as it should be treated to address the situation.  Here is an option.  There is an alternative solution staring the Government in the face, but it does not want to know about it.  The Minister would rather wait to see how his negotiations with Deputy Alan Kelly land.</p></speech>

The attitude of the Government with respect to the disposal of State assets alarms me, because we are managing a situation, as Deputy Cowen said, on behalf of the citizens of the Republic.  With the scale of the portfolio involved, it is inexcusable that we do not immediately investigate, in the interests of the Oireachtas and the country, the conduct of NAMA and the disposal of the portfolio.  The total face value of the loans associated with Project Eagle is in the region of &euro;5.7 billion.  It constitutes the biggest sale of what was a State asset, because, since its establishment in 2009, NAMA has been administering the disposal of State assets.  The loans were packaged together on the basis of their connection with 55 borrowers based in the North.  Of those involved with the assets, about half were from the North and the balance were from the Republic.  Some were from the UK and Europe.  The portfolio was eventually sold to a US private equity firm, Cerberus, at a price of &euro;1.6 billion.  NAMA originally bought the loans for &euro;2 billion and impaired that loan to the value of &euro;200 million.  A sale price of &euro;1.6 billion saw a further loss of &euro;200 million.  Of the face value of the asset acquired on behalf of the citizens of the State of &euro;5.7 billion, the State discounted &euro;4.1 billion.  That is an astronomical sum given the context of the sum involved, as Deputy Cowen said, and the possibility of using funding to meaningfully address the housing crisis.</p>  <p>  Among the pressing reasons for a commission of inquiry in this context are the questionable features of aspects of the disposal of the Project Eagle assets, particularly the methodology whereby the disposal was accelerated.  That must be taken into context with respect to the rapidly growing property market in Northern Ireland.  Commercial property prices in Belfast rose by 20% in the 12 months following the sale of Project Eagle.  Property prices beyond Belfast had risen 10% in the same reference period.  NAMA continues with its programme of disposal and it seems to be coming under significant pressure from the Government to deliver moneys to the Exchequer so that the Government can present itself in front of the citizens at the general election and say in a reassuring way that it has dealt with NAMA.  The thought of a vulture fund quickly doubling its money by flipping property is repugnant at this time in particular when there are 1,500 children living in hotels in Dublin.  The discussion about selling the assets in a block is a concern, because there is ample evidence that we could have broken down the Project Eagle assets into smaller lots and seen a greater return and percolation of that return to the community.</p>  <p>  These concerns become sharper as we uncover aspects of the sale.  Several apparent conflicts of interest were highlighted tonight by Deputy Michael McGrath.  NAMA may not be directly responsible, but the robustness of its corporate governance structures is called into question.  Pimco was forced out of the sale process by NAMA and the legal adviser it used was forced onto the bidders at the insistence of NAMA.  Separately, and in somewhat curious circumstances, &pound;7 million was found in a offshore bank account.  These funds are related, we are led to believe, to the sale.  We need a commission of inquiry, and I am surprised the Minister for Finance does not agree.  The allegations set out by Deputy Mick Wallace have been covered in an earlier contribution.  I commend him on his dedication, commitment and action in staying with this very thorny subject.  It is incumbent on the House to establish an inquiry, not for political gain but for the 1,500 children out there tonight who have no homes.  Sitting as a body, neither the D&aacute;il nor the Committee of Public Accounts is adequately equipped to investigate this matter.  I say that with due respect to the Deputies who serve on the committee and in the House, including my own party colleague Deputy John McGuinness.</p>  <p>  There is a need to get answers to questions that the public are concerned about.  People are concerned North and South of the Border.  We owe it to our fellow Irish men and women in the North to establish an investigation into the truth.  It is essential that the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Stormont Assembly come together to iron matters out and collaborate to be transparent and get to the truth.  However, the existence of an investigation in the North does not answer the need for an inquiry in the Republic.  This jurisdiction ends at the Border, but the consequences of the sale and the magnitude of the impact of that decision rest with the citizens of the Republic.  I urge the Minister and Deputies opposite to reconsider their opposition to the inquiry.  As the Taoiseach said somewhat dismissively one day, "Paddy wants to know."  Paddy wants to know what is going on with Project Eagle.  Paddy wants to know if NAMA is serving the interests of the citizen well.  It is not unreasonable, in light of the scale of the resources involved, to table such a motion.  I acknowledge the contribution made by Deputy Michael McGrath and his commitment and resolve in tabling this motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-20a.394" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="20:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000047#UU00100"><p>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this motion, which calls on the Government to establish a commission of inquiry into the sale of NAMA's Northern Ireland portfolio.  That is what it means in straightforward English, as people might not understand titles like "Project Eagle" and so on.</p>  <p>  There was a loan book of &euro;5.4 billion.  NAMA paid &euro;2 billion and received proceeds of &euro;1.6 billion, representing a loss to the Irish taxpayer of 70%, or &euro;3.8 billion.  No matter how one views this, it is a disastrous day's work.  Commissions of inquiry have been established for much less.  That &euro;3.8 billion is probably as much as is collected in USC in a full year.  Imagine if we had that we would not need to have a chat about how long it would take to reduce the USC.  The Minister might claim that NAMA was not responsible for all of the loss because it got the loans at a discount, but NAMA has had a duty from the beginning to recover as much for the taxpayer as possible, not just to set a target identical to the amount at which it took over the loans.  I have discussed this matter at the Committee of Public Accounts.</p>  <p>  NAMA has been clear on a couple of points, the first of which is that the &pound;7 million that showed up in a bank account has nothing to do with its side of the sales process.  That is correct in so far as it goes, as the money was on the purchaser's side, but that is not the full story.  Instead, the full story is that the purchaser made that &pound;7 million available to secure the purchase of the Northern Ireland portfolio.  As such, the &pound;7 million should have gone to NAMA.  NAMA has claimed that the fee had nothing to do with it because it did not get that money, but the people making the purchase knew that they could allocate some of the amount they were bidding to other purposes, proving that the &euro;1.6 billion was not the maximum amount that NAMA could have got.</p>  <p>  I am not questioning NAMA's integrity, but its commercial competence.  Its members are honourable people, including the former chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, against whom no one in the House would say a word.  He is a man of integrity.  However, when a process ends with one bid on the table, any sensible business person would cancel the process and return to it another day.  Proceeding with just one live bid, one that was close to the price that NAMA had stated it would accept, was wrong.  This is the crux of the matter.  From a commercial point of view, the process should have stopped at that point.  No one even knew about possible conflicts of interest.</p>  <p>  Some probably misunderstand where the loan book was based.  Geographically, 50% of the properties were in Northern Ireland, with 33% in the rest of the UK.  Of that, 40% was in Scotland and 23% in the north west.  In addition, 6% of the properties were located in rural counties in the South, 1% were located in Dublin, 6% were outside Ireland and the UK and 4% were in London.  To fixate on the Northern property market not being great and that this was a scrappy portfolio does not reflect the truth.  Only 50% of the underlying distressed assets were in the North.  It is important that this fact be taken into account, as it is slid past in all of the discussions.</p>  <p>  Regarding conflicts of interest, the question of Mr. Cushnahan has been raised several times, including at the Committee of Public Accounts.  Since the committee's last meeting, I wrote to NAMA to ask whether it had been aware of the possible conflict of interest involved in that situation.  I thank the person in NAMA who recently sent me a letter in response.  NAMA confirmed that Mr. Cushnahan had not disclosed to it the "alleged" shareholding in Mr. Graham's company.  That shareholding is a matter of public record, yet NAMA called it "alleged".  According to the letter, NAMA understands that it is a matter of public record that Mr. Cushnahan's solicitor has stated that Mr. Cushnahan disposed of his shareholding in Mr. Graham's company in 2008.</p>  <p>  I wish to refer to an extract from a Companies House record relating to the company in question, Fernheath Developments Limited, company registration No. NI055085.  The date of the return sourced in the Companies House was 9 May 2010.  The address is Oyster House, 12 Wellington Place, Belfast.  Mr. Frank Cushnahan was listed as a shareholder on 9 May 2010.  NAMA has accepted an assurance that the shareholding was sold in 2008.  Elsewhere, I believe at the Northern Ireland committee, it was stated that the shareholding was sold in 2009.  And yet the Companies House asserts that he was still a shareholder in May 2010.  The Companies House record is the true version.  Wrong information is being put about and people are accepting it at face value when it suits them not to pursue the matter in greater detail.</p>  <p>  For shorthand, we have been calling it the "Northern Ireland" portfolio, but that is not what it is.  Only half of it was located in Northern Ireland.  As I have pointed out in immense detail, the rest was located outside Northern Ireland.  For now, though, we will call it the "Northern Ireland" portfolio.</p>  <p>  Why did NAMA feel the need to bundle all of the loans together and sell them off and why is it doing the same thing again?  I referred to the reason recently.  The Minister met some people in Davos who told him that they were not interested in scrappy little projects of 200, 300, 400 or 500 properties, and that they would only buy anything on the cheap if he gave them a decent bit.  Given the scale of the projects being made available for sale, only a limited number of organisations in the world have the necessary resources to compete for them.  We are removing the possibility that people in Ireland will buy back some of the loans.  I am not referring to those whose loans these were in the first place, but to other people who could have put the loans to good use.  NAMA took its lead from the Minister, put the loans up in large lots and sold them quickly.</p>  <p>  The Northern Ireland portfolio process was fraught with political involvement at every stage.  There were letters from the Minister and letters to Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Assembly's finance committee.  It is essential that there be no political interference in NAMA's activities, yet I have never seen such political involvement in anything that was not meant to have any as I did in this sale.</p>  <p>  Intriguingly, everyone believes that a commission of inquiry is required.  The Committee of Public Accounts has examined the issue, but there is a limit to its powers.  The Northern Ireland finance committee also has limited powers to examine it.  A commission of inquiry would have more teeth and the ability to go where neither committee has gone to date.  It is remarkable how the Minister has resisted establishing a commission.  Why is he the only one holding back a proper investigation?  I do not understand it, as I do not believe that he has anything to hide.  He will recall the issue with Siteserv and IBRC from some time ago.  He set up a commission of investigation.  I do not know how it stands now, although I believe it is to report in the near future.  When the Minister saw that there was a genuine rather than frivolous public demand from people who had an issue with how that situation was handled, he believed that it was right for the reputation of everyone involved, including the Government's, to set up a commission of investigation.  While that has long-fingered the matter to beyond the next election, as we do not expect the commission to report by next spring, people will be happy to get the truth in a report somewhere along the line.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is also examining this matter and will report on it shortly.</p><p>That will be helpful in this context because he will have access to information that will not necessarily be available even to the members of the Committee of Public Accounts or, perhaps, the Minister.  However, I must put the conflicts of interest I mentioned on the table.  NAMA was a little naive in accepting some of the  assurances it was given.  I have given the Minister the concrete example of people having shares in a particular company when NAMA believed in good faith &mdash; I am not questioning its integrity &mdash; a statement that the shareholdings had been sold in 2008.  To return to my point, I do not believe the organisation was commercially sharp enough to deal with some of the sharks it was in the water with.</p> <p> This brings us to the conclusion of NAMA's loan book activity.  Let us consider NAMA's statements to the Committee of Public Accounts.  It takes a very conservative view.  If it is saying it expects to have a surplus of &euro;1.75 billion on concluding its activities in the next two years or so, it will be welcome.  It should come back to the Irish taxpayer.  I am quite sure NAMA will have a much greater surplus because it is taking a conservative view.</p> <p> As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I was shocked to hear a certain response to one of my questions to the NAMA representatives.  The public cannot get the information in question as of now but we are going to chase NAMA to provide it.  NAMA took over loans from Anglo Irish Bank, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland and it has no system in place at the end of the day to report, in respect of the &euro;34 billion of loans it took over, how much was achieved in respect of each of the banks.  Ultimately, the agency can talk about what was achieved in respect of each of the developers and the loans from individuals but it cannot give the details on the loans it took from the various banks.  That needs to be examined.</p></speech>

It is a function of NAMA, pursuant to section 11(1)(<i>d</i>)(i), to dispose of loans or portfolios of loans in the market &quot;for the best achievable price&quot;.  Another control in place under the NAMA Act that has received broad support in the Oireachtas is section 172, which provides that a defaulting debtor cannot acquire from NAMA or a NAMA group entity any interest in any property which secures the debtor's loans.</p><p>It is against this obligation that NAMA's activities since its inception must be assessed.  That is why my predecessor, the late Mr. Brian Lenihan, ensured NAMA was held accountable over these objectives by the Oireachtas through the legal standing provided to the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General to oversee the work of NAMA.  Under section 58 of the NAMA Act, the Committee of Public Accounts has the power, under the Standing Orders of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to examine the accounts and reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and to call on the NAMA chairman and CEO to give evidence &quot;whenever required&quot; to report on various matters, including the Comptroller and Auditor General's audited accounts and special reports.</p><p>The Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts are held in the highest regard and I have full confidence in the ability of both to hold NAMA to account on this and, indeed, every transaction that it concludes.  In this regard, I very much welcome the fact that the Committee of Public Accounts invited NAMA to appear before it to discuss the sale of the Northern Ireland portfolio, both on 9 July 2015 and on 1 October 2015.  NAMA's opening statements for each appearance are available on the NAMA website and the full transcripts of those sessions are available on the Oireachtas website.</p><p>Concerns raised by the Committee of Public Accounts focus on whether NAMA maximised value for the taxpayer through this sales process.  It is entirely appropriate that the Committee of Public Accounts explore such concerns.  After all, it is the mandate of the Committee of Public Accounts to ensure NAMA operated in line with its legislative objectives, and the committee is well equipped to do so through the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p><p>As part of its upcoming third triennial review of NAMA under section 226 of the NAMA Act, the Comptroller and Auditor General has confirmed to the Committee of Public Accounts that he will perform a value-for-money review of the NAMA sales and will evaluate the sale of the Northern Ireland loan portfolio as a matter of priority.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is best positioned to review independently this transaction from a value-for-money perspective and has indicated that he intends to produce a preliminary report as soon as is practicable.  I am confident this report will be useful to the Committee of Public Accounts in continuing its important work.  This represents the institutions of the State working in line with legislation in the best interest of the Irish taxpayer.  It is clear to me that we have established the appropriate mechanisms to hold NAMA accountable on its legislative mandate, and we should allow those mechanisms to function.</p><p>There has been much coverage of various aspects of NAMA's sale of its Northern Ireland loan portfolio, most of which focuses on what may have happened on the purchaser side of the transaction, particularly in Northern Ireland.  Serious allegations have been made against various individuals within the Northern Ireland business community in regard to their behaviour surrounding the acquisition of this portfolio.  There are a number of investigations under way, including those with the UK National Crime Agency, NCA, the US Department of Justice, the Northern Ireland Committee for Finance and Personnel and the Law Society of Northern Ireland.  Furthermore, I believe Deputy Wallace has brought his allegations to the attention of the Garda.  I welcome these investigations.  Such serious allegations should be, and are being, thoroughly investigated.  However, to my knowledge, these investigations concern activities on the purchaser side of the sales process and do not involve NAMA's role in the process.</p><p>The NCA, supported by the Police Service of Northern Ireland, is conducting a criminal investigation into alleged inducement payments among parties involved on the purchase side of this transaction.  The Northern Ireland Committee for Finance and Personnel has undertaken a fact-finding mission focusing on the Northern Ireland Department of Finance and Personnel's relationship with NAMA, its interest in the assets of Northern Ireland and the basis and rationale for any actions it may have taken in regard to this sale.</p><p>The Law Society of Northern Ireland is investigating the behaviour of a former partner of Tughans solicitors, based in Northern Ireland, regarding allegations around the diversion of advisory fees paid to that firm.  The CEO and chairman of NAMA met the NCA some weeks ago to provide an overview of NAMA and the chronology of the sale process.  It is their clear understanding, based on that engagement, that the NCA investigation is not concerned with NAMA's role in this transaction.  The NCA's focus appears to be very much on the purchaser side of the transaction.  Both NAMA and the Department of Finance have supplied extensive documentation to both the Northern Ireland Committee for Finance and Personnel and the Oireachtas Committee of Public Accounts.  NAMA provided both committees with a detailed 300-page response to 73 questions posed by the Northern Ireland committee.  This response is available on the NAMA website.  My Department has also provided extensive documentation to the two committees.  These documents are available on the Department of Finance's website.  The Northern Ireland committee has indicated that it may submit further questions to NAMA, and NAMA stands ready to assist the committee with responses.</p><p>I would encourage the signatories of the current motion to read the materials that have been made available by NAMA and my Department as a thorough review and understanding of these materials may quench their desire for an investigation.  It is important to state that, through all of this disclosure and investigation, there has not been a single allegation of wrongdoing directed at NAMA.</p><p>Attempts to conflate NAMA's open-market loan sale process with allegations on the purchase side of the sale process are entirely wrong and misleading.  As I have previously confirmed, NAMA is not being investigated as part of any of the ongoing inquiries.  We should ask ourselves who stands stand to gain from the establishment of an investigation when there is no allegation of wrongdoing.  Who stands to gain from drawing a halt to current sales processes while an investigation is undertaken?</p><p>With the millions or potentially billions of lost value that would likely result from such an action, it is clearly not the taxpayer who stands to gain.<br/><br/>In any case, the Deputy has put this motion to the House without any indication of wrongdoing by NAMA and may have created questions in people's minds, so I will again set out the facts surrounding the sale of the Northern Ireland loan portfolio which raise no question regarding NAMA's behaviour in this process.  These events and the documents supporting these events are a matter of public record and can be found on the Department of Finance and NAMA websites.<br/><br/>In late June 2013, I received a letter from the Northern Ireland Minister for Finance and Personnel, Mr. Sammy Wilson.  With his letter Mr. Wilson enclosed a copy of a letter he had received from a law firm, Brown Rudnick, which indicated that a client of theirs was interested in acquiring NAMA's Northern Ireland loan portfolio.  The Brown Rudnick letter advocated a semi-exclusive sales process and considered a number of suggestions regarding the future management of the portfolio, which suggestions were for the Minister, Mr. Wilson, to consider.<br/><br/>In my reply I pointed out to the Minister, Mr. Wilson, that parties interested in acquiring NAMA loans or assets securing NAMA loans should contact NAMA directly.  I also drew attention to NAMA's policy that loan and asset sales should be openly marketed and pointed out that NAMA did not favour granting exclusive access to any potential purchaser as that would militate against achieving optimal value for the assets concerned.<br/><br/>In September 2013, Brown Rudnick made an unsolicited approach to NAMA and indicated that one of their clients, PIMCO, was interested in acquiring NAMA's Northern Ireland loan portfolio.  In its subsequent engagement with NAMA, PIMCO indicated a preference for NAMA not to market the portfolio openly.  The NAMA board agreed that senior NAMA staff should engage further with PIMCO but with a view ultimately to completing an openly marketed loan sale in line with board policy.<br/><br/>On 27 September 2013, at his request, I met the First Minister, Peter Robinson, in Stormont Castle.  At that meeting we discussed, among other things, NAMA's Northern Ireland portfolio.  I explained that NAMA's policy was that loan and asset sales should be openly marketed and that NAMA did not favour granting exclusive access to any potential purchaser.  The First Minister, Mr. Robinson, while completely understanding NAMA's position, expressed his reservations that an open process may attract buyers seeking to profit at the expense of the Northern Ireland economy.<br/><br/>As would be expected, NAMA did not conduct an exclusive sales process.  At a meeting on 12 December 2013, the NAMA board decided that the portfolio should be openly marketed as part of a competitive process.  The board also set a minimum price below which it would not be willing to proceed with a sale.<br/><br/>At a further meeting on 8 January 2014, the NAMA board approved the appointment of Lazard bankers to advise NAMA on the appropriate marketing approach and to oversee the sales process.  It was envisaged that this would involve marketing to suitable targeted bidders who would have the financial wherewithal to submit credible bids on the portfolio.<br/><br/>On 14 January 2014, at the request of the Northern Ireland Executive, I held a call with the First Minister, Mr. Robinson, and the Deputy First Minister, Mr. McGuinness, to discuss the Northern Ireland portfolio sales process.  I reiterated NAMA's intention to conduct an open and competitive sales process.  It was agreed during that call that the Northern Ireland Executive would send to NAMA for informational purposes a draft letter of intent which the Northern Ireland Executive would seek to put in place between itself and each bidder relating to the proposed management of the Northern Ireland portfolio following its sale by NAMA.<br/><br/>On 17 January 2014, NAMA received a copy of that draft letter of intent which appeared to summarise an agreement between PIMCO and the Northern Ireland Executive.  Its purpose was to require the purchaser of the portfolio to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Government of Northern Ireland confirming certain fundamental conditions relating to the future management of the portfolio.  I am assured that NAMA did not engage further in relation to the draft letter.<br/><br/>On 10 March 2014, PIMCO informed NAMA that its compliance staff had discovered that PIMCO's proposed fee arrangement with Brown Rudnick included also a payment of fees to Tughans, a Belfast law firm, and to Mr. Cushnahan, a former external member of NAMA's Northern Ireland advisory committee, NIAC.  While Mr. Cushnahan was not a member of the NIAC at the time - he had resigned on 8 November 2013 - and never had access to confidential portfolio information, NAMA viewed this disclosure as a very serious development and the NAMA board met on 11 March 2014 to consider the most appropriate course of action.  The NAMA board decided that if PIMCO did not withdraw, NAMA could not permit it to remain in the sales process.  NAMA informed me of the proposed fee arrangement at the time it was brought to its attention.  On 13 March 2014, following discussions with NAMA, PIMCO informed NAMA that it would withdraw from the sales process.<br/><br/>Up to that point, during the first quarter of 2014, Lazard had engaged with a total of nine potential purchasers, including PIMCO.  Following the withdrawal of PIMCO from the process and having concluded that there was sufficient competitive tension among the remaining bidders, Lazard went on to engage with the remaining interested parties.  On 28 March 2014, I held a call with the First Minister, Mr. Robinson, to update him on the sales process.  At the end of the process, the best bid from the two remaining bidders was received from Cerberus.<br/><br/>In light of the arrangement that PIMCO had brought to NAMA's attention, prior to NAMA accepting its bid, Cerberus provided NAMA with written confirmation that no fees were paid to any party that ever had a relationship with NAMA, including any current or former NAMA board member, current or former committee member or current or former staff member.  The Cerberus bid was accepted by the board on 3 April and was announced on 4 April 2014.  The transaction was completed in June 2014.  I am assured by NAMA that the sale process was well managed and competitive, conducted in line with best international practice, independently overseen by Lazard, and that<b></b>NAMA took care at all stages to ensure the integrity of the process was fully protected.<br/><br/>There have been some suggestions that upon learning about the PIMCO fee arrangement I should have intervened and halted the sales process.  It is crucial to remember that the Oireachtas, in framing the NAMA Act, ensured that NAMA would be independent in its decision-making to avoid a position where others, whether for political or commercial self-interest or for other reasons, would seek to influence decision-making in a way that would serve only certain vested interests.  By extension, any such interference would be detrimental to the interests of Irish taxpayers.  Political interference in NAMA's independent commercial decision-making would render the agency incapable of carrying out its work on behalf of taxpayers and would cast a major shadow over NAMA's ability to achieve its objectives.<br/><br/>Turning back to the proposed Private Members' motion before us, I maintain that no such investigation into NAMA is necessary.  I can see no benefit of such an investigation because up to now there has been no allegation of wrongdoing directed towards NAMA.  NAMA is held accountable by the Oireachtas for fulfilling its objectives, and the Committee of Public Accounts is exercising that oversight through the Comptroller and Auditor General's current value for money review of NAMA transactions.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has confirmed that this review will prioritise a value for money review of the sale of the Northern Ireland portfolio.  The Comptroller and Auditor General expects to produce a draft report as soon as practicable.  It is entirely appropriate that the Comptroller and Auditor General would conduct such a review.  I welcome and support this review and ask that Members do likewise.<br/><br/>I am very surprised that Fianna F&aacute;il tabled this motion.  NAMA is one of the few successes in the Fianna F&aacute;il legacy-----</p></speech>

It is important to ensure we do not make allegations or use half-truths to denigrate any individual or organisation in this Chamber at any time.</p>  <p>  NAMA is very much the subject of tonight's debate.  The agency has operated under legislation passed by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  Thus far, it seems to be completely innocent of any alleged wrongdoing as far as fraud is concerned.  In fact, the only charge thrown against the agency to date is that it did not, perhaps, have the proper business practices in place or that it could have done more to extract value from the loans.  This has been confirmed by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The latter has also confirmed that his investigation will prioritise a value-for-money review of the sale of the Northern Ireland portfolio and all assets within that portfolio.</p>  <p>  NAMA operates under instruction from the Oireachtas, with a certain input from the Department of Finance.  However, as every member of the Opposition is aware, the board of NAMA is fully independent and free to make decisions about achieving the best value for money for Irish taxpayers.  Let us consider with what the agency has had to deal.  NAMA was set up by the State to deal with &euro;34 billion of variable assets.  As many Opposition Members will recall from when we discussed this matter at the very outset, some of these assets were nothing but junk, some were performing poorly and others were normal performing loans.  People would be naive to think that there would be absolutely no problems considering the economic mess the country was in.  Most Members present tonight sat through all the debates in both Chambers on the establishment of NAMA and are aware of the reasons for setting it up and the crisis which obtained at the time.  There have been numerous debates about the legitimacy of the NAMA Act, the NAMA business plan and whether the staff were up to it.  I imagine the Deputies opposite have heard the same whispered gossip and allegations of dodgy business dealings by individuals in NAMA.  However, no one has ever said that NAMA is in any way corrupt and no one has made any allegations of fraudulent or unethical behaviour against it.  There has been nothing of that nature in all the time this organisation has been in existence.  NAMA has come before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Committee of Public Accounts.  Certainly, we argue with the officials, including Frank Daly and Brendan McDonagh.  However, Deputy Michael McGrath is in the same position as me in that throughout my following of this conflict and the crisis to date, neither of us can point to a smoking gun in the hand of Frank Daly, Brendan McDonagh or anyone from with NAMA for whom we have the utmost regard.  We would do ourselves a disservice by standing up for these half-truths that are being bandied about.</p>  <p>  We are calling for a major review but some of this is completely outside our scope.  There may be sharp practices in Northern Ireland.  I am unsure how business operates there.  Perhaps there are certain individuals in what is probably a small business community.  Perhaps there are certain individuals who know all the people who have these loans.  Perhaps they can contact these individuals at the weekend and ask how much they would be prepared to pay and put together a reasonable idea of what personal guarantees can be delivered if an outside investor bought into a given company.  I am unsure whether the informed opinion paid for by these international investors can be considered to be real or whether there is an unethical dimension to it.  That is what has been alleged.  It has been alleged that some fraudulent activity has gone on within the business community in Northern Ireland.  I am unsure but perhaps that is what happens within business.</p>  <p>  There is an issue around the Law Society of Northern Ireland.  Perhaps it needs to step up to the plate, investigate its members quickly and decide whether there has been sharp practice relating to alleged fraud, criminal activity or unethical behaviour by certain individuals within the legal profession in Northern Ireland.  That needs to be done speedily if Northern Ireland wants to be perceived as a destination for inward investment in future and wants to compete with what is happening in our economy.  For the same reason, it is important for the PSNI to conduct its investigations rapidly if serious allegations have been made about criminal activity around the NAMA sale.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy opposite indicated, there has been much talk about this matter.  No allegations have been made to the effect that NAMA is in any way involved in dirty dealings, underhand practices or unethical behaviour.  It has stood the test of time.  Deputy Michael McGrath has been involved with various relevant committees of the House.  No one among the management of NAMA has got an easy ride at meetings of those committees.  They get rough, tough questioning when they come to this House and they answer every question we put to them.  We can e-mail them.  Of course, they will not deal with individual issues but they can deal with anything around the legislation and the business plan of NAMA.  They have always answered those questions clearly.  We should be very careful about who we are laying these accusations against.  We need to be careful about what we say in this House.</p>  <p>  I am happy to leave it to the Comptroller and Auditor General to examine the business practices of NAMA and obtain an independent assessment.  That is important for the taxpayer.  The Comptroller and Auditor General must establish whether NAMA is doing its job and following the procedures expected of it by the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  We cannot be 100% right on the matter.  Perhaps NAMA has been a victim of the economic success that this country has gone through.  A vendor may have been considered daft for buying a certain asset three years ago but now may be considered to have got a bargain.  Perhaps that is the way the business practice went.  I am keen to hear what other Opposition Members have to say.  No one is saying there is any allegation of unethical behaviour relating to senior management within NAMA.  Certainly, no one is saying anything to the effect that there is any sort of alleged criminal activity by anyone within NAMA.  These issues are important to put on the record when we consider both the vast size of NAMA, as an organisation, and the major responsibility it has been given.  We should consider this in the context of the major economic crisis the country underwent at the time.</p>  <p>  If there are questions to be answered about how procedures were followed in Northern Ireland by the PSNI, the Law Society of Northern Ireland or the political establishment in Northern Ireland, that is a different matter.  That is not our responsibility.  I would be far happier for those organisations to answer the questions that Deputy Michael McGrath has posed.  They should answer those questions quickly in order that we can see it as a necessity for us to go further in this jurisdiction.  However, NAMA has completely played its role - as expected - with both the Northern Ireland Assembly and the various the regulatory organisations in the North.  It is important that this should continue to be the case.</p>  <p>  We can continue, if necessary, to proceed further by calling representatives from NAMA to come before the relevant committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas on foot of the outcome of the Comptroller and Auditor General report in some weeks' time.  However, let us not undermine or in any way denigrate the character of individuals who have worked tirelessly for this country in recent years to get us out of the incredible mess we found ourselves in.  I believe we are working closely with political parties in Northern Ireland to come to the end of this.  This matters because the future of Northern Ireland is very much connected to our economic and political future.  It is important that there be no ambiguity regarding how business is done in Northern Ireland.  I hope that matter will be cleared up as quickly as possible for the sake of the people who are trying to make a living and make business work in Northern Ireland.  That is very important for all of us.</p>  <p>  My final comment relates to some of the remarks and the pure stupidity of Opposition Members referring to loans worth of &euro;5.6 billion which were then sold for only &euro;1.6 billion.  The economic ignorance is either pure stupidity or simply amounts to trying to play a political game.  Deputy Michael McGrath might consider giving a lesson to the Fianna F&aacute;il Parliamentary Party about what happened in this country and why loans which were borrowed on assets and which were worth &euro;5.6 billion decreased in value to &euro;1.6 billion in a couple of years.  Some of that was pure speculation of the daftest kind, coupled with an economic crisis that literally put us on our knees.</p></speech>

I have raised the issue with the Taoiseach on several occasions.  It is not just an issue about the North or, as the T&aacute;naiste described it, just a Northern tale; rather, it is a national tale.</p>  <p>  The revelations, which the Minister conceded in his remarks today, that an illegal &pound;15 million fixers fee was to be paid to individuals involved in the sale of the Northern loan book was brought to the attention of NAMA by PIMCO, a potential US bidder.  NAMA previously claimed that its Northern advisory committee was not privy to confidential or useful information regarding the sale.  It has since been disclosed that the committee discussed potential purchasers on at least two occasions before the loan book was sold at a huge loss to Irish taxpayers.</p>  <p>  Belfast accountant Mr. David Watters has claimed that he devised a concept to sell all of NAMA's Northern loans in a single portfolio in a letter he drafted, which has been disclosed and reported publicly.  Mr. Watters called his proposal Project Amani, which we know now became NAMA's Project Eagle.  He brought in Mr. Frank Cushnahan, then a member of NAMA's Northern advisory committee, to work with him on the concept.</p>  <p>  We also now know, through correspondence released by PIMCO to the North's Assembly inquiry, that Mr. Cushnahan was present at a meeting with them as a potential bidder on 22 July 2013.  This meeting also involved First Minister Peter Robinson, Sammy Wilson, Ian Coulter, Tughans and Brown Rudnick.  Mr. Cushnahan was at that time still an active member of the NAMA advisory committee and did not resign until November 2013.  NAMA has since confirmed that he did not declare any conflict of interest.</p>  <p>  Businessman Mr. Gareth Graham has testified that he possesses thousands of phone calls exposing inappropriate and possibly illegal contact.  NAMA's chairman, Mr. Frank Daly, said he briefed the Minister, Deputy Noonan, in full, including the scandal, something the Minister conceded, of the &pound;15 million fixers fee.  Despite this, the Minister failed to suspend the Project Eagle sale process or inform the North's Offices of First and Deputy First Ministers.</p>  <p>  It is crucially important that the role and responsibility of the Irish Government regarding this entire issue is transparent.  That is the intention of the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment to the motion.  It is also a fact that the shenanigans around this - it is now a matter of public record - are under criminal and parliamentary investigation by the Assembly, the British National Crime Agency, the US Department of Justice, the FBI, the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the Law Society in the North.  There is evidence, in all of these investigations at least, of the validity and importance of the concerns expressed by Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>  <p>  The Irish Government continues to defend NAMA blindly and to deny there is any scandal whatsoever.  It continues to refuse to establish a commission of investigation.  NAMA is an arm of the State.  The money is the people's money and NAMA should be accountable.  It was established in the name of the taxpayer and it is the responsibility of the Oireachtas, particularly the Government, to ensure it does its work properly and commands the full public trust and the confidence of citizens in securing the best value for Irish taxpayers.</p>  <p>  It was only today that the Minister came into the D&aacute;il to make a statement.  I missed the first part and am studying the rest.  We may come back to the issue, but every week new details about NAMA and the sale of the Northern loan book emerge.  It is obvious to anyone who follows this that the easy way to deal with it is to bring in independent investigators and have a commission of investigation conduct a full and proper examination of all the facts.  I urge Deputies to support the Sinn F&eacute;in amendment and again call on the Government, as a matter of urgency, to establish a commission of investigation.</p></speech>

We heard the allegations and concerns about the sale of the Northern Ireland loan book of NAMA.  Major concerns have been expressed in the House and there have been allegations about people receiving payments from American companies which wish to acquire assets held by NAMA in the North.</p>  <p>  In April 2014 Cerberus bought Project Eagle for &pound;1.2 billion.  It was the sale of the century.  As part of that, it has been claimed that &pound;7 million found its way into an Isle of Man account allegedly connected to a politician or political party in the North.  The key point is that there has been 20% negative equity on property and a 30%, 40% or 50% drop in value, but a cut of 80% or 90% or even higher in the value of assets would be very unusual.</p>  <p>  Deputy Twomey referred constantly to business people in the North of Ireland and stated it was a matter for the North.  It is a matter for taxpayers in Ireland because the shortfall between what the properties cost the Irish taxpayer and what they were eventually sold for in one block has been met by the taxpayer.  The fire sale is very much a matter for Irish taxpayers.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance spoke about the best offer being taken up, but that misses the point.  The point is that it was a fire sale of a complete portfolio.  The fact is that NAMA has been established as a long-term project and I cannot for the life of me see why large property portfolios were not broken into smaller lots and dealt with more transparently.  It is to be hoped some of this will be clarified during the course of the PSNI investigation into the allegations and other inquiries, including that being carried out by the Assembly committee, which is headed by Sinn F&eacute;in Assembly Member Datha&iacute; McKay.  There are also committee hearings in the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  It is clear that the attempt to insinuate that there was some sinister knowledge on the part of Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness was an attempt to muddy the waters and score a political point against Sinn F&eacute;in, and there is nothing new there.  The amendment we have tabled calls on NAMA and the Minister for Finance to attend the Assembly finance committee inquiry to give evidence on the matter, which should not be too difficult.  It would be very easy for the Minister to drive a couple of hours up the road, attend the committee hearing and give his version of events.</p>  <p>  We also want to see an independent commission of investigation established to conduct a full and proper examination of the facts surrounding the sales process of the Northern loan book portfolio, Project Eagle, for the Government to establish a deadline for the completion of the report by the commission of investigation into NAMA and for its findings be debated in the House within two weeks of the publication of the report.  These things should not drag on forever.  That is the only way we can get to the truth quickly and debate the matter here.</p>  <p>  On the broader issue of NAMA, this affair highlights the fact that valuable assets which could have been used to much greater economic and social benefit have been sold off to what some would describe as vulture funds at less than what could have been achieved.  That is not to deny the fact that property values fell.  They had to because of the artificially inflated prices during the madness of the term of the previous Government and the bubble of the Celtic tiger.</p>  <p>  In a recent Private Members' motion we tabled, we proposed that property and land held by NAMA be used to address the housing crisis, something we sincerely believe.  We proposed that the empty buildings on NAMA's books be refurbished to provide emergency accommodation for those people who unfortunately find themselves forced into bed and breakfast accommodation and, in some cases, sleeping on the streets outside the Houses.  I find that embarrassing and feel very bad about it as a Deputy.  If one walks around any of the streets in the late evening one sees people lying in doorways.  We are not doing enough to address that problem, but we have the opportunity to do so, using a publicly owned company which holds publicly owned property.</p><p>I am not convinced we are doing enough to turn some of this property into residential accommodation.  Given that NAMA holds these assets and is, in effect, publically owned, there is no reason some of them cannot be utilised in such a manner, particularly given that some of them have lain empty for years without attracting any great interest up to now.  It is also important to examine the issue of who is buying or likely to buy NAMA held property.  We have seen examples where blocks of property, in particular blocks of apartments, have been sold at knockdown prices.  One example is a block of apartments in Corrig Glen in Portarlington which are in NAMA.  They have been sitting there for a long time.  I recognise that not all of them are suitable for social housing, but some of them are suitable for downstairs social housing and duplex apartments could be used for affordable housing.  If they are sold in bulk it could be for a very small amount of money.  Everybody in here knows that if people on modest wages got an opportunity to buy them and were able to access a loan at good interest rates it would put them in a position of being able to acquire their own house and sort out their own housing solution, and some of the apartments could be used for social housing.</p> <p> The important issue this evening is that of the Northern Ireland portfolio, but I ask that the overall thrust of what NAMA is being directed to do with regard to dealing with these property portfolios be examined, and that we take a more long-term view of how we utilise the properties we have, whether commercial or residential.  There is significant demand for residential property and I ask the Government to review this and talk to NAMA about it again to ensure the property is being utilised for the best purposes with regard to taxpayers and those on the housing waiting lists.</p> <p> I call on Deputies to support our amendment.  We have tried to improve on the motion submitted by Fianna F&aacute;il, and I hope Deputies throughout the House will support it.  I cannot see why anybody would refuse to do so, or would be in any way weak willed about supporting the amendment.  I hope the amendment is backed tomorrow evening.</p></speech>

I would like 50 minutes but I will not get them.  I will address several of the points which have been raised.  Government speakers have stated that just because something had a par value of &pound;4.5 billion and it ended up being sold for &pound;1.241 billion, it does not mean it was sold for more than &pound;3 billion too little, but the fact is that when NAMA was set up the argument was made at the time that the reason for doing so was so we would not firesale assets but wait for the market to recover and get value.  Sadly, this rule was not kept.  Property does have a value.  It is worth what it cost to build, even if the land does not cost anything.  If property is sold for less than it cost to build, in my opinion it is being sold for less than its value.</p>  <p>  The point has been made that the parcels of land were so big that only a handful of companies on the planet could have bought these big portfolios.  It was impossible for Irish business people to buy into this property area.  When NAMA was set up, it was one of the biggest property companies on the planet.  What has happened is that we have actually sold this property mostly to US vulture funds.  We have sold a huge chunk of Ireland away to people who only care about the bottom line, which is profit.  The Government seems to be content with the idea of Kennedy Wilson controlling the rental market in Dublin.  I do not think this is such a good idea.  If what we had before lacked regulation, this was something which should have been addressed, but we had landlords who owned two, five or ten houses and they will be wiped because of how things have gone.  An apartment in Dominic Street has gone from &euro;900 a month to &euro;1,500 a month in the space of three years because a small group of players such as Kennedy Wilson has a major stranglehold on the rental market.</p>  <p>  A number of Deputies have said no allegations have been made against NAMA itself.  I am sorry, but I beg to differ.  At present, 15 different investigations are being carried out by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na into the workings of NAMA, and this is just the reported stuff.  Trust me, there is more coming down the tracks in terms of complaints about how NAMA has done its business.  People have said enough investigations are going on, but it just so happens the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States are only interested in US companies.  This is their remit under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  They can only look at the four US companies involved, namely, Brown Rudnick, Cerberus, PIMCO and Fortress.  The National Crime Agency in Britain is looking at the Northern Ireland angle.  In actual fact, we are still not getting any proper independent investigation into the workings of NAMA.  If we go back through the answers the Committee of Public Accounts was given by NAMA, when Deputy Mary Lou McDonald asked about the conflict of interest of Frank Cushnahan and the Project Eagle sale, she was told it was commercially sensitive and that another issue was personally sensitive.  This is understandable and NAMA is within its rights to do this, but only a commission of inquiry will get the unredacted version, and only this way will we get to the truth of what is happening.</p>  <p>  I argue that the process of the sale of Project Eagle was not competitive.  Fortress bid less than &pound;1.1 billion and the reserve was &pound;1.24 billion.  There was something amiss.  Cerberus was the only live bidder left on the job.  We probably have not heard the last of Fortress and there are problems with it.</p>  <p>  As Deputy Michael McGrath said, there is a cloud over the workings of NAMA and it will remain there until there is an independent commission of inquiry of some nature.  If the Government does not do it, we will probably get it after the election, but we will get one eventually and the sooner the better.  Project Arrow should be frozen.  It would be criminal if NAMA goes ahead and sells to a company under criminal investigation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2015-10-20a.420" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="21:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015102000052#ZZ00900"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  This Bill seeks to implement the provisions agreed in the Lansdowne Road agreement earlier this year.  It does so in the context of our country&rsquo;s continuing economic recovery and within this Government&rsquo;s policy of prudent fiscal management.  We are, therefore, in a position to allocate additional moneys to public expenditure.  We may now be among the fastest growing economies in the world, but this does not mean that we can throw caution to the wind, like so many Governments of the past.  The Bill is not about giving away in an irresponsible and unplanned manner, but rather giving back, to the public servants who have endured so much in past years and maintained services in the face of the fiscal discipline and reform which was required.</p>  <p>  The dire economic situation from 2009 onwards necessitated the previous five Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Acts.  Since that time, the cost to the Exchequer of public service pay and pensions has been reduced by approximately &euro;3.7 billion, that is, by more than 21%.  The measures imposed by the FEMPI Acts affecting current and retired public servants directly contribute to savings for the State of &euro;2.2 billion annually.</p>  <p>  This is the seventh consecutive year in which there have been no pay increases for public servants.  In addition to pay freezes, public service workers have endured two, and in the cases of higher paid workers three, reductions in pay since the outbreak of the financial crisis.</p><p>Moreover, under the collective agreements necessitated by our need to cope with the exigencies of the past few years, they are now working 15 million additional hours and providing additional services with 10% fewer staff.  Under those same agreements, they have also seen overtime and other payments reduced, while other conditions relating to pensions, sick leave and holidays have also been changed.</p> <p> The policy of pay freezes and reductions is no longer sustainable; as growth returns, thank God, and private sector wages rise, it is only right that our nurses, garda&iacute; and teachers should see modest increases in their take-home pay too.  During the crisis their sacrifices allowed us to sustain our public services while at the same time cutting costs considerably.  The legal position concerning the financial emergency legislation, which has underpinned the reductions to date, had to be addressed as part of putting in place sustainable pay-setting arrangements in the public service.  The constitutionality of the Acts is predicated on the existence of a financial emergency, which has now been brought under control by the actions of the Government.  Commencing the orderly winding down of this legislation in an agreed and sustainable process, rather than risking a successful legal challenge, is the appropriate and prudent approach.  This Bill is the first step in that process.</p> <p> Following the public service pay talks that concluded in May of this year, the Labour Relations Commission, as it was then known, put forward a series of proposals on the partial and phased restoration to public servants of deductions made under the five previous Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Acts under the heading of the Lansdowne Road agreement.  These restorations are significantly weighted in favour of the lower paid.  The changes to the FEMPI measures require the Government to now bring forward primary legislation to amend the existing Acts.  The text and terms of the Lansdowne Road agreement were approved by Government on 3 June and the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions accepted the text and terms of the agreement on 16 September.  I firmly believe this agreement strikes the right balance between the legitimate aspirations of public servants to pay recovery and sustaining our improving public finances.  The estimated additional cost of the measures agreed in the Lansdowne Road agreement is &euro;267 million in 2016, &euro;290 million in 2017 and &euro;287 million in 2018.  In addition, a reduction of the public service pension deduction, impacting public sector pensioners, carries a cost of &euro;30 million for 2016, 2017 and 2018.</p> <p> The public service in Ireland has changed for the better, but with the end of the emergency, any thought of returning to how things were or even staying still must be resisted; what we want is an ongoing, active rejuvenation across all of our public services.  Crucially, as part of the Lansdowne Road agreement, both sides have recommitted to the pay and productivity measures introduced in the Haddington Road agreement that preceded it.  The unions signalled their support for long-term and sustainable workplace reforms to underpin the delivery of a more integrated, efficient and effective public service.  These include changes in the areas of performance management, work sharing, redeployment, and workforce restructuring.  Active employee support for these initiatives is key, and the value of industrial relations peace and stability in this country during the crisis and in future should not be underestimated, particularly when one reflects on the scenes we have witnessed in some other European countries.</p> <p> Efficient public services are essential to a modern society.  When we came into office, reform of the public service was a key component of our strategy to meet the enormous challenges we faced.  I am proud of the considerable improvements that we have delivered since 2011, and I again commend public servants on their effort and commitment in this regard.  That process must continue, and change is now an inevitable part of working in the public service, as it is when working in any sphere of the economy.  As well as being more efficient and productive, the new public service must continue to be responsive to the needs of service users and businesses and become more strategic, focusing on longer-term outcomes for society as a whole, as well as every citizen.  The implementation of our Civil Service renewal plan and the wider programme of public service reform will continue to play a key role in Ireland&rsquo;s recovery.</p> <p> This Bill is concerned with the amendment of prior legislation, predominantly the FEMPI Acts, to give effect to what has been agreed between employers and trade unions in the Lansdowne Road agreement.  As I have stated, it is the first step in the carefully managed unwinding of the FEMPI legislation necessary for the pay and pensions of public servants to be restored.  As Deputies will see, the measures it introduces are proportionate and fair, with something given back to all, since all contributed, but with the lower-paid standing to receive the most relative to where they were.  For the benefit of Members I will briefly outline its main provisions.</p> <p> Section 3 concerns pay restoration for public servants.  It amends the FEMPI (No. 2) Act 2009 to allow the reductions effected under that Act to be lessened.  It is important to stress that the nature of this is progressive and measured, with lower-paid public servants standing to gain most proportionately.  It is also equitable, with the rationale being that because all public servants suffered pay reductions under the previous FEMPI Acts, all should receive relief of some kind.  The restoration will take place in the following way: from 1 January next, public servants earning up to &euro;24,000 will have their salary increased by 2.5%, while those earning between &euro;24,000 and &euro;31,000 will receive a 1% increase.  On 1 September 2017, the salary of all public servants earning less than &euro;65,000 will be increased by &euro;1,000.  As well as these measures, this section will reverse the additional pay cuts for the higher paid from 2013, as follows.  Where their annual salary is between &euro;65,000 and &euro;110,000, the amount by which it was reduced will be restored in two halves, first on 1 April 2017 and then on 1 January 2018.  This restoration was part of the Haddington Road agreement and the Government is happy to follow through on that commitment.  For public servants with an annual salary above &euro;110,000, the amount by which it was reduced will be restored in three equal parts, on 1 April 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.  This slower restoration of the cut in pay for this higher-paid group is proportionate and fair.</p> <p> Section 4 amends the FEMPI Act 2013 to extend by a further two years the suspension of the operation of incremental pay scales with respect to any public servants who are not encompassed by a registered collective agreement as outlined in section 7 of that Act - that is, by the Haddington or Lansdowne Road agreements.  This provision follows the existing structure of the 2013 Act and is now extended to accommodate the Lansdowne Road agreement.</p> <p> Section 5 deals with the pension-related deduction payable by all public servants and introduces measures to reduce it, putting money back into the hands of those who have had to pay this additional levy on their wages for the past six years.  To this end, it amends the first FEMPI Act of 2009 so that this year&rsquo;s exemption threshold increases from &euro;15,000 up to &euro;17,500.  This provision provides for outstanding monies due in respect of the small change effected in pension-related deduction rates under the Haddington Road agreement in January 2014, rather than in July 2013, when all other measures took effect.  The cost of this is &euro;20 million.  From 1 January next year, the exemption threshold rises again, this time up to &euro;26,083.  This figure is a blended sum, which equates to the provisions agreed in the Lansdowne Road agreement, whereby the threshold is increased to &euro;24,750 from 1 January 2016 and then again to &euro;28,750 per annum from 1 September 2016.  For administrative purposes, the two figures have been amalgamated into one, which will operate from the beginning of the year in order to achieve the reduction required over the course of the year.  The full-year effect of the new rate is then set for 2017.</p><p> Sections 6 and 7 concern the public service pension reduction, PSPR, currently payable by retired public servants on their pensions.  Both sections amend the FEMPI Act of 2010.  There are three groups affected by the PSPR and they will all have the amount payable reduced over the next three years through incremental increases in the threshold for exemption.  The three categories of retired public servants who pay the PSPR and will have their pensions partially and proportionally restored by the measures in this Bill are those with pensions in excess of &euro;12,000 and who had the levy imposed by the 2010 FEMPI Act, those with pensions worth upwards of &euro;32,500 who were also affected by the further levy in the 2013 FEMPI Act, and those who retired after 29 February 2012 and receive salaries in excess of &euro;32,500, and thus were affected by the 2013 FEMPI Act only.</p> <p> Sections 8 and 9 are straightforward amendments of the FEMPI Act of 2009.  The changes being made reflect the very different economic context in which we operate, six years after the original Act, and the need to adjust upwards in some cases rather than solely downwards.  The original FEMPI Act gave the Minister for Health, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, the power to reduce the fees paid to health professionals by the State for services rendered.  This amendment allows him or her to increase these if necessary and stipulates certain considerations to be borne in mind when doing so.  We are, therefore, undoing the reduction.  Similarly, section 9 will allow any other Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to increase the fees paid by the State for certain services should he or she wish to do so.  Section 10 is necessary to allow an exception to be made to the provision in the FEMPI (No. 2) Act of 2009, which prevents any increase in pay for public servants.  The exception being allowed for is where such an increase is provided for in a registered collective agreement, such as the Haddington Road and Lansdowne Road agreements.  For example, in the Haddington Road agreement it was agreed that teachers would cease to receive allowances for supervision and substitution but that from 2016 their wages would be adjusted to reflect this.  This section enables that adjustment to be made by the Government, but as might be expected, that will only happen for public servants adhering to the commitments to which they have signed up.</p> <p> Unlike the rest of the Bill, the last two sections deal with other Acts besides the FEMPI legislation.  Section 11 comprises amendments to the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act of 1961 in relation to the pay of the judiciary.  These are in two parts.  The first is to provide that the pay of the Judiciary shall continue to be set by Government order but that such orders will no longer need to amend primary legislation.  This is done on the advice of the Attorney General and, while not a significant change in itself, it ensures best legal practice is adhered to.  The second is more substantive.  It replaces the measures in the FEMPI (Amendment) Act of 2011 which extended the 10% pay reduction for new entrants into the public service to the Judiciary.  Under the new measures, new appointees to the bench will be put on a three-point payscale so that within two years they can achieve parity with their peers.  This is in keeping with the general measures put in place for new appointees and recent entrants to the public service and as such addresses an inequity in terms of the remuneration of judges.</p> <p> Section 12 amends the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2011 to give the Minister permanent powers to deal with situations where public servants become in receipt of salaries at rates higher than those approved by the Minister or in receipt of allowances which have not been approved.  The Bill ensures that any such excessive remuneration that has been given without consent shall not have contractual effect and that any unsanctioned overpayment in this regard is recoverable from the public servant.</p> <p> The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2015 is a relatively short Bill but its impact is considerable.  It represents an important turning of the corner in that for the first time in six years, we are in a position where, due to careful economic management on the part of this Government, a FEMPI Bill is being presented to this House which will give something back to our public servants rather than taking more away.  There are some public servants who will perhaps object that we could have been more generous.  To them we can only plead that we must be cautious after the recklessness of our predecessors &ndash; after all, it is our rectitude which now allows us to give some restoration &mdash; and remind them that this is simply the first step in an ongoing process.  As for those on the other side who would have no relief for public servants whatever, to them I can only reiterate what I have already said regarding the emergency nature of the FEMPI legislation and the legal necessity of its being unwound.  I would also add that public servants have contributed very substantially to the recovery we are now experiencing and that it is just and equitable that they be rewarded for their sacrifice in the form of a partial pay restoration.</p> <p> Of course, Government must also choose the right balance between competing priorities and principles.  In this case, the legitimate expectation of public servants for some form of pay recovery must be weighed against broader economic considerations, including the limits placed upon our spending by fiscal ceilings, while the ever-present need to maintain reformed and sustainable public services must also be factored in.  This is a time for cool heads and careful calculations, not red-hot rhetoric or bluster.  Hence the Government has provided in this Bill a measured and carefully calibrated response that recognises, but does not compromise, the significant improvement and recovery from the fiscal emergency it inherited and on which the previous FEMPI legislation was predicated, and which provides a fair and reasonable return to our nurses, doctors and garda&iacute;, all of whom were required to make considerable sacrifices during that emergency.  This is restoration done responsibly.</p> <p> I look forward to hearing the views of the House on the Bill and I commend this Bill to the House.</p></speech>

We will be supporting the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2015 because it is based on the various agreements the Minister referred to, namely, the Lansdowne Road agreement, which succeeded the Haddington Road agreement, and it has been voted on democratically by hundreds of thousands of public servants who have, as the Minister rightly said, had severe financial measures imposed on them in recent years.  This is the start of a process of unwinding that by degrees.  I will talk about the unwinding process and whether it can be done by degrees or in the timescale the Minister might like versus the timescale others might choose.  I will refer to the one or two aspects in the Minister's speech I want to deal with, but I also want to put some things on record from our side of the House.  Some of it will cover ground the Minister has covered and go through matters in respect of the FEMPI legislation and some of the key provisions included in it.  I have specific issues we will inevitably raise in detail on Committee Stage.</p>  <p>  We have to put on the record the history of the FEMPI legislation.  The first Act was passed in 2009 and it introduced what was commonly known as the pension levy.  The second FEMPI Act in 2009 reduced the salaries of public sector workers.  In 2010 we had FEMPI legislation again and the Act imposed a public service pension reduction, PSPR, on pensions of &euro;12,000 and upwards.  It also altered the minimum wage, which has since been amended again.  In 2011 we also had the FEMPI (Amendment) Act which dealt with the situation of the existing pay reductions to be applied to sitting judges.  It introduced a new wage scale for judges appointed after the commencement of the Act and that legislation also reduced the remuneration of certain other officeholders, namely, the Taoiseach and Ministers.  Then we had the FEMPI Act 2013, which brought in a reduction in the remuneration of certain public servants, including Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Judiciary and other officeholders.</p><p> People might wonder what FEMPI legislation is, but it is relevant to anybody in the public service in relation to the Lansdowne Road agreement which was concluded on 29 May 2015 and the Haddington Road agreement about which we have spoken separately.</p> <p> The Lansdowne Road agreement, LRA, was not unanimously accepted by all trade unions.  The Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland, ASTI, voted 74% against the Lansdowne Road agreement with a turnout of 31%.</p></speech>

Sometimes there can be indifference as well.</p>  <p>  We cannot trumpet a result when it suits us and then when a result does not suit us, look at the underlying turnout.  However, I stated there was a 31% turnout.  The Teachers' Union of Ireland also voted against the Lansdowne Road agreement, with 92% opposed following a 60% turnout.</p>  <p>  The ASTI decided not to be bound by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions aggregate acceptance of the agreement.  That is something I cannot fully get to the bottom of.  I do not know what that means because I thought that, generally, one was dealing with the Congress public sector committee here.  It is a issue that is left hanging.  Maybe it has been resolved to the knowledge and satisfaction of others.</p>  <p>  In July 2015, the Lansdowne Road agreement was also rejected by the Irish Medical Organisation, with 93% voting against.  They stated that the agreement does nothing to address the real crisis in the health service.  Therefore, that vote was not exactly on the issue, but one could see the frustration and that the staff on the front line dealing with the health service are not happy with the funding of the health service.  The Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors rejected the agreement by a majority of 53.6%.  Those are merely a handful.  We all will be aware that once the big unions are on-side, it is a done deal.  One could argue that the smaller unions often have the luxury of being able to vote "No" in the full knowledge that it has already been carried in any event, but that will bring us to the overall collective agreement.</p>  <p>  The consequences of non-compliance with the Lansdowne Road agreement have been raised by the ASTI in the context of increments and other adjustments to the teacher supervision and substitution allowance.  The Haddington Road agreement included a commitment to address the supervision and substitution allowance for teachers at the 2011 rate of &euro;1,592 by way of salary increases in two phases, in the 2016-17 and 2017-18 school years.  Section 10 of the Bill provides the statutory basis to effect the provisions of this commitment regarding supervision and substitution such that the pay of public servants may be adjusted to reflect the terms of a collective agreement.  That is an issue to which we will have to return because some might feel that this could be interpreted as a punitive measure contained in the FEMPI legislation, as being unfair and heavy handed and disproportionate in reacting to the specific concerns of those involved in the provision of education.  Those are the bones of contention.</p>  <p>  On the bigger picture, as I stated, the general agreement has been accepted, has been voted on by public servants and it would be remiss of us not to support the implementation of this agreement.  My party has been involved in lots of national pay agreements over many years and we always honoured them, both in the spirit and to the letter of the law.  I do not see any reason to depart from our tradition on either public sector pay agreements or wider agreements including those from the farming and voluntary sectors.  This agreement is not one of the latter agreements.  It is an agreement between the Government and its employees.  It is not a wider social agreement.  There are those - I am sure the party the Minister, Deputy Howlin, is in government with - who might not agree with them getting any increase at all and, probably, if they had their way, would even cut their numbers and their salaries a little more if they could, and they complain about the pensions.  Employees are paying substantially to their public sector pensions - it is only right to acknowledge that - through superannuation and pension deductions.  That is always forgotten about in some of the equations and it is important to state.</p>  <p>  In relation to the remuneration of public servants, the increases proposed under the Bill for those earning up to &euro;24,000 is 2.5% on 1 January next year - the Government was correct to wait until the staff get the money in their pockets before it goes to the polls.  The Government will hope the staff will be grateful for it but they will feel that it is their money, they have earned it and they should be getting it.  The days of politicians feeling that people will be grateful for doing what they are elected to do are gone, if some ever thought they did.  Those earning from &euro;24,000 to &euro;31,000 will get a 1% increase as well on 1 January.  Those earning up to &euro;65,000 will get &euro;1,000 in September 2017 - they must wait as it is a little bit down the road.</p>  <p>  Some of the staff on those higher salaries will qualify for the restoration of the 2013 reductions in pay under Haddington Road.  Oireachtas Members, who are on a salary between &euro;65,000 and &euro;110,000, will get 50% of the 2013 reduction in April 2017.  The Minister might clarify, for those Members who are here today who might not be here at that date, what is the exact position and will it be restored.  He might, at Committee Stage-----</p></speech>

At Committee Stage, we can tease that out.  Those Members will get the second 50% of that 2013 FEMPI Act reduction on 1 January 2018.  One must remember that those are really only the ones who experienced a reduction under the Haddington Road agreement, in which there was a sunset clause.  I will not join the bandwagon of those who say TDs should work for nothing.  There are those who peddle a myth that we should work for the average industrial wage.  There is no Member in this House of any party living on the average industrial wage.  Some Members say they do but we know it is not true.  We look at them, we see the cars they drive and we see they spend more at elections than most of us do.  The question is where are the funds coming from.  It might not be coming through their salaries, but certainly they have more access to funds than most of us have.</p>  <p>  Those on the higher salaries of over &euro;110,000 must wait another year to get their Haddington Road agreement reductions back.  Some say they should not get it back but I am on public record as stating that where an agreement is freely entered into, negotiated, voted on and accepted by public servants, I would not be comfortable voting against it, and that is what has been negotiated.</p>  <p>  Pension-related deductions on pensions is a thorny issue on which the Alliance of Retired Public Servants has spoken to us.  They met a number of us in recent days and I will come back to their particular issue.</p>  <p>  Section 9 of the Bill deals with a variation rather than a reduction in payment to health professionals.  That is fine, and I will not quibble over that.  I might ask the Minister to clarify what he has in mind.  I mentioned earlier this issue of the collective agreement.</p>  <p>  The one issue I am intrigued about is the amendment for judges' pay in the Bill.  I note the briefing note we received from the Government Whip's office mentioned that the Office of the Attorney General spoke of this.  Why would he?  Is he not one of them himself?  Is he not a member of the legal profession?</p></speech>

I must put on record that I question this.</p>  <p>  In accordance with advice from the Office of the Attorney General, amendments to the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act of 1961 are being brought forward to regularise the position with regard to the arrangements for remuneration of members of the Judiciary.  This Act also provides that persons newly appointed to the Bench are not restricted from achieving pay parity with existing judges following the application of measures of the FEMPI Act 2010.  The Minister might have an opportunity to clarify it.  On the face of it, although I may be wrong, there is something fundamentally wrong if we are passing legislation here to allow judges not to be restricted from achieving pay parity with those who were appointed some time ago.  Can we do that for teachers?</p></speech>

I ask the question and the Minister can answer it in due course.  I would be most concerned that the provision would apply to all public servants, including nurses, garda&iacute; and teachers.  Any of us who were listening to the radio in the past week or two will have been shocked to hear about the net take-home pay of some new garda&iacute;, the garda recruits and garda&iacute; who are putting their lives on the line to look after the rest of us.</p><p>They are getting what most people would not consider to be a decent salary for the work they do.  Perhaps the Minister might deal with it in his reply or we can tease it out on Committee Stage.  I will be happy if the Minister says the measure will be reversed in respect of those who came in on the lower pay scales and perhaps he might provide a detailed timeframe in this regard.  I would be very pleased to support such a measure, given that it is an ongoing, burning issue with many people.<br/><br/>I return to the basis for the continued existence of the FEMPI legislation.  While we all accept the reason it was introduced in the first instance, the Minister stated earlier:</p><blockquote>The legal position concerning the financial emergency legislation, which has underpinned the reductions to date, had to be addressed as part of putting in place sustainable pay-setting arrangements in the public service for the future.  The constitutionality of the Acts is predicated on the existence of a financial emergency ...</blockquote><p>When the Minister goes canvassing next year, will he tell people we are still in a financial emergency?  I have heard nothing-----</p></speech>

My apologies for not sticking to the formal process.  I do not think we are in a financial emergency.  I have listened to Minister after Minister, the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and everybody else explaining to the people who wonderfully well the country is doing, how great the country is and how it is the greatest little country in which to do business.  Nothing the Government has said is consistent with the Minister stating that we continue to grapple with a financial emergency which needs to be brought under control.  The Minister is rightly concerned.  He said, "Commencing the orderly wind down of this legislation in an agreed and sustainable process, rather than risking a successful legal challenge, is the appropriate and prudent approach [to take]."</p>  <p>  Many people would question whether the Government can say we are in a financial emergency in light of the recent announcement, which gives the lie to the assertion that there is such an emergency.  There was a financial emergency and, in that context, I will return and deal in specific detail with the report the Minister issued to the Oireachtas in June.  Ireland has done well.  We have come through the financial emergency and we must be careful and prudent.  However, if somebody challenged this in a court, no judge would say there is a financial emergency.</p>  <p>  The expenditure ceiling for 2015, announced 12 months ago on budget day 2014, was &euro;53.626 billion.  The actual expenditure for 2015, announced last week on budget day, October 2015, was &euro;54.875 billion, an excess of approximately &euro;1.25 billion.  People are talking about Supplementary Estimates of the order of &euro;1.5 billion.  I do not know what will be the exact figure because we have not seen the details yet.  Last week, the expenditure ceilings for 2016 were announced.  We are talking about expenditure of up to &euro;55.275 billion, which is another &euro;382 million on top of the Supplementary Estimates of &euro;1.249 billion for 2015.  Over those few days last week, at the stroke of a pen, expenditure for 2015 was increased by &euro;1.249 billion.  On budget day, it was also announced that expenditure for 2016 will be opening with an extra &euro;1.249 million to match the Supplementary Estimate for the coming year, 2016.  In addition, new measures of approximately &euro;400 million or more were announced.  I estimate that in those few days the Government announced an extra &euro;2.89 billion in expenditure for the 15-month period from October 2015 to the end of 2016.  It is almost &euro;3 billion extra and in the region of &euro;1.5 billion in Supplementary Estimates.  With the same amount added into the opening figures for next year and new initiatives announced on budget day of several hundred million, it is inconceivable that the Government can increase expenditure by &euro;3 billion while trying to tell people there is a financial emergency.  I question the feasibility of doing so.</p>  <p>  At a particular point we mentioned the possibility of having a discussion - perhaps on Committee Stage - regarding the annual review and report to the Houses of the Oireachtas under section 12 of the FEMPI legislation, which was published in June 2015.  We did not have opportunity to do so.  Perhaps the committee schedules were too full or we did not have time in the House.  I am not arguing on it.  While some people might find this a dry topic to discuss, we are elected to do so.  Members who deal with public expenditure and the finance committee are elected to do this job.  The report examined the economic context and stated that real GDP in 2014 was still 2% lower than that of 2007.  However, we have probably now surpassed the peak figure of 2007.</p>  <p>  The Minister's report also states that the economic recovery is well under way, but goes on to state that, "while recent improvements in competitiveness have been beneficial, it is important to highlight that as a small, open economy the Irish economy is particularly susceptible to external risks".  It mentions oil prices, the situation in Greece, unconventional monetary policy, low interest rates and the current low inflation rate.  Using this is a formula, we could be in surplus and have no debt and the Government could say we are still in a financial emergency because we are a small open economy susceptible to oil prices, low inflation, low interest rates and the Greek situation.  This is not an acceptable reason for saying Ireland should continue to be in a state of emergency.</p>  <p>  The Minister's report mentions tax receipts.  This year, income tax receipts are predicted to be higher than they were at the height of the boom.  The report refers to general Government debt measures as part of the justification for the continued existence of the financial emergency.  The T&aacute;naiste and leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Burton, said here that in a year's time our debt will reach the European average.  This is not an emergency situation, unless somebody tells Angela Merkel she has an emergency in her country, the debt levels of which those of Ireland match.  I do not buy it and nobody else would.  It is important that there be a bit of realism.  I am not talking about unwinding everything in FEMPI.  Rather, I am referring to being real and calling a spade a spade.  There is no financial emergency.  We have announced an extra &euro;3 billion of expenditure for the period between October of this year and the end of next year.  This does not tally with what one would expect during a financial emergency.  No judge could reconcile the two.  He or she could only conclude, based on the Government's actions, that there is no financial emergency.</p>  <p>  The Minister referred to the consideration of the need to continue the provisions of the Act and I understand what he is saying.  I am raising matters here that I could have raised on Committee Stage, had there been a committee meeting.  One group about which I am also particularly concerned is the Alliance of Retired Public Servants.  The Minister met the group several times.  There are approximately 240,000 retired public servants and they were denied access to the Croke Park and Haddington Road talks because these involved discussions on pay, whereas those to whom I refer are in receipt of pensions.</p></speech>

For some time, we have been calling for a mechanism to be found for letting the group into the talks, given that its members were affected by them.  Pensions were cut disproportionately for those with higher incomes.  While they are saying that the changes in the legislation are welcome, the Alliance of Retired Public Servants continues to have concerns.</p><p>They accept that in January 2016, some &euro;400 will be returned to most pensioners affected by the public service pension reduction, with a further &euro;500 to be returned in 2017 and a further &euro;780 to be returned in 2018.  While that will benefit most of those affected by the public service pension reduction, there will continue to be a group that will not be free of its impact.  I tabled parliamentary questions to the Minister for Public Enterprise and Reform last week seeking to know whether he would consider the points made by the alliance.  The reply, which came from the Minister for Finance, made it clear that no further changes are envisaged.  The alliance sought a meeting with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and a separate meeting with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection.  Both Ministers replied by saying they were not prepared to agree to meet the alliance, which was very disappointing.  The alliance is disappointed because it feels that in a democracy, its numbers should at least entitle it to a meeting.  It was essentially told in the parliamentary reply I received through the Minister's officials that the Minister is well aware of these matters.  The Ministers, Deputies Bruton and Burton, have said they are well aware of the issues of concern to the group and those issues have been noted.  That was not satisfactory from the point of view of the alliance.  I would like this aspect of the matter to be dealt with in advance of Committee Stage.</p> <p> It is welcome that we are starting this process.  Everybody here needs to be careful and not reckless.  We cannot unwind everything in the FEMPI legislation.  There are people in this House who think that as part of the unwinding of the FEMPI legislation, all the money that was deducted over the past five years should be handed back in back pay.  All I can say is that I was almost knocked over when I heard that request.  I said upfront that this was the biggest ask ever to be put to me.  We are where we are.  It seems that pay and pensions will be restored in due course.  It is to be hoped that some of those who will not benefit immediately from the unwinding of this legislation will benefit down the road.  It is too much to ask for the reinstatement in the form of back pay of everything that was deducted since 2009.  I have to put that on the record.  I would support the restoration of pay and pensions in an orderly and constructive manner as long as the cost of meeting our obligations does not affect this country's competitiveness.</p> <p> I concede that we are still in a very difficult financial situation with regard to one issue.  I am not speaking about the national debt, which is generally coming under control.  We are going to be heading to European average figures very soon.  I refer instead to the level of personal debt associated with people's high mortgages and negative equity.  I would consider that to be our biggest debt issue.  When the Government got a big national debt under control in previous recessions, the country got going more quickly.  It is taking a little longer on this occasion because of the high level of debt associated with people having to pay expensive mortgages and being in negative equity.  Many of the people in question are public servants, although many of them are not.  I issued a statement in advance of these talks saying that any increase in public service pay should be done in tandem with pay increases in the private sector.  The public sector should not run ahead of the private sector and should not lag behind the private sector.  That is why we recommended in the submission we made when the Low Pay Commission was looking at the situation that the increase in the minimum wage should come in at the same time as these increases.  We did not know the date.  We probably said it should happen in January 2016.  The increase in the minimum wage for those in the private sector is being made in January 2016.  The increases under this legislation and the Lansdowne Road agreement are commencing in January 2016.  That is right.  At the beginning of this process, I called for those increases to happen in tandem.  There has to be a bit of cohesion in society.  It would be very wrong for one group to run ahead of or lag behind the other group.  I do not think there is anyone in the public sector on the minimum wage, by and large.  Maybe they are not all on the living wage, but certainly none of them is on the minimum wage.  The increase in the minimum wage will benefit people in the private sector and this will benefit people in the public sector.  It will be good for people to feel there is some improvement in their financial circumstances.  They can look forward to an eventual declaration by a Minister that the financial emergency is over.  I hope this will happen as soon as possible.  Maybe it will happen in June of next year, although I do not know who will be the relevant Minister then.</p></speech>

I have read his speech.  Speed-reading is one of my varied talents.  As I listened to Deputy Fleming, I almost mistook him for a Government Deputy.  He announced that the emergency is over and almost lauded the Minister for his efforts in that regard.  It seems that Deputy Fleming is labouring under the misapprehension that there are people out there, or even in here, who expect that Deputies, Ministers or the Taoiseach "should work for nothing".  I would like to set the record straight by assuring the Deputy that it is not the case that there are people who feel that way.  As Deputies are aware, in the course of this D&aacute;il I have had many long debates with the Minister about the excessive pay that is received by a small minority of people within the public service and the Civil Service.  It has never been my position, or Sinn F&eacute;in's position, to demand that people "should work for nothing".  Slavery is not something we recommend.  We have insisted on pay moderation and on a recognition that a small minority of people within the system are overpaid.  Even with the FEMPI cuts taking effect, some of the individuals in question are still overpaid in our estimation.  If the Government and the Oireachtas in its entirety are to have any credibility, we have to recognise that such a yawning gap between the pay of those at the bottom and those at the top within the public sector cannot be tolerated.  If we do not address the gap between the workers in the private and public sectors who are struggling and the tiny number of people at the top, we cannot imagine that our voices will carry any weight in the public domain.  I have just been at a meeting in my neighbourhood in Cabra.  We were discussing the budget.  I can tell the Minister that it has not gone down terribly well.</p></speech>

This is an issue that weighs on the public mind.  I do not think there is any point in trying to disregard it or try to portray it as some kind of crazed agenda for poverty among public servants or politicians.  There needs to be an understanding that although we should be paid well, we are not a special category of citizens and we should very quickly lose any delusion of excessive entitlement.  For the record, I drive a Nissan Micra.  If Deputy Fleming is concerned about very big cars, I can assure him that I do not occupy one of them.</p></speech>

One of the things that happened when the FEMPI measures were introduced set a very dangerous and worrying precedent.  I refer to the manner in which the collective bargaining system used by the State, as an employer, to deal with its employees and strike pay arrangements with them was fatally undermined.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, will recall that at the time of the Croke Park agreement, there were regular discussions in here and in studios about the negotiations that were under way with the trade unions, and by extension with their membership, always with the knowledge that if they did not play ball, the Minister would step in and legislate anyway.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, was using a big stick to warn people to make a deal.</p></speech>
