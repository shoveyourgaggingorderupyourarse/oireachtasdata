We have more than 900,000 people waiting for vital medical care as we speak.  I want to focus on just one of the very alarming aspects of this crisis and that is the more than 100,000 children who today go without the treatment they need.  I am talking about children in need of a disability diagnosis, an autism assessment or access to mental health services; I am talking about children who desperately need early intervention but yet face a two-year wait and cannot get access to therapies; and I am also talking about children with scoliosis, who lives their days and nights in agony, waiting for a life-changing procedure.  There should not be one child or family left in such an awful situation, let alone thousands upon thousands.</p>  <p>  Yesterday, we heard what the lack of capacity in our health service actually means for children.  Speaking on radio, Dr. Gabrielle Colleran summed up just how dire things have become.  She said: "I had another doctor write to me last week saying they have a child with neurological symptoms and the appointment they had been offered was for 2035."  That is 14 years away, a wait so long that the child will no longer be a child when the appointment comes around.  The human toll of all of this is devastating.  I personally know of parents of children who miss school regularly because of chronic pain, children so traumatised by their wait that they are on anti-depressants, and children and parents who see no light at the end of the tunnel.  At the root of this, of course, is decades of bad Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael policy - 40 years of pushing private interests, weakening public healthcare, slashing capacity in our hospitals and creating nightmarish working conditions for nurses and doctors.  We see this failed agenda again in the problems that have arisen with the delivery of Sl&aacute;intecare, in the Taoiseach's failure to fill on a permanent basis 720 vital consultant positions and in the fact that so many of our young nurses and midwives do not see their future here.  The problem is that the Government is wedded to a two-tier system that has failed people time and again, and that is why we continue to have a system that does not work for everyone.  It certainly is not working for those 100,000 children.</p>  <p>  Teasta&iacute;onn athr&uacute; uainn.  T&aacute; Rialtas ag teast&aacute;il uainn a th&oacute;gfaidh seirbh&iacute;s sl&aacute;inte a oibreoidh do gach duine.  T&aacute; gn&iacute;omh pr&aacute;inneach ag teast&aacute;il chun dul i ngleic le l&iacute;on ollmh&oacute;r na bp&aacute;ist&iacute; at&aacute; ar liosta&iacute; feithimh.  This has to change.  We need a Government that will build a health service that will work for everyone.  Urgent action is needed to tackle the colossal number of children on waiting lists.  There can be no pl&aacute;m&aacute;sing or hiding behind alibis of complexity.  The Taoiseach's job is to do right by these kids.  There are things he could start today that would make a difference.  I have two specific asks.  Will he commit to filling those 720 consultant positions urgently and on a permanent basis?  Will he target that investment to the areas that most affect children, such as orthopaedics, ear, nose and throat medicine, ENT, and neurology?  Will he invest to increase dramatically diagnostic capacity to the level required to get children off these waiting lists and into care?</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&eacute; ag teacht.  T&aacute; an tseirbh&iacute;s sl&aacute;inte ag &eacute;ir&iacute; n&iacute;os treise l&aacute; i ndiaidh lae.  T&aacute; 6,000 n&iacute;os m&oacute; duine ag obair sa tseirbh&iacute;s i mbliana n&aacute; mar a bh&iacute; ag an am c&eacute;anna anuraidh.  Is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil g&eacute;arch&eacute;im ann.  T&aacute; a fhios ag c&aacute;ch go bhfuil g&eacute;arch&eacute;im ann de bharr na paind&eacute;ime, go bhfuil a l&aacute;n dochar d&eacute;anta do ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; sl&aacute;inte ag an gcor&oacute;inv&iacute;reas agus gur chuir an v&iacute;reas a l&aacute;n br&uacute; ar na c&uacute;rsa&iacute; sin.  Is &eacute; sin an f&aacute;th go bhfuil na liosta&iacute; i bhfad n&iacute;os faide anois n&aacute; mar a bh&iacute; siad roimh theacht an chor&oacute;inv&iacute;ris.</p>  <p>  Change is happening and will continue to happen with regard to our health services.  Fianna F&aacute;il has not been in government for more than ten years.  This Government, of which Fianna F&aacute;il is a member, has dramatically increased health spending over the past 12 months.  Notwithstanding the extraordinary pressure the pandemic has put on our health services and the fact that it has frustrated and impeded our attempts to get waiting lists down, bed capacity has increased, as have ICU capacity and diagnostic capacity.  Up to &euro;25 million in funding has been granted to improve GPs access to diagnostics, which has resulted in up to 70,000 additional scans taking place.</p>  <p>  I take the Deputy's point regarding children.  We do not want children to remain on any waiting list for too long.  In previous eras, we had got waiting lists for children down to three months.  It our objective to get waiting times for children right across the board, including those for mental health, disabilities, acute issues and the various specialties, reduced considerably.  For example, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has allocated &euro;4 million for the period, September and December 2021, to reduce primary care waiting lists for psychology services.  This is a targeted approach that involves the utilisation of public and private capacity, locum professionals, Saturday clinics and so forth to get the waiting times for the thousands of children who had been waiting for access to primary care psychology prior to this initiative reduced significantly.  Likewise, on the special needs front, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has moved very strongly and allocated substantial funding to get the waiting lists for childhood assessments reduced.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Health is preparing an action plan for dealing with waiting lists more generally.  He secured approximately &euro;240 million this year but, because of Covid and the two lockdowns, we had reduced capacity to do the work on that waiting list initiative that we wanted to get done.  The funding will be allocated again for 2022.  The waiting list plan, which aims to tackle these large and unacceptable numbers, will be announced by the Minister shortly.  Critically, it will set out the timelines.  The Deputy should be under no illusion, however.  Substantial change has occurred.  There is no question but that targeting the significant waiting lists, which have also increased significantly because of the pandemic, will be a key priority over the coming weeks, now that we are emerging from the pandemic, and into the early part of 2022, to get those waiting lists and waiting times reduced for all involved.</p></speech>

There are 100,000 children on these waiting lists.  The Taoiseach speaks of the additional &euro;1.2 billion that has been committed but one third of that money has not even been spent.  I asked him specifically about those consultant posts that need to be filled on a permanent basis.  I also asked him specifically about increasing diagnostic capacity.  Saying "mar dhea" or that there is not a problem or that the Government has risen to the challenge simply does not tally with the facts.  By the way, this is not a Covid overhang.  The facts tell us that, in January 2020, long before we heard of Covid on our island, there were 824,000 people on waiting lists.  This is a long-running problem and at the heart of it is capacity.  It is about staffing, beds, theatre space and diagnostics.  I challenge the Taoiseach again and ask him to give reassurance to those children and families that the resources will be invested and that, when the Government's plan is produced, it will not fall short again.</p></speech>

Our 12.5% corporate tax rate has been the most identifiable thing about our industrial policy, the one constant that multinationals could rely on and a rate that was retained when the country went bust and had to be bailed out.  However, the OECD will turn our 12.5% north star into a supernova.</p><p>We all know change is coming with the global minimum corporate tax rate.  There is an inevitability about this.  The evolving language of the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Finance on the issue suggests they accept change is coming.  What will that change look like?  What will our unique selling point be then?  Some countries attract foreign direct investment, FDI, not only through a skilled workforce, but through excellent public services and an affordable cost of living.  Ireland will not attract companies on that basis.  Our dysfunctional housing market means housing costs are the most expensive in the EU.  According to a EUROSTAT survey, housing costs in Ireland are a whopping 78% above the EU average.  Are wages 78% above the EU average?  They are not.  We have the third highest proportion of low-paid workers in the EU.</p><p>When it comes to healthcare costs, Ireland is the only country in western Europe that does not have free universal coverage for primary care, which makes the Government failure to implement Sl&aacute;intecare all the more deplorable.  Our roads are clogged with traffic and our public transport is at capacity and will soon be oversubscribed, with vital infrastructural projects such as MetroLink and DART+ seemingly delayed to 2034.</p><p>Our energy costs are the fourth highest in the EU, and that was before the current explosion in prices, which will put huge strain on families and households this winter.  The energy crisis goes deeper than this.  The <i>Business Post </i>reported an &euro;80 billion investment by Intel is in jeopardy because of antiquated energy and water infrastructure, while the IDA has warned serious reputational damage could be done if these issues are not addressed urgently.</p><p>We have a highly educated workforce but when the corporate tax is changed and the global playing field is levelled, the cost-of-living crisis in this country will factor much higher in the calculations of companies considering setting up or investing here.  Why would they go to a country where workers cannot afford a home and it is not guaranteed that the lights will stay on, when they can go elsewhere and not suffer a tax penalty for doing so?</p><p>What will our industrial policy look like when the 12.5% tax rate is gone?  From this side of the House, it does not look like there is much of a plan or policy in place.  Will the Government announce new measures in the national development plan, NDP, to address the serious infrastructural deficits in the context of that new industrial environment?</p></speech>

The first point is that the corporation tax rate is not the unique selling point in attracting foreign direct investment into the country.  One of the most important decisions made by modern Ireland was to join the EU.  That has been critical to the continued economic transformation of our country.  The party of which I am a member was the party that led that, with other parties that supported our entry into the Union.  Others opposed it at the time.  Some opposed it for approximately 30 years until they saw the light, but it was and is a very important policy in terms of our economic well-being and development and still represents that.  Even earlier this week, when I was in New York talking to companies that are going to locate in Ireland, I made the point to them that if there are questions about our skills base and so on, our membership of the EU has been a huge buffer.  We are the only English-speaking member state now, which is important.</p>  <p>  Second, I point to the decision in the 1960s to bring in free second level education and to open outwards.  The Lemass leadership of opening outwards was a key turning point in modern Ireland.  Investment in third level education over successive generations is also a key selling point for Ireland.  It is important because, repeatedly and consistently, companies that have located here, from the Intels to the Eli Lillys to companies all over the country, will say that the quality of the workforce here is second to none and very strong.  That is a tribute to the education system right throughout.  More latterly, our recent investment in research from the late 1990s onwards is paying dividends in the form of a higher quality of research and development investment that comes in, but we have to do more there into the future.</p>  <p>  The tax system has been important; I do not understate that at all.  That is why we have entered reservations in the OECD's position.  We have not signed up to the OECD consensus, and the reason we have not done so is the lack of certainty in what has been proposed so far.  The key issue for those who invest in Ireland is that they want certainty over the overall industrial policy framework, including tax.  They do not want a situation in which the base rate will change every two to three years.  There is also far more detail in this consensus on which companies will be covered and the threshold around turnover.  Certain sectors such as financial services have been carved out.  The negotiations are not complete at all, and we have made it clear that certainty and continuity, which have always been the hallmark-----</p></speech>

It never was, actually.</p> <p>It was very important, but the other two points I referenced, in terms of investment in education and our joining the European Union, were also key, fundamental pillars of the economic transformation of this country over 50 years, as well as our consistent industrial policy, which has been pro-enterprise.  It is important to be pro-enterprise.  Not everybody in this House has always been pro-enterprise but it is important, and it also important that people get that sense of the country when they arrive here.</p> <p> The Deputy correctly referenced Intel, which is a very interesting example.  We are now a centre of manufacturing excellence globally because of our experience over 30 or 40 years.  We have benefited human capital-wise and in respect of processes in terms of how to manufacture.  We are reliable partners in terms of being a country where manufacturing excellence is so evident.  I was down at the Intel site recently and it is quite stunning, not least to see all the construction companies there.</p></speech>

I am envious of Leixlip in County Kildare when the Taoiseach talks about the number of construction workers alone operating there.  The proposal for a facility in Oranmore would create 10,000 jobs in the region.  It has also highlighted the potential and attractiveness we have in the west and north and how we can make sure we are prepared to take on this opportunity infrastructure-wise.</p>  <p>  The EU recently categorised the north and west of this country as a region in transition, a lagging industrial region and a moderate innovator.  This was done on the basis of measuring our performance in that area.  There are eight counties involved, including Cavan, which is the county represented by the Minister sitting beside the Taoiseach, as well as Monaghan, Donegal and the five counties in Connacht.  A project of the size proposed by Intel will demand that we have support coming into that site in Oranmore, if it comes, and, if it does not come, some other company will come and do it.  We need to have the supports in place to deliver the services, construction and workforce to make sure this project, if it comes or there is another of the same scale, will be transformative for the west of Ireland.</p>  <p>  With the national development plan being looked at currently - I understand the process is called Review to Renew - it is important we take into account where we are in that region and the infrastructure we need to make sure it can reach its full potential.  It has the attractiveness but it needs a lot more than that.  We need to provide the infrastructure and the wastewater facilities in the east of County Galway that are required and being promoted by Galway County Council.  We need to provide the outer ring road in Galway city to make sure people can move around the city and get into it.  We must ensure all the workers coming from the east of the county, where my constituency is, can get into work.  More importantly, we also have to look at what other infrastructure is required.  Phases 1 and 2 of the western rail corridor are waiting to be done.  They would link in Castlebar, Ballina and Westport, as well as Limerick, to support a project such as the one that is proposed.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider all of that.</p>  <p>  The last point I raise is that we need to create that attractiveness for people to come, live, work and enjoy life in the region.  We also must put in place a proper, structured cancer care centre for the region.  We need to make sure it has a full research and innovation structure within it.  It is important that Ireland be at the heart of the European Beating Cancer Plan.</p></speech>

The Deputy referenced one plant.  That is an ongoing issue the company itself will determine but it is interesting from an industrial policy point of view that we are saying to a lot of companies that are investing in Ireland to consider the regions and that we can help to assemble land banks to facilitate significant industrial development.</p> <p> The Deputy referenced the Minister seated beside me, Deputy Humphreys.  More than &euro;42 million has been allocated from the Department of Rural and Community Development.  Under the rural regeneration development fund, Portumna received approximately &euro;2.5 million in funding for a project that will redevelop the historic courthouse building and courtyard in the town.  In the context of the national development plan, we are very conscious of the issues that have been raised, especially relating to the western rail corridor.  All of the Deputies in the House, cross-party, have been in touch in respect of this and, obviously, the Ministers from the region have also.  I know the Minister, Deputy McGrath, is fully aware of the desire of all Oireachtas representatives to have that developed.</p> <p> As the Deputy is aware, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, has launched a strategic rail review that will examine all aspects of interurban and interregional rail and will be conducted on an all-island basis in full co-operation with the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland.  It will provide a strategic backdrop to investment in our rail network for the next 20 years and more, and it will consider the potential of currently lightly used lines like Limerick to Waterford, disused lines like the western rail corridor, and the potential for new alignments.  The review has just commenced and will be completed within 12 months.  As I say, there is considerable advocacy on behalf of this corridor from all of the Ministers and Deputies representing the western region and we will, obviously, continue to pursue that in the context of the national development plan.</p> <p> I point out the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, is spearheading the development of a new west regional enterprise plan.  It is a bottom-up plan that was developed by regional stakeholders, including the local authorities, enterprise agencies, local enterprise offices, regional skills forums and education and training institutes in each region.  Under the regional enterprise development fund and the Border enterprise development fund, about &euro;16.7 million has now been allocated to approximately nine enterprise-focused projects for the region.  We will continue, in the context of all the various initiatives under different Departments, to advance the economic development of the west and we fully take on board the points raised in respect of the necessity to do that and the importance of the western rail corridor in that context.</p></speech>

We need a bit more in the west than just a desire to do something.  We need a commitment on it.  It is very important that a commitment is made.  As the Taoiseach stated, politically, everybody wants to do the rail network.  It is actually part of our climate action plan to make sure transportation and production within plants are all done in a way that saves on CO2 emissions.  The most important and pertinent point, however, is that when a global company such as Intel puts out a finger and states that, out of ten places worldwide, it is looking at Galway and the west of Ireland, we should consider what it would mean if it did come to the region.  We must consider what needs to be done to make sure that if it does come, we are ready to support it and make sure it is viable.  If it does not come, we have to make sure that we are ready for the next global organisation to look at the region.  We have already had the case of Apple, which was attracted to Athenry and still is.  There are a significant number of medical technology companies in Galway, but what is happening is that every one of those workers coming in from the east of the county has to travel to work by road.  We are talking about taking cars and lorries off the roads.  We have an ideal opportunity with the western rail corridor to make sure we deliver the goods and services to Intel in a way that meets our climate action plan as well.  It is ready to be done.  No planning permission or anything else is needed.  It would be a good stamp for this Government to put desire into action and to get it going.</p></speech>

There is a strong proactive Government approach to encouraging investment into the regions where that is possible and where we can facilitate it.  That is a very important point.  I take the Deputy's point in terms of railways more generally.  In the context of climate action, the climate change agenda and the necessity to decarbonise, railways will have a much more important role now and into the future.  In that context, the Minister has commissioned the all-island strategic rail review, which will set out the map, as it were, and the plans, followed by the allocation of resources to get such projects under way.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, the Department of Rural and Community Development is funding the Western Development Commission in respect of regional remote working hubs, which are important in building up the human capital skills base to facilitate smaller enterprises as well as creating the overall capacity so that the requisite skill sets are there when bigger players come into the region.  For us now, it is about getting these projects delivered.  The resources are being allocated to do so.</p></speech>

The Government recently announced an ambitious Housing for All plan, but its success is predicated, among other things, on being able to attract new construction workers.  Around 27,000 are required, according to some estimates.  On top of that, the Taoiseach's colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan, has stated that we need 27,000 new construction workers to carry out retrofitting across the State.  Where are they all going to come from?</p>  <p>  At the moment, 3,500 apprenticeships are delayed because of backlogs caused by Covid.  I do not doubt the difficulties Covid caused for the vocational side of the training they do in education and training boards, ETBs, and colleges across the State.  However, I do not believe that difficulties are a sufficient excuse.  We need these workers to be trained and to enter the workforce.  We also need to ensure they realise how valued they are, because 5,500 trainees left apprenticeships over the past five years.  I do not know why this happened.  I am not saying all of it was because of delays or even any of it was necessarily because of delays.  However, I know many of my young constituents in County Clare are very frustrated by the delays because they cannot move on to the next level, which has repercussions for how much they can earn, when they are going to earn properly and, they hope, get a house and support a family.</p>  <p>  SOLAS announced funding recently and stated that the backlog would be cleared.  What does it mean that the backlog will be cleared?  Does it mean the backlog of getting new apprentices into the system will be cleared?  Currently, there are apprentices who started a four-year apprenticeship and are now being told it will take them six years to complete it.  Medical, dental or other students across the State are not being told that instead of their degrees taking four years, they will now take six years, nor should they be.  Apprentices should not be treated any differently.  The State should do whatever it takes to ensure these apprentices get the training they signed up for in full and on time so that they can enter the workforce.  That is, of course, if the Housing for All plan is to actually take off.  There are many other problems.  Construction materials are costing a lot of money and very little is being done in terms of granting felling licences to get timber in.  However, I wish to focus on apprenticeships today.  What is the Government going to do on apprenticeships?  Will it provide a guarantee to existing apprentices and those who are hoping to start apprenticeships that they will finish their apprenticeships on time and the ETBs and colleges will be providing the training that is an essential part of their apprenticeship to enable them to finish on time?</p></speech>

It is a very pertinent question that goes to heart of the challenges that face us in terms of Housing for All and having the requisite skill sets, but also across the broader economy.  There is a waiting list for craft apprentice off-the-job training in electrical, plumbing, carpentry and joinery.  The Deputy is correct on that.  Covid and the measures that happened as a result in terms of lockdowns have been a factor in backlogs, but there has also been a doubling of the apprentice population over the past four years.</p> <p>In addition to that, there was the closure of face-to-face training in 2020 and 2021 and reduced capacity due to Covid-19 distancing requirements.  Programmes were running at a capacity of 40% to 50% to allow for appropriate distancing.  SOLAS, as recently as last Thursday, announced the actions being taken to address this so apprentices whose training has been affected by the impact of Covid will be offered places for phases 2, 4 and 6 of their programmes, which consist of off-the-job training.  More than 4,800 apprentices currently on a waiting list for off-the-job or workshop-based training are now on track to commence their training by the end of 2021.  This represents 40% of those currently waiting.  One hundred percent will be returned to workshop-based training in 2022.  We fully accept the vital importance of getting these apprentices back into their programmes as quickly as possible.  Those who are waiting the longest will be prioritised.</p> <p> Twenty million euro in capital has been allocated to SOLAS and the Higher Education Authority, HEA, to provide up to an additional 4,000 off-the-job training places for craft apprentices to address the current backlogs.  From September 2021, course provision returned to full capacity.  Places created from the capital investment of &euro;20 million are now beginning to come on stream.  This expansion is planned to continue throughout 2022 as new facilities become available for learner use.  A restructuring of phase 2 programmes in the three main apprenticeship areas &mdash; plumbing; electrical; and carpentry and joinery &mdash; will allow for blended learning over the coming period, reducing the time spent on site and providing for an additional intake off premises at phase 2.</p> <p> The Deputy will know that the apprenticeship incentivisation scheme will continue to operate until the end of this year.  We will review that.  Employers approved by SOLAS to employ apprentices are eligible for a &euro;3,000 grant for each new apprentice registered.  Between March 2020 and August 2021, in excess of &euro;10 million was sanctioned for payment under this initiative, supporting almost 2,000 employers to employ more than 3,500 apprentices.  Phase 2 training continued throughout the summer, with 780 apprentices starting their training in July and August.  Phase 2 is scheduled on an ongoing basis.  Therefore, more classes are being scheduled at present.</p> <p> At the end of August, there were about 18,733 registered craft apprentices, with 9,743 waiting for a period in respect phases 2, 4 or 6 of their seven-phase apprenticeships.</p></speech>

I greatly welcome them all.  My question is simple: will these apprentices finish their apprenticeships when they are scheduled to do so?  No doubt, they have made plans for their lives, including to buy a van and get working, and ultimately to buy a house as they are building houses.  Will they be able to commence as fully qualified electricians, carpenters, plumbers etc. as scheduled?</p>  <p>  To draw an analogy, the members of the Government have a slightly unusual relationship in that the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, was told he would be Taoiseach again in December 2022.  If the Taoiseach turned around to the T&aacute;naiste and said that since there have been a lot of difficulties over Covid, he was not going to be Taoiseach for another year at least-----</p></speech>

Obviously, on-the-job training, off-site training and so forth are important.  The blended programme I referred to should make up time, and there is a desire to get people back on track in terms of the timeline so they can complete their apprenticeship programme within the timeline identified at the outset.  I cannot give guarantees in respect of that but I would like to believe that SOLAS and the HEA will be flexible and sensible enough in terms of the design of the programmes and using that blended approach to facilitate the individuals concerned.</p>  <p>  Overall, what is clear from this is that there has been a step change.  The new Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science is leaving its mark in respect of further education and apprenticeship training, but it is also bringing together and co-ordinating much more effectively than heretofore SOLAS, the education and training boards, and the Higher Education Authority.  This is extremely important if we are to achieve the best value for the resources that are allocated and more targeted approaches.</p> <p>We need more skilled apprentices available to the economy right across the board.  We have a retrofitting programme to do, and, again, we will require specific skill sets for that in addition to the housebuilding.  There is a whole programme on direct provision.  A whole programme will be required right across the board.  It is going to be very challenging on the skills front.</p></speech>

This morning, we heard very harrowing news about an investigation being carried out at Cork University Maternity Hospital after it emerged that the organs of 18 babies were transported abroad and disposed of by incineration without the consent or knowledge of their parents.  I am sure we can only imagine the extreme hurt and distress that those families are now experiencing.  This is not the first scandal and upset around organ retention and matters arising from this, however.  It is beyond belief that we are at this point again.</p>  <p>  As the Taoiseach will know, what happened in Cork University Maternity Hospital is in breach of HSE guidelines that go back to 2012 arising from a previous scandal.  We need answers.  We need to know why this happened.  As a matter of urgency, time needs to be made available for the Minister for Health to appear before the House to make a statement, take questions and give answers to the D&aacute;il, but, more importantly, to start to give answers and assurances to those families, in particular, and to the wider community.</p></speech>

How was this allowed to happen?  It happened under the pressure of the pandemic, which bore down on every Irish hospital.  Did anything similar happen in any other Irish hospital as the pandemic loomed?  We want time to be made available this week for statements on this issue, and, in particular, for questions and answers with the Minister.</p></speech>

We need a debate on this.  It is truly shocking.  It actually did not happen during the pandemic.  It happened in the November before the pandemic arrived on our shores so we cannot blame the pandemic for everything.  It is truly outrageous that this could go on, but, of course, the Government ushered in abortion here so can we expect anything better?</p></speech>

It is very difficult to comprehend how this occurred because this was the subject of a very exhaustive and comprehensive inquiry in the past across every single hospital in the country.  The Dunne inquiry would have been involved in that.</p>  <p>  That this was done without the consent or knowledge of the bereaved parents is cruel and unacceptable.  I would certainly be anxious to facilitate a debate in the House and for questions to be asked.  I believe the Minister is seeking assurances from every other site across the country that this did not occur.  There are two inquiries and I understand that a review is under way within the HSE at the moment.  With that said, I understand fully the desire of the House to have some debate and the issue raised in respect of the parents concerned.  We will certainly facilitate that on this side of the House.</p></speech>

Rents are way above the Celtic tiger peak, house prices are getting there too, homelessness is endemic and families are on council housing waiting lists for an eternity, some for 14 years and more.  Even so, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, the Taoiseach's man, the man charged with fixing housing, does not believe the property market is out of control.  It is this kind of clueless, out-of-touch thinking behind the Minister's housing plan that means we again have a plan that puts developers and investors first.  Will the Taoiseach get a grip on this crisis, drop his recycled, failed policies and deliver a plan that works for people?</p></speech>

More than 90,000 social houses will be delivered over the period of the plan, along with thousands of cost rental and so forth.  I have always stated that housing is the number one social crisis of our time and it needs everyone in this House on board.  The Deputy and her party need to get a grip with it and not just in a knee-jerk way oppose every application that comes before them because it will get them votes in particular constituencies.

Many people believe it is the indefinite deferral and delay of MetroLink.  The programme for Government not only mentions MetroLink but states, "the Government will prioritise plans for the delivery of Metrolink".  Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin is the Taoiseach, the chief, the boss.  Will he assure the House and the people of Swords and north Dublin that the Government is still committed to Metrolink; that once the railway order goes through and planning permission is given, work will begin as soon as possible; and that the Government will deliver MetroLink as close as possible to 2027 and not push it out to 2034, as the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has said?

That is what he wants.  He has not delayed anything; he just gave a realistic assessment of where things are and are likely to be, given the planning issues and so on.  Be under no illusion, it is a priority and the national development plan will deal with that issue as well.  One has to be honest and realistic, and the realistic and honest comments of the Minister were translated into a suggestion he is delaying the project.

Disgracefully, it took Ireland more than ten years to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and we are still awaiting the ratification of the optional protocol, which crucially enables people to enforce their rights acknowledged in the convention.  The programme for Government commits to ratifying the optional protocol after the first reporting cycle, but it is now very likely this schedule will delay the ratification by several years.  People with disabilities cannot wait that long to be able to guarantee their rights.  Human rights and legal experts have told the Joint Committee on Disability Matters we can ratify the optional protocol immediately if the political will is there.</p> <p>There is no reason for any further delay.

These workers risked their lives and their health and suffered fatigue, stress and all types of mental health pressures to help to pull this society through the worst of the crisis.  Workers in the public and private sectors alike deserve proper compensation.  Does the Taoiseach accept that our society includes so-called high net worth individuals and some corporations that benefitted financially from the Covid-19 pandemic in a massively disproportionate way?

If the vaccine task force under Professor Brian MacCraith has taught us anything, it is that if one assembles the right people with the right skills and the right resources, one can achieve world-class outcomes.

It was multidisciplinary and involved different aspects of the public sector and some of the private sector.  Our vaccination record of 93.5% of adults is an extraordinary achievement for the country and reflects very well on all concerned.  The waiting list initiative is now key.  As we emerge from Covid-19 we simply must reduce the times that people are waiting to get procedures.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, will develop proposals for the establishment of a task force.

The winter plan promises 23.62 million home support hours, but the HSE is currently only delivering 11.4 million.  This is chronic.  To refer to the last question, the hospitals will be full while people cannot get home support.  As it faces into the winter plan, at what point is the HSE going to be upfront and deliver this?  There are 2,156 people across the country waiting for new or additional home help hours, and 894 are in County Tipperary.  Families and carers are getting sick and if that is not dealt with, the hospitals crisis will be much worse.  Hospitals are already overcrowded, so what is the point of producing figures if the HSE is not going to deliver?  It is very frustrating for people trying to ring and beg and scrounge to get home help hours.  Then they are getting sick when they do not have any supports.</p></speech>

The issue will be getting personnel to work in the sector.</p></speech>

The following year the jury at his inquest stated that it was far from satisfied as to the circumstances under which Patrick Nugent sustained the injuries which caused his death and called on the Minister for Justice to investigate the matter further.  It took until 2017 for an inquiry to be established by Judge Clyne.  He reported to the Department of Justice on 31 October last year.  Since then I have asked the Department numerous times what is happening and have been told that it is being reviewed by the Attorney General.  While the Department is hiding behind the Attorney General, the only person answerable to this House for the Attorney General is the Taoiseach.  He is reputed to be a very hard-working Attorney General.  What is the delay?  This family has waited long enough for a report into what happened to their son and brother in 1984.</p></speech>

A key element has been the introduction of the new personal injury guidelines which came into effect before the summer.  The Minister for Justice will produce a report on their implementation at the end of this year.  I am chairing the office that is promoting competition in the insurance area.  I have met IDA Ireland to encourage new businesses to come into Ireland.  Most of the actions in the action plan are already in place.  On two occasions I have met the chief executives of all the insurance companies to ensure that they pass on these reductions.

This work makes Ballyhaunis an attractive town to live and work in and these organisations and individuals are to the forefront of inclusiveness in rural development.  For months, the threatened closure of the Bank of Ireland branch in Ballyhaunis has cast a shadow over this town and surrounding area.  For a financial institution to be allowed to turn its back and withdraw these vital services runs contrary to the programme for Government aim of revitalising small towns.  If he has not done so, can the Taoiseach and his Minister for Finance meet the banking executives and ask them to reconsider their decision to close this branch and to engage with the chamber of commerce and community council in the town in this regard?</p></speech>

When we have met the banks, we have repeatedly stressed the need for them to retain and maintain their regional and rural footprints as well as the importance of that to the commercial viability of towns.

What should have been a routine task has been anything but that.  Patricia and her wife went to court to be recognised as their daughter's legal parents.  They waited for parental recognition of same-sex couples by the Oireachtas and they waited for section 21 to be signed into law.  To be then told that she cannot apply for a passport because she is not the birth parent adds insult to injury with a trowel.  This is not good enough.

The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, in particular, has identified the requirements for childcare into the future in terms of the funding that will be required over the lifetime of the plan and in terms of the Estimates on a multi-annual basis.  That is the context in which childcare policy will evolve.  One of the challenges facing childcare policy has been how it has evolved historically, unlike other educational provision.  From age zero to six, we have a multiplicity of different groups and providers from State actors to the private and community sectors.  It is not easy to get a single solution to it if we are honest about it.  That is the problem with the challenge we face.</p></speech>

The same is happening in Northern Ireland.

This had a huge impact on pig prices in the South.</p> <p>There is a major shortage of labour at the moment in all sectors, whether it is in hospitality, tourism or agrifood.

There is without question an issue with work permits, visas and ensuring we have an adequate labour supply in the market right now.  One dimension of it was discussed earlier in terms of upskilling and providing a range of skills, which is being done to an unprecedented degree.  The other aspect we have to urgently review, and this is now under way in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, under the Minster of State, Deputy Damien English, is the work permit system, to facilitate a faster and more flexible approach to get people into sectors where there are considerable shortages right now.</p></speech>

In October 2018, a prisoner came to the governor of that prison and said that other officers were constantly coming to his cell and, in his words, wanting him to cut up Tom HcHugh.  This is just one of example of what an ACO in our prisons has experienced.  He was vindicated by the Naughton report.  There was a Garda investigation and a "Prime Time" investigation into this matter.  I have raised this with the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste, the current and previous Ministers for Justice and the Minister of State in that Department, yet, 18 months later, this public servant has still not been able to go back to work because the same conditions pertain in that prison.</p>  <p>  We have a situation this week where four officers are being investigated for going on the beer while they were bringing a gangland criminal from prison to court.  I spoke to a senior person in the Irish Prison Service, IPS, today who said the crisis is so severe in the service that someone will be found dead soon.

It is a non-fee paying, publicly funded school run by the Christian Brothers, who have decided to sell off the school playing fields to a private property developer.  Since the previous Government would not listen, I ask the current Government to intervene to stop the sale of school pitches that have had heavy amounts of public investment, where there is an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, unit that depends on those playing areas and where there is a  local sports clubs with a chronic shortage of playing pitch space throughout the area.  These will all lose out to essentially benefit a private property developer.

Unilateralism is the opposite type of impulse than that represented by the Good Friday Agreement.  My sense, until recently, was that the British Government was anxious to work with the EU to get a resolution.  European Commission Vice President, Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efčovič, went to Northern Ireland and met all the parties and had good engagement with them.  That was acknowledged by those parties.  I had quite a lengthy meeting with him the previous evening.  There is a route to getting this issue resolved.

By &quot;application&quot;, I mean the date on which an application form plus all relevant documentation is received by the local authority, which would include an occupation therapist's report recommending the works and the estimates of cost from certified contractors, in conjunction with required medical documentation.  If it is necessary, which will depend on the nature of the proposed work, an architect's or engineer's report should also be submitted.  All information should be gathered by the applicant and submitted together so that it can be checked and approved within the shortest time and I propose that should be a period of four weeks.</p><p>The reason I am bringing this Bill forward is that I have been made aware that many disabled people and older people require adaptations to their homes as a result of an accident or illness.  They are often unable to live in their own homes until the required works are carried out.  That regularly requires an extended stay in hospital or having to relocate to a nursing home for a period, which can be costly for the person concerned and their families, but also costly for the State as the additional stay in hospital adds an extra cost to the State and takes up hospital beds for which other people are waiting.  Some 200,000 bed days were lost in 2019 due to delayed discharge.  While all of those lost days may not have been due to unsuitable accommodation, some certainly were.  I know many people who have made an application for this grant and have been forced to wait months for approval.  I am aware of one woman who is unable to use the bath in her house as a result of knee problems and is required to wash herself at a sink.  Another lady is petrified of getting into the bath because she has an issue with balance and eyesight.  She has fallen and hit her head getting out of the bath in the past and, therefore, requires a level-access shower, which would be life-changing.  She has been waiting months for approval.</p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic has substantially increased waiting times.  That is unacceptable because it is having an unfair and disproportionate impact on older people and disabled people, and needs to be addressed urgently.  Many people are struggling on a day-to-day basis and something like a stairlift or level-access shower could make a big difference.  As an aside to the Bill, I am aware that the lack of contractors and the additional cost of construction material is having an additional and adverse impact on this grant.  I hope budget 2022 will address this and the grant will be increased to meet these additional costs.</p></speech>

We had a recent discussion about response times from county councils to various representations from elected members.  Indeed, there is currently a ten- to 12-week waiting period to get on the housing list in Kildare.  Let me be clear: I do not blame the staff or the officials.  They are being let down by the Government too.  Yesterday, at the monthly meeting of Kildare County Council, a number of councillors received unfavourable reports from officials in response to their motions.  It was not that the officials disagreed with the motions themselves.  Their answers were due to a lack of resources and, in particular, staff.  We need to invest in local government if we are to have true local democracy.  We have a form of local administration at the moment and not local government.</p>  <p>  As the Sinn F&eacute;in spokesperson for older people, I have been contacted by many people from all over the country who have experienced delays of many months in receiving a reply to their applications.  I recently helped to bring to a successful conclusion to two applications that were ongoing for more than two years.  These kinds of delays are unacceptable.  At yesterday's council meeting in Kildare, a motion was tabled by Councillor Nuala Killeen, which sought an increased budget for housing adaptation grants.  The report from the directors of housing and finance stated that the additional costs associated with the councillor's request would take &euro;200,000 from other areas of expenditure.  It went on to state that without additional funding from central government, it is not expected that Kildare County Council can achieve this without cutting front-line services.  The reality is that people are waiting far too long, with priority 2 and 3 applicants not even receiving a reply, in some cases after months of waiting.  They deserve a better quality of life and this Bill is the first step to achieving it.</p></speech>

I am delighted to be introducing, alongside my colleague, Deputy Clarke, our Bill.  This is the fruit of a year&rsquo;s work and as today is International Access to Information Day, I feel it is the perfect day to introduce this amending Bill.</p><p>Since being elected I, alongside my colleague, Deputy Clarke, have been making the case that our freedom of information, FOI, regime is in crisis.  This is something that transparency campaigners and investigative journalists have been highlighting for some time.  At times it felt as though we were ploughing a lonely furrow and calls for reform were falling on deaf ears.  However, recent events brought into sharp focus the crisis we had been describing.  To be clear, we knew prior to these events that urgent action was needed.  This was as a result of a year's work conducted by Deputy Clarke and I and as a result of a survey we conducted.  The Bill seeks to strengthen the Act and I hope we will receive Government support.</p><p>The Bill would enhance the powers of the Office of the Information Commissioner to allow it to refer complaints under FOI legislation to the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, for investigation where it is believed that the relevant person has failed in their obligations under the FOI Act.  It would ensure all public bodies established under the Companies Act are immediately brought under the remit of FOI legislation upon establishment.  This would prevent bodies, including, for example, the Land Development Agency, being exempt from FOI for the first six months of their existence.  That is an important amendment.  It would also empower the Minster to conduct an annual review of all bodies to which FOI legislation applies, including any bodies to which a partial exclusion currently applies and whether this is consistent with the Act's principles of oversight, transparency and accountability.  This is to ensure that we are adhering to best practice and transparency at all times.  It would also bring back information on pension payments related to former taoisigh, Ministers, Presidents and office holders within the remit of the FOI legislation.  I am delighted to move this Bill, alongside my colleague, Deputy Clarke.</p></speech>

The Bill seeks to strengthen the FOI regime, which has been eroded in recent years, and to ensure that what we have, going forward, is fit for purpose.  It is most timely, given recent events, and because it is International Access to Information Day.  However, long before those events, freedom of information was under attack and legitimate concerns were being raised by those who should not have been encountering barriers to access information, including journalists, researchers and victims of institutional abuse.  Instead of building on the 1997 introduction of FOI and ensuring a complete and robust mechanism to access information, what has emerged is a flawed system that feeds directly into a lack of transparency and accountability.  That needs to be addressed urgently.  Instead of shortcomings being exploited in a manner that is simply wrong and leading to a perception of a culture of loophole-seeking to block the provision of information, the fundamental principle that the public has a right to know must be put back at the centre of freedom of information because the public has a right to know.</p> <p>The public has a right to know when their tax payments are being used for pension entitlements for former taoisigh, Ministers and the President under current expenditure.  There is not, nor can there ever be, justification for any period of exemption under FOI legislation when a private company becomes a public body, as happened, for example, with the Land Development Agency.  The powers of the Information Commissioner need to be enhanced to ensure that a body is able to refer complaints under FOI to the Standards in Public Office Commission where a Minister or relevant person has intentionally or recklessly failed in his or her obligations.  As a democracy, we need an FOI regime that is consistent with the principles of oversight, transparency and accountability.  It is also vital that, where policies are introduced or put in place, a method to monitor compliance is also put in place.  Where non-compliance is identified, it must be rectified and appropriate steps taken within a reasonable period to ensure non-compliance does not recur.  We spoke about freedom of information in the House quite recently.  The Bill Deputy Farrell and I have laid here today is somewhat compatible with what the Minister said that evening.  I very much look forward to future debates on this issue because it is of vital interest to both Members of this House and the public.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach will agree that this topic comes up every September and then goes away again.  I am concerned that the book publisher, Folens, has now acquired the teacher training institution, Hibernia College.  An educational book entity, which exists for commercial interests, is now effectively the largest provider of teachers for the education system.  In Northern Ireland, schoolbooks are free; in the Republic, they are not.  In fairness, two budgets ago the Taoiseach's Department introduced a scheme to provide 50 schools with free schoolbooks.  This was then extended to 100 schools.  Working with the Opposition, and with the best of goodwill, we could, for &euro;20 million, which is not a large sum in the overall budget to be presented shortly, provide free schoolbooks for every child in the Republic, just as they are provided in Northern Ireland.  Can we take away the conversations about money at the school gates and replace them with conversations about education?  The Taoiseach will appreciate that far too many of the conversations teachers and principals have with parents are about money rather than education.  I ask him to prioritise that issue in the budgetary cycle.</p></speech>

I do not doubt his intention but we differ substantially with regard to our preferred approach, particularly in respect of mitigation.  On Monday, close contact tracing for asymptomatic close contacts in primary schools ended.  A clear explanation for this approach has not yet been given.  I would like the Taoiseach to clearly state why that approach was taken now, as we approach winter.  I will once again ask him to elaborate on the issue of air monitors in our schools.  At the moment, a school with nine to 12 classrooms has seven air monitors while a school with 13 to 16 classrooms has nine.  There are substantial issues regarding air filtration.  In the absence of the antigen testing used in other European countries, will the Taoiseach elaborate on the end of contact tracing and the absence of mitigation actions that would have enhanced this measure?</p></speech>

He agreed with me that this is wrong and that it will deprive the school, the ASD unit, local community sports organisations and others who use these fields but he said that there was nothing he can do.  I would like to point out that this issue was raised multiple times during the term of the previous Government and we had the same hand-wringing.  The point is that there is much bigger precedent involved.  These religious organisations own a vast number of our schools and hospitals.  They are publicly funded, yet the Government says that it is completely powerless when they decide to flog off lands to property developers at the cost of local community and school facilities when there is a chronic shortage of land for schools in our area.  There is a queue of schools looking for permanent sites and there is a chronic shortage of sports facilities in the area.  There has to be something the Taoiseach can do.</p></speech>

A survey conducted by my office has since found that 82% of leaving certificate students who replied expressed the view that the proposed changes are insufficient.  These students lost months of classroom teaching time as a result of the closure of their schools.  The changes I would most like to see are the abolition of the leaving certificate alongside the introduction of a policy of open access to third level.  The examination is unnecessarily stressful, it is out of date and it discriminates against students who are not neurotypical or who come from homes that cannot afford grinds.  At the very least, these students should be given a far greater concession than that made by the Minister.  They will be very interested to hear the Taoiseach's views on the matter.</p></speech>

Earlier, the Taoiseach said third level investment was a key factor in attracting FDI and economic development, and I agree.  Since the report, successive governments have avoided addressing the issue of underfunding at third level.  In real terms, colleges get 50% less per student than in 2008 and, at the same time, fees have increased from &euro;850 to &euro;3,000.  We have spent less on research and development as a percentage of GDP and of public expenditure every year since 2011.  The Cassells report made clear in 2016 what action was needed and presented three options for how this could be funded.</p></speech>

This and successive governments have failed the parents, the children, more particularly, and the staff of Gaelscoil Chol&aacute;iste Mhuire on Parnell Square East.  These have been waiting for a permanent school building since the late 1990s.  I can only describe what they have been through as an ongoing saga.  The children and staff find themselves in completely inadequate accommodation.</p>  <p>  The Department of Education and the State have played a game of blink and bluff with this school community.  It is outrageous.  There is provision for a new school build in Dominick Street.  This has dragged on and on.  The Department of Education tried to convince the school community and others that the fault for such delays lies with a neighbour, which is not the case.  I appeal to the Taoiseach in the name of reason and fairness to intervene in respect of Gaelscoil Chol&aacute;iste Mhuire.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach visited one of the secondary schools there with me two years ago, namely, St. Caimin's Community School.  The other school is Shannon comprehensive.</p>  <p>  As we come out of Covid, there is a need for the post-primary buildings unit to take a comprehensive look at both schools.  St. Caimin's was built with an enrolment capacity of 600.  It is far exceeding that, yet Department officials fail to recognise the growth of the town and the wide hinterland it encompasses.</p>  <p>  Shannon comprehensive is a much older school dating to the 1960s or 1970s, but some of the buildings are crumbling.  I fear some of the concrete work may have pyrite in it.  The buildings unit will urgently have to come to the town and look at the capacity it has and at the deficient buildings.  There needs to be a comprehensive look at how this town, Ireland's newest town in the 1960s but now ageing, can meet its current needs.  It needs an urgent re-examination.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach has a long history of delivering for special education provision as a previous Minister with responsibility for education.  Cork City Council has identified a site in the Glanmire area that is suitable for a school for special education provision.  I urge the Taoiseach, given we have such challenges in Cork, to look upon that site favourably and progress it as expeditiously as possible.</p></speech>

Why is there no decision to have a CO2 monitor in every classroom?  Why is there no decision to have high efficiency particulate air, HEPA, filters in classrooms?  Why has the Government made the decision, which makes no sense to me whatsoever, to say something magical happens in a classroom which means the regular rules of contacts for Covid do not apply?  If a child goes to a birthday party for half an hour with another child who has Covid, they count as a close contact and have to get tested.  However, if they sit in a classroom in the same pod for a week with that same child, they do not count as a close contact.  How does that make any sense?</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in raised the issue of free schoolbooks.  I would need to talk more about this, to be honest.  Targeting of resources is still very important in terms of children who need additional supports in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas.  It is the old argument about universality of provision versus targeted provision to those who need it most and those on the lowest incomes.  Given the multiple needs in our education system, I have no issue with increasing the number of schools but there is value in staying around the thresholds and looking after children on other fronts in terms of the variety of supports required, from therapies right across.  I am open to engagement on it.</p>  <p>  Deputy Gannon raised contact tracing, as did Deputy Paul Murphy.  Public health advice is saying this; Government is not making this up.  The clear explanation relates to the testing that has been done.  There are relatively low levels in terms of schoolchildren, at around 6%.  Public health has advised and the Minister and Department of Education have adhered to public health advice all along in respect of classrooms of children.  We are not risking children's health in any actions we take.</p>  <p>  On air monitors, that arose from a special advisory group that advised the Department of Education on ventilation in schools and the use of air monitors.  They are not static; they are mobile.  It is about having up to 25,000 air monitors provided to the system, which is significant, as part of the broader return to school protocols.</p>  <p>  To Deputy Boyd Barrett, I have given my views already on Clonkeen College.  The Government has a lien on properties and physical buildings in respect of investments made in voluntary secondary schools.</p>  <p>  Deputy Barry raised the issue of the abolition of the leaving certificate.  I do not agree with abolishing it overnight.  I believe in reform of it.  There has been ongoing reform which has dramatically changed it.  The leaving cert we sat 20 years ago bears no comparison with the leaving cert today.</p></speech>

She needs to think that through.  I do not agree with it.  It would create mayhem overnight.  We do not have the capacity to do that, nor is it necessarily the right thing to do.  We need to have a wide provision over time so people can access courses, modules and so on to take the urgency out of the leaving cert and to remove the idea that it is the be-all and end-all.  We need to create a roadmap for young people so there is a route to where they want to go, through a variety of colleges of further and higher education and modular-based education.  That is the approach we need.</p>  <p>  I met with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science recently on the Cassells report.  It has been given active consideration by the Minister and he is engaging with other Ministers on how we roll that out and deal with it.  There are Estimates and budgetary contexts to that.</p>  <p>  On Gaelscoil Chol&aacute;iste Mhuire, I do not believe it is because of the Government or the Department of Education over the past 20-odd years.  Twenty is on my mind today.  It is not all blink and bluff.  There were genuine issues there.  I will ask for the report on that from the Department's building unit and come back to the Deputy on it.</p></speech>

The next Cabinet committee on housing is yet to be scheduled.  The committee works to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of programme for Government commitments regarding housing and related matters.</p>  <p>  The focus of recent meetings has been on the completion of the Housing for All plan, which the Government published on 2 September.  Housing for All builds on much progress and hard work in recent years, despite the setbacks due to Covid-19.  It is the most ambitious housing plan in the history of our State and contains a range of actions and measures to ensure more than 300,000 new homes will be built by 2030.  This figure includes 90,000 social, 36,000 affordable purchase and 18,000 cost rental homes.</p>  <p>  Crucially, the actions outlined in the plan are backed by more than &euro;4 billion in annual guaranteed State investment in housing over the coming years, including through Exchequer funding and Land Development Agency and Housing Finance Agency investment.  The plan includes measures to support availability of the land, workforce, funding and capacity to enable both the public and private sectors to meet the targets.</p>  <p>  Through Housing for All, we will also continue to support our most vulnerable, including those experiencing homelessness and those who have more complex housing needs.  The plan will provide the basis for a long-term sustainable housing system for this and future generations and supports the ambitions of the forthcoming climate action plan through measures on retrofitting and waste reduction.</p>  <p>  There will be a strong focus on implementation of the Housing for All plan.

Last week the Government did not oppose the Labour Party's renters' rights Bill, proposed by Senator Moynihan and Deputy Bacik, but there does not seem to be any enthusiasm to change quickly the Government's policy or the law.  We know from statistics that the main reasons for terminating a tenancy are the sale of the property, which accounts for 51% of reasons given, or the use of the home for a relative, which accounts for 24%.  Our Bill would restrict evictions for these reasons and ensure families are protected.  Will the Taoiseach work with the Opposition to bring forward to fruition and to enact the Labour Party's Bill?  Will he commit to a three-year rent freeze?</p></speech>

In Housing for All the Government commits to giving about &euro;1 billion in subsidies to developers.

Fed up with and sick of the lack of tenants' rights and completely extortionate rents, the people of Berlin, driven by a campaign from below, have made exactly the right call, which is to expropriate the big corporate landlords and the big investment funds and to take into public ownership the big portfolios of residential apartment and housing property to deliver controlled rents.  That is a measure we should take here.  We were alone in saying that pinning rent increases to the consumer price index, CPI, for example, would not be good enough and that we need actual rent controls.

The question is what the Government will do for those living with the consequences of that regime, a regime which effectively allowed the profits of the developers to be expedited and allowed the developers to bypass the regular planning process and the communities that have to live with the consequences of that.  I will give the Taoiseach the example of Citywest, which has seen huge-scale development of largely build-to-rent apartments in a very short space of time with no investment in necessary community infrastructure - no library, no community centre, no investment in parks.  What will be done to ensure those people in Citywest and in similar communities throughout the country have the community facilities that are needed to live quality lives, given the scale of development that has taken place in the context of SHDs being used?</p></speech>

That is more than a year's salary for very many of them.  The average price of a house in Cork city is now &euro;307,000 - in other words, more than 12 times the annual salary of those young workers.  Throughout the State, 42,600 mortgage approvals were granted in the year to June, yet only 31,300 drawdowns were made in the same period.  These statistics seem to suggest that more than a quarter of those approved for mortgages were priced out of the housing market.  Does the Taoiseach accept the housing market is treating young people in a viciously unfair fashion?  Does he accept his Government will lose a hell of a lot of support among young people if these issues are not resolved very quickly?</p></speech>

Every county or administrative area in the country has them.  In the context of the Cabinet subcommittee on housing, will the Taoiseach consider establishing some kind of affordable housing list structure in order that the younger end of the population in particular can get a visual over time as to what sites will produce affordable housing, where they will be available, in what number and by what date, giving a tangible picture of the affordable housing roll-out that is coming downstream?</p></speech>

The Taoiseach may have welcomed its plan; however, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage did not.  In fact, officials were and are deeply critical of Hammerson's planning application in their observations submitted to the council.  In addition to their criticism of the extent of the demolition of the two terraces, they have described the demolition of No. 38 Henry Street as unnecessary and pushed for the retention of the historically important post-1916 buildings on Moore Street and Henry Street.  Critically, the Department recommends that the council should consider whether an alternative design for the redevelopment of this site would allow for the retention and sensitive adaptation for use of these existing structures.

They need to be considered in any reform.  Under the current Rebuilding Ireland home loan there are technical exemptions from the first-time buyer clause for people have gone through a separation.  However, this information is not being shared properly with people making applications.  People are being refused despite actually qualifying in some local authority areas.</p> <p>A separated person who has enough for a deposit from the sale of the family home but is refused a mortgage from financial institutions is then being refused assistance by the local authority and has nowhere to go.  People in that situation, who often have children, are being driven into the private rental sector, where they are at the mercy of landlords and real estate investment funds.  Families are often left in this very difficult situation with nowhere to go.  Will the Taoiseach discuss this with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage with a view to including people who have suffered family breakdown in the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme?</p></speech>

Key to housing is infrastructure and, unfortunately, there has been significant doubt around the metro project in recent weeks.  Last week, I asked the T&aacute;naiste whether the Government had made a decision strategically to delay the project.  I ask the Taoiseach to state again that the Government has not made, and will not make, a decision strategically to delay the project and that, if project delays have arisen with the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, they will be identified and minimised where possible.</p></speech>

I will first deal with rents generally, which covers a number of the questions.  On the issue of a rent freeze, the Government has been advised in the strongest possible manner that it is unconstitutional to introduce a three-year freeze.  I remember years ago, before an election, Opposition Members put forward a proposal for a commercial freeze.  Subsequently, when people got into government, they could not do it because they were told it was unconstitutional.  That was a previous government.  It is easy to say things in opposition but, in this case, we are being told it is not possible.</p>  <p>  The Minister is very committed to controlling rent price increases.  There was the outgoing situation in July, at which time rent pressure zones, RPZs, were extended until the end of 2024 to prohibit any rent increase in an RPZ from exceeding general inflation, as recorded by the harmonised index of consumer prices, HICP.  That measure significantly reduces the level of permissible rent increases for the estimated 74% of all tenancies that are in RPZs.  In addition, until 2025, rent reviews outside RPZs may occur no more frequently than biannually and it remains the position that increases in RPZs can occur no more frequently than annually.</p>  <p>  Housing for All commits to strengthening security of tenure, which was raised by Deputies, subject to legal advice, by legislating for tenancies of indefinite duration.  Work in this area is under way.  There has been increased funding for the housing assistance payment, HAP, to support new tenancies.  An additional &euro;2 million has been provided on top of what was there for the operational costs of the Residential Tenancies Board, bringing its funding to &euro;11 million.  A total of &euro;10 million was allocated for the rental inspections programme for 2021 to assist local authorities to achieve inspection targets in respect of private rented accommodation.  Since 16 July, the previous cap of 4% on annual rent increases was replaced, and rents on RPZs can only go up if necessary and in line with general inflation.  As part of rent reform legislation due to be brought before the Oireachtas this session, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, will seek to ensure effective rent controls are legally enforced in RPZs by introducing a cap.</p>  <p>  As I said, rents in RPZs will only go up, if necessary, in line with the general inflation as recorded in the harmonised index of consumer prices to a maximum cap that is yet to be determined.  In essence, we want to do everything we possibly can to keep rents down to the lowest level possible.  When the Minister brought in the harmonised index element, it was done in good faith.  Obviously, international commodity prices have gone through the roof since then and there is a general global inflation drive that now means the provision has to be reviewed to see whether we can get a realistic cap to keep the levels of rent increases down.  Prices are very high - too high for people - in cities.  Ultimately, it is a matter of supply.  We have to get building supply up.  We must build more houses, including affordable houses, houses for rent and social housing, to take pressure off the HAP system and the private sector system and give people proper security of tenure in social housing.  Progress has been made this year, notwithstanding the lockdown.  The sector is coming back strongly in terms of commencements and so forth, but we will wait and see until the end of the year to get the figures in respect of that.</p>  <p>  Deputy Lahart made a very good suggestion in respect of the need for a transparent, tangible picture of the affordability landscape for people who wish to buy a house, so that they have some sense of what is happening over time.  That is a very fair point.</p>  <p>  In terms of strategic development zones, which Deputy Murphy raised, the Minister is moving on the issue of their expiration and making sure the right amenities are put in place in largely built-up areas.  That is ongoing work and significant capital funding has been allocated to local authorities to facilitate the provision of such amenities in large housing conurbations.  The money is there.</p>  <p>  In terms of the Hammerson development on O'Connell Street, the problem in that regard has been going on for decades.  At the moment, it is terrible in terms of the dereliction that is there.  The Government moved to secure the national monument by buying it.  There is always a balance to be struck in these situations.  I have no interest in going back ten or 20 years.  We need to transform O'Connell Street and make it a modern, thriving street in a modern city like Dublin and give opportunities for people while also bringing to the fore as part of that, which has never really happened, the incredible heritage the 1916 site represents.  There are opportunities now but we cannot keep putting it on the long finger.  I regret to say this to Deputy McDonald but I get the sense there is a huge element of politics in this.  I get the terrible sense that here is another campaign to undermine what is being done.  Many people were involved in this-----</p></speech>

Since then, there have been 13 meetings of the Cabinet committee on Covid-19.</p>  <p>  In addition to the meetings of the full Cabinet and of Cabinet committees, I meet with Ministers individually to focus on different issues.  I meet regularly with the Minister for Health and his Secretary General to discuss priorities in the area of health, including Sl&aacute;intecare and, in particular, our management of and response to Covid-19.</p></reply>

The programme for Government includes a commitment to a citizens' assembly on the issue of drugs.  As he knows, many people are working on a campaign for the decriminalisation of the drug user.  I do not want the word "decriminalisation" in this context to be confused with the idea of decriminalisation or legalisation of drugs.  We are talking about the decriminalisation of drug users.  The objective is that people who use drugs or have an addiction should not be pushed through the criminal justice system and should be helped, supported and empowered purely through the health system.  When is the promised citizens' assembly on drugs, which falls under the Taoiseach's Department, going to happen?</p></speech>

The school has 37 children with profound or severe intellectual disabilities.</p> <p>In May, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, informed the HSE that services at Carmona were to remain at pre-Covid levels, provided by clinicians of the same grade and skill set specialisations, and, specifically, that the clinicians were to be based on site.  That was confirmed in June during a meeting with parents at the school.  It had been accepted by the Minister and the Taoiseach that the HSE's reconfiguration of children's disability services into children's disability network teams under the progressing disability services programme had to include the retention of on-site clinicians where needed but, despite these commitments and the specific instructions of the Minister of State to the HSE regarding Carmona, the HSE has now withdrawn all on-site therapists from the school.  This decision has profound implications for the children in question.  None of the children have been seen by a physiotherapist since June.  The occupational therapist is no longer based on site and there is no speech and language therapist.  The clinicians who attend are based out of the HSE office in Leopardstown.</p></speech>

Nobody has a monopoly on desperation or the need for information.</p>  <p>  Does the Taoiseach have any news for the House regarding extra hospital beds coming into the system, assessments of needs of teenagers and young children in particular under the Disability Act, or home help waiting lists, which are, obviously, very much always on our radar on this side of the House?

The State has an ugly history on this issue but we thought that chapter had ended.  Twelve years ago, the Willis report recommended and the State accepted that the incineration of babies' organs and tissue should cease but here we are again.  We have learned that senior management apparently disagreed with senior medical staff and argued that this was not a serious matter.  The backdrop to this decision was the spectre of the pandemic but that does not excuse the inexcusable.  The pandemic loomed over every Irish hospital.  The Taoiseach indicated earlier that all hospitals have been written to in order to ascertain whether something similar happened on those sites.  When are replies to those queries expected?  I hope the investigation is thorough and concludes reasonably quickly.</p></speech>

This Friday, several hundred patients will lose their GP in the Monkstown Farm area of D&uacute;n Laoghaire because there is a rule, of which I was previously unaware, that GPs are compulsorily retired when they reach the age of 72, even if that retirement is against their will, as it is in this case.  They wish to continue serving their patients but are no longer allowed to do so.  Many of these patients who have mobility problems, chronic illnesses and so on will now have to travel long distances and most of them have not even been told what new GP service will be available.  The doctor in question can continue in private practice but can no longer provide for his General Medical Service, GMS, medical card patients.  I have appealed to the Department of Health to provide an extension for this doctor, which is what he wants.  His patients want him to have an extension.  The Department is just saying "No" because the rule is that GPs have to retire at 72 even though there is no rationale for it.</p></speech>

Where are we today?  We have a further embedded and deeply unequal two-tier system, the weaknesses of which were badly exposed by the pandemic.  There are almost 1 million people on hospital waiting lists.  Hospital staff are overworked and underpaid and significant amounts of public money are ending up in the private healthcare system through, for example, the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  There were the resignations of Laura Magahy and Tom Keane from the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation advisory council and that of Professor Geraldine McCarthy, chair of the board of the South/Southwest Hospital Group.  In her resignation letter, she wrote:</p> <blockquote> 	I have waited for a long time for developments led by successive ministers for health and government.  However, recent information and my own experiences tell me we are no nearer to the required reform than we were six years ago.  </blockquote>  <p>Is the Government actually committed to what is in Sl&aacute;intecare or is it just politically expedient to say it agrees with it?</p></speech>

The course has many positive attributes but one of the negatives is that the students need to go to Liverpool to complete part of their training.  In many cases, that leads to brain drain, with people qualifying from the University of Limerick and remaining in Britain to work out their professional lives.  Covid has taught us that we need to increase our capacity in all forms of front-line healthcare.  I ask the Taoiseach to consider the brand new Civil Defence facility in Ennis which has fabulous lecture halls and the capacity to deliver this form of training in Ireland.  I ask him to push for a partnership between the University of Limerick and Ennis.  Limerick Institute of Technology will gain technological university status on Friday.  Ennis could have a very positive link with the University of Limerick and solve the brain drain problem of paramedics leaving the country.</p></speech>

It must be regulatory or relate to a particular aspect of the education programme.  We are open to any submissions from the University of Limerick in respect of having that completed here or a liaison with the technological university.  That is something we are open to having pursued.</p><p>Deputy Paul Murphy raised the issue of health needs and Sl&aacute;intecare.  I will simply say that a lot of progress has been made.  Deputy Lahart raised the issue of extra hospital beds, for example.  In the context of the generality of debate that has ensued, there are approximately 800 additional hospital beds this year.  That is the largest number of new hospital beds opened in a single year for many decades.  That is the level of State investment in the State system that is now occurring.</p><p>On the issue of home helps, approximately 5 million additional hours were provided for in the budget.  The waiting list last year was approximately 7,250 people.  Now there are approximately 1,307 people waiting for home helps.  The next stage has to be to try to get more people into that workforce.  We have to look at work permits and facilitating people coming into the country to work in our health sector, as well as training up and skilling up people in the home care health sector, which is growing and will continue to grow.  We do not want waiting lists in that area because it is very connected to the acute hospital system.  The Minister will be establishing a task force shortly and announcing a waiting list initiative which will again concentrate on a further level of expansion of acute hospital beds, including intensive care beds, but also the whole area of elective care facilities and ambulatory care facilities.  The Minister is close to bringing proposals to the Government in respect of ambulatory care in Cork, Galway and Dublin and additional electives that will be required as part of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme.  That is more medium term in terms of obviously giving us the capacity to do the electives.  That relates to the waiting lists.</p><p>I met with Tom Keane and Laura Magahy yesterday.  Deputy Murphy raised that issue.  Their issues relate more to structural factors.  In fact, they would acknowledge that a significant amount of progress has been made on many fronts in terms of activity levels, but there is a fundamental structural issue from their perspective in terms of the role of the office within the Department of Health <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the HSE.  That is something the Government and I will reflect on in terms of the structural approach to implementing Sl&aacute;intecare but the Government remains very committed to the implementation of the principles of Sl&aacute;intecare right across the board and in all aspects.</p><p>Deputy Barry raised the issue of the Willis report.</p> <p>I dealt with that earlier in terms of organ retention.  With regard to reviews on the way within the hospital that are required, the practice was not in accordance with the guidelines, rules and regulations laid out by the HSE itself in respect of the retention of organs, and particularly in respect of post mortems and the need to have the full consent of the parents in terms of what happens after the post mortem and the return of the organs to the parents for burial or cremation.  That did not happen on this occasion.  As I said earlier, the Minister is seeking assurances that this was not a practice across other hospital sites during the pandemic.  He has not received a response yet, but is hoping to receive one.</p> <p> Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the issue of the Monkstown situation.  I will talk to the Minister for Health in relation to that.  It could be a medical council issue or a regulatory issue.  That would be my own observation.</p></speech>

This Government and I are keenly aware of the housing challenges facing people right across this island.  We know that the impact of the housing crisis is felt in every family right across our country.  It ranges from hard-pressed tenants stuck in a rent trap and wondering if they will ever own their own home to those at the sharpest edge of the crisis, who will spend tonight sleeping in emergency accommodation, or worse, sleeping rough on one of our city streets.  To tackle the roots of the crisis, our central goal in Housing for All, as set out in the programme for Government, is:</p> <blockquote> 	Everyone in the State should have access to a home to purchase or rent at an affordable price, built to a high standard and in the right place, offering a high quality of life. </blockquote>  <p>This plan will work.  It will give the squeezed middle starting out in life a real chance to buy their own home.  It will give a helping hand to those struggling to make ends meet.  It will work towards ending homelessness by 2030.  It will help to ensure vibrant cities and breathe fresh life into our towns, villages and rural communities.  Most importantly, it will get our country back building homes.  Every player, whether it is a State body or in the private sector, has a part to play in solving the housing problem.  Any long-term solution needs the entire system pulling in the same direction to a common goal: more, better houses and apartments at affordable prices to buy or rent.  It is only by taking measures across all aspects of our housing system that we can begin to improve the situation for our citizens right across the board.</p><p>There is no panacea to the housing question, as anyone with a genuine interest in housing knows.  We are witnessing the scale of the housing crisis compounded by the pandemic across the world, and not just here in Ireland.  House prices are surging globally in the biggest international property boom in two decades as the Covid-19 squeeze has hit supply and people look for new homes.  House price growth across the OECD is running at 9.4%, similar to Ireland.  I believe we need a coherent, stable and sensible approach to drive on supply and tackle the root of the problem.  Housing for All sets out that approach and takes a genuine whole-of-government approach to get to grips with this crisis and to improve the lives of all our people.  We recognise the impact of the crisis and the scale of the challenge, and we are committed to solving it.  Housing is the number one priority for this Government.</p><p>Is &iacute; tith&iacute;ocht an phr&iacute;omh-eisi&uacute;int in &Eacute;irinn inniu.  Tuigeann an Rialtas &eacute; sin.  N&iacute; m&oacute;r d&uacute;inn feabhs&uacute;, ar mhaithe len&aacute;r ndaoine, agus t&aacute;imid in ann &eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh.

Oibreoidh an plean seo.</p><p>Delivery is the key to the plan and it is important, from the outset of these statements, to set out how we aim to achieve it.  It will be overseen and directed at the highest level through the Cabinet committee on housing, chaired by the Taoiseach, and through the Secretary General delivery group.  There will also be dedicated workstreams, led by the relevant Secretaries General, on investment, industry capability and public service delivery.  These workstreams are tasked with drilling down into the priority actions to identify any blockages, take appropriate action and ensure a rigorous monitoring system is put in place to ensure the delivery we need.</p><p>Quarterly progress reports will be submitted to the Cabinet committee and to the Government setting out performance against the targets and actions set out in the plan, prepared by a dedicated unit in the Department of the Taoiseach, assisted by the programme management office within my own Department.  To keep us on track, the actions in Housing for All will be updated on an annual basis, including timelines, to sustain momentum on delivery during the lifetime of the plan.</p><p>Housing for All is the most ambitious housing plan in the history of our State.  It sets out, over four pathways, a series of bold actions that rise to the challenge we face.  Through pathway 1, it will support home ownership and increase affordability.  Pathway 2 will deal with eradicating homelessness, increasing social housing delivery and supporting social inclusion.  Pathway 3 is about increasing new housing supply across the board, and importantly, pathway 4 will address vacancy and efficient use of existing stock.  </p> <p>Crucially, however, this plan is backed by historic levels of investment, with in excess of &euro;20 billion available through the Exchequer, the Land Development Agency, LDA, and the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, over the next five years alone.  This amounts to over &euro;4 billion in capital per annum.  It is the first time we have had a multi-annual plan such as this fully funded.  This will provide the sector with the stability and certainty it needs.</p> <p> Over 300,000 new homes will be built by the end of 2030, including a projected 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes and 18,000 cost rental homes.  It is the largest State-led building programme in our history, eclipsing even the programmes of de Valera in the 1930s.  Of course, the simplicity of that statement belies the complexity of executing the plan.  I do not underestimate the challenge ahead but I do believe Housing for All will transform our housing system by removing the constraints that lead to delays and blockages in the provision of quality, affordable housing to buy or rent.</p> <p> Housing for All puts forward a new vision that places homeownership back in the hands of ordinary working people.  The first home scheme will see people buy their home with the help of the Government by bridging the gap between the finance they have and the cost of the home they want.  The local authority-led affordable purchase scheme will see homes at an average of &euro;250,000 right across the country.  A reformed local authority home loan will see more single people eligible for State-backed mortgages, with much-improved terms.  I have already implemented a reduction of the mortgage interest rate by 0.25% for new borrowers under the existing Rebuilding Ireland home loan, RIHL.  This lower rate will also apply to loans issued under the reformed local authority home loan.</p> <p> The affordability measures provided for in this plan will set us on a path to reversing the current trend, which has seen homeownership rates fall to historic lows.  I believe in homeownership.  Housing for All supports it.  It is an honest and just aspiration that should be and is supported by the State.  It is supported in this plan.</p> <p> I recognise that it is cheaper to buy a home than to rent one in several Irish cities.  That is how broken our system is right now.  Affordability is increasingly challenging for renters who aspire to purchase and who must save a significant deposit while simultaneously paying relatively high rents.</p> <p> Housing for All lays the foundation for an entirely new housing tenure in Ireland, cost rental, which will be a game changer for rent affordability.  Some 10,000 new cost rental homes will be delivered in the period to 2026, with at least 18,000 in total over the course of the plan.  The LDA will have a key role in delivery, with targets of rents being at least 25% below market level.  The delivery of cost rental at scale will have a stabilising effect on the wider rental market.  We have started this already.  Our first cost rental tenants are in their homes now.</p> <p> Leasing is being phased out, and we are empowering local authorities to get back building again.  With their approved housing body, AHB, partners, they will deliver an average of 10,000 social homes each year.  Local authorities are being funded to acquire land so that they can deliver social and affordable homes at scale.  I have already made changes to the reimbursement process for our local authorities.  Meath County Council was the first to avail of the new procedural change.</p> <p> I have assured local authority chief executives and directors of services at the recent housing summits that I hosted that the resources and supports they need, both human and financial, will be provided, particularly to bolster their housing and planning teams to deliver on this ambitious programme.</p> <p> To ensure a sufficient supply of homes across the country, each local authority has been given housing supply targets.  These, together with updated planning guidance, will ensure sufficient land is zoned for housing.  The Government will support this by providing additional State lands to the LDA, capable of delivering a further 15,000 homes under Housing for All.  In addition, Housing for All tasks the LDA, through Project Tosaigh, with intervening in slow or stalled developments on non-State lands, through an open and transparent process designed to ascertain the potential for it to enter into strategic partnerships with landowners to unlock and accelerate the delivery of affordable homes.</p> <p>  In tandem with these measures to incentivise the bringing forward of supply, there is a need to balance this with penalties for non-activation of sites.  In this regard, the Minister for Finance will bring forward a new tax to activate vacant land for residential purposes.  This will replace the current vacant site levy.  I am cognisant that the planning system must be reformed to ensure certainty and stability for those providing housing in Ireland.</p> <p> Under Housing for All, the strategic housing development process will be replaced &ndash; I am winding it up early &ndash; with new planning arrangements for large-scale residential developments.  Planning arrangements will go back to the local authorities.  Such reforms will make decision-making on these developments more efficient.</p> <p> The plan also includes modern Kenny report-style powers to ensure the State gets a fairer share of the increase in the value of land resulting from rezoning decisions, and that the community benefits as a result.  This will reduce the speculative value of land, which is badly needed.  The judicial review process will also be reformed, and planning legislation will be reviewed to ensure the planning system is plan led, has greater public acceptance and reflects the needs of existing and new populations.</p> <p> In the shorter term, I want to see non-activated planning permissions activated where possible.  The estimated "uncommenced" figure in Dublin is around 40,000, representing about four years' housing supply in the capital.  That is untenable.  I am establishing the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe cities fund to tackle the affordability and viability barriers to stimulate such activation for apartment developments of four floors or more, above certain densities.  These apartments will be for sale to owner-occupiers in our cities at lower price points.</p> <p> Rural communities will be given greater certainty over building homes in their areas.  The measures are targeted, radical and necessary to respond to the challenges we have.</p> <p> At a time of high housing need, when people are homeless and living in unsuitable accommodation, it is vital that existing vacant homes be brought back into productive use.  Housing for All sets out several key actions in this regard, including the establishment of the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe towns fund for servicing sites to attract people to build their own homes in towns and villages and also to refurbish vacant properties in regional towns and villages.  The Government is firmly committed to a town-centre-first approach, which will build upon the ambition set out in Our Rural Future, to support the regeneration, repopulation and development of rural towns and villages across the country.  While programmes such as the urban regeneration development fund, URDF, and the rural regeneration development fund, RRDF, are primarily intended to support wider town regeneration, they also facilitate the optimal use and reuse of existing properties.</p> <p> Only yesterday I was in Navan visiting the Flower Hill quarter, which has received funding just short of &euro;8 million to regenerate it.  The funding is part of the &euro;1.3 billion the Government is investing in regional towns and cities, in addition to inner-city Dublin, to generate growth and to bring about redevelopment and regeneration.  In this regard, Housing for All commits that further calls for the urban and rural regeneration and development funds will include specific criteria to encourage activation, particularly in respect of vacant properties, and bring stock back into use.  This funding will be integrated with proposals on retrofitting and existing supports, such as the Better Energy Homes grant, to ensure the architectural heritage of towns is preserved.</p> <p> I will also review and extend regulations that exempt certain vacant property premises, such as over-the-shop-type spaces, from requiring planning permission for a change of use for residential purposes right up to 2025.  Many areas of towns and villages of all sizes have vacant residential and commercial properties that could and, indeed, should be used.  If brought back into use, these properties could provide much-needed homes and add vibrancy to our towns and villages.  Promoting residential occupancy in our rural towns and villages is at the heart of our town-centre-first approach and Housing for All.</p> <p> The delivery of 33,000 homes per year, on average, requires an expansion of the current workforce.  Through the actions laid out in Housing for All, the industry will be supported in returning existing workers to full employment, and there will be proactive engagement with international labour where a supply is unavailable locally.  There will be a ramp-up in education and training opportunities, including commitments regarding programmes on apprenticeships and the delivery of new courses.</p> <p> Housing for All focuses on supply-side solutions by freeing up State lands for the delivery of affordable homes, by removing barriers and intervening in slow or stalled developments on non-State lands to unlock and accelerate delivery via the LDA, and by making the construction sector more productive through the construction sector group and the Construction Technology Centre to drive innovation and productivity and reduce residential construction costs.</p> <p> Despite the pandemic, Government has been focused on progressing major reforms that will accelerate and increase the supply of public, affordable and private housing.  We got to work straight away last year, while at the same time developing this plan.  We passed the first ever comprehensive Affordable Housing Act and reformed the LDA, giving it a legislative backing and adding to its powers.  Just recently, we opened Ireland's first cost-rental homes.  We reformed Part V and increased the contribution by developers from 10% to 20% to include affordable housing and cost rental housing; signed the Lisbon Declaration, committing to ending homelessness by 2030; increased grant funding to assist older people and people with disabilities; extended rent pressure zones, RPZs, and limited rent increases to general inflation; introduced five separate tenancy Bills to protect renters through the pandemic; brought 3,600 vacant social homes back into productive use; increased Irish Water funding by more than &euro;100 million; and banned co-living.  These actions demonstrate the Government's commitment to fixing our housing system.  Housing for All takes that commitment a step further on the pathway to a sustainable housing system by clearly setting out how we plan to address the serious short-, medium- and long-term challenges to 2030.</p> <p> The good news is that the sector is already responding positively.  Commencement notices show that in month of August 2021, we had 2,162 dwellings under way, which is a 38% increase on the same month in 2020.  For the 12 months to August 2021, the number of dwellings commenced was 29,565, which was a year-on-year increase of 34%.  We need to build on that momentum.</p> <p>We need to use all tools at our disposal to get to grips with the housing crisis.  This means using both public and private sector to deliver homes.  Some in the Opposition, however, seem intent on tying one hand behind our back in the biggest fight the State faces.  In reality, we need to use every weapon we have.  It is too easy to just oppose for opposition's sake but that is what we have.  Sinn F&eacute;in opposed the LDA and the help-to-buy incentive.   It opposes any private land initiatives and has opposed more than 5,000 homes in Dublin city alone.  I cannot particularly think of anything the Social Democrats have not opposed in this period.</p> <p> We need to be ambitious, honest and committed to delivery.  That is at the heart of Housing for All.  We cannot let one party's perfect be the enemy of the common good or put ideology above pragmatism.  We will not get out of the housing crisis by driving into an ideological cul-de-sac.  That approach would suffocate building and will only see sites lay idle, waiting lists grow and dreams of ownership die.</p> <p> This is a plan for the squeezed middle, to give those people the opportunity to buy their own home, while ensuring we have the kind of society that helps those who need it.  The breadth of ambition in the plan will help to stop and reverse the decline in homeownership and break the rent trap in which so many people are caught.  It will ramp up State building of social homes to help eliminate homelessness and address waiting lists.</p> <p> The housing system is complex.  The scale of the crisis is international.  There is no silver bullet and I cannot tell Members that it will be fixed overnight.  We have the solutions, ability, drive and determination to make a real impact, however, and we have a plan that is fully financed.  The Opposition parties need to reflect on what they are offering beyond sound bites, hypocrisy and ideological dead-ends.  As I said, now we have a radical plan that is fully financed, and we need to get on and deliver it.  The plan will make a real difference for our people and we are determined, as a Government, to make it work.  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agaibh.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2021-09-28a.280" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1468" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="17:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2021092800025#X00200"><p>I had a terrible sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu when listening to the Minister's speech.  So many of the rhetorical flourishes of what he said were used by the then Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, when he stood in this Chamber and told us it was the most ambitious and radical State-backed plan in the history of the State, and again, when former Minister, Eoghan Murphy, stood in the Chamber saying the same thing.  What has become a feature of this Government is the ever-growing gap between the rhetoric of Ministers, and, particularly, the Minister with responsibility for housing and the reality for working people on the ground trying to secure appropriate and affordable accommodation.</p><p>The Minister used three words to describe this Government's housing plan: &quot;ambitious&quot;, &quot;honest&quot; and &quot;committed&quot;.  I cannot think of three less appropriate words for this heavily-padded document.  It is not ambitious and I will explain why shortly.  I do not believe it is honest, certainly not if it is claiming to tackle the decades of failed Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael housing policy.  I do not believe for one second that this Government is committed to the kind of fundamental policy change that would be required to meet the housing needs of working families.</p><p>I noted with great interest the Minister's quote in <i>The Irish Times</i>today.  He was asked whether he believed the housing market is out of control, and, if the quote is correct, the Minister said, &quot;I don't accept it's out of control&quot;.  Rents are now higher than they were at the peak of the Celtic tiger.House prices are not far behind that peak.  More than 100,000 households are dependent on rent subsidies.  Homelessness is rising again, and, in many parts of the State, waiting times for social housing are between ten and 14 years.  I do not know what indicators of &quot;out of control&quot; this Minister needs, but, on all of those indicators, from what I am seeing, it is very clearly out of control.</p><p>The really interesting comment made by the Minister was that this problem is &quot;not unique to Ireland&quot;, not unlike the comments he made thereanent.  The Minister is correct as there is a housing crisis, particularly in most large urban centres in the world.  Let us consider the most recently published data from EUROSTAT, however.  Housing costs in this State are the most expensive anywhere in the EU.  We are at top of the housing cost table.  In fact, the only country in the European free-trade area with higher housing costs than us is Switzerland.  While there is a crisis, therefore, there is something much worse here that we need to understand.</p><p>The Minister is absolutely wrong.  The crisis of house price inflation is not, in the first instance, caused by Covid-19 restrictions.  They have made an already bad situation much worse but what is the actual cause of the housing crisis that has been escalating over the past ten-plus years?  It is decades of bad housing policy by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  In fact, if anybody can be accused of carrying ideological baggage, it is Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael, which simply cannot break away from the failures of their ideological past.</p><p>If we look at the plan and the few pages of the lavish 160-page document that contain hard facts, we begin to see that what is in it is not that ambitious at all.  Let us consider social housing.  On average, there are 9,000 social housing units provided for per year over the lifetime of the plan.  That is 1,000 social housing units less than what had previously been promised by Fine Gael under the national development plan, NDP.I accept that last year and this year, Covid-19 has reduced the overall output.  What the Minister should have done in this plan, however, is accelerate beyond the original NDP targets.  Instead, he has cut them.  We are worse off because of this plan than we would have been if Fine Gael had stayed in charge and led housing over the next five years.</p><p>The Government is also saying that it will deliver 4,000 affordable homes this year, 5,000 the year after and 6,500 the year after that.  That is not true.  The Government should be honest with people because 2,000 of those homes annually are unaffordable, open-market priced homes that will be purchased with the shared equity loan scheme and, therefore, affordable housing provision next year will, at the very best, be 2,100 units.  It might go up to 3,000 the year after and somewhere close to 4,000 the year after that, and that is if the Government meets the targets.  The number of affordable homes to be delivered through the cost-rental equity loan and affordable housing fund this year is so low that I do not see how the Government is going to deliver 2,000 affordable homes through those schemes next year.  I would be appreciative if the Minister could provide detail on that.</p><p>He said the Government has changed Part V, which, I suppose, it has, if he means it has changed it post 2026 because of the sweetheart deal or get-out clause for landowners who have yet to apply for planning permission.  Thankfully, we have the Housing Agency's report, which is a good piece of work numbering more than 70 pages.  The agency gave a variety of options, however.  Of course, the Minister chose the most pro-developer option available, which is that any landowner who has not secured planning permission has until 2026 and only the 10% applies.  That is not reform; that is giving developers everything they have asked for on a plate to the detriment of the delivery of affordable homes for working people.</p> <p>At the same time, house prices will be pushed up because help-to-buy pushes up house prices.  Despite the fact 60% of the people who had availed of the scheme did not need it, given that they had a deposit and mortgage finance, the Minister then increased it last year in a move that was criticised by the ESRI and other bodies.  The Government is then going to combine that with the shared equity loan scheme and, if it gets its way, that will be again doubled with the participation of the mainstream banks.  All of this, along with the excessive tax breaks the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Michael McGrath, will continue for real estate investment trusts, REITs, and others, will increase the level of credit in the market, push up prices and make home ownership even more difficult for working people.</p> <p> There is nothing meaningful for renters in the plan.  I wish the Minister would stop telling people he is going to introduce tenancies of indefinite duration because that is not his plan.  Unless the section 34 grounds for notices to quit, namely, sale of the property, use by the landlord or his or her family member and substantial renovation, are removed, tenancies of indefinite duration will not exist.  Until that is changed, renters will still live in precarious and, unfortunately, unaffordable accommodation.  We can talk later during oral questions about what the Minister will do about spiralling rents, given that the previous legislation he introduced in that regard did not work.</p> <p> Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe seems to be a reheated local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, although the Minister might convince us otherwise, and the targets in respect of vacant properties are just as weak as they were under the previous Government.  Nothing in the plan resembles the Kenny report recommendations on land.  On the contrary, Mr. Justice Kenny was against the kind of measure the Government has outlined in the plan because it will do nothing to tackle land price inflation, but why let the facts get in the way of a good sound bite?  I note with interest there is no date for the referendum to enshrine the right to housing in the Constitution because, of course, while the Minister says he is in favour of it, he has not convinced his Fine Gael colleagues who are against it, and until that is resolved, the referendum is out of reach.</p> <p> When I read this plan, what struck me most was that it is a sign of a Government out of touch and out of ideas.  Increasingly, that is how the public sees this.  Time after time, the Government puts the needs of big developers, large landowners and international institutional investors over those of regular working people.  It is clear the Government does not have what it takes to make the types of policy changes required to tackle this housing crisis.  I do not for a second believe there will be over the coming years a significant increase in the supply of genuinely affordable homes, anything that will be close to the level of social housing required to tackle lengthening waiting lists and rising homelessness, or anything that will deal with the significant burden of sky-high rents, let alone the insecurity of security of tenure, all because the Minister is wedded to the past.  He is wedded to a particular view of housing policy that believes the private sector can meet the overwhelming majority of social and affordable housing need.</p> <p> To contradict him, I want private builders to build as many homes as possible and private developers to develop as many homes as possible, but I also want there to be a level of direct investment in public housing on public land that will not be contained in this plan.  The &euro;4 billion figure is a fiction.  Come budget day, when the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform announce the capital interest in direct voted expenditure, it will be so far below what the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, is claiming that he will be found out.  At the very most, he will secure a couple of hundred million euro for the cost rental equity loan, CREL, scheme and the affordable housing fund, and any additional capital will be spent on more subsidies and grant aid for developers.  We know that because the Government's targets are so low for affordable housing and it is cutting 1,000 social homes from what would otherwise be delivered.</p> <p> I have no faith or confidence in the Minister, the Government or the housing plan.  That is why, more than ever, if we are to tackle the ever-deepening housing crisis for social housing applicants, renters and people who want to buy, we need a change of Government, not more bluff and bluster from the Minister.</p></speech>

I say &quot;new&quot; but, as we have heard, there is little new in it.  It is called Housing for All but, as we know, this could not be further from the truth.  The Minister's plan is just more of the <i>status quo</i>.  He stated he recognises it is cheaper to buy a home than rent one in several cities and added that this is how broken the system is.  He talks as though the system broke itself, and as though we have suddenly found ourselves in the midst of a housing crisis.  He washes his hands of it and asks who did it.  We are here because of the failed policies of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael that have created the housing crisis, yet the Minister and his Government expect us to believe that the people who caused the crisis are somehow the same people we should entrust to fix it.  Do they live in the real world at all?</p><p>It is clear from the plan there will be little, if any, increase in direct capital investment in social and affordable homes between now and 2025, over and above what was in the pipeline.  This means rents and high prices will continue to increase and supply will continue to lag behind.  If someone is paying &euro;2,000 a month for a one-bedroom apartment, or cannot access a mortgage and fears he or she will never own a home, or has been ten years or more on a council waiting list, or is in his or her 30s and is living back with his or her parents, or sleeps in a homeless hostel, or had to emigrate because of the cost and lack of housing, there is no need to worry.  The Minister is telling people there is no crisis and the market is not out of control. </p><p>What happening is out of control.  If he does not acknowledge that, we are wasting our time and he is wasting his.  Somehow, he expects us to believe that the people who brought us here will be the same people to fix the problem, with the same policies and ideology.  He is wedded to his market-driven ideology.  That is what has brought us here and it will not get us out of this situation.</p></speech>

On the same day, this House passed a motion, which no Deputy opposed, calling for 100% redress for families who have been devastated by defective concrete blocks.  The scheme that is in place was supposed to provide 90%, with the banks making a large contribution towards the remaining 10%.  Of course, the banks ran away and were nowhere to be seen, and the figure is anything but 90%.</p>  <p>  The Minister's working group has been established but the families did not have a good experience with that group.  His departmental officials, as is in the DNA of departmental officials, are focused on limiting the exposure of the State.  That is their mindset in these discussions.  The families, meanwhile, have been focused on solutions.  They have made their final submission to the Minister.  They have put a great deal of work into it and it is based on a costing per square metre by the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland.  The Government has asked what 100% redress would mean and the families have demonstrated what can be done based on real-world prices, but they have also demonstrated the need for a State guarantee.  If we are saying to families that, in many instances, they are not required to demolish their homes and that removing the outer leaf would be a safe option, as is the view of the engineers who put together the protocol for the National Standards Authority of Ireland, the State needs to guarantee that work.  People will embrace that if there is a guarantee and an assurance is in place. </p>  <p>  They are the two big calls, namely, for 100% redress and a State guarantee in respect of any works that take place.  The families who stayed with the process, even though they were not happy at all, have made the submission and presented it to Members in the Houses in the past week, as the Minister will be aware.  They have done tremendous work and I am hopeful he will back their report and deliver the solution so many families badly need.</p></speech>

His reputation and success will rest on it, as I am sure he recognises.</p> <p>That is how important this document is and, as the Minister said, how important it is for this Government.  I have a different view.  I have no doubt the Minister is going to build houses.  Fianna F&aacute;il builds houses.  It has the relationships with the people to build houses.  Our concerns are how affordable they will be, the reliance on the private sector and what the Minister will do for renters.  These are issues we and our spokesperson on housing, Senator Moynihan, have raised numerous times with the Minister since his appointment, under the legislation he already brought forward in advance of Housing for All in respect of the Land Development Agency and the affordable housing scheme.</p> <p> I will outline the areas where we have issues.  We believe a fundamental flaw in Housing for All is that there is no definition of affordability.  It will not come as a surprise to the Minister that we have this issue, as we have articulated it for well over a year now.  It has not been included in the Affordable Housing Act and there is no indication from the Minister that it is something the Government is willing to confront.  The advice of experts appearing before the housing committee is that affordability be specifically defined as a third of a person's income.  Senator Moynihan put forward amendments in this respect for previous legislation but they were not accepted.  Housing for All provides for a variety of different affordable purchase schemes, together with cost rental, but does not provide an underpinning legal definition of what constitutes a so-called affordable home for the success of these schemes.</p> <p> The success of these schemes is not whether the roof is built over somebody's head, but how affordable it will be for the people who will be under it.  There are people who will scrimp and save and get into the home, but who will then struggle month on month and if another economic crash hits, and it does not have to be as severe as the last one, they will lose everything.  That is where the success of an affordable housing scheme will be truly measured.  That is a key concern, and it is not a political point-scoring concern.  This is a fundamental concern for the Labour Party.  The market cannot be allowed to dictate what it means for something to be affordable.  It is in the interests of the market not to care for people.  The market does not care for people; it cares for the bottom line.  The market is not going to find a natural affordable rate.  It is always going to pursue profit, and that is never going to change.</p> <p> There is a reliance on the private sector to deliver.  The reality is that there are developers who are sitting on land.  The Minister knows from the constituency both of us share that in the past ten years developers have been sitting on large tracts of land waiting for the value to increase.  If they decide to develop on the land, they develop it piece by piece.  The first phase will be released at a particular price.  The second phase will be released &euro;25,000 dearer.  In the next year, the third phase will be released with another &euro;25,000 or &euro;30,000 on top of that.  That is what the private sector does.  There is nothing in this document that is going to mitigate that practice.  They have the State by the proverbials on this, given the amount of land banks they own in key areas such as Fingal that will be needed to solve the housing crisis.  Fingal is the youngest county in the State, with young people, older people seeking to downsize and people who have separated needing to buy homes.  They are looking at these land banks and waiting for the developers to deliver.  The developers are not going to do it until it is profitable for them to do so.  There is nothing in this document that assuages our concerns in that regard.</p> <p> There are 400,000 people renting in this country.  That is a huge number of people who really need support.  There remains a massive imbalance of power between renters and landlords.  The Minister spoke favourably last week about our tenant rights Bill in the name of Deputy Bacik, but he appeared to focus on issues relating to the quality of rental accommodation and not the security of tenure, which is ultimately the bedrock on which renters' rights are based.  That is something the Minister has to address, and we do not have confidence it is addressed in the Housing for All document.</p> <p> The Minister mentioned that housing is the first priority for this Government, and it should be.  However, where housing and big infrastructure projects intersect, will the infrastructure projects fall aside?  I refer to MetroLink and the example of the Fosterstown lands in Swords.  Thousands of units will be developed in Fosterstown.  When I was a councillor, I, the Fianna F&aacute;il councillors and other councillors engaged with our constituents and told them this plan had to go through because MetroLink was going to be delivered on the back of it.  Those units are going to be built, but MetroLink is going to be delayed.  Optimistically, it is going to be delayed but most people now believe it will never happen.  The Minister is aware of the traffic congestion.  What happens then?  We need transport.  There are many parts of this city and of other cities and parts of the country that have no transport infrastructure.  To build and deliver houses on already zoned lands without the promised ambitious, much-needed, climate-friendly transport infrastructure is a betrayal.  We are still suffering from the lack of that development when Fianna F&aacute;il was last in power and built a rake of houses.</p> <p> As I said, I believe houses will be built.  The Government has the relationships to build those houses, and many people may end up with a roof over their heads.  However, it may not be affordable and may be a struggle for many.  I believe it will be.  We are back to where we were previously, whereby a few people will get very wealthy and will profit from housing development in this country while the very many who fund that profit and those riches will be struggling each week, month and year to ensure the roof remains above their heads and that they are not sunk again by another economic or housing crisis.  I hope that does not happen, but our concern is that it will.</p></speech>

I listened to Sinn F&eacute;in Members with bemusement.  They are always trying to create a caricature and then attack it.  The latest caricature is that this plan is all about private developers.

Some 48% of all housing built in the next decade will be either social or affordable.  That is in the plan.  This is not relying on the private sector.  This is driving a housing sector, both private and public, to deliver for ordinary people.  To try to portray it as some type of attempt to get into cahoots with private developers to hoodwink people is simply not the case.</p>  <p>  I looked at the housing pipeline in my constituency.  It will be of interest to people that 11,500 homes are in the pipeline in the constituency, just one part of Dublin.  That will be a 20% increase in the number of homes in the constituency, if they are developed.  One can ask how many of them are coming from a Sinn F&eacute;in controlled council.  It is only 10%.  The reality is that 32% of the private ones are on-site, which is not enough, but only 15% of the public ones are on-site.  On top of that, Sinn F&eacute;in and others blocked an 853-unit housing project-----</p></speech>

It blocked that, despite it being in the pipeline for four years and approved by Sinn F&eacute;in members of that council at that stage.  Let us get real about where housing strategy is coming from and what we are trying to achieve here.</p>  <p>  This is a very innovative policy proposal.  Not only does it plan to deliver 48% social and affordable housing, which is unprecedented in the history of the State, but it also brings in a State developer, not a private developer, for the first time.  It is the first time we have a State developer, the Land Development Agency.  The agency already has access to sites for 26,000 homes, which it will deliver as affordable.  Along with others, I want the Minister to drive forward that and ensure there is absolutely no delay with those.  Some of those are getting stalled private sector sites moving forward.  The reality is that our councils have not been up to this challenge.  They have not been able to deliver at scale or at affordability.  Now we have a system where a State developer will have access to State land and get that at discount prices so it can deliver affordable prices to people who need them.  That is innovation in my book.</p>  <p>  In addition, we have land value sharing so in future rezonings we will see a recovery of that for the State and for communities.  There is a cities fund to reach out to young families who are now living in high-density areas, which is very expensive, and to make it affordable for them.  CPOs on vacant premises will be supported with a State fund.  There will be a tax on vacant homes.  There will be a unit in the Department of the Taoiseach to drive forward this, so we will not see Departments scattered around the State blocking the capacity of this plan to deliver.  I believe this should be welcomed.  I also welcome the move in the fair deal scheme.</p> <p>The fair deal scheme has locked down homes because of the rules of that scheme.  Now they are being changed.</p></speech>

I want this to succeed.  I want us to fix the housing problem by looking pragmatically at every solution, not standing on our little territories and refusing to allow private building on public lands.  That sort of approach has stalled the delivery of homes and makes our local authorities unable to step up to this challenge.  I welcome what the Minister is trying to do here.  It is the right direction.  We need to make it work.  I hope there will be more co-operation when we get into committees and down into the councils to see this work at ground level.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the collaborative approach we had in preparing this document.  It is a long-term plan, incorporating many green objectives that started off as discussions with the Minister and his advisers.  We improved those ideas and now we see them in a strategy and in legislation.</p>  <p>  Cost rental has been the core of the Green Party housing policy for a long time.  We met our Green colleagues in Vienna to look at its world-class cost-rental model.  I do not believe anyone in this House could argue with the cost-rental model.  We have introduced it into Irish legislation for the first time.  I expect the numbers will increase over the time as the Land Development Agency, LDA, scales up and as we attract investors into that space with those limited returns that would suit those ethical long-term investors or pension funds.  I expect that number to scale up, because when representatives of the LDA appeared before our committee, they said cost rental would be a focus of their work and I believe they will deliver on that.</p>  <p>  I listened to the Minister's opening speech in which he referred to cost rental as being a game changer, which is exactly how I described it to people on doorsteps during the previous general election campaign.  I am proud we are legislating for this and that we are delivering this in government.</p>  <p>  Urban regeneration and addressing the vacancy and dereliction that exists on many of our streets is a core part of this plan.  There are thousands of opportunities to take an existing building, renovate it, refurbish it and then rejuvenate it, to bring life and living back into the town and above shops or, in limited cases, instead of a shop.  Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe is putting the life and the heart back into those towns.</p>  <p>  We need to put in place supports to assist people who want to take a derelict or vacant building because it is difficult to get the loans in certain circumstances.  It is awkward to build in town centres.  There can be traffic management issues, live streets, neighbours and all those kinds of difficulties.  Often it is so much easier to go with a greenfield development and I can see the attraction of that.  With those buildings we have in our town centres, I firmly believe the greenest building is one that is already built that we can invest in, adapt, repurpose, change its use and upgrade it to live in it.</p>  <p>  When that life and living and vibrancy is put back into a town centre, it generates an economic return to that town.  It also generates a societal return for that town and rebuilds that community.  It is hard to put into tangible economics what that can generate for a town.  It is an incredibly important part of the Housing for All strategy.</p>  <p>  The target of producing 33,000 homes annually is grounded in the ESRI analysis on population growth, persons per dwelling, demographic changes etc.  It is a realistic figure.  It is challenging but deliverable over the course of this strategy.  I listened to the Opposition Members who are highly critical of this figure.  They have claimed it should be higher, quicker etc.  If we had said 40,000, they would have said 50,000.  They do not deal in facts or detail.</p></speech>

None of that has ever produced a house.  None of them has ever produced a house.</p>  <p>  The target we need to produce is large but doable.  It also creates another problem in that it leads to significant carbon emissions if these are all to be new builds, which I do not believe they will be.  Concrete production is an enormous carbon emitter.  If we take the existing stock of derelict and vacant buildings, and stock that is going into obsolescence, and provide the resources for people to refurbish them, it will also be a game changer.  There are hundreds of kilometres of commercial streets with two or three storeys above them where no one is living.  That brings life and vibrancy back into a town after 5 p.m.  When the shutters come down, there is still life and light on the streets, which is important for a sense of security in local communities.</p>  <p>  We need to match that town centre living with commensurate investment in the public realm in the creation of those nice public amenity places with good wide footpaths, safe walking routes to school and all the matching infrastructure that goes with living in a town centre.  For the bigger projects we can do much of that through the town and village renewal, the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, and the rural regeneration and development fund, RRDF, funding.  However, for the smaller projects we need to ensure our local authorities are well enough resourced and have the capacity to carry out the audits in our town centres to see where we need those small interventions and small bits of work that would make living over the shops or in the town centre attractive for residents and draw people into it.</p>  <p>  Carrying out the health checks and audits for our towns is a vital part of deciding where and how we should direct public funds to generate the best return for the economic and societal benefits and to create towns that are attractive to live in.  It all takes resources at local level as well as national level.  Our local authority resources and staff are under pressure all the time.  I welcome giving local authorities better powers to compulsorily purchase vacant and derelict buildings, to regenerate them and bring them back into use for society, but we need to resource them to do the extra work the compulsory purchase order, CPO, scheme demands.</p>  <p>  It is important to audit our towns, identifying sites where there is no impediment to development and liaising with owners to encourage them or show them how they can change the use of these properties.  Even trying to find the owners can be difficult in certain circumstances.  Staff who are already under pressure do not always have the luxury of being able to do that.</p>  <p>  There will be challenges with upskilling the construction sector for apprentices for professional services to deal with the new build, refurbishment and repurposing of buildings.  The retrofitting of 500,000 units of our existing housing stock will be another challenge.  However, it will create thousands of long-term, well-paid professional and trade jobs.  I acknowledge the work done by the Minister, Deputy Harris, and others to encourage the uptake of apprenticeships.</p>  <p>  This plan is costed, realistic, deliverable and funded.  It will provide certainty for people who want to buy, build or rent at affordable costs.  It commits to ending homelessness.  It is the largest ever State intervention in a public building programme.  It is State led and plan led.  It will take time to get there but the route is clear.  The legislation has been passed and more is on the way to ensure we deliver on housing, which is the most immediate critical issue we face.</p></speech>

I support what my colleague, Deputy Mac Lochlainn, said about 100% redress and the guarantee needed for households who opt for the outer layer option.  I commend all the people who gathered to demonstrate in Ballina.  I hope these people will get their lives back very soon.</p>  <p>  This plan will not deliver housing for all.  Apart from the many weaknesses and shortcomings highlighted by my colleagues and other Members of the Opposition, the plan has nothing of substance to address the accommodation crisis students are facing.  Despite having the highest college fees in the EU, accommodation is the biggest barrier for many working students and families on low and medium incomes.  This particularly disadvantages students from rural areas.  Families are running themselves into financial ruin just to educate their children - that is if they can even afford to send them to college.  Students were really angry when they heard the Taoiseach say he would keep a close eye on third level colleges to ensure they do not charge exorbitant rents.  That is a bewildering comment for students who are in this situation.  They have heard the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage admit he has no plan to address the crisis in student accommodation-----</p></speech>

This is for all the students who are in hostels, in hotel rooms or who are sleeping on floors as we speak.  The Government's housing plan states that universities have developed a significant amount of student accommodation in recent years, another statement that is divorced from reality and shows how out of touch is the Government.</p> <p>Since 2017, the year the student accommodation strategy was published, only 679 on-campus student accommodation places have been added, with the increase in student numbers and the ever-increasing share of student accommodation going to attract high-fee international students.  The reality is more students are competing for comparatively fewer on-campus beds.  The only other initiative for this policy is around the technological universities, and I welcome and support that.  The Minister has left students behind in the housing plan so I ask him to address the crisis and emergency that is there.</p></speech>

It will provide housing for some but not for ordinary people.  It will provide housing for developers, landowners, speculators, investment and vulture funds, and greedy landlords but not for ordinary people who are trying to put a roof over their heads and pay a rent or mortgage that is sustainable.  The Minister is there with his partners in government in Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the Green Party.  Listening to the contributions of Deputies Bruton and Matthews you would think the housing crisis happened yesterday.  The housing crisis happened over the past 20 years because of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael policy, which was supported during that time by the Green Party.  For members of those parties to come in here and say that Housing for All will solve the problems and is the answer shows how little they understand the crisis people are facing.  We are not talking about delivering houses in five or ten years' time.  Houses need to be delivered now.</p>  <p>  In Cork alone, there are 9,000 vacant and derelict houses.  Last weekend, a group in Cork did a derelict tour of Cork city and it took them two and half hours to walk one portion of it.  I thank the Community Action Tenants Union, CATU, Frank O'Connor, Jude Sherry and everyone who walked with them for what they did to highlight this dereliction.  This was caused by Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  Do the Government Deputies not understand that or do they deny they are responsible?  Will the Minister come to Cork city with me to meet Cork City Council officials?  I will walk him around the city and show him the dereliction that is destroying Cork.</p></speech>

That is the difference.  The Minister spoke about ideology, and there is a problem with it because the Government believes in looking after the well-to-do and the wealthy developers.  People do not have homes, they are worried about how they will pay their rents and mortgages and there is nothing in Housing for All for them.</p></speech>

Let us be clear about what is happening in terms of the comments made earlier by the Minister and in the media.  There is an attempt to normalise our housing crisis by saying it is a problem internationally and by pointing to what is going on in other European countries to make it acceptable somehow.  This was tried by the previous Government and the now T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Varadkar, when he commented on homelessness.  He tried to normalise it by saying it is an international problem.  People saw through that and the public did not accept it and the public will not accept this now.</p>  <p>  The reality and truth are that we have some of the highest rents in the European Union in this city and that we have some of the highest housing costs in the European Union.  Those are facts and this is not normal.  The reason for that is we have a high-risk, high-cost and highly speculative method of delivering housing.  I have no issue with private development and I want to see more of it but the problem we have is we do not have enough not-for-profit, affordable or cost rental development taking place.  That is the missing piece.</p>  <p>  On cost rental, something unusual is happening in Ireland in that we are defining cost rental on a basis on which it is not defined anywhere else in the world that I am aware of.  Cost rental is understood to provide rented accommodation at the cost of providing it, that is, on a not-for-profit basis.  What the Government has done in the Affordable Housing Act is allow for cost rental on a for-profit basis.  That is not done anywhere else in the world that I am aware of.  It is not done in Austria.  Any surplus from cost rental in Austria is reinvested into cost rental.  That is part of the sustainability of the system.  It is simply not true to state otherwise.</p>  <p>  We have a Minister who likes to state otherwise.  He came into this House on 24 June and told me the Central Bank had passed and approved his shared equity scheme.  Does the Minister stand over those comments he made to me on 24 June?</p></speech>

There has been a lot of spin on this plan.  The first bit of spin was during the launch, where there was a lot of talk about increasing home ownership levels.  If this plan is implemented and meets its targets, home ownership levels will continue to decrease in Ireland.  That is a fact.  Incidentally, that is not for the worst of reasons; it is because the plan sets out the construction of more cost rental and social homes.  However, at the launch speaker after speaker said that this plan will increase home ownership.  The plan sets out to continue to decrease our home ownership levels, albeit for honourable reasons as I said, but that was the first bit of spin on this.</p>  <p>  The second bit of spin was the constant reference to the increase in funding and the &euro;4 billion per annum that would be spent.  The ESRI has been strong and clear in saying we need to go from &euro;2 billion in Exchequer capital funding on housing to about &euro;4 billion, but that is not the way that &euro;4 billion figure has been arrived at.  There was &euro;3 billion of Exchequer funding allocated in the 2021 budget for housing with &euro;2 billion on the capital side and about &euro;1 billion in Housing Finance Agency loans.  That is where we arrive at our &euro;4 billion.  There is no additional capital funding in this plan.  We will see some increase on the capital side in the budget but it will not bring us from &euro;2 billion in Exchequer funding up to &euro;4 billion, as a lot of people are now expecting from the spin that was brought out at the time of the launch.</p>  <p>  On the land value sharing measures in this report, let us be very clear this does not amount to the implementation of the Kenny report.  It is better than doing nothing and we should be trying to capture land value in terms of funding infrastructure, but that will not bring land on stream at affordable costs to ensure more affordable housing.  It will mean more funding for infrastructure from the Exchequer.  How that works out with development levies being taken away as a balancing measure to that remains to be seen.</p>  <p>  There is far too little emphasis in Housing for All on the serious skills deficit we have.  In terms of our wet trades in construction apprenticeships, we are only at about 10% of our 2004 peak, particularly in areas such as bricklaying and plastering.  There is an over-reliance in the Housing for All strategy on the idea that this will all be sorted with international labour.</p>  <p>  Climate action and dealing with matters such as cement and carbon from housing and the need to have a circular use of materials are weak in the plan.</p> <p>I hope the climate action plan will address those matters.</p> <p> The plan allows for at least &euro;1 billion in subsidies for developers from shared equity and other measures.  All it gives people who are homeless, in emergency accommodation or sleeping on the street is a mere 20 additional new Housing First tenancies, increasing from 220 a year to 240 a year.  That is far too few and we could do much better.  I ask the Government to re-examine that and to look to at least double the number of Housing First tenancies a year from the current 220 so we can make proper headway on that. </p></speech>

I was working it out because, like the Taoiseach, I did not do honours maths.  This is a very important document for the Minister, for those Deputies who support the Government and for the thousands of people who want this housing crisis to end.  Something substantial happened in February 2020.  We were told through the democratic mandate that things needed to change on housing.  That is why we all had the responsibility to try to put together a Government that did that.  Some people led that job of putting a Government together, while others did not.  They will be judged on that as much as we will be judged by this plan.</p>  <p>  I want to talk to people about how this plan will help them, but the difficulty is that all the debate so far has sought to refight the general election of 2020, pretending the plan prior to that election is the same as this current plan.  It is not.  The rhetoric from the Opposition that this Government believes the private sector should be the builder of the majority of housing is not true.  We do not agree with that and it is wrong.  They say this Government is out of touch and out of ideas.  They are wrong; this document is packed with ideas.  They say we do not live in the real world.  Every day, the Minister, like all of us in our clinics, hears problems relating to the housing crisis.  We are anything but out of touch with it.  They say we do not understand it, that we have speculator buddies, that we are leaning into the market, that we have the same policies and the same ideas and that we are wedded to market-driven priorities.  They are wrong.  Why are they wrong?  Because Housing for All specifically outlines how they are wrong.</p>  <p>  Let us compare Rebuilding Ireland with the Housing for All option.  Rebuilding Ireland was a &euro;6 billion plan over six years.  This is a &euro;20 billion plan over five years.  Rebuilding Ireland was very much focused on social housing.  Housing for All delivers housing for all - cost rental, affordable purchase and social housing, because we need mixed income and well-planned estates everywhere.  I and many Deputies represent constituencies where that was not done and it is a key deliverable in Housing for All.  This Government has brought in cost rental legislation, something Rebuilding Ireland did not do.  The Labour Party talks about cost rental over and over again, but it was in government for five years and there was no legislation on cost rental.  None.  It had its chance.  We did it in the space of 12 months.  The previous Government limited the role of the Land Development Agency, LDA, while this Government has expanded it because, as the Minister said, we want every tool in the box.  The previous Government reduced Part V by 10%; this Government doubled the obligation on developers to 20%.  The previous Government introduced co-housing; we abolished it.  How can the Opposition say these are the same policies all over again?  It is just not true.</p></speech>

I will not talk to the Opposition but to the members of the public who want this problem solved.  What does Housing for All do?  First, if you do not qualify for social housing at the moment, Housing for All has solutions for you.  If you do not qualify for social housing, you will now qualify for cost rental.  If there are empty public sites beside you, in Dublin, Cork and other places where affordability is an issue, 100% of those will be used for public housing on public land, as provided for in the LDA Bill.  The Minister has capped both deposits and rents.  Housing for All provides councils with the ability to build public housing and affordable purchase homes on their sites, costing between &euro;160,000 and &euro;250,000 per unit.  The budget is &euro;20 billion, which is real money that will deliver real homes.  As I said, the strategic housing development, SHD, process, which was essentially one that enabled developers to flip their sites, has been ended by this Minister.  We have restored local democracy and local powers to local authorities.</p>  <p>  There are so many things in sight that will all have local application on the ground.  In my constituency, there will be affordable purchase and senior citizen homes on Parkview, senior citizen homes on Jamestown Road, all three different housing models on lands at Kildonan, a site at Whitehall car park and further sites at Oscar Traynor, the Dublin Port tunnel, Coultry Gardens, Sillogue, Balbutcher Lane, Finglas West Church and Belclare Drive.  None of these is under construction but all of them will be built using the tools in Housing for All, tools that were not available in Rebuilding Ireland.</p>  <p>  All of us will be judged, including the Minister, me and everyone in this House, both the Opposition and the Government, on whether we have delivered for the people with this plan.  I hope we will do so, but the focus now shifts to implementation, to the local authorities, to the approved housing bodies and to every other provider and partner we can work with.  The job did not end when we passed this legislation or when we passed the budget.  It will only end when keys are turned in doors and more people get more homes.</p></speech>

In particular, I support his tributes to the Minister.  Housing for All is a very good document and a very good plan.  There was lots of evidence on the day it was launched that the Minister had taken on advice and suggestions from his colleagues in government, from colleagues across the Oireachtas, from NGOs that are working hard in the area of housing, particularly homelessness, and, most important, from people throughout the country who are worried they will never be able to settle down in a home where their status is secure.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has spoken previously about the three big priorities for Government being health, housing and climate.  These areas are linked in many ways, not least in the need to deliver compact growth leading to sustainable and healthy communities.  In addition, they are all extremely challenging areas requiring a whole-of-government approach and political leadership.  They necessitate doing things in a different way and they are all very difficult problems to solve.</p>  <p>  Every year in this Chamber we talk about housing, and every time we discuss the issue someone mentions the Kenny report.  It was often Green Party Deputies who raised the issue of housing as that report gathered another layer of dust on the shelf.  I am very pleased this Government will introduce measures similar to those recommended by Judge Kenny in 1973 to capture some of the uplift in value for the State when land is rezoned.  The measures are not perfect, but it will go on record that the Minister was the one who started to implement the recommendations of this report after so many decades.</p>  <p>  Housing for All will also introduce penalties for owners of zoned land who fail to develop it.  Again, this took far too long to introduce.  I believe this is because it was too politically difficult and I am glad this Government has taken some politically difficult decisions not taken previously, because we need to take difficult decisions to deliver on housing.  In addition to taxing undeveloped zoned lands, I also support the introduction of the Cro&iacute; C&oacute;naithe fund to support the delivery of housing in cities where planning permission has already been received and, importantly, to give financial support for the refurbishment of vacant homes.</p>  <p>  Housing for All is bringing a new direction to the URDF, one I welcome.  From my experience in my city of Limerick, despite the best of intentions in our applications for funding, we have not managed to deliver the best for Limerick.  We tried to apply for flagship projects that did not necessarily deliver a more liveable Limerick city.  I welcome the fact the URDF will in future be much more focused on delivery of housing, in particular on bringing vacant housing back into use.  Revitalising our urban centres requires a multifaceted approach and it was remiss up to this point that vacant housing was not a primary focus of the URDF.</p>  <p>  I am passionate about the issue of housing vacancy.  It is morally wrong that we have so many empty homes throughout our State, and I have been working with my colleagues to try to push for a wide range of measures to tackle the issue of housing vacancy.  I am glad to see that Housing for All delivers many of these measures.  I will continue to push for comprehensive measures to address housing vacancy and vacant sites because we must restore the fabric of our cities, towns and villages, getting people to live in them again and to do so in a sustainable manner.</p> <p>There is often a lot of lip service paid in this House to the concept of balanced regional development but I believe that the town centres first approach is the way of actually delivering it.  I know that the Minister's Department is working hard with the Department of the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, to deliver the town centres first policy.  I know from my party colleagues, the Ministers of State, Deputies Joe O&rsquo;Brien and Malcolm Noonan, that this town centres first approach is receiving high priority in both Departments.</p> <p> There are many other welcome aspects to Housing for All but I want to conclude by saying that when faced with difficult problems, there can be a temptation to flee to the safety of ideological purity, to focus more on being right than on getting things done.  I do not think that my constituents, many of whom have contacted me to share their difficulties in getting a place they can call home, would thank me or anyone else for not urging you to focus now, as you have committed to doing, on getting things done and delivering this plan.  We have the blueprint for action, and now we must deliver.</p></speech>

Let me tell the House about the housing situation in north Kildare because I noticed that the Minister was quite amused by the whole thing.  My office is out the door with men and women in every age group desperate for a home.  There is a mother of three who is expecting her fourth child.  She is just out of a refuge for women experiencing domestic violence and has been living with her mum.  Kildare County Council suggested that she goes back to her abusive partner because the council would have to get on to Tusla if she presents as homeless.  It is unimaginable.  This State is never not at it when it comes to women.  A woman in her 50s pays &euro;700 a month for a single room in a house share.  A working man in his 60s lost a home in a marriage break-up and never imagined he would be renting into his pension years and beyond.  He cannot even find a place to rent at the moment.  With added cruelty, some people are dumping or giving away their furniture.  They have been evicted because a house is to be sold and they cannot afford to store their treasured possessions.  They cannot find a place to rent in time so all the things they have collected throughout their lives and that furnished their lives, not only physically but also emotionally, are just gone.  It is as if the system is telling the renters of north Kildare they cannot even have basic comfort because profit rules and profit decides they do not deserve it.  All of this degradation and brutalising of people has become normal in the Government's eyes.  The Government wants it to appear normal for all.  We are facing outright slaughter in terms of housing for people who will be renting until they die and depending on the old age pension, which does not include accommodation costs.  We need radical change and actual housing for all, not this sham.  A major investment in social and affordable housing is needed and it is too long overdue because people in north Kildare and everywhere are not affected by this crisis as much as they are afflicted by it.  That affliction of good, ordinary people must stop.  The pretence must stop.</p></speech>

This plan is good for big developers and investment funds but it is bad for working people looking to buy, for renters, or for those in need of social housing.  It will push up house pries and rents while failing to deliver affordable housing that is badly needed in areas such as mine in Longford-Westmeath.  The number of people whose lives, families, futures, hopes and dreams are being crushed by policies that this Government is wedded to inflicting on them is simply sickening.  People arrive to my office doors with the dreaded notice to quit in their hands.  That notice to quit might as well read &quot;nine minutes&quot; instead of &quot;nine months&quot; for all the hope these people have of finding an alternative home to live in.  Those people experience anxiety and stress as that clock ticks down.  They could not care less what is happening internationally as they pack their belongings into plastic bags.</p><p>Affordable housing needs to be exactly that: affordable.  The question that begs to be asked when we see price caps of &euro;225,000 in Longford and &euro;300,000 in Westmeath relates to what planet the Minister is living on.  That is completely unaffordable to somebody who is working in Dunnes Stores and married to a member of the Defence Forces.  It is not going to happen.  Where is the all in that arithmetic?  A housing policy that focuses exclusively on supply must ensure supply in the right location and at the right price.  We all know that it needs to be the right policy delivered by the right Minister and the right Government because otherwise it is simply going to fail.  That is not what the people voted for in the most recent election.  They did not vote for more failure and a lack of change.</p><p>It has been reported that at a recent meeting of Longford municipal district, the director of services expressed his fears as written correspondence received by his department returned not very encouraging insights as to where Longford fits into the Government's plan.  His department of housing officials had devised seven criteria for the counties, one of which Longford will fail on immediately.  If that does not raise alarm bells, I am not too sure what else would.  That official believed that only 14 counties nationwide would meet the terms set down in the plan.</p><p>This housing plan will not fix the housing crisis.  It will push up prices and rents.  The social housing delivery will completely fail.  We will have an increase in homelessness.  When the Minister has a chance, I encourage him to look up the <i>Longford Leader</i>on Google.  I point him in the direction of an article that is headlined &quot;Government bosses told to wake the hell up&quot;.  I strongly suggest this Government takes that advice on board.</p></speech>

The people who asked for this debate get six and a half minutes after the contributions of five or six Government speakers and the Minister, who does not want to hang around to hear from the rest of the parties.  This party has been ringing alarm bells about the housing crisis since I entered the D&aacute;il in 2011.  It makes me sick but it is typical of what is going on in here.</p>  <p>  We have heard the nonsense and rhetoric about Housing for All and &euro;4 billion a year.  I ask the Government to tell the truth.  I asked a parliamentary question on this matter.  What is actually being delivered in terms of investment is &euro;12 billion in direct Exchequer funding, &euro;3.5 billion through the Land Development Agency and another &euro;5 billion.  That totals &euro;18.5 billion over nine years.  That is just over &euro;2 billion a year.  That is the amount the Government is actually putting in and the rest is coming from the private sector, or the Government is hoping it will come through the private sector.  A big chunk of even the public investment is through the housing assistance payment, HAP, the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and leasing money that is being put into the pockets of the private sector.  The Government claims that the State is now going to be the biggest deliverer of housing, but it is not.  Look at the figures.  Some 57% of the plan the Government is proposing is going to come from the private sector.  One just needs to add up the numbers for each of the years.  There will be &euro;142.3 million in public and affordable housing and the rest is coming from the private sector.  The dependence on the private sector, which has led us to the crisis we are now in, is continued in this policy.  That is the truth.</p>  <p>  The affordable and social housing plans can be broken down further.  How much is the Government going to get through Part V, that is, from the private sector?  The Government's answer to a parliamentary question to that effect is that it cannot tell us.  How much of the affordable housing is actually going to be affordable?  How much is the Government hoping to source through Part V, that is, from the private sector?  It cannot tell us.  This is more of the nonsense we have had for the past number of years.</p>  <p>  The Minister talked about protecting tenants.  The test of whether this Government is going to protect tenants is if the tenants in St. Helen's Court, about whom I have been talking for four years and who are threatened with mass eviction by a vulture fund, will be protected from eviction.  They are not so protected now.  I told this Government and its predecessor that this is an example of how vulture funds are unjustly mass evicting tenants who have done nothing wrong and I asked what they are going to do about it.  The answer is zero.  The Government does not want to stand up to the vulture funds.  That is the truth.  The funds were invited in and given tax breaks.  I do not have time because our time allocation is pathetic and I have to hand over to Deputy Barry, but if the Government wants an example of what actual radical, emergency action on housing might look like, it should look at what 57% of the population of Berlin said over the past week.  They said to expropriate the vulture landlords.</p> <p>If such action is justified in Berlin to deal with unaffordable rents and a lack of tenants' rights, it is doubly justified here because all of those vultures, cuckoos and corporate landlords got their property from us via NAMA.  What had a nominal value of &euro;40 billion is probably worth approximately &euro;100 billion now.  They also get tax breaks and day-to-day money through HAP, RAS and leasing.  We are paying at every level but we own nothing.  They charge unaffordable rents and can evict people.  We pay for it, they run away with the profits and tenants are screwed.  That is the reality of what is going on.  I have been asking the Government to raise the income eligibility thresholds for social housing for five years so that people would not be whacked off the list.  Nothing has been done.  A review has been promised for five years.  It goes on.  There is talk, talk and talk but there is no action to deliver affordable public housing, tenants' rights or the security people need because the Government is still dancing to the tune of the big money people who get rich from property.</p></speech>

The housing crisis created by Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and the capitalist housing market will not be solved by Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and the capitalist housing market, even if the Green Party is now included in the mix by way of decoration.  The plan relies on the private sector to deliver 156,000 houses between now and 2030 but you cannot control what you do not own and the State has no control over whether these houses will ever be built, or over the price at which those that are actually built will be sold.  We need an end to market madness.  The business of housing delivery needs to be taken out of the hands of the profiteers and put into the hands of society by way of the nationalisation of the building industry under democratic control.</p><p>The people of Berlin have voted overwhelmingly in favour of taking 250,000 apartments owned and controlled by for-profit corporations into public ownership.  They realise the importance of nationalisation as a tool for tackling their housing crisis.  It is disappointing that both Sinn F&eacute;in and the Social Democrats spurned the opportunity this morning to support similar measures in this country.  Sinn F&eacute;in told <i>The Journal</i>that it was not necessarily the answer to Ireland's housing woes while the Social Democrats dodged the question altogether.  Market madness will never solve Ireland's housing crisis and nationalisation is key to tackling it, alongside a policy of building public housing on public land.  I refer to both council housing and genuinely affordable cost-price housing.  The sooner all who oppose the Government's strategy see that, the better.</p></speech>

At times, it has felt like a debate on the Housing for All programme.  On that issue, when this legislation was being discussed in the summer, there were many debates in this House, although we were in the convention centre at the time.  The issue had a very good airing.  Obviously, some Deputies chose not to support it but ultimately all of us are coming from a good place on this.  We all acknowledge that rents are too high.  First-time buyers cannot access affordable housing and people are waiting years for social housing.  It is clear the market-led system has failed.  Everyone should have access to sustainable, good quality housing to rent or buy at an affordable price.</p>  <p>  Housing for All is a massive State intervention in the housing market that will deliver social and affordable housing.  It will transform how we deliver housing across Ireland.  Housing for All is a plan that will assist the squeezed middle in buying their first homes and ensure that families on lower incomes have access to social housing.  It will transform communities.</p>  <p>  Housing for All will also facilitate a massive increase in the supply of housing.  We often hear about the lack of supply in this Chamber.  The plan commits to the delivery of 300,000 homes over its lifetime.  These will include 90,000 social homes, 36,000 affordable purchase homes, 18,000 cost rental homes and 156,000 new private homes to rent or buy.  The State is taking responsibility for delivering 50% of all housing over the next decade.  People talked about radical change earlier on.  This is a radical step.  It involves a &euro;20 billion investment over the next five years.  By any measure, that is a massive intervention in the market and is unprecedented in the history of the State.</p>  <p>  Housing for All looks beyond housing output and includes commitments to increase rental protections, to eradicate homelessness, to introduce Kenny report-style powers with regard to land value and to establish a commission on housing.</p>  <p>  Housing for All provides a number of pathways to accessing housing.  For first-time buyers, the plan will increase the supply of affordable housing to purchase.  We have seen pilot schemes deliver these homes at &euro;250,000 or under.  The plan will deliver 36,000 new affordable homes, including thousands in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, where we are seeing the first homes being built in Shanganagh.  The first house scheme gives first-time buyers a chance to bridge the funding gap, with the State taking an equity stake in homes. </p>  <p>  For renters, Housing for All creates an entire new affordable cost-rental system whereby people will be able to rent at rates at least 25% below local rents.  We have seen the first of these units let in Enniskerry Road in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown and 200 more are planned in Shanganagh, in Shankill, County Dublin.  It will also improve tenants' rights, place caps on deposits, cap rent increases and introduce tenancies of indefinite duration which will give people certainty in their homes.  For people who need to access social housing, the plan will deliver 90,000 new social homes.  Local authorities will again start building homes, supported by approved housing bodies like Tuath and Respond.</p>  <p>  Housing for All is an ambitious plan, as is recognised across the Chamber, but there will be challenges.  The cost of construction needs to be addressed.  We need to see reductions in input costs such as the &euro;7,500 Irish Water levy; the equivalent is a mere &euro;1,278 in the UK.  We also need to see action on felling licences for timber.  We need to address labour shortages.  I welcome the plan to ramp up apprenticeships that is being pursued by the Minister of State, Deputy Niall Collins.  There are also plans for a national centre of excellence to advance construction technology and methods.</p>  <p>  However, what is perhaps the biggest challenge is in this Chamber.  I call on Deputies to get behind the plan.  As one Opposition Deputy said earlier, we need houses now.  We have a plan. Let us get behind it.  The public will not thank Deputies who continue to play politics with their future.</p></speech>

It is a few short pages long.  There are seven pages of text with just one dollar or euro figure in it.  Meanwhile, the Housing for All plan is comprehensive, fully costed and extremely detailed, as other Deputies have set out.  There are links to two other Sinn F&eacute;in documents at the back but they are even shorter so one should not go looking for too much detail.</p>  <p>  I will talk about the issue of consented land in particular.  This specific and detailed issue is contained in Housing for All, as is a response to it.  Consented land is land that has been zoned and for which planning permission for residential development has been sought and given but on which no homes have been delivered.  Officials from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, local authorities around the country and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage are breaking their backs trying to get land activated.  This is particularly so in the eastern and midlands region.  On page 102 of the Office of the Planning Regulator's annual report for 2020, it is shown that the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly, EMRA, area continues to dominate in 2020, having significantly increased its share of residential units permitted, which rose to 74%.  This represents close to 33,000 units, an increase from 25,000 in 2019.  Further analysis shows that 89% of all apartment units permitted in 2020 were in the same region.  Of that, 64% were in the four Dublin local authority areas. </p>  <p>  The point the office is making is that this suggests that the basis for achieving more compact and sustainable patterns of urban development is there, particularly if the many permissions for higher density development within cities and towns and public transport corridors are activated.  These are the principles of climate-friendly development and the permissions have been granted.  What is going on?  Why are they not either built or in the process of being built?  Let me be clear; I do not buy the financial viability argument for a moment.  We have heard it for some time.  Who would not, at this time, operate a business which pre-sells build-to-sell homes and funds its work on the basis of those sales?  The only reason that we give zoning is to give permission to build homes and any entity that is not in the active business of home delivery, but rather makes efforts to acquire land value, needs to get a grip now or get taxed out of the market.  </p>  <p>  This is a case of tax first, ask later.  There need not be delay.  Chief executives need to get really aggressive about this locally, with no exemptions. Let us accept that developers are on notice, that liability immediately arises where zoning and consents have been given by State entities, and that there is an immediate implicit notification that the clock is running.</p> <p>Let us shorten those assessment notice periods and refund excess taxes if and when we are proved wrong and home delivery is actively occurring.  Our population now exceeds 5 million, up 1 million in 20 years.  They need places to live and different ways to live in different stages of their lives and the consented land needs to be activated.  Thankfully, the LDA has, in this detailed Housing for All plan, been established and put on a statutory footing, notwithstanding Sinn F&eacute;in objecting to it and voting against it.  It has the capacity to get in and activate and underwrite some of those sites at value to the State and a discount to the State and get that stock into affordable homes as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

Houses are not affordable for most and waiting lists are too long.  This document, put together by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and his Department, is our first real chance to address and solve that.  I urge Deputies to get behind it because it is ambitious and financed and has measures that will bring housing affordability within people's reach and solve the social housing waiting lists.  These measures have been outlined by Deputies Carroll MacNeill and Devlin.  I urge people to get behind it and commend the Minister, Department and staff on the extraordinary work they have put into this document.</p>  <p>  It is a long-term plan.  It is financed to the tune of &euro;4 billion per year for the next five years, but there are urgent measures I want to highlight.  One urgent measure is around disability.  There is good policy and text in this document around provision of housing for people with disabilities and the building of accessible housing.  In the short term, there are people with disabilities, wheelchair users in particular, who do not have access to accessible housing.  These are people on social housing lists, in particular.  We need interim measures to ensure local authorities are given finance and backing to source houses and units they can upgrade, finance and make accessible.  That is incredibly important because it is happening throughout the country.  People with disabilities are not able to get accessible housing.  I would like to see that addressed in the short term.</p>  <p>  There is an infrastructural deficit impeding the building of housing.  In west Cork right now, there are applications for 50 to 100 houses being refused because of the lack of infrastructure.  This is addressed in the Housing for All plan, but we need short-term measures to ensure these applications can proceed and be successful.  To ensure that, we need investment in wastewater and drinking water.  Otherwise, we will not see results as fast as we need to see them.</p>  <p>  Over-the-shop premises and on-street premises that have been vacant for years are contained in the Housing for All plan.  They provide a housing provision solution and could be a cornerstone to ensuring we bring vibrancy back to our high streets and main streets in rural towns and villages so we get people living there.  Incentives for landlords and local authorities to take on and refurbish these premises are needed in the short term.</p>  <p>  I commend the Minister, the Department and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, on the work and effort they put into producing this document.</p></speech>

However, the policy would be better called "Housing for the few and not the many".  Since the policy launch, people and independent experts have had a chance to examine the details of the proposals and concluded that those proposals are problematic and, in areas, do not add up.  For example, Social Justice Ireland has criticised the targets set by the Housing for All policy of 33,000 new homes every year, as well as 90,000 social homes over the period from 2021 to 2030.  These targets were established from housing need and demand assessments, HNDAs, and from research conducted by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI.  Social Justice Ireland rightly contends the data from these targets indicates they are insufficient to meet the needs and that substantial numbers of the social housing targets will be delivered through the private sector using HAP.</p>  <p>  This housing plan is developer-led and we have seen in the past how a reliance on the private sector was a central factor in the housing crash which, in turn, led to the economy crashing.  It would not be an exaggeration to say this Government's housing plan is heading in the direction of only one long-term outcome, and that is the crash of the economy, similar to what we experienced in the past.</p>  <p>  This policy also shows there is a wide gap between what the Government regards as affordable and what is realistically affordable for the ordinary person.  The only people who will be happy with the shared equity scheme will be developers.  Deputies would have to be blinkered not to see the scheme will inflate prices and increase developer profits to the detriment of the would-be home purchaser.  The Minister needs to take on board the legitimate criticisms, not just from Sinn F&eacute;in, but from housing experts and other bodies.</p></speech>

The aspirations within the plan include "over 90,000 social homes by the end of 2030, including an average new-build component of over 9,500 social homes" during that time; some "54,000 affordable homes between now and 2030 with yearly targets for the provision of affordable Housing" and a "focus on new builds to provide social homes, with the ending of long-term social housing leasing arrangements through the phasing out of new entrants."  Beyond these targets, what are the headwinds to this policy?  I believe affordability is now the main issue and the main danger to the aspirations of the Minister and the Department.</p> <p>There are the increasing supply chain costs, which may not recede.  I do not believe they will ever go back to pre-pandemic levels.  There is the lack of skilled labour and new entrants to the labour market, which is causing a consequent rise in wages and overheads.  There are significant developer water and electricity connection fees.  Other build costs have escalated quickly, including professional services, insurance finance, interest charges and embedded Irish building supply costs, particularly the cost of materials such as timber, concrete and insulated panels.  The Minister of State might not be aware of this, but if he were to go to get a container of building materials comprising largely of those three items in Poland, he would pay up to 30% less than in Ireland today.  What about the Government's take of fees and taxes in the build costs?  The figure includes VAT, developer levies and other fees, which can be up to 25% of a new build cost.  Perhaps the Department might devise a mechanism whereby a tax credit is retrospectively awarded to first-time buyers to assist purchase but in a timeframe that would not lead to developer price escalation.</p> <p> I refer to the town and rural regeneration schemes.  Getting existing property into habitable use should be a primary goal of the policy.  However, how are planning applications and requirements to be fast-tracked?  How will objections be dealt with?  How should listed buildings be dealt with while still incentivising owners to develop or is the plan to CPO these properties?  If so, in what timeframe will that deliver new home opportunities?  In addition, rural planning and minimum density guidelines have not been confirmed in respect of the new plan, and local authorities are now drafting their development plans in these areas.  We need to see certainty in respect of preferential planning to continue for families to be able to build on their own lands.  This should be extended to nieces and nephews.  Many rural villages cannot avail of minimum density requirements, and if discretion is not offered in this area, erosion of rural communities will continue.  Areas in my constituency such as Ballyduff Upper, Ballysaggart, Dunhill and Clonea-Power will not have new builds.  If we cannot have a certain amount of one-off housing in those villages, they will die on their feet, as they are dying at present.</p> <p> The local authority purchase scheme, whereby the local authority proposes to take an equity share, is be supported by a Government affordable housing scheme.  I understand that the Department is using a rolling 12-month average build cost to estimate the support it will provide to each local authority.  Given the rapid change in building supply costs, I ask the Minister of State's officials to take a second look at this analysis; otherwise, local authorities such as mine in Waterford will struggle to deliver on this policy, given the recent rapid price movements in the construction sector in the south east.</p></speech>

This has happened in large part because Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Sinn F&eacute;in have changed the way in which the D&aacute;il operates, meaning that now most of those due to speak for those three parties have spoken before Opposition parties such as mine can get to speak.  This is despite the fact that some of these guys have an opportunity to speak to the Ministers at their parliamentary party meetings anyway.</p>  <p>  Vacant homes is probably one of the biggest scandals of the housing crisis over recent years.  It is incredible that right now the Government does not know how many vacant homes exist in the State.  Let that sink in for a second.  We are in a housing crisis that has been going on for years.  Fine Gael has been in government for more than ten years while Fianna F&aacute;il has been in government for the past year and a half and supported the previous Government, yet the Government does not know how many vacant homes there are in this country.  We have the highest rents and house prices in Europe.  We have spiralling homelessness and people waiting on housing lists.  The vacancy element is still not understood by the Government.  It is not even that the Government is acting on it to change it; it does not know how many vacant homes exist in this State.</p>  <p>  I asked the Minister for Finance last July, when he was implementing his new local property tax, LPT, Bill, whereby he was reforming that tax, whether he would levy a higher tax on vacant houses so we could mobilise some of those homes into use.  The Minister said the Government did not know how many houses were vacant and did not know why they were vacant.  As a result, he will carry out some investigation or research into this before he will decide whether to introduce a tax on those vacant homes.  It is so frustrating to most of the people in the country to listen to a sentence like that, which exudes a complete lack of urgency, and then to look at the housing crisis as it exists for most people, which is a matter of urgency.  That chasm between the Government's understanding of the problem and where the people are is incredible.</p>  <p>  The Minister is on record as having said he does not believe that a tax on vacant homes will be a game changer.  There are no silver bullets in the housing crisis.  There are a large numbers of levers that, when all pulled, will have a positive effect on the housing market, and vacancy is one of the biggest of those levers.</p>  <p>  The GeoView directory, which was done in quarter 4 of 2020, takes the number of homes that are considered vacant by An Post.  It shows that there are 92,000 vacant homes in this State.  Some 4.6% of the housing stock is vacant.  In at least ten towns and villages in my constituency, streets, including the main streets, are festooned with vacant homes.  This is happening at a time people are in crisis.  The frustrating part of this is that dealing with vacancy is probably the quickest solution to some elements of the housing crisis.  It is much faster to get a home that is 80% built into use than going from design on paper to a complete build of a new home.  It costs a lot less to do the job as well.  In the context of the Green Party, getting those vacant homes back into use would have the lowest carbon impact.  Still there is no urgency on the part of the Government to do this at all.  It strikes me at times that the location of Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael is now more in Dublin than in the rest of the country.  Is it because of their lack of understanding of what is happening in the rest of the country that they are slow in fixing the vacancy issue?  It is a disgraceful dereliction of duty on the part of the Minister, given the housing crisis.</p>  <p>  I had only four and a half minutes to speak on this.  I would have loved to have mentioned a lot more, but if there is one thing the Government should set about doing with energy, it is fixing the problem of vacancy because it will also rejuvenate those towns.  It will get them back to a vibrancy they have been missing for a long time.</p></speech>

However, there is a lie being perpetuated here by many people on the Opposition benches tonight and in recent months.  The lie is that these caps on affordable houses are actual prices.  In my case, the cap will be &euro;450,000 in Cork city and &euro;400,000 the county.  I have listened to Opposition Members over recent months perpetuate this lie.  One affordable housing scheme has been launched in Cork city because Cork City Council took the initiative to get ahead of the legislation and to launch its own scheme.  A two-bed house is &euro;175,000 and a three-bed house is &euro;215,000.  This myth and this lie that has been perpetuated by people in the Opposition needs to be called out for what it is.  When I turn on my local radio station, I hear that lie regarding the affordable housing plan being given every day.</p>  <p>  As I said at the outset, I am a fair-minded person.  Am I saying that everything in the contents of this report is perfect?  No - far from it.  I myself have issues with a number of items in it.  At the same time, however, I need to promote some of the positives from it.  Fianna F&aacute;il agreed as an Opposition party that we would abolish the SHD process.  While that is taking a bit longer than we would like, it is being done.  It is being delivered in this plan and SHDs are being phased out.  We also gave a commitment that we would treble spending moving from the Rebuilding Ireland programme to this current plan, and we have done that.  That is costed and in the document.  We have also provided for a new cost-rental model and it might not be for everybody.  It is certainly not for me.  As a person with a young family, I want to set down my roots.  I want to stay in my locality and buy my own home.  However, a cost-rental model is now being launched.  Many of those homes have been announced in Dublin in recent months and they will come to Cork as well shortly, with an announcement due in my town of Glanmire.</p> <p> There are challenges, which a number of speakers referred to, including in regard to Irish Water and infrastructure.  As Deputy Shanahan said, the inflationary cost of building homes is probably the main issue at this time.  This is a plan for the delivery of affordable housing.  The great difficulty I have with it, and this is a question I have put to the Minister and both Ministers of State in the Department, concerns what implications those exorbitant costs might have for the deliverability of the plan in respect of the number of social and affordable units provided.  There are several actions we can take to rectify that problem.  We can consider changes to the standards and regulations, which are adding to the costs of building in other sectors.  For example, &euro;56,000 for a water pump is a charge many people will be expected to face in retrofitting their homes in the coming years.  It would be just as easy to retrofit an oil heating system for &euro;5,000, which is a fraction of the cost, and source the energy needed from biofuels and other sustainable energy sources.</p> <p> As I said at the outset, we need to dispel the myth that this plan is anti-tenant and anti-homeowner; it is far from it.  In fact, it is the first constructive attempt at addressing the housing problem in the past decade.  That needs to be acknowledged.</p></speech>

I was delighted to see a number of one-bedroom homes included in that development, particularly from the perspective of accessibility for people with disabilities but also because we need to build more one-bedroom and two-bedroom units in a context where people are living longer and may require smaller homes later in life.  It is important that Housing for All should address that need as soon as possible.</p><p>I have spoken to the Minister of State previously about how delighted we are in the south east to be getting a technological university.  We are exceptionally lucky in County Carlow that we can access two excellent third-level colleges.  However, there is going to be a massive lack of housing supply in the area.  The drawback of the presence of a technological university will be felt by people who are on the local authority list, in receipt of HAP and finding it hard to find accommodation to rent.  Every September, people come into my clinics saying they cannot find a house and there is nothing to rent.  That needs to be addressed and it requires looking at supply.  We have had 32 cases of homelessness in Carlow in the past few weeks, which is unacceptable.  We need to ensure no one is homeless.  Everyone should have a home.</p><p>I have concerns about the HAP scheme in that people are finding it hard going now because they are paying landlords and local authorities so much.  Many are on the breadline.  Then there are the people who do not qualify for the housing list, who are also finding it really hard.  As the Minister of State will be aware, Carlow is one of the local authorities that has a cap on eligibility for applicants to the list.  That is another issue.  We need to examine the ceiling to qualify for acceptance on local authority housing lists.  Previous speakers referred to affordable housing.  Provision of such housing is crucial but we have none of it in Carlow.  We must make sure that what is set out in the plan is delivered within a quick timeframe.  I have nine or ten cases of people contacting my office who would be delighted to get an affordable house, but there seem to be problems with wastewater and all those issues.  We need to address all those problems.</p><p>In addition on the issue of affordability, according to <i>daft.ie</i>, County Carlow experienced Leinster's second-highest house price increase this year, at a whopping 14.4%, with the average house price now standing at &euro;226,391.  Outside Dublin, we are all seeing a large rise in prices in rural towns such as my own in Carlow-Kilkenny.  I know the Minister and the Minister of State are committed to dealing with this but delivery is key if we are to deal quickly with the lack of supply.</p><p>In the time remaining, I want to speak about an issue I have raised several times with both the Minister and the Minister of State.  Capital funding for Carlow County Council is down by nearly &euro;3 million annually.  Indeed, it gets one of the lowest allocations of capital funding in the State from central government.  That is unacceptable and everyone in Carlow is paying the price for it.  Services are not being delivered because those who deliver them cannot afford to do so.  There is a major issue with staffing and service providers cannot afford to pay staff.  The only people who will suffer in the long run are the people of Carlow.  I am asking the Minister of State, as a representative of Carlow-Kilkenny, to secure more capital funding for Carlow County Council and make sure it gets the staff it deserves.</p></speech>

Many of the points I have heard from Opposition Deputies today are simply that - opposition for opposition's sake.  That helps no one who wants to own his or her own home.  Listening to the debate, one could be forgiven for thinking Sinn F&eacute;in voted against the Government's Affordable Housing Bill.  In fact, the party's Members voted for it.  As for the legislation to establish the LDA, the body charged with the delivery of public homes on public lands, they opposed it without even attempting to shape or amend it.  Their opposition to the shared equity scheme stands in total contradiction to their stance on the similar scheme operating in Northern Ireland, which party representatives there oversee.  Sinn F&eacute;in's opposition to the help-to-buy scheme did not help the 20,000 people who need support to purchase a home.</p>  <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in says it wants to solve the housing crisis but there is a big difference between what party members say and what they do.  Local authorities are tasked with delivering homes on public lands and councillors are asked to support them in that objective.  Fine Gael members on South Dublin County Council, which is my local authority, have voted in favour of 96% of proposed homes on council lands.  Sinn F&eacute;in members have voted for only 44% so they voted against 56% of houses the council proposed to build on council-owned land.  In fact, they have opposed almost 1,500 homes that the chief executive of South Dublin County Council has sought for approval.  That figure is close to 6,000 when the numbers for the whole of County Dublin are included.  Sinn F&eacute;in does not look like a party that is serious abut building homes.  It does not look like a party that is serious about delivering homes on public land.  Indeed, its stance looks an awful lot like opposition for opposition's sake.  The latest tactic of the party's councillors seems to be to abstain altogether and refuse to use the voice and vote that people elected them to use.  We saw this in Tallaght just a few weeks ago when Sin F&eacute;in councillors refused to vote either way on a proposal for 620 homes, 80% of which would be social or affordable.  In the lead-up to that vote, they told people they were against the project.  When it became obvious that they would not get away with a free ride in opposing it, they abstained, leaving their constituents wondering where they stand.</p>  <p>  The Opposition's ambition for solving the housing crisis does not measure up against its record in my local authority.  There is a big difference between what Sinn F&eacute;in says and what it does.  As I speak, there are boots on the ground in Kilcarberry, Clondalkin, where more than 1,000 new homes are being constructed, in excess of 300 of which will be social housing.  Sinn F&eacute;in voted against that development.  Solving the housing crisis requires ambition, not opposition.  Our ambition is set out in Housing for All.  It is a radical, realistic and costed plan, underpinned by record State investment.  It will help families to access affordable, high-quality housing for purchase or rent.  It has been broadly welcomed by NGOs working with families who need homes, but surprise, surprise, it is being opposed by Sinn F&eacute;in.  To reach our targets, unprecedented levels of funding are being provided for housing.  Over the next five years alone, more than &euro;20 billion will be made available.  That represents a doubling of the budget, with &euro;4 billion to be invested in housing every year.  Housing for All is a costed and comprehensive plan.  It provides multimillion euro funding on a multi-annual basis and it is going to deliver homes.  At the end of the day, that is all people care about.  When I speak to my constituents, they are not concerned about who builds houses or what ideology is behind their delivery.  They just want good-quality and affordable homes.  That is what Housing for All will deliver.</p></speech>

I sincerely hope this plan will, as its name suggests, deliver housing for all.  Such delivery is badly needed in this country.  We have a housing crisis throughout our cities and we certainly have a massive crisis in west Cork.  Last Friday, 12 people came into my clinic in Bandon, seven of whom have a housing issue.  Two of them are homeless.</p> <p>This new thing of couch-surfing is very popular now in west Cork.  I only heard about it in the past six or seven months.  Although housing has always been an issue, the problem is growing and I do not see a solution to it.  I sincerely hope there is a solution.</p> <p> I do not like to condemn something until it is given time to work but we certainly need to look at the current housing situation in towns and villages such as Ballinadee, Ballinspittle, Goleen and Ballydehob in west Cork.  There are fabulous places to live in these towns and fabulous opportunities that have never been developed.  Why are grants not being given to get people living over shops or pubs?  There should be grants for people who want to develop their town or village but cannot afford to do so right now.  Consideration should be given to grants for people who own derelict houses.  If those people avail of a grant in respect of the derelict property, then, obviously, they must let the house afterwards.  They should be given tax relief if they do so.  That is how we can get the system up and running but it has not been done up to now.</p> <p> I have been very critical of the planning regulations, rules and laws that are in place because planning is a no-go area in west Cork.  There are young people who want to build a home on the family farm and help to rebuild rural communities but they are not being allowed to do so for silly and nonsensical reasons.  The whole thing needs to be shredded.  Local authorities and local planning rules will have to be changed completely.</p> <p> In west Cork, people are trying to work from home and get their lives together through this damn pandemic.  In fairness, the local mobile phone company, Three Ireland, put up a new mast in Gaggan, near Bandon.  The Department has encouraged the erection of little masts to provide broadband.  However, the planning authority in Cork County Council has now decided it wants the mast pulled down.  It is an insane situation.  One cannot even see the masts in Gaggan, just outside Bandon town.  A significant number of people will be insane about this when it is revealed that the local planning authority has turned down the mast.  The decision has gone to appeal before An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The whole point I am trying to make is that anywhere I drive in Dublin city, there are masts everywhere.  I have no issue with that.   That is the way it has to be because life has to progress.  The mast near Bandon could not be seen but the planning authority decided to object to it.  We are in a dire situation in respect of planning and somebody in the Government needs to wake up.  If we want people to return to rural communities and live there, the Government has to decide to change the planning rules.</p></speech>

I want to wish Bobby Aylward, our former colleague from that county, well.   He is going through a bad patch at the moment.  Is an-chara liom agus le gach &eacute;inne &eacute;.  He is a former colleague of the Minister.</p>  <p>  I previously asked the Minister of State to come to see one of the great Irish houses near where I live, in Knocklofty.  Will he please come down to see it?  It is part of our national heritage.  Knocklofty House is being plundered.  I was at one of the houses on the site last night.  It was a very sad occasion.  I was shocked to see the state of it.  The Minister promised to come down in September but September is nearly over.  "Cad a dh&eacute;anfaimid feasta gan adhmad?  T&aacute; deireadh na gcoillte ar l&aacute;r."  Cad a dh&eacute;anfaimid feasta gan adhmad anois?  N&iacute;l p&iacute;osa adhmad ar bith le f&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  This housing policy is great on paper but I am sick and tired of it.  I was on the committee for five years and I just walked away from it.  If thought could build houses, there would be no one homeless.  Who would have thought there would be so many homeless families?  There are 753 families homeless at the moment.  That there are 2,120 homeless children and 8,212 homeless adults is a shocking indictment.  In response, the Government gives us reports like this.</p>  <p>  I am not going to play politics like Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Sinn F&eacute;in did the other night.  There is not even one Sinn F&eacute;in Deputy present for this debate, which is amazing.  They would build sandcastles in the sky for you, no bother, but none of them ever drew a plan or built a house in their life or was part of a voluntary housing association or anything else.</p>  <p>  The Government needs to go back to basics.  It needs to go back to voluntary housing associations and support them.  I did it myself with voluntary lay people.  We have bureaucracy now and rules and guidelines and all kinds of rubbish and regulations.  Many of them are the result of the actions of the Minister's party.  The Minister of State, Senator Hackett, is sitting there and will not allow a tree to be cut down.  One cannot get a bit of timber now.  The price has gone up.  A supplier will not give a price more than three days in advance because the price is going up and up.  The Government is fooling itself by hiring extra experts.  A man who plants a tree should be allowed to harvest it in the same way as a man who plants spuds, beet, miscanthus or anything else can harvest them.  God's law is that one reaps what one sows.  What the hell kind of laws do we have here that we will not allow that?  The price of oil has gone up.  The Government closed all the peat plants.  The price of insulation has gone through the roof because of the increase in the cost of oil.  It is the same with everything else.  The Government is talking about other things instead of sorting out those problems.</p>  <p>  I refer to families trying to get planning permission in rural Ireland.  Someone asked about getting planning permission for nieces and nephews a while ago.  One cannot even get it for sons or daughters.  It is a mockery.  To think that we are a herding people.  Let us take the situation in cities and the small towns such as Clonmel, Tipperary, Carrick-on-Suir, Cashel and all the rest.  Mrs. Mary O'Gorman, who is in her 80th year, is the aon duine amh&aacute;in, the only person living on O'Connell Street in Clonmel.  It used to be a busy, bustling business street but it was also a living town for many families.  There is only one person left living on the street.  All the buildings are empty, whether upstairs, downstairs or whatever.  Many of the shopfronts are empty too.  We have been talking about doing something with those schemes and centres for so long.  Talk will not sort this out and neither will these plans or announcements.</p>  <p>  I understand the plan was delayed several times because of ideological disagreements.  There is no longer any ideological difference between Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael.  They are all the one - joined at the hip.  Fad&oacute;, fad&oacute;, there were arguments outside church gates and speakers at podiums.  I remember the goings-on at election time and everything else.  Now they are all the one.</p>  <p>  The Government needs to start listening to the people and to have compassion but, above allow, it needs to allow people who have a site and can build a house to do so.  Then it needs to make building a house affordable.  It is not affordable.  The prices are going up by the hour.  There are no apprenticeships.  All the apprentices who are out on sites at the moment will be going back into college.  Who will be left to do the work?  There is no one there.  Many of the non-nationals have left and gone home.  There are fundamental problems.  This Housing for All plan will not deliver.  It is more likely to be housing for none.  A fundamental change is needed.</p></speech>

I wish to very much focus on that issue.  All Members accept there is a dire need for housing.  My county of Clare is no different from any other in that regard.  I wish to focus on dereliction because many Deputies spoke about the number of derelict houses across rural Ireland.  The only place in which one does not see widespread dereliction is Dublin.  Even then there is dereliction in parts of Dublin and certainly there is a significant space not utilised over shops, business premises, etc.  In fairness, the Housing for All plan mentions dereliction quite a bit, but when one drills down into it and looks at the concrete steps to be taken, one sees that dereliction is only mentioned once in the chapter dealing with the table of actions - it is one of the last chapters of the plan - and that reference is in the context of harnessing European regional development funding to tackle vacancy and dereliction in towns.</p>  <p>  The lead is to be taken by the regional assemblies.  I have never served on a local authority but, as far as I know, regional assemblies are comprised of members of local authorities.  Local authorities already have extensive powers under the Derelict Sites Act 1990 in respect of dereliction.  Under the Act, local authorities have a duty to take reasonable steps to ensure that any lands situated in their functional area do not become derelict.  They can serve a notice on the owner of a derelict site.  The Minister can direct the local authority to serve a notice in respect of a site.  The Minister can make a direction in respect of any land on the derelict sites register that is owned by a statutory body.  Local authorities have the power to acquire, by agreement or compulsorily, any derelict site in their functional area and use it for whatever purpose they wish.  Local authorities have the power to issue a derelict sites levy.  That is a considerable range of powers.  It may be the case that there is very little about derelict sites in the Housing for All plan because there are extensive powers on the Statute Book.</p>  <p>  However, very little is being done with those powers across the country.  I tabled a series of parliamentary questions on this issue earlier this month  I asked about the number of derelict sites registered for each local authority, the number of notices issued under section 11 by each local authority in 2019, 2020 and 2021, the number of directions made by the Minister and his predecessors under section 12, the number of directions made by the Minister and his predecessors under section 13, and the number of derelict sites acquired by each local authority under the powers provided to them.</p> <p>The table is quite depressing.  Notwithstanding all of the powers and the number of people who are looking for social housing in every county in Ireland, we see that very little is being done.</p> <p> In my own county of Clare, four notices were issued and no levies were collected. County Clare is probably among the poorer performing counties, but it is by no means the worst and by no means unique.  Everybody agrees that dereliction is a problem and we need to bring these properties back into the housing stock, but nobody seems to do anything about it.  That is not to take a cut at any particular side.  The Government parties do not control the local authorities.</p></speech>

I will do my best to remain focused in those three minutes.</p>  <p>  I have with me the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness from 2016.  The only difference I see between that plan and the new plan is that two Deputies introduced that plan and three Deputies are introducing this plan.  In the previous plan, we were told by the then Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, that, "A truly ambitious social housing programme of 47,000 units to 2021 will be delivered with funding of &euro;5.35 billion."  It did not happen.  The former Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, told us the range of options set out in the plan was ambitious.  I also have with me the new plan.  I read both plans, so sad is my life, to try to see if there was something positive I could say, which I can.  There are some positive initiatives in the plan.  My difficulty is that the Government is following the same failed model.  We are being accused of ideology.  I do not think the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is going to listen to me, but I was elected to give voice to those who think differently and who want to give constructive criticism and show there is a different way.</p>  <p>  The Minister made a speech today.  In case we were in any doubt, he told us that this is a plan for the so-called squeezed middle.  I hope the Minister of State hears that.  He is part of this Government that has a plan for the squeezed middle.  In the Minister's foreword to the plan, he repeatedly uses the phrase "squeezed middle" and keeps telling us about it, in case we were in any doubt.  In two and a half pages of a foreword, he mentions the squeezed middle four times.  He then tells us who the squeezed middle are.  In case we do not know who they are, we are told they are the "people who work hard and play by the rules but seem to have nothing to show for it at the end of the day".  Can you imagine that as a basis for a housing plan for all to inspire confidence?  How could something as divisive and terrible as that inspire confidence in us?</p>  <p>  I think about beautiful Galway city.  T&aacute; me thar a bheith br&oacute;d&uacute;il as.  Rugadh agus t&oacute;gadh m&eacute; ann.  T&aacute; g&eacute;arch&eacute;im &uacute;af&aacute;sach ann at&aacute; ag lean&uacute;int ar aghaidh bliain i ndiaidh bliana.  We look at that and we see the homeless figures.  Nationally, 8,212 people are in emergency accommodation.  In Galway, there are 241 homeless adults in emergency accommodation.  House prices have gone up by 14.3%.  People are on a social housing waiting list going back to 2005.  A housing task force that was set up in 2019 has never once produced an annual report that I have had sight of.  One of the nine terms of reference stated it would produce such a report.  We are being accused of ideology.  The ideology is on the part of Government that believes the market will provide.  The market has utterly failed to provide.  There is a role for the market, but the State has a role to play in conveying the strong message that we are not talking about a home as a commodity.  A home is the most basic unit and we must provide public homes on public land that will bring down the price of houses.  The Government is artificially keeping house prices up.</p>  <p>  I understand that more than &euro;1 billion will go into HAP alone.  I welcome the fact the Government is going to phase the scheme out gradually, but it was one of the biggest mistakes.  When there is talk about billions going into social housing, it is going into the private landlords' pockets.</p></speech>

Truth be known, the same argument should, and can, be made on healthcare, namely, that public moneys should be spent on public healthcare services and private medicine should not come before the public good.  Yet that is not happening because we have a deeply two-tier health service, where private medicine and the private sector is embedded in the healthcare system.</p><p>First we must appreciate the scale of the problem that faces us.  We do that in our motion, which I am proposing today.  The figures are so stark that it is hard for people even to comprehend them.  More than 900,000 people are on some form of health waiting list, either waiting to see a consultant or waiting for a hospital procedure.  The big jump in those figures came before Covid, as we know, but has accelerated due to Covid.  Of the more than 900,000 people who are awaiting treatment, 210,000 have been waiting for more than 18 months and 31,000 of them are children.  There is a human story behind each and every one of those people who are waiting for treatment.</p><p>I conducted a survey a number of weeks ago, which I published, in which I asked those who are on waiting lists, sometimes for years, what their experience is.  I heard many stories from parents of children with scoliosis who are waiting years for treatment, often in pain.  I heard stories of people who are waiting years for orthopaedic treatment and for other procedures, including ear, nose and throat, ENT, and ophthalmic procedures, in areas where we know waiting times are very high.  I also heard of the human consequences of people waiting that long.  It has an impact on their mental health, their overall physical well-being and their ability to work.  Many of them are out of work for too long.  My point is there are human consequences and real consequences for people when we have the kind of waiting lists we have.</p><p>I wish to go through the Minister's amendment to the Sinn F&eacute;in motion.  I must say it is weak, to say the least, and it is lame in terms of the excuses the Minister gives.  I will provide some examples of this.  In the amendment, the Minister talks up some of what was done last year.  I accept that investment was made in healthcare last year.  The amendment mentions that 795 acute beds were put into the system this year, with a target of 938 that will be reached by the end of the year.  The Government funded 1,150 beds last year.  Therefore, 204 of those beds will not be delivered.  In respect of ICU beds, we had 600 ICU beds in 2009.  Even if the Minister delivers what he has said he will deliver, we will fall way behind on where we were then.</p><p>The amendment mentions community intervention teams.  What the Minister forgets to mention in his amendment is that of the &euro;150 million he provided for enhanced community services last year, only around half of that money is anticipated to have been spent.  The Minister took to his feet last year and said we were going to recruit 14,500 people into the Irish healthcare system.  That figure has now been revised down to around 7,500.  Only around half of the staff promised by the Minister have been recruited.  He cannot hide behind Covid, or anything else for that matter.  He was the one who made that promise.  Covid was with us when the Minister put those figures out there, provided the funding and made those commitments.  He simply has not delivered.</p><p>In the remainder of my time, I must say there are huge challenges in healthcare and there are big decisions that have to be made.  We have had high-profile resignations in Sl&aacute;intecare, which I reference in my motion.</p> <p>That cannot be seen as a vote of confidence in the Government's ability to deliver the big changes.</p> <p> One of the areas where we must collectively stand our ground concerns public consultant contracts.  Consultants who work in the public system have to do public work.  The other big changes, involving removing private medicine from public healthcare and moving to universal GP care, also must happen, but they are happening at a snail's pace.  They are not happening anywhere near quick enough.  If we do not make these big changes, more and more people will become disillusioned and put on waiting lists.</p> <p> On the Government's promise to have multi-annual waiting list targets and a plan to make this happen, unless there is a centralised referral system it will not work.  Unless there is an integrated waiting list management system, it will not work.  Unless the capacity is put in place, it will not work.  I could wallpaper this room, as could the Minister, with all the waiting list management plans of successive Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael Governments.  These plans have not worked because they were not backed up with capacity.</p> <p> The Minister should think about the victims of long waiting lists.  Those children and adults who are waiting years for treatment are the ones for whom we have to deliver.  They are the people who are at the front and centre of why we moved this motion.</p></speech>

There was a beautiful view looking out over Castlemaine Harbour.  She has been battling and beating cancer for the past ten years.  She has a young family, one of whom returned home from school as we spoke.  Every three weeks, she receives treatment in University Hospital Kerry for three hours with six or seven others.  She knows all the staff by their first names.  She had the height of praise for everybody in the unit.  The people of Kerry are very proud of all the nurses who work there.  The woman is comforted by the backup services in the university hospital, including the physiotherapy and scanning facilities.  It seemed strange to me until recently that the unit has been borrowing wards from other departments.  The most vulnerable are affected.  What awaits the woman with the amazing view are anxiety and concern because it seems that, rather than investing in space to treat those affected, the authorities will outsource treatment to a private hospital.  I do not know the financial cost but there will be no ancillary services in that hospital.  Nurses say there will be a risk to health and safety and that if people become unwell, they will have to be blue-lighted from one end of the town to the other.  Is the Government waiting for a charity to pick up the pieces for the unit?</p>  <p>  Recently, in the past couple of days, there has been more depressing news from University Hospital Kerry.  Surgeons there sent a letter to GPs stating facilities are not available there anymore.  Elective surgeries have been curtailed for four weeks running.  Things are falling apart.  We in the office are receiving call after call about people having to wait for an hour for an ambulance.  The situation is not sustainable.  Nurses who have given their heart and soul to the hospital are leaving, and surgeons have written to GPs stating 2,200 patients are waiting to be seen in the surgical outpatients department.  They say protected surgical daybeds have been taken over for emergency purposes.  The also say nursing and infrastructure shortages mean the service the people of Kerry deserve cannot be provided any longer.  Non-urgent surgical referrals can no longer be accepted.  I ask the Government to do something about that.</p></speech>

They are going blind and their illnesses are getting much worse as they wait, wait and wait again to be seen by a consultant in the first instance.  Having been seen by a consultant, they must wait, wait and wait again for the procedure.  For those in need of a single hip replacement, for example, the waiting period is so long that their good hip becomes banjaxed.  Therefore, instead of one hip needing replacement, both need to be done.  Can you imagine your hip being so bad that it takes 20 minutes to get up the stairs to bed or to the toilet?  What about the fact that the strain from the stair climbs or crawls and the constant excruciating pain, the lack of mobility and the constant use of strong painkillers often result in other ailments, including heart attacks, ulcers, obesity and mental health strain.  I know many constituents who have suffered in this way, including a cancer survivor.</p>  <p>  Others face blindness while languishing on the waiting list to see an eye specialist.  That is before they are even put on the four-year-long cataract waiting list.  These incidents are scandalous enough but for our children on the waiting list, the circumstances are a living disgrace.  Shame on the HSE for overseeing, or maybe not overseeing, a waiting list with nearly 100,000 children who are awaiting operations and medical procedures.  The 100,000 do not include children awaiting an assessment for speech and language therapy and much more.</p>  <p>  N&iacute;or ch&oacute;ir don Aire an mille&aacute;n a chur ar Covid n&oacute; ar ionsaithe ar ch&oacute;ras r&iacute;omhaireachta an HSE.

There are more than 20,000 people in a county of 160,000 on the waiting list.  That amounts to one in eight.  I am not even including Sligo hospital, whose waiting list includes people from south Donegal.  That is a damning indictment of Government after Government.</p>  <p>  The issue for Letterkenny University Hospital is that despite its being the sixth largest hospital in the State, and its having had more than 24,000 inpatients before the pandemic, it is ranked 13th when it comes to the budget.  Some allowances can be made for the fact that the major hospitals in Dublin and Galway are dealing with additional specialities but how can we explain the circumstances whereby budgets in the major hospitals are two to three times greater per capita than in Letterkenny University Hospital?  I was asked to get these figures by senior hospital staff in Letterkenny because they felt the only way to get to the bottom of this was through parliamentary questions.  What is happening is a scandal.  There has to be acceptance in the HSE that Donegal is treated like a backwater.  It means real impacts in Donegal, where people are forced to travel huge distances for basic procedures unnecessarily.  We should have the specialities in Letterkenny University Hospital, the sixth largest hospital in the State.  People should not have to travel long distances.  This is about equality of access to healthcare.  I ask the Minister to examine this.  I am going to send to him directly all the statistics I have gathered on this.</p></speech>

It is shameful that almost 900,000 citizens of this State are languishing on waiting lists just to get the treatment they need at this very moment.  It is good to see the Minister of State responsible for mental health present.  I am my party's spokesperson on mental health.  We are all aware that early intervention is key in a child's development.</p>  <p>  The latest figures I have on waiting lists indicate there are still more than 2,500 children waiting for a child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, appointment.  Almost 9,000 children are waiting for a primary care psychology appointment, which is not good enough.  To have testimonies in the debate on this motion, we asked people to contact us and outline their real-life experiences.  Some people cannot even get on a waiting list.  One response we got was from an individual who stated their daughter was referred to the local psychological service only to get a letter back stating there was no service in her area.  This is not good enough.</p>  <p>  We have had announcements from the Government on additional funding for mental health services.  Back in February, the Taoiseach announced, to much fanfare, &euro;10 million in additional funding for a Covid response to mental health issues.  Not a penny of this has been spent yet.  We are in a mental health emergency, yet not one single euro of the money announced has been spent.</p>  <p>  I got a response to a parliamentary question this week on the money allocated for Sharing the Vision and the early recommendations in that respect.  A sum of &euro;23 million was allocated for Sharing the Vision in the budget for 2021.  To date, &euro;2.7 million has been spent.  That is less than 10% of the money allocated.  We need to make sure this money is not rewashed, redressed in a new shirt and tie, and used for the forthcoming budget; we need to make sure it is available and ring-fenced for the people who really need it.</p> <p>We were in a mental health crisis pre-Covid; we are now in the mental health emergency.  This Government needs to get the finger out and start putting things into action.  If it is announcing money for mental health supports and services, we need to make sure those resources go to the services that really need them.</p></speech>

The waiting lists are not of their making.  It is not their fault but it is the staff and patients who suffer.  I believe the Minister has no plan for this.  There is no direction.</p>  <p>  I have raised this issue with the Minister in the Chamber since he was appointed, especially the trolley crisis in University Hospital Limerick, UHL, which is ongoing.  This month will see almost 1,000 people on trolleys in UHL.  I plead with the Minister again to come and have a look at that.</p>  <p>  As has been said, more than 900,000 people are on waiting lists throughout the State.  The figures for UHL are particularly stark with 43,656 people currently on outpatient waiting lists for a consultation.  More than 23,000 of them have been waiting for more than one year, and of these, 19,000 have been waiting for more than 18 months.  This totally unacceptable.  We can get lost in the figures but each and every one of those is a person whose life is being impacted by his or her ailments.</p>  <p>  Last week, I received a response from a parliamentary question I tabled regarding one such individual, a woman in her mid-60s who is suffering from severe cartilage damage to her knee.  It inhibits her movement and restricts her lifestyle.  Her status or grading on the waiting list is "urgent".  For me, the word "urgent" means she needs her consultation promptly, yet we are advised she will be waiting for 30 months.  How can the Minister stand over somebody waiting 30 months for an appointment that is deemed urgent?  She will endure 30 months of pain and limited movement.  She will be 70 years old by the time she sees her consultant.  This is an absolute disgrace.</p>  <p>  Recently, a consultant who was on duty at UHL rang me to ask if I could intervene to get a scan for one of his patients.  How bonkers is it that a consultant in the hospital has to ring a local parliamentarian to get a scan done in the hospital?  There is something seriously wrong there.  The Minister needs to intervene.</p>  <p>  We need to see a centralised referral system coupled with an integrated waiting system to manage this.  The planning and additions will allow for patients to be seen at different hospitals as capacity allows.  As I said, UHL consistently has problems with overcrowding.</p>  <p>  This month today, we have almost 1,000 people treated on trolleys in the hospital.  I refer back to the waiting lists and categories of appointments on which people are waiting.  There are so many, and of course the type of appointment which some will be waiting for will be the most important for those individuals.  One figure that stood out for me was that of maxillofacial outpatient appointments in UHL.  These are people with physical injuries to the face.  Some 2,891 people have been awaiting such appointments for 18 months or more.</p>  <p>  I do not want to be all negative.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in have a plan for how to fix the health service.  We know the direction to take.  It will require significant but necessary investment.  We cannot have our sick being treated like this and we cannot leave our healthcare professionals working in such challenging conditions.</p></speech>

I am very conscious, especially in Sligo University Hospital, that we have a situation where people are waiting on wards but they cannot get in.  They are being sent to a four-bed ward with six beds in it.  It does not have the capacity or the staff.  It is the same in the emergency department, which is overrun and has not got the staff.  This issue needs to be dealt with.  At the moment, in the Saolta University Health Care Group, there are 54 vacant consultant posts.  I am sure that is the same in every other region in the country.  This is the core of the problem.  The investment is not being put in to employ the necessary staff to deal with this issue.</p>  <p>  Our hospitals are all running at more than 100% capacity most of the time.  Internationally, it is said that they should be at approximately 70% capacity to deal with the surge, when it comes.  The problem we have here is that the private system is being used to back up a public system that is in decline.  The Minister needs to get a grip on this and put that public system back on the agenda as being the priority.  That is clearly what needs to happen.  There needs to be a centralised system for waiting lists to ensure people can be seen as quickly as possible in whatever hospital there is an available appointment in.  We have solutions and we need to have those solutions delivered.  As long as the Government continues to go down the track of using the private system to back up the public system, however, it is not going to work.  There needs to be a clear division as to where we are going to go to get on the right track.</p>  <p>  The Sl&aacute;intecare resignations are a reflection of the frustration felt by the people who were on those boards. They want to deliver Sl&aacute;intecare.  They see the potential of it and yet they see it being held up by the Minister and others in the Department who simply have not got it in them to stand up to vested interests and ensure we deliver for our people.  That is what this is about.  We have to deliver for the ordinary people out there who are on these waiting lists, in pain and distress, not for months but for years in many cases.  I know many people in my constituency who are in that situation.  It is simply not right.  There is right and left in everything when we talk politics but there is also right and wrong.  This is a situation of right and wrong.  Until the Minister and this Government are prepared to stand up for the people and ensure we deliver, this health service is going down the tubes.</p></speech>

It is a debate we need to have and one we need to come back to repeatedly.</p>  <p>  Some time ago, a constituent of mine in County Wicklow, Sarah, needed a hip operation.  She was suffering.  Much like the scenario recounted by another Deputy, she was waiting in intense, debilitating pain.  She did not have private health insurance and she was told that on the public system, it was going to take two and a half years before she could be operated on.</p>  <p>  I went to the National Orthopaedic Hospital in Cappagh to find out what was going on.  The problem was not that we did not have enough doctors, nurses or operating theatres.  It was that the budget allocated for buying the titanium hips was gone.  We were still paying all the overheads, but because of this broken system, Sarah and many other people were not being seen.  Three of the seven operating theatres in Cappagh were closed and surgeons were having their lists cancelled again and again.</p>  <p>  When I took office, one of the first places I visited was one of our children's hospitals.  I was told that right now, many children in our country who have been referred for an MRI by their GP or consultant must wait in some cases for years for that MRI.  That is not acceptable.  I will not stand over it.  No government and no Member of the House would stand over it.</p>  <p>  Before Covid-19 arrived here, our waiting lists were too long.  They were described regularly as some of the longest and worst waiting lists in Europe.  The number of patients waiting for a procedure in one of our hospitals peaked in mid-2017 at approximately 87,000 people.  It has come down by approximately 12%.  Today's figure is approximately 12% lower than that peak but it is still completely unacceptable.  The figures were coming down.  The inpatient and outpatient waiting lists were beginning to fall, but as we all know, because of the pandemic and the cyberattack, they have gone up.  We have seen that a lot of planned and scheduled care unfortunately had to be delayed.</p>  <p>  I want to be absolutely clear about this.  As the threat from Covid-19 continues to recede, and, please God, it is going to keep receding, tackling the waiting lists is the greatest challenge we face in healthcare in our country.  Addressing the waiting lists is my number one priority as Minister for Health.  They will receive the same intense focus, attention and determination that I, my officials, the HSE and many of our partners have put up against Covid-19 and used to roll out the vaccine programme.</p>  <p>  What are we doing?  We are tackling the waiting lists in several ways and doing those all at the same time.  The first thing we are doing is adding permanent capacity to the public healthcare system.  We are adding that capacity in spite of the pandemic and doing so at record speed.</p>  <p>  This year, we have added approximately 800 beds to the public hospital system so far and it is still September.  We intend on adding beds right to the end of the year.  That is the biggest number of beds that have been added to our public system going back several decades, as far as we can tell.  At the start of last year, the number of critical care beds stood at 255.  We have been adding beds all though the pandemic.  By the end of this year, we intend to move from 255 critical care beds to 321.</p>  <p>That will be an increase of about 25% in our critical care capacity during the pandemic, which is welcome but not enough.  I have secured agreement from the Cabinet that we will continue after this year and I have agreement to extend critical care capacity to 446 beds, which is very necessary and will help greatly with these waiting lists and stop the continuous cancellation of planned care that so many people have to deal with.<br/><br/>We are also adding to the workforce, again at a record speed, with more doctors, nurses, midwives, therapists, scientists, clinicians and specialists throughout the system.  Last year, during the pandemic, saw the largest increase in the public health workforce since the establishment of the HSE, while this year will be another record year.  Deputy Cullinane rightly stated we have funded just above 14,000 posts.  We are on target to hit more than 7,000.  While we would all like the original target to have been met, nobody last October anticipated the full year the world has seen in the context of the pandemic.  In spite of the pandemic, however, and even though people have not been able to travel and all sorts of restrictions have been in place, we will see another record year in terms of increasing the workforce and we intend to continue in this vein.  At the same time that we increased the permanent capacity in the HSE, we recruited, with external partners, 3,200 women and men to work in areas such as contact tracing, testing and tracing and the vaccination programme.<br/><br/>Consultant numbers continue to grow.  In the past five years, more than 700 additional consultant posts have been filled, with more than half of them in the past two years.  The number of consultants has increased over the past two years from 3,153 to 3,506.  There are clear recruitment challenges, in certain specialties in particular and in particular locations.  We all know that and it has to be addressed.  Issues in Letterkenny University Hospital and University Hospital Kerry have, understandably, been raised during the debate and other hospitals are also finding it very difficult to recruit people.  The majority of posts, however, that have been identified as vacant are currently filled under fixed-term or specified-purpose contracts.  We want people full time in those roles and the new Sl&aacute;intecare public-only contract will be essential to that end.  In disability, mental health, home care and addiction services, there has been much progress over the past year or two.  The Ministers of State, Deputies Butler and Rabbitte, will outline some of the successes and plans in these areas.  <br/><br/>Elsewhere, we are innovating to improve how and where patients are treated.  As the story of Sarah from Cappagh shows, it is not just about money and capacity; it is about using what we have as well as we can.  It is about our clinicians working to the full extent of their licences.  It is about ensuring that our operating theatres and diagnostic suites will not just run from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday.  We have to staff them, run them longer and build and use the capacity within our public health system as well as we can.  Right now, we are not doing that.  There are some notable good examples but there is much opportunity to do better.<br/><br/>Change, as we all know, can be difficult.  On my visits to the hospitals, including Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda in recent days, Tallaght University Hospital and many other places throughout the country, I have been meeting a galvanised, determined workforce who have been living change and innovation throughout the pandemic and who are passionate about universal healthcare, our public health system and their patients.  They talk to me about a desire to continue innovating, continue changing and continue finding ways to treat patients more quickly and in their communities where possible when they need the care.<br/><br/>This year, we have provided funding to ensure GPs have access to diagnostics, MRIs, X-rays, ultrasound scans and CT scans.  At a cost of &euro;25 million, it has not been done before.  We estimate that by the end of year, we will have funded about 140,000 additional scans, and we are getting strong feedback from the GP community on this.  We are scaling up the provision of advanced nursing practitioners, one of the most exciting opportunities we have.<br/><br/>Advanced nursing practitioner-led teams in the community are treating and discharging a majority of patients waiting to see a consultant.  In Tallaght University Hospital, for example, the urology waiting list has fallen from five years to 12 weeks, and we are going to be doing an awful lot more of this.<br/><br/>Third, I am launching a plan to tackle the waiting lists.  In the immediate term, through the waiting list action plan, we will examine the impact of Covid-19 and the cyberattack.  This is all the more necessary given that we expect hundreds of thousands of patients to come into the system between now and the end of the year.  The second component of this is the development of a longer term, multi-annual waiting list plan.  It will be overseen by a ministerial task force I am establishing, which will be led by my Secretary General.  Targets and detailed hospital-by-hospital lists and plans are being established and it is our full intention to keep driving and investing on this until we meet the prescribed Sl&aacute;intecare waiting list times for inpatient, outpatient and diagnostic care.<br/><br/>I welcome views on this issue from throughout the House.  Sinn F&eacute;in will have been examining it in Northern Ireland, where the inpatient waiting list <i>per capita</i>is more than twice that in the Republic, while the outpatient list is about 70% higher than it is in the Republic.  I expect, therefore, that there will be many ideas.  We need to work on this together.  I welcome the debate and look forward to sitting down with Deputies and figuring out how we can do everything possible to ensure men, women and children will get the care they need when they need it.</p></speech>

It is good to see him and both Ministers of State here for the debate.</p>  <p>  I will begin by reading from statements I received in recent weeks in the context of a survey.  They are the stories of people.  One woman said she is a full-time carer, a single mother of two boys with special needs, who has been waiting five years to see a consultant.  She stated she does not get respite or home help.  Another mother said her child's teeth are severely out of shape and now, at 13 years of age, is the optimal time to fix them, but the HSE waiting list extends to at least four years.  She said her daughter's confidence has been severely affected.  A third respondent stated they had been waiting four and a half years to see a consultant about carpal tunnel syndrome.  The person saw a consultant in May and was told they urgently needed surgery, which they would receive by the end of June.  They were still waiting at the end of August.</p>  <p>  Sl&aacute;intecare called for maximum waiting times of 12 weeks for inpatient procedures, but in Cork, 645 adult patients have now been waiting more than 18 months.  The total number of patients, both adults and children, on waiting lists in Cork for inpatient or day care stands at 4,846.  Sl&aacute;intecare also called for maximum outpatient waiting times of ten weeks.  The total number in Cork on waiting lists, between adults and children, is 66,299.  Behind those figures are people who are feeling the impact of the HSE's failures and of the health service crumbling.  In a recent survey, more than 70% of people reported physical or mental health issues, including increases in stress and anxiety.</p>  <p>  I am glad both Ministers of State are here.  The HSE wants to close the Owenacurra mental health centre in Midleton, in the middle of a pandemic, when we have been talking so often about mental health.  I hope the Ministers of State will revert to me in respect of my request for a meeting to discuss that.  Families need help now.  We need to create a national health service with a deliverable plan to tackle these long waiting lists.  There is a national emergency and the Government should recognise this.</p></speech>

It reflects part of the frustration over the HSE's management of funding and so on.  He stated the funding to purchase the replacement joints Sarah needed was gone but the State was nonetheless paying for overheads and staff, with theatres closed.  Was that changed there and then?  The Minister is nodding.  That is a start, because that would be the most frustrating aspect of all.</p>  <p>  We have talked about 900,000 people, a figure I heard all the previous speakers mention, but we should stop and think because we all know these people.  There are 900,000 people in pain, stress and worry, waiting for their scan, in a small State such as this.</p> <p>Some 100,000 of those 900,000 are children, with many of them, almost one third, waiting over 18 months.  We cannot blame the Covid-19 pandemic or the cyberattack.  The number was 870,000 in January 2020.  That has nothing to do with the Minister, but it is a damning indictment of the last Government and this Government.</p> <p> Two weeks ago, at the Committee of Public Accounts, I asked representatives of the HSE about the additional home help hours.  There were 5 million additional hours to be delivered this year.  The HSE has only delivered 2 million thus far and it is hoping for a further 1.5 million by the end of the year, but who knows about that given that it is the end of September now?  Therefore, it is short 1.5 million.  Of the 612 public beds that were to be developed in the winter plan for last year, only 288 were delivered.  It appears that the Minister is failing to address waiting lists in every sector of the health service, be it for scans, outpatients or inpatients.  It is the whole shooting gallery.  People have been waiting so long to be seen.</p> <p> There are over 15,000 people on waiting lists at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and they have been waiting for a long time.  The Minister said he was at the emergency department there last week.  People are actually getting up and going home to take their chances at home because they have been waiting up to 14 hours.  It is crazy, and it has to stop.</p></speech>

The constituency that I represent, Laois-Offaly, has witnessed the healthcare system struggle consistently for years.  This is despite the exceptional work of the front-line staff in the services.  There are now almost 30,000 people in Laois and Offaly on hospital waiting lists.  This is from a population of 150,000.  In Laois, 13,411 are on outpatient waiting lists and 2,038 are on inpatient waiting lists.  In Offaly, 11,572 are on outpatient waiting lists and 1,709 are on inpatient waiting lists.  As has been said in this debate, behind each of those figures is an individual who is suffering deteriorating health, delayed diagnosis, which obviously leads to other problems, stress and dreadful pain.  People are waiting for hip replacements and so forth, and it is unacceptable that they are fed with painkillers year on year, which leads to them developing ulcers and other health problems.  The Minister and I have seen that in our constituency offices and we must stop it.</p>  <p>  The hospital waiting list crisis can be resolved.  I know it is a challenge, but no job is easy, particularly turning around our health system.  It requires leadership and commitment.  This means facing down the vested interests.  The Minister knows what they are better than me because he has had a closer look in the last year.  In the 11 years I have been a Deputy and in the decades before that when I was a councillor, I got a glimpse of what it was like.  Those private vested interests need to be faced down.  Hospital managers must be running hospitals, not private consultants.  That is what happened in Cappagh, if it was traced back to what went on.  The hospital managers must run the hospitals.</p>  <p>  Our motion sets out some of the solutions and our vision for resolving the crisis.  We would introduce single integrated waiting lists.  That is one of the can-dos.  It is a system that we believe would significantly speed up the process and reduce waiting times across the hospitals.  We would also provide a major capital fund to increase the number of beds, staff and capacity within the system.  This is the type of ambition that we must see from the Government.  What is particularly worrying, however, is that we are not seeing the progress that is necessary.  Sl&aacute;intecare is one example.  This is very concerning.  I pinned a great deal of hope on Sl&aacute;intecare, as did other Members.  The report notes that there is still no waiting list management and reduction plan in place, despite the waiting list in the State being at 907,648.  There is an estimated &euro;300 million which will go unspent in the health budget this year, despite the Covid-19 pandemic.  If this is not happening, that is good.  The money is there and it must be well used.</p>  <p>  Over 700 consultant posts are still vacant.  I heard what the Minister said earlier and that is welcome, but there are still over 700 vacancies.  I do not see an urgency to address this from the Government.  We must be training and promoting doctors into those essential vacancies.  There should also be public-only contracts for consultants to work in the public system, unlike the current mess where they do private work during their working day in public hospitals.  That must stop.  There must be new public-only contracts for the new consultants coming in.</p></speech>

We had the curtailment, as it was called at the time, of the Shannondoc services, which resulted in their disappearance.  Dentists are opting out of the medical card dental treatment services scheme, DTSS, and GPs are not taking new patients.  People are left without access to primary care.</p>  <p>  The people of Clare are definitely feeling disadvantaged when it comes to accessing healthcare.  If they must present to University Hospital Limerick, for example, which has one of the busiest emergency departments in the country, they will more than likely spend a few nights on a trolley.  Every week a constituent contacts my office asking for representation to the HSE because those constituents feel they have been completely forgotten.  They do not understand how they could possibly be expected to wait and endure chronic pain and anxiety caused by having an untreated illness.  I am working with a woman who has been trying to access rheumatology care for the last nine years and who is coping with severe daily pain.  In the meantime, I have another constituent whose surgery, which was deemed urgent at the time of the consultation in 2019, has been cancelled three times, but only once because of Covid-19 restrictions.  He was told he was at the top of the list nine months ago and he is still waiting.</p>  <p>  In terms of children with additional needs, the average waiting time is 19 months.  That is in spite of the legally imposed timeline of three months.  Sadly, once a child accesses an assessment of needs the child is basically back to square one, left out to dry and made to source, resource and secure the intervention needed to support the child's development, as if the assessment of needs had not happened.  This is truly ineffective and, to be frank, immoral.  It must be addressed by the Government.</p>  <p>  Major healthcare reform is absolutely necessary.  Key Sl&aacute;intecare personnel are dropping away and nobody seems to know why.  It is not exactly a vote of confidence in this Government.</p></speech>

It is very timely.  I apologise for not being present for the start of the debate.  I had a scheduled meeting with Care Champions, who the Deputy and members of his party have met.  They are relatives of people who passed away in nursing home care in the last 18 months and, with the indulgence of the proposers of the motion, I ask the Minister to engage with the group.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has done so.  I am still absorbing the half hour that I was on the call with them.  It was very powerful.</p>  <p>  This motion is very important and timely.  Again, I thank Sinn F&eacute;in for proposing it.  There are currently 652,344 people on an outpatient waiting list, an incredible number.  Some 263,354 of these have been waiting on a list for more than 12 months.  What is even more shocking is that since January 2020 the number of people who have been on a waiting list for more than 18 months has increased by over 80%, from 107,000 to 192,764.  It is very hard to conceptualise these numbers.  We could say it is two or three Croke Parks or whatever, but it is a huge number.  These are people in our lives whom we know personally, not to mention the countless people who contact us through our constituency offices.  They are not just numbers on a page, but real people with real conditions who need treatment.  With every passing day and week they are getting further away from the treatment they need, with their conditions in many cases deteriorating in that time.</p>  <p>  It is not a problem that is exclusive to one part of the country.  Five kilometres from here there are 45,000 people on a waiting list for the Mater hospital.  There are 60,000 waiting for treatment in University Hospital Galway, 48,000 are waiting to be seen in University Hospital Limerick and in Cork, the Taoiseach's city, 36,700 are waiting in Cork University Hospital, 26,000 in South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital and 7,500 in the Mercy University Hospital.  Age does not appear to be a discriminatory factor in whether one is on a list, with over 12,052 children waiting to be seen by an ENT service.  Shockingly, there are 71,369 adults waiting to get orthopaedic treatment, accounting for over 11% of those on waiting lists.  That is so wrong.  In terms of orthopaedic treatment, we think about mobility.</p> <p>Make Way Day last Friday was one of those days where we got to shine a light on the impact of the obstructions of everyday life for people with mobility issues and those who are using wheelchairs.  <br/><br/>Whether it is a young girl in County Kerry suffering from scoliosis who has been on a waiting list for 18 months or a man in his 70s waiting for hip replacement for more than a year, the State should not be keeping people on a waiting list for significant periods.  Never before in the history of the State have so many people been on waiting lists.  Unless the Minister takes action, this will spiral further out of control.<br/><br/>Staggering waiting lists are not a symptom of the Covid crisis.  It may seem like a long time ago, but this was a major problem with our health service long before the pandemic.  Unfortunately, our health service was always described as being in a crisis - throughout my lifetime at least.  While we have been dealing with a pandemic which is an enormous crisis in itself, we are now returning to the pre-crisis state of our health service.  As we come out on the other side of the pandemic, we are faced with a broken health service.<br/><br/>The sad reality is that the Government thinks the National Treatment Purchase Fund is the be-all and end-all that will solve all our problems.  The NTPF was established by Mary Harney on a promise that it would deal with waiting lists, that we would move beyond it and that we would not need to use it in the future.  It has now become a crutch.  Successive governments have promised to end waiting lists, but the reality is that as the drive towards a two-tier health system continues unabated, the NTPF will be a fundamental tool used by the Government which is wrong.<br/><br/>Thanks to Fianna F&aacute;il's and Fine Gael's ideological commitment to for-profit medicine, there is a danger that those who can afford to pay get the best attention while those who cannot end up on waiting lists.  We see it in many different areas of care.  Families with children awaiting speech and language therapy are being forced early in the child's life to go private.  It is only &euro;150 or &euro;200 for an initial consultation.  People will scrimp together and get that initial consultation, but of course after that there is further care and suddenly they find themselves in the private healthcare system.  They cannot afford to be in the private healthcare system, but they have been led there and because it is their child and they want the best for that child, they will do everything they can.  It is fundamentally unfair; it is not good practice and it is not providing the solutions we need.  We need a patient-centred healthcare service that caters to the needs of the individual regardless of their ability to pay.  <br/><br/>There are different types of waiting lists.  Today's <i>Irish Examiner</i>contained a very harrowing story about Emma-Jane Stoker-Phelan who has suffered from anorexia for the past 12 years.  She said she feels like she is &quot;slowly dying&quot; due to a lack of services.  Bodywhys has pointed to a 60% increase in hospital admissions for people suffering from eating disorders.  We need to ring-fence money in the budget, but we need to ensure that mental health gets the funding it desperately needs.<br/><br/>We need to move our system to a more community-based system.  If we can treat people in the community, they will not be on waiting lists for our main hospitals.  They will be getting the treatment they need where they need to be getting it.  For areas like this, which seem to be on the fringes of healthcare provision, it would make a major impact on our overall healthcare system if we can deliver that model and if we can deliver this care where it is needed.<br/><br/>We cannot keep trundling from crisis to crisis in our health service.  It is always one thing after another.  Staff and patients in our hospitals are incredibly frustrated by what they perceive to be the hands-off approach of this Government and the previous one to solving the waiting list crisis and the trolley crisis.  The funding of our public health service must now be multi-annual and focused on investing in and retaining all staff - doctors, nurses, midwives, healthcare assistants, porters and medical scientists.  The professionals in our healthcare family are multifaceted and we need to recruit them and retain them.  There are too many long-term vacancies across a swathe of healthcare jobs and that issue needs to be tackled.<br/><br/>It is depressing that every time we mention a health-related issue in this House, it is followed by the word &quot;crisis&quot;.  Until we do something about it, that will always be the case.  As we all know, it is not the fault of the amazing workers in our health service.  It is incredible that over the past 18 months the HSE has been on flags and bunting hung out of people's windows as a source of pride.  That is the first time that has happened in my lifetime because people have really felt connected with their front-line workers and all workers in the health service.  We are in danger of losing it but we cannot lose that.  The way to ensure we do not is by investing in the system and trusting the great professionals in there to improve and increase the care they provide.  If we do that, we will tackle the waiting lists.<br/><br/>We are still a small country, but we are a rich country.  We should not have these crises.  We should not be rolling over and accepting every year that we will have debates about waiting lists and access.  We can solve this.  Hopefully, the Minister can solve it and not leave it for subsequent governments.  </p></speech>

We have had many accounts this evening of the shortcomings in our health service.  Various people read out letters outlining the incredible difficulties people are having in accessing healthcare.  It is important to take a bit of time to listen to another letter which was delivered to every home in England in 1948 about the new National Health Service.  It reads as follows:</p> <blockquote> 	Your new National Health Service begins on 5th July.  What is it?  How do you get it?<br /><br />It will provide you with all medical, dental and nursing care.  Everyone - rich or poor, man, woman or child - can use it or any part of it.  There are no charges, except for a few special items.  There are no insurance qualifications.  But it is not a &ldquo;charity&rdquo;.  You are all paying for it, mainly as tax payers, and it will relieve your money worries in time of illness. </blockquote>  <p>Is that not a wonderful letter?  Imagine everyone in England getting that through their door.  Imagine the value system and the ethos that underpins the political thinking behind that.  Here was a country emerging from the war.  It was broke, but the Labour Party government at the time and the Labour Party Minister for Health, Aneurin Bevan, had that vision for a civilised society, part of what has to be a modern, caring and inclusive society.  He created the NHS and he spelled out to people why he was doing that and what it was.</p><p>The most impressive part of that letter was in telling people that it was not a charity but that they were paying for it.  Is that not a million miles away from our health service where successive governments have regarded the public health service as some kind of charity?  Indeed, for many decades it was provided as a charitable service, mainly from religious organisations.  To a large extent, there is still that element and the ethos behind our public health service that somehow this is a charity.</p><p>This goes to the core of why we do not have a modern public health service that is universally available and that everybody is happy to use.  There has been a mindset within successive governments, including this one, that the public health service is merely for people who cannot afford to go private.  Fundamentally that is what the thinking is.  I grant that is not to the same extent in Fianna F&aacute;il, but it is a very prevalent view within Fine Gael.  That view is not only in respect of the health service.  It is also about childcare and housing.  There is an attitude that there must be something wrong with someone who cannot afford to pay their own way.  That absolutely goes against the thinking in any kind of modern inclusive social democratic society where there is a social contract, where people pay a fair share of tax and in return they get access to good quality public services in a timely way.</p><p>I have quoted the origins of the NHS.  I am not saying the NHS is perfect by any means.  Successive Tory governments have starved the NHS of funding.</p></speech>
