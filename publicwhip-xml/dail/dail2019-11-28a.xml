While media reports mentioned Oak Hill on a few occasions regarding other matters, it has not been part of the general debate on the national broadband plan.  The first time it will appear in the Official Report will be in this debate.  What is Oak Hill's involvement in the national broadband plan?  What is its responsibilities?  When did it become involved, and why was its name not mentioned in previous parliamentary question responses related to those involved in the national broadband plan?</p></reply>

It is vital that we ensure the people of rural Ireland have the same opportunities as the people in our towns and cities.</p>  <p>  The fundamental building blocks of the project, which is designed to bring fibre to the home to over 1.1 million people in the intervention area, have not changed since the procurement process commenced.  The project is led by Granahan McCourt, supported by key subcontractors Enet and the Kelly Group, with Nokia as the provider of electronic equipment.</p>  <p>  After appointment as the preferred bidder, the sponsors are required to finalise a number of steps before a contract can be signed.  The Department is also required to carry out the necessary due diligence. </p>  <p>  These steps included closing out contracts with infrastructure access providers, civil engineering companies and so on; concluding the contractual provision in the 3,000 page contract; and the finalisation of the committed equity documents with the shareholders of the new company, National Broadband Ireland.</p>  <p>  As is standard in large projects, including public private partnerships, PPPs, the final mix of shareholders to the project is concluded when all contractual documents have been finalised.  The national broadband plan, NBP, process has been no different in this regard.</p>  <p>  The bidder proposed for contract award that McCourt Global LLC be replaced by Oak Hill.  The procurement process for the national broadband plan contract includes a mechanism for the Department to assess and approve, or reject, changes to the membership of bidders.  This assessment is carried out by ring-fenced teams with similar make-up to the teams that carried out the evaluation of the final tender, and overseen by a review panel and the procurement board.  The Minister has no role.  This due diligence was carried out against the conditions set out in the assessment process and was approved.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy knows, the project information memorandum sets out the procurement process and the documents are published.</p>  <p>  As part of the assessment of a change, the relevant bidder is required to demonstrate that it continued to meet the economic and financial standing, together with technical and professional capacity, set out in the original pre-qualification criteria.  The Department could not approve a change in bidder composition unless the relevant bidder met those criteria.</p>  <p>  The funding commitments of National Broadband Ireland, including the equity investment commitments, have been contractualised as part of the contract award.</p></reply>

The Granahan McCourt consortium has changed so many times it has been difficult to keep up.  First, it was widely known as the Enet-SSE consortium and contained a number of other companies.  John Laing, SSE and Enet then dropped out, leaving only Granahan McCourt.  We then heard that Granahan McCourt is being backed by McCourt Global and Tetrad.  We then heard only Tetrad was involved but that McCourt Global had helped Granahan McCourt to pass the relevant tests.  We now find out that it is made up of Granahan McCourt, Tetrad and Oak Hill.  Can the Minister clarify the level of investment provided separately by Tetrad, Oak Hill and Granahan McCourt?  Is Tetrad providing &euro;175 million?  Is Granahan McCourt still providing &euro;45 million?  If so, how much is being provided by Oak Hill and to what end?  We know that the scale of Granahan McCourt's investment is limited and that there may be issues with that but what we need to know is what the Minister has not answered.  When did it become involved?  Was McCourt Global simply used as a front to facilitate it through the process, following which it denied even wanting to be involved in May of this year?</p></speech>

As he is aware, this has gone on since 2015.  That was always recognised in the contract documents.  The contract documents also set out very strict criteria to ensure that whenever a change occurred it did not in any way undermine the basic strength of the proposal.  That process of pre-qualification approval was done entirely independent of either me, as Minister, or the Secretary General, by an independent team of experts with a panel, including the National Development Finance Agency, NDFA.  This was an independent process.</p>  <p>  What has happened here is that the finalisation of the investment includes Oak Hill, which will have a substantial minority shareholding, but Granahan McCourt will continue to be the controlling interest.  It was always envisaged, and other PPP projects are the same, that the equity commitments of the different partners will only be decided at the concluding stage.  That is what happened in this case.  There is nothing unusual about it.  I believe it can be said that Oak Hill has a very substantial financial strength that even a review online will reveal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-11-28a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="10:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112800003#A01300"><p>We need more than a review online.  Is Oak Hill the same Oak Hill that was previously involved with Enet and Mr. McCourt in the past?  The Minister might clarify that.  The issue is extremely serious because it deals who will be responsible if National Broadband Ireland requires additional funding.  For example, concerns about take-up in the intervention area have arisen.  We hope that never arises but it is at the core of our concerns.  The issue is that it is unclear why McCourt Global was required in this process at all, unless issues arose in the consortium.  If it was the case that Granahan McCourt could not pass the financial bar and relied on McCourt Global, that is of public concern.  If it was the case that Granahan McCourt could pass the test alone, the question to be asked is why McCourt Global was involved in the first place.  There have been a small number of media reports about Oak Hill and the national broadband plan, although very few before last Tuesday, but they were not mentioned as part of the final tender by the Government.  Why has Oak Hill only been associated with the tender by Government at this point?  If it has been flipped and changed so often in the bidding process, is this what we are facing now-----</p></speech>

The controlling interest in this is Granahan McCourt.  However, one of the investors with less than 50% is Oak Hill and that provides a strong financial basis for the roll-out.  As I indicated, the process of approving any change in the make-up of the consortium is undertaken by the very same review group, with the same expertise, advice and review panels, as has taken place throughout this process.  That independent process has approved that not only have these investors committed the equity and working capital but they also meet all of the criteria set out from the outset in this process.</p></speech>

My question is on the powers and the role of the just transition commissioner.  The Minister might be aware there was a lot of discussion on this at the Joint Committee on Climate Action yesterday.  Concerns have been raised both at the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment, which is the Minister's line Oireachtas committee and at the Joint Committee on Climate Action by Government Members and Opposition Members on the just transition roll-out and policy and the view from the trade union movement is that it is not working.  One of the issues raised was the role and the powers of the just transition commissioner, especially in industrial relations matters.  The Minister might outline those for us.</p></reply>

I published the terms of reference for the work of the just transition commissioner on 19 November.  The commissioner will engage with the relevant stakeholders, including local community organisations; Bord na M&oacute;na; the ESB; the midlands transition team; local authorities and public representatives; and relevant trade unions and workers' representatives.  The commissioner will also review experiences and best practices in other projects and areas, nationally and internationally, and will review relevant existing State plans and programmes.  The commissioner will then recommend the essential elements of a just transition.  The commissioner will report to Government through the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p>  <p>  I have asked the commissioner to specifically consider the following matters in developing his recommendations: delivery of the just transition measures provided for in budget 2020, in particular the just transition fund; optimal structures or processes to support co-ordinated and effective delivery of a just transition in the midlands, including developing liaison channels between institutions in the region and central Government; implementation of other actions under way, or planned, by Government Departments, agencies and companies, including the four competitive funds under Project Ireland 2040, which could contribute to the transition; and any additional actions or measures he considers appropriate for Government consideration.  The commissioner has also been invited to take account of relevant existing plans and programmes, such as Bord na M&oacute;na's brown to green strategy, the regional enterprise development plan for the midlands, as well as the provisions made in budget 2020, which include the &euro;20 million retrofitting initiative; the &euro;5 million for peatland rehabilitation - outside of Bord na M&oacute;na bogs; and the &euro;6 million for a dedicated just transition fund, where the ESB has contributed an additional &euro;5 million.  The commissioner will not have a direct role in industrial relations matters in Bord na M&oacute;na, which will continue to work with the joint industrial relations council established under the Workplace Relations Commission and with the Workplace Relations Commission itself as necessary.</p></speech>

Whatever about the role of the just transition commissioner, Bord na M&oacute;na is not engaging with the trade unions and the workforce.  The problem for all of us in here is we want to see a just transition policy, framework and architecture in place that work but if that allows for Bord na M&oacute;na to opt out or if that gives Bord na M&oacute;na a veto so it does not have to engage, then we have a problem.  The just transition policy may as well be torn up.  That is what the trade unions and workers' representatives are saying.  Bord na M&oacute;na is not engaging with the Workplace Relations Commission.</p>  <p>  We are saying that we can have a just transition policy but if Bord na M&oacute;na or the ESB refuse to engage with the industrial relations machinery then that is just tough luck for those workers.  That means we do not have any just transition policy.  This is not related to all the measures the Minister spoke about that were in the budget and that Kieran Mulvey will have responsibility for such as the retrofit programme and the rest of it.  It is the issues around those workers transitioning into jobs and the protection of their jobs that is the real concern for them.  I hope the Minister understands there is a problem and a difficulty here that needs to be dealt with.</p></speech>

However, I would point out to the Deputy that the joint industrial relations council was established due to a proposition made by the Workplace Relations Commission.  This is an independent body that is chaired by the Workplace Relations Commission itself with an independent chairperson.  The provision in these joint industrial relations councils as I understand them is that where issues cannot be resolved, they will move forward to the Workplace Relations Commission, which will play a role in resolving those issues.  I have some experience of the Workplace Relations Commission and it has advisory services, conciliation services and mediation services.  Those services are available to assist both the trade unions and Bord na M&oacute;na in resolving issues that arise.  Those measures are tried and tested.  I am conscious that Bord na M&oacute;na itself is an independent commercial company and it must make its arrangements but I also expect it to follow the tried and tested ways of dealing with genuine disputes that have to be resolved.  I see a significant role for the Workplace Relations Commission in this work.</p></speech>

He should read the transcripts from when they were before the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  They said the joint industrial relations council is not the way to deal with this.  They do not have a difficulty with dealing with the Workplace Relations Commission.  The Workplace Relations Commission is open to a just transition element in its work because it is slightly different from what would normally be the cut and thrust of industrial relations issues that would arise.  The trade unions do not have a difficulty with either Kieran Mulvey as just transition commissioner having a role in industrial relations or compellability with the Workplace Relations Commission but what is there at the moment is not working.  If the Minister's position is that it is entirely up to Bord na M&oacute;na to engage, and Bord na M&oacute;na is an independent body, and if it does not engage, there is nothing he can do about it and our just transition strategy lies in tatters.  What is the point if it can simply opt out?  That is what the trade unions are saying.  We have a responsibility to put a framework in place that compels companies to engage and to ensure there is proper engagement with the trade unions and workers.  That simply is not happening and it is not there.</p></speech>

He was a former director general of the Workplace Relations Commission but he has not come to take on the role of the Workplace Relations Commission.  Kieran Mulvey is a man of considerable experience who has taken on the task I set out in my earlier reply, namely, to liaise with community interests across the region.  He will also look at things such as the just transition fund, which specifically makes provision for the retraining of workers, and he will make sure that redeployment and those opportunities to reach new jobs are available to Bord na M&oacute;na workers.  He is not there to replicate the service of the Workplace Relations Commission.  As I understand it, the way the joint industrial relations council works is that it is chaired by an independent person who is from the Workplace Relations Commission itself and issues that cannot be resolved there can be escalated to the Workplace Relations Commission in the normal way.  I would expect Bord na M&oacute;na to co-operate with that process, just as I would expect trade unions to do.</p></speech>

New analysis by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has found air pollution is reaching dangerous levels, beyond World Health Organization, WHO, air quality guidelines and we have serious issues with premature deaths, asthma related illnesses and cardiac related illnesses as a result.  Given this disturbing state of affairs, on Monday of this week the EPA called for an urgent nationwide ban on smoky coal.  Will the Minister outline what immediate actions, legislative or otherwise, he is taking to improve air quality and ensure a nationwide ban is put in place?</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-11-28a.40" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="10:40:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112800004#B01400"><p>Transitioning away from fossil fuels to more renewable, sustainable energy sources is at the heart of the climate action plan.  Some 40% of our homes use coal and peat for heating, many in combination with other fossil fuel heating systems.  By 2030, we will upgrade a third of all homes to at least a B2 energy standard, installing approximately 400,000 heat pumps.  Over 99% of our vehicle fleet is powered by fossil fuels.  By 2030, nearly 1 million electric vehicles will be on our roads.  These measures will significantly improve air quality by reducing emissions of harmful pollutants.  Extending the ban on the use of smoky coal would also have a positive impact on air quality, particularly in built up areas.  The ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal, or the smoky coal ban as it is commonly known, was first introduced in Dublin in 1990, and subsequently extended to 26 major urban areas.  My two predecessors proposed a national extension of the smoky coal ban, but a number of coal firms have indicated they would challenge the proposal of two former Ministers to extend the smoky coal ban.</p> <p>This is disappointing.  The basis of their challenge is that a nationwide smoky coal ban cannot be introduced without a nationwide ban on the burning of peat, turf and wet wood because such products produce similar levels of pollution.  The legal threat is not only to take down any new nationwide ban, but to remove the ban currently in place in cities and many towns throughout the country. </p> <p> In that context, it is especially important to ensure that the measures put forward will not be vulnerable to legal challenge, and I am continuing to work to finalise a legally robust way forward that will improve air quality by reducing air pollution, without jeopardising the existing ban.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-11-28a.42" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1255" speakername="Jack Chambers" time="10:50:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112800005#C00200"><p>That was a nonsense of a response.  People are dying as a result of smoky coal but the Minister stated that because of the vulnerability to a legal challenge, there will be more inaction from his Department on such a serious matter.  There have been no suggestions about how the Government may improve or address the current, partial law and no proposal on how to shift subsidies and incentives away from fossil fuel burning.  It is concerning that the Minister is more obsessed with legal challenges than in saving lives, which is what it comes down to in light of the EPA data.</p>  <p>  The State's response to a real, immediate and worsening public health matter cannot be dictated by potential legal threats and big business.  Experts at many universities have stated there are serious public health implications, and the national ban on selling and burning smoky coal is a logical first step towards improving air quality.  Air pollution is closely linked to the climate crisis, yet the burning of smoky coal is entirely absent from the Government's new climate action plan.  The same threats were made by big tobacco many years ago.  The Government is taking the approach that because there is a potential for legal challenges, there will be no legislative action.  That is not good enough.  People are dying, as the data show.</p></speech>

There are substantial subsidies for the move to electric vehicles, insulation, the upgrading of homes, the fitting of heat pumps and other measures that would substantially reduce reliance on fossil fuel.  The subsidies are in place and have been substantially expanded in the budget.</p>  <p>  The issue for any Minister is that when one gets legal advice that a proposition made by one's predecessors, as is the case, could bring down the ban on smoky coal that prevails in 26 major urban areas, including Dublin, one has to tread carefully.  It would serve no one's interest for the existing ban in Dublin and the other 25 areas to fall under a legal challenge.  I have to proceed, therefore, in a way that I can be confident I can enforce the change and not undermine the existing law.</p>  <p>  In the context of the previous question, the issue is that the ban in place does not extend to peat and wet wood.  They, too, are substantial causes of pollution.</p></speech>

As we saw on "RT&Eacute; Investigates" last night, there are illegal quarries throughout the country, and there are threats and legal challenges.  It seems business reigns above politics in this case.  Who runs the country?  In October, the Minister stated he was working with the Attorney General to address an issue.  The Government has repeatedly chosen to deflect and deny, while the evidence shows increasing levels of respiratory illnesses and hospital admissions due to poor air quality.  Air pollution causes 1,000 premature deaths per year in Ireland but legal challenges mean more than those lives.  Why are the lives and health of people living in Enniscorthy less important to the Government than those of people living in cities?  The Government is treating people in rural areas as second-class citizens.  It is unacceptable that the Government is willing to dismiss relevant human rights obligations in this area, not least in respect of ensuring the right to health and the rights of a child.  On the air quality issues relating to the quarries mentioned last night, there has been no enforcement from local authorities or action from the Government to address the issue.  Instead, judicial reviews and legal quagmires have been allowed to undermine the rights of people to health and proper air quality.</p>  <p>  It goes back to the fundamental question of whether the Government shows political leadership.  It should ban it and deal with the consequences.</p></speech>

I have to take seriously the legal frailties of any proposal made.  That is my job.  I have to ensure I protect people, but I am also examining how I can move forward on the matter.  I recognise the concern the Deputy expressed and many of my party colleagues are similarly concerned.  Nevertheless, I have to ensure that anything I do in the area will be robust and able to withstand the test.</p></speech>

She has to be aware that the LNG projects, including that at Shannon, have been proposed by commercial developers.  They are private sector projects and final investment decisions for them, including the sources of their funding and their compliance with legal and regulatory requirements for consents or permits, are the responsibility of the project promoters.  In that context, I have no plans to intervene in individual commercial projects.  I recognise that the revised EIB policy will no longer consider new financing for unabated fossil fuel energy projects from the end of 2021.  The EIB recognises, however, the necessary role that gas will continue to play in the transition to decarbonisation.  Within the gas sector, the bank will focus its support on projects aligned to the transition.</p>  <p>  Shannon LNG has been on the list of projects of common interest since 2013, and while Ireland supported its inclusion on the fourth list, I have made it clear the Government will not consider any application for the EU Connecting Europe Facility unless and until it passes the tests I have set for it.  In addition, I have instructed my officials to request that the European Commission review the implications of importing LNG, both conventionally and unconventionally extracted, into the EU, in terms of a sustainable, secure and competitive European energy policy.</p>  <p>  The climate action plan I launched in June sets out an ambitious course of action over the coming years to address the climate challenge and to transition to a carbon-neutral economy.  In the context of the transition, a comprehensive independent energy security and sustainability review will be carried out.  It will examine the fuel mix necessary, including the role of gas in electricity generation, how and from where it is sourced, as well as the role of other technologies such as interconnection and battery storage as backup for renewables to ensure security of supply.</p></speech>

One of the ten recommendations that came out of that experiment was not to allow the importation of fracked gas and to oppose the Shannon and Cork LNG projects.  Tomorrow, the same students will take another day of strike action, and at approximately 12 noon they will be on Merrion Square.  I intend to join them and I wonder whether the Minister can tell them with a straight face what he just stated to me, or support their demand to end the importation of North American fracked gas.</p>  <p>  I listened to the Minister's response, in which he paid no attention to the two reports published this week that suggest we may have crossed the tipping points and thresholds that will lock us into catastrophic climate change because emissions are soaring all the time.  Without allowing the climate emergency measures Bill to go forward or banning LNG projects, we will be certain to have done nothing.  Although the Minister denies we have anything to do with LNG facilities and that they are private, we facilitated the fast-track planning and building of the projects in Cork and at Shannon, and have allowed for their inclusion on the list of European projects of common interest.  It is not as though his hands are clean and he has nothing to do it.</p></speech>

In the interim, I have signalled very clearly that the Government will not support such a project in any way.</p>  <p>  However, being able to stop a private sector project going through the planning process is not a power available to the Government, nor is the power to block its importation.  I understand that is a matter for the European Commission because it would be a trade issue.  I have undertaken the evaluation that is necessary so we can have a proper examination of the science to determine whether this has any role to play and how we should treat it.  In the interim, I will not support any such project.</p></speech>

This is fracked gas from an area of North America that is suffering severely in terms of health and the environment.  We have banned it in this country for those reasons, yet we are willing to facilitate its importation into this country.  I repeat that we are facilitating it through our planning structure and the fact that the Government is allowing it to remain on a list of projects of common interest in Europe.</p>  <p>  Gas and fracked gas is driving the spike in methane emissions.  One third of this is coming from the industry in North America, from where fracked gas will arrive in Shannon.  Businesses are looking for a market.  If they succeed in building LNG here and across Europe, we can kiss goodbye to the Paris targets and any hope of limiting temperature rises to under 2&deg;C.  The science is there.  Robert Howarth of Cornell University gave evidence at climate change committee meetings that if we could reduce methane emissions we could buy ourselves more time to try to deal with the climate catastrophe we are facing.  Methane leaks at a significant level from fracked gas and traps heat at a much more intense level.  Will the Minister listen to school students and do something about LNG? </p></speech>

The truth is that I was the first Minister to put in place a climate action plan which will see us move from a figure of 30% of renewables and is putting State money into building interconnectors, facilitating additional wind farms and solar capacity to make our power clean, helping homeowners to improve their homes and helping people to switch to cleaner and better forms of transport.  We are putting substantial resources in place and making regulatory changes to bring about a much cleaner environment.

The interdepartmental committee on island development is the first cross-Government policy developed for the islands in 23 years and will set a roadmap for the long-term sustainability and development of our offshore communities.  Our coastal islands are an integral part of our cultural heritage.  Island communities need to continue to be sustainable and to realise their potential, and the voices and views of islanders will be central to the process.</p>  <p>  At a special event in November on Sherkin Island, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, in conjunction with the Government Chief Whip and Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Kyne, launched a consultation process aimed at formulating a new national policy for the future development of the islands.  My Department has supported this initiative by outlining the breadth of policies relevant to the islands, including communications, energy, climate action and fisheries.</p>  <p>  One major project is the national broadband plan, which aims to deliver access to high speed broadband to every premises in Ireland, regardless of location, including offshore islands.  Provision of advanced communications services and innovation in smart agriculture, e-health, education, tourism and improved supports for emergency services all offer potential island applications.  The deployment plan will be finalised shortly and all counties will see premises passed in the first two years.</p>  <p>  Approximately 300 broadband connection points in community centres such as schools, library hubs and local sports halls in every county in Ireland, including some on the islands such as, among others, Tory Island, Inishbofin, Inis Oirr, Valentia and Achill, will be connected.  There are many opportunities for the islands to become pioneers in initiatives designed to deliver our climate action plan and sustainable development goals.  </p>  <p>  My Department has active programmes for community participation in areas such as the sustainable energy communities network operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, waste reduction and recycling and Sound &amp;amp; Vision Ireland, operated by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that the Aran Islands were recently recognised for their outstanding achievements in moving to a low waste and clean power approach to island communities.</p></speech>

A policy on the islands has been drafted and each Department has been specifically asked about its actions.  When was the Minister's Department contacted by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht?  What actions has it taken in regard to the islands?  I ask this in the context of a motion that was passed in September which asked for a policy on the islands because of the vacuum that exists.</p>  <p>  Scotland has legislation and a policy in respect of its islands and its island population has increased.  We value our islands and there is wonderful language in our national planning framework and other documents.  Our islands and coastal areas contain some of our most vibrant and culturally distinctive communities.  What are we doing to support sustainable life on the islands?  </p>  <p>  The Minister listed a range of events.  I realise that there are many opportunities.  What is the Minister's Department setting out in respect of the islands?  In contrast to Scotland, the population on our islands is declining.</p></speech>

I outlined two significant contributions my Department has made, including rolling out high-speed broadband to every home on the islands.  In the interim we are installing broadband connection points which will be hubs located on specific islands.</p>  <p>  We are also proposing to increase the number of sustainable energy communities from 300 to 1,500.  We will of course make available the resources of the SEAI to work with communities on the islands to develop such programmes.  It has the facility to draw down money to put together an energy plan to improve energy efficiency in buildings in those communities.  That is a very worthwhile project which can offer employment opportunities in terms of rolling out the programme and, more importantly, make communities sustainable in terms of energy use and more self-sufficient in their approach to power.</p></speech>

I ask for a more specific plan, which is what the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht asked for because of the vacuum and challenges facing the islands and the drop the population.  This is urgent and all Departments must play a role.</p>  <p>  I welcome the broadband plan, but not the price of broadband.  I would like more specific timescales for broadband on the islands.  Aside from broadband, there are many other issues, as the Minister said, including energy.  The island and communities are coming forward to outline the challenges and solutions and to ask for help.  The Department is weak in terms of interface from that point of view.  When will the Minister's Department have a report ready in response to the request from the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht as an input into policy?</p></speech>

I understand there is a consultation process which I am sure will shed light on the expectations from each Department.</p><p>The Deputy seems to be belittling the fact that Tory Island, Inishbofin and so on will have broadband connection points before the end of next year.  They will be furnished with important hotspots which will give people access to broadband.  If a sustainable energy community is formed, a grant of up to &euro;25,000 to help it develop a plan is available.  Communities will not be left alone to develop plans.</p> <p>They need to identify the participants locally, however, before the plan can take shape.  We are happy to provide resources and to work with communities to see the emergence of a sustainable energy community.  In any other area where we feel we can be of assistance, we are certainly open to doing so.</p></speech>

In this regard, the Government has agreed that Departments and bodies will no longer purchase single-use plastic cups, cutlery and straws.  We have also strongly supported new EU legislation on single-use plastics, which will ban straws, cotton bud sticks made from plastic, plastic plates and cutlery, plastic coffee stirrers and plastic balloon holders.  That is due to be transposed into legislation by 3 July 2021 at the latest.  A clean oceans initiative has also been commenced and the Government is legislating to ban microbeads.</p>  <p>  These measures are intended to bring a concentrated focus on the reduced prevalence of single-use plastics and on quality recycling throughout all Irish organisations, public or private.  Many organisations are taking steps to improve their resource use and all public bodies will be submitting a report shortly on the progress that they have made as a result of the decision made last January.  My Department provides direct funding for the local authority prevention network, managed by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  One of the initiatives funded involved approximately &euro;150,000 being provided to 17 local authorities in 2018-19 to provide public drinking water fountains in public buildings, including schools and leisure centres, at events and on greenways to reduce single-use plastic consumption.</p>  <p>  The local authority prevention network will shortly publish a handbook on providing public water stations, based on the experiences of local authorities to date.  Further consideration of measures to tackle single-use plastics will be undertaken in the context of Ireland's waste action plan.  A full public consultation on the development of the plan will be launched before the end of this year.</p></speech>

There is support for these practical initiatives across the House.  Focus is often devoted to macro issues, such as the need for more renewables and a reduction in our carbon footprint derived from the use of fossil fuels.  However, practical things can be done.  Base on my experience, some local authorities have, temporarily provided access to water for the public at major outdoor public events.  What we are talking about is putting in place permanent infrastructure so that people fill up reusable flasks with water instead of buying plastic bottles of water in shops.</p>  <p>  I welcome the Minister's comments on the local authority prevention network providing funding in this area.  How much has been spent by local authorities so far?  It is fine if he does not have those figures, he can send the information to me in a note.  I would like to see how much money was made available for this purpose and how much was drawn down.  I welcome a handbook being made available.  I assume that is to inform local authorities about how to access the available funding and how this these fountains can be rolled out in a coherent manner.  I welcome the progress but more is necessary because the more of these practical measures that are put in place, the more people will recognise that the State is engaging with them and providing alternatives in the context of reducing our carbon footprint and strengthening our environmental protections.</p></speech>

I refer to the inclusion of a report by the end of this year on resource use in areas such as water waste and energy.  It is important that public bodies start to think about how they can reduce the extent to which their staff, clients or customers rely on plastic bottles when there could be alternatives.  As far as I know, the &euro;150,000 was all spent, but I will inquire further.  Many other organisations, other than public bodies, should also engage in this initiative.  I would love to see more private sector organisations getting involved in similar schemes.  It is encouraging to see many supermarkets, for example, signing up for plastic pledges.  It would be helpful to see fountains in supermarkets and shopping centres.  There is, therefore, significant scope to roll out, as part of our waste management plan, some of these ideas that have been rightly identified by the Deputy.</p></speech>

The ESB is matching that with &euro;10 million in funding.  The project includes the installation of 140 fast chargers and consists of 90 150 kW chargers, each capable of charging two vehicles simultaneously.  They will be able to charge vehicles fully in six minutes, so they are very powerful.  Another 50 existing standard chargers will be upgraded to 50 kW chargers.  The project will also involve replacing more than 500 existing standard charge points with next-generation high reliability models.</p>  <p>  This is a multi-annual project and is expected to be fully completed by 2022.  The locations of the chargers installed as part of this project have not been finalised.  However, a provisional map of the planned network, showing indicative locations, was developed by the ESB and has been published on my Department&rsquo;s website.  The location of the planned installations will, once finalised, be published by the ESB.</p>  <p>  An allocation of &euro;36 million has been provided for electric vehicle uptake in 2020.  This includes &euro;2 million in funding to support local authorities in the roll-out of on-street public charge points for electric vehicles.  This can support the installation of up to 400 on-street chargers in 2020.  All local authorities can now apply for funding to the Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland, SEAI, in respect of that initiative.  In addition, in the first quarter of 2020, we will develop a charging infrastructure strategy and we will also carry out an updated needs analysis for fast chargers based on having 75,000 electric vehicles by 2022.  Each year, there will be additional inclusions, meaning there will be some 1,200 local chargers over time.</p></speech>

It was all talk, all announcements and no action, as far as I can see.  It is not right to simply publish a map of where chargers might be.  When money is being committed and major announcements made, my constituents are entitled to know where the chargers will be and when they will be installed.  There are a couple of chargers in Kells and Dunboyne and a fast charger halfway between Ratoath and Ashbourne in my constituency.  Other than that, however, there is little in the way of electric vehicle infrastructure.  That has to change.</p>  <p>  When these announcements are made, we are entitled to find out where the Government is planning to carry out these measures.  On major infrastructural projects, what is repeatedly happening is that something is announced and the action is then nowhere to be seen.  That is the difficulty I have with this announcement.</p></speech>

Regarding the roll-out of the project, I announced the funding and the roll-out is now proposed, with that provisional map.  Of the 90 fast chargers, 45 will be put in place in 2020 and we currently have 98 50 kW chargers.  That number will increase to 52 in 2020.</p> <p>The upgrading will continue.  We will also have the local authority ones I have mentioned.  Meath County Council has an opportunity to apply to participate in the scheme that involves 400 additional chargers.  I am sure that at the Deputy's urging, the council will get in its application quickly.</p></speech>

I drive around the county.  I know where they are.  I use them.  They are simply absent in many of the towns in my constituency of Meath East.  This is a big problem.  There are simple things that we could do.  The Minister must do what is needed to fund them.  Local authorities should not be allowing service stations to be developed without chargers.  That is a very simple thing that could happen immediately.  More and more petrol stations are opening, or reopening after being refurbished subject to planning, without being required to have electric car chargers from the start.  This must change.  It could happen without any Government money.  Somebody must end this inaction by telling local authorities to do this.  I hope that when the Department makes a submission on county development plans, including the County Meath plan, it will recommend that local authorities should insist on the installation of these chargers as part of their strategies.  I think that can be done as well as providing money and plans.</p></speech>

The planning system already provides certain conditionality.  New buildings with ten parking positions must have a charger.  From 2025, every building that has 20 parking places will need to have a charger.  The Deputy has proposed that we make a change in respect of service stations.  I think many of them are planning the installation of these facilities.  I suppose this has been triggered by the plan to introduce a charge for fast chargers.  That gives people in the private sector an incentive to install such chargers.  I believe we will see growth in public chargers and an increase in these alternative sources.  Of course the optimum which we try to encourage is for people to charge their cars at home at night.</p></speech>

The contract to deliver this service was signed on 19 November.  Work will begin immediately.  A deployment plan will be made available by National Broadband Ireland, NBI, shortly.  All counties will see premises passed in the first two years.  Over 90% of premises in the State will have access to high-speed broadband within the next four years.  Approximately 300 community centres, schools, library hubs and local GAA halls in every county will be connected to high-speed broadband during 2020 to enable communities to get free public access to high-speed broadband.  A list of these community centres is available to view on the high-speed broadband map on my Department's website.  NBI will pass approximately 10,000 premises by the end of 2020 and approximately 115,000 premises by the end of 2021.

This new superhighway communications infrastructure will combat isolation in rural Ireland and foster population growth and development.  This issue has been raised at the doors in recent years in the context of remote access, remote working, reduced commuting times and the compliance concerns of the farming population.  A great deal of documentation has to be uploaded through web portals by those involved in farming and by people in rural Ireland who are seeking to avail of various services.  High-speed broadband is needed for such uploading, for businesses like website design and for retail.  A great deal of bandwidth is needed to design websites.  Will the actual roll-out of the plan be done through the local authorities?  Are there teams in place, particularly in County Limerick, to decide on which areas outside the hubs that have been chosen will be moved on first?  I ask the Minister to make a statement on this matter.</p></speech>

It was estimated that there would be a 4% rate of participation in remote working, but we heard this morning that the rate is already 10% and is growing rapidly.  I think that will be really valuable for people.  It will allow companies to move to more regional locations because they will have confidence that these connections will be available.  The roll-out of the broadband connection points has been agreed with local authorities, which have been involved in the selection of such points.  NBI will set up the process of providing the 150 Mbps wireless connection to those points.  With the support of the Department of Rural and Community Development, we will ensure those centres are properly equipped and functioning so people can use them.  There will be different types and different standards of broadband connection points to meet different needs.  There will be a sort of hierarchy of what they will deliver.  All of them will be in place by 2020.  The Deputy also asked about the detail of the wider roll-out.  The country is being divided into 110 different boxes, each of which contains approximately 5,000 premises.  As I understand it, the company will publish its full roll-out in early January.  It has guaranteed that every county will have active laying of fibre during 2021.</p></speech>

Obviously, broadband will have an influence on this.  It has been suggested to me that the advertising model for community radio stations is quite restrictive.  A community station in my local area, West Limerick 102, has been running since 2005.  The area from which it is allowed to gain advertising is confined to the region from which it broadcasts.  It cannot go outside that area when it is looking for advertising.  I will give the Minister an example of what I am talking about.

Question No. 11 happens to be about Bord na M&oacute;na and the just transition.  I ask the Minister to meet the trade unions representing Bord na M&oacute;na workers to hear their views.  The unions are demanding that Bord na M&oacute;na management attend the Workplace Relations Commission on the question of a just transition for their members.</p></speech>

I met the workers most recently on 11 November last, when myself and a number of my Cabinet colleagues visited the Lough Boora Discovery Park and Lough Ree power station.  I also met Mr. Tom Donnellan, who is the CEO of Bord na M&oacute;na, and Mr. Pat O'Doherty, who is the CEO of ESB, on that date.  This followed previous meetings I had held with the worker directors of Bord na M&oacute;na, representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Bord na M&oacute;na group of unions, and the chief executives of both companies following An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision with regard to the west Offaly power station.  I have also met the midlands regional transition team and the regional skills forum on achieving a just transition for the midlands.</p> <p>On the Deputy's question regarding the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, I dealt with this issue earlier, but I am not sure if the Deputy was here at the time.  Essentially, Bord na M&oacute;na, while independent, has a joint industrial relations council, which was established under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Commission.  The council is well placed to facilitate discussions between Bord an M&oacute;na and the group of unions.  However, if there are difficulties around finding solutions, issues could be, as is the normal approach, moved from the joint industrial relations council to the WRC and, if matters remain unresolved, onwards to the Labour Court.  The WRC, the services of which I am familiar with, provides useful advisory, conciliation, mediation and arbitration services.  It is a useful facility for resolving the undoubtedly difficult issues that are arising.</p></speech>

Various committees have spent hours quizzing the CEO and the unions on the nature of a just transition and how it is dealt with, including two days ago, with officials from the Minister's Department.  It has become apparent that there is a complete misunderstanding or disagreement on the meaning of a just transition for workers.  On the one hand, it is seen as normal day-to-day business as usual and industrial relations issues that can be dealt with by the joint industrial relations council and on the other it is seen as a major issue to do with a society trying to move away from carbon fuelled industries, the latter being how I see it.  If it is about major issues then it has to be dealt with in a different forum to the normal business as usual joint industrial relations council, which is not capable of dealing with the plethora of issues facing these workers and their communities.</p></speech>

I have appointed a just transition commissioner in the person of Mr. Kieran Mulvey and I have given him a very wide brief in terms of the proposals announced in the budget around developing retrofitting opportunities, repurposing the public service obligation, PSO, to allow work occur on the bogs to do a high level of restoration of bogs so that they become genuine carbon assets of the State.  I am also making sure there is wide participation such that we will get good redeployment opportunities and the skills that workers need to transfer will be developed.  In this regard, the wider involvement of agencies such as the education and training boards, ETBs, and the institutes of technology is important.  The Deputy will be aware that the regional enterprise strategy has at its core the transition to a low carbon economy.  I believe that through the just transition commissioner we can assist the development of good projects that will see opportunities develop.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, just transition is about finding alternative opportunities that will provide both workers and the regions with a strong prosperous future.</p></speech>

It is all of the above as mentioned by the Minister but it is also about how they are treated while their jobs are being done away, what access they have to voluntary redundancy, what that amounts to and who is covered by this agreement.  There is a cohort of Bord na M&oacute;na and subsidiary company employees who are not covered by the joint industrial relations council.  Where do they go?  The just transition commissioner's terms of reference are limited to the areas mentioned by the Minister such as retrofitting, restoration of the bogs, etc., but that does not deal with workers who are being dumped on the scrap heap, some of them after 35 or 40 years, with inadequate pensions and redundancy payments and many of them without a choice in terms of whether or not they avail of that redundancy.  For many of them, their working hours have been changed and their pay has been cut.  Where new industries have been provided, such as the plastics recycling facility at Littleton, contracts of employment are subject to renewal annually and, thus, workers are denied access to the industrial relations machinery because, as the Minister will be aware, to be eligible to access to that machinery an employee must be in employment for a particular length of time.  Also, these are minimum wage jobs as opposed to the properly paid jobs that Bord na M&oacute;na workers had for decades.</p>  <p>  There is a problem with the Minister's interpretation of a just transition for workers.  We have to get it right.  It is not only about the bogs and redeployment, it is about to what happens to workers when they are made redundant.  If we do not accept that and we do not give Mr. Kieran Mulvey the scope in his terms of reference to deal with this, as is currently the case, then the only place to deal with this is the Workplace Relations Commission.  At a meeting yesterday of the Joint Committee on Climate Action, the committee would not back a proposal from me to send a letter on the issue to the Minister.  I am pleading with him to prevail upon Bord na M&oacute;na management to attend a just transition forum in the Workplace Relations Commission, which the latter has agreed to facilitate.</p></speech>

In terms of what I am doing, for which I have obtained funding, I am putting in place a fund that can allow alternative developments to occur, including training for workers.  I am also making sure that we repurpose the PSO so that we can continue to employ workers on the same terms and conditions as they have enjoyed before in doing work that will be of real value long-term to rehabilitating the bogs and opening up new opportunities.  I am also making sure that we support the emerging opportunities.  Some of the assets of Bord na M&oacute;na and the ESB can be core to seeing new quality jobs emerge.  We need to make sure that the opportunities to develop those opportunities are in place.  Mr. Kieran Mulvey will be in a position to make recommendations to Government, through me, on additional measures that he believes are appropriate.</p></speech>

This is a measure that is included in the UK Labour Party manifesto.  There are varying estimates regarding what level of carbon savings would be made, including one of 16%.  This measure forms part of our green new deal with socialist policies, which precisely illustrates how we can stop climate catastrophe and dramatically improve people's lives.</p></reply>

These are agriculture, power generation, the energy use of buildings, transport, industrial processes and resource-use by all sectors.  The plan has identified the policies that can deliver change at least cost and offering most opportunity.  More flexible work patterns can be a part of the strategy which individual bodies can consider as part of a climate plan, such as through remote working.  The plan encourages public bodies and enterprise to consider the actions which can assist.  The Government is committed through Future Jobs Ireland to developing and implementing a range of measures aimed at making participation in the workforce more flexible and, therefore, easing barriers to entry into the workforce.  This includes measures aimed at intelligent working arrangements, such as the development of guidelines for employers on flexible working options; child care provision; reducing disincentives for those who wish to work longer; and targeting certain cohorts through the public employment service</p>  <p>  The climate action plan recognises that the implementation of the national planning framework will help to underpin these measures by promoting development involving reduced travel distances and greater proximity to employment and services, which will enable a greater proportion of journeys by means of active travel.  The successful roll-out of the national broadband plan will also stimulate remote working opportunities and increase the creation of local employment opportunities, which allows more people to work closer to their homes, reducing the emissions associated with longer commuter journeys.</p>  <p>  Policy matters in regard to working hours falls under the remit of the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation. </p></speech>

I would argue that that should be combined with no loss of pay such that people are not harmed.  This is part of a green new deal vision for transforming our society, avoiding climate catastrophe and giving people time to contribute to society, taking advantage of massive productivity increases the benefits of which overwhelmingly go to the bosses and the capitalists.</p> <p>There is a trade union campaign in Ireland for a four-day working week.  It refers to the study in Sweden that shows that for every 1% reduction in working hours, energy consumption and emissions are reduced by 0.8%.  If that was translated to Ireland and we worked to a four day working week, emissions could be reduced by 16%.  Various studies show clear benefits in productivity, mental health and workers being happy and contributing at work and society.  It would benefit workers in this country.</p></speech>

I am happy to look at evidence of any policy initiative and its impact on climate.  If there is data, I will examine it.  Clearly, things such as remote working which reduce people's use of public transport is a way of doing the same.  If people work one day from home, they will get much of the savings.  Every year, we will review policy proposals that are submitted.  We rely on the advice of the Climate Advisory Council to evaluate some of those policies.  It depends on what happens when a person is not working and if output is the same will there be a saving of carbon emissions.  Many other accompanying policies would have to be put in place to see whether such an initiative would have a significant impact.  In the short term we must work on the fabric of our buildings, on the make up of our transport fleets and the shape of our generation capacity.  Those are the big items we must shift.</p></speech>

It was a gain by the labour movement to get rid of the Sunday and eventually the Saturday.  Effectively since that time working hours have remained quite stable as each productivity gain delivered by workers has been gobbled up in the form of profits.  I agree that this goes beyond climate change, there is no question of that; it goes to the question of the kind of society that we want to have, what we want to spend wealth on and whether we wish to continue merely to boost the profits of big multinational corporations or to improve people's lives and take significant action to reduce carbon emissions.  The demand for this will grow and grow.  The trade union campaign on this is building.  The research in Britain showed that workers were ill less often, less stressed, happier, more productive, developed their skills, travelled less and it attracted workers into the industries where four-day weeks applied.  As part of a vision for a socialist society where people participate, a participatory democracy, freeing up time for people to be able to participate in their communities and work places to have democratic control is important.</p></speech>

The Deputy will recognise that what he raises is a much wider issue for Irish society to consider.  I must focus on my own work.</p></speech>

Will the Minister set out how workers and communities will immediately be included in the development of a fair and transparent just transition process and not a mere brief consultation phase?</p></reply>

I have asked the commissioner to engage with all relevant stakeholders, including local community organisations, Bord na M&oacute;na, ESB, the Midlands Transition Team, local authorities and public representatives, and relevant trade unions and workers' representatives. </p>  <p>  The commissioner will report to Government through me and I have asked him to consider specifically the following matters in relation to recommendations to be made.  This includes the delivery of the just transition measures provided for in budget 2020, the optimal structures or processes to support co-ordinated and effective delivery, including developing liaison channels between institutions in the region and central Government, the implementation of other actions underway, or planned, by Departments and agencies that could assist in the just transition and any additional actions or measures that he considers appropriate for Government consideration.</p>  <p>  The commissioner has also been invited to take account of relevant existing plans and programmes such as the regional enterprise development.</p>  <p>  On immediate resources that are available, the budget announced &euro;20 million for a new energy efficiency retrofitting scheme to be focused on the midlands, &euro;5 million for peatland rehabilitation outside of the Bord na M&oacute;na estate, &euro;6 million for a dedicated new just transition fund, with ESB agreeing to contribute an additional &euro;5 million.  We are also seeking to repurpose the public service obligation, PSO, to support a much higher level of bog restoration on Bord na M&oacute;na bogs so that workers will continue to work on the bogs but instead of extracting, will work to rehabilitate the bogs.  Finally, we have succeeded in having peat included in the EU coal platform which will be relevant to the commissioner's work.</p></reply>

There is a 2020 deadline for the ESB.  As the ICTU told the Committee on Climate Action this week, when the jobs are gone, they are gone and the people are unemployed.  That transition and certainty is still absent.  It is vital that the newly appointed commissioner meets with worker representatives, community and environmental groups before the end of the year.  Local input into planning and implementation is essential to the success of this process.  The Government has not put forward any specific timeline or deadlines for the new commissioner's recommendations.  It is important that the Government's quarterly reports include ongoing activities, conclusions and recommendations and are brought to the Joint Committee on Climate Action.  Will the Minister confirm that these steps will be taken?  What responsibilities will the commissioner have for allocating any funds in communities in the midlands and Clare?  On new sources of funding, will he outline how and when the PSO level will be repurposed to support job creation and clarify whether the EU platform for coal will provide financial support?</p></speech>

We are working to get final approval from the EU under state aid.  We have submitted a Bord na M&oacute;na proposal to get the additional repurposed PSO which will allow significant numbers to be re-employed on the bogs doing restoration to a much higher level.  We have also committed to rolling out a retrofitting programme in the midlands.  We recognise that will require retraining.  No doubt the regional skills forum, which has already adopted a low-carbon transition objective, will look at the sorts of skills that are needed to complement those already available to Bord na M&oacute;na workers to make the change.</p>  <p>  The commissioner will make recommendations as to how the just transition fund should be best deployed.  It will obviously seek to select the best ideas that emerge from the local communities for the development of alternative opportunities along with those I already outlined.  I mentioned that we are part of the EU coal platform.  It will be a question for the new Commission under the multi-annual funding framework as to whether it provides funding.  There was no such funding element by the last Commission but I understand the President of the Commission has given positive indications for the future.</p></speech>

There is uncertainty and the fear of worker representatives is that jobs will be lost and not regained.  Does the Minister accept the point made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, that a forum for immediate and direct engagement with Bord na M&oacute;na workers is urgently needed that is above and beyond what is there from the just transition commissioner and that the Minister must take the lead in ensuring dialogue between the two sides?  As the Minister knows, Bord na M&oacute;na representatives have said it will not engage with the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, process and the Minister stated before that the just transition commissioner has no role in these matters.</p>  <p>  On a separate but related point, the Department's public consultation on the long-term climate strategy for submission to the European Commission by year-end is open for only 15 working days.  Why was such a short period provided when we have known about the importance of the strategy for over a year?  How will the Department be able to review and incorporate input from the public consultation in just nine working days?  It seems to be a token public consultation process and I am concerned about it.  There is genuine public willingness to provide input to the Department and the Minister on these matters.</p></speech>

It has been clear that he will not have an industrial relations role.  We have a joint industrial relations council between Bord na M&oacute;na and its unions chaired by the WRC.  Unresolved issues can be escalated in the normal way to the Workplace Relations Commission.  As Mr. Kieran Mulvey was formerly the director general of the Workplace Relations Commission, people may presume his new role will be similar but the Deputy understands that the professional Workplace Relations Commission must fill that role.  It has great experience in dealing with difficult matters.  We must ensure alternative opportunities emerge, which is the primary purpose of this process, and we must also ensure that the redeployment and retraining that Bord na M&oacute;na workers will need to avail of these opportunities will be available.  It will form the core of Mr. Mulvey's work, although he will be empowered to make recommendations to the Government as he sees fit.</p></speech>

It is long-awaited by rural Deputies like me.  Many people have been waiting to see how they could change their working lifestyles or implement a more flexible pattern of working from home.  What will be the impact of rolling out high-speed broadband to rural areas, with consequent remote or flexible working arrangements, in helping to tackle climate change as well as everything else?</p></reply>

As I have stated, high-speed broadband will be the most basic service in the long term and will be thought of like rural electrification.  We will look back on this as being a very important decision, with people probably being puzzled as to why there was so much controversy about it.  The changes it will facilitate are very broad-based and home working is very definitely one of those.  I recall from the estimates of benefits to be accrued in the cost-benefit analysis that currently only 4% of the working population avail of remote working.  There are reports today that this has moved to 10% and many companies are now making a standard provision in this respect.</p>  <p>  There will be an additional benefit in that in more rural locations, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland will find it much easier to locate new investment because they will have the confidence that staff and employees can have access to high-speed broadband and the sort of connectivity that this provides.  This has been a barrier to investment in the past.  There is extraordinary potential in other areas, including remote health or remote education.  As we have already seen in the past couple of years, we are increasingly dependent on connectivity to run our lives.  This dependence will increase, which is why it so important that rural Ireland can be involved with the very same technologies as urban dwellers.</p></speech>

I come from Carlow, where 8,000 homes will be connected over a period and there will be &euro;32 million in investment.  People say we are an hour from Dublin but as I have regularly seen, one can sit in a car for over two and half hours to get to Dublin even coming here to work every day.  It applies to many people.  It is very important that this service can be up and running as soon as possible so people can get the opportunity to use it.  I welcome the Minister's comments on IDA investment into rural Ireland getting more jobs into that area.  Has the Department had any conversations with IDA Ireland on the fast-tracking of specific areas for broadband connections, which may help attract businesses to more rural areas?</p></speech>

We have identified 300 broadband connection points right across the country in every county and there is a focus on more remote areas.  Many are on islands that might otherwise have no access to such a connection.  During 2020 we will deliver 150 Mbps capacity to those centres and some of them will be very significant; they could represent hot desk and enterprise hubs, while others will be smaller and community-related.  In the long term, we are guaranteeing that all 540,000 premises will have access to high-speed broadband, which is future-proofing the process.  This is fibre to the home, which is the highest standard of connection and it is protected against future needs.  Within ten years it will offer capacity of 500 Mbps or 1 Gbps to business users.  This will be transformative in enterprise development.</p></speech>

We have seen older people being left on trolleys for days on end and families nervous about taking their loved ones to emergency departments because of the delays.  We have seen elective surgeries being cancelled.  On Tuesday, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin expressed concern, in particular, about children's elective surgeries being cancelled, the incidence of which was confirmed this morning by a leading professional involved in one of the main hospitals.  There are 117,000 children on inpatient and outpatient waiting lists.  On Tuesday night, the fire service had to be called to University Hospital Limerick to inspect the conditions in its emergency department, a building recently built and opened under the Government's watch.  Patients had to be removed on the instructions of fire service staff.</p>  <p>  There has been huge coverage in this House and outside it of all the issues in the health service.  We debated the issues only two weeks so.  However, I always get the sense that there is no understanding on the other side of the House of their impact.  There is no real interest in what is happening and the Government is just going through the motions of defending it.  That was confirmed to me when I read the transcript of yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on Health, where one of the T&aacute;naiste's colleagues spoke about her shock at the conditions in the health service.  She could not understand why children with head injuries, broken arms and broken legs had to wait in the same room as children who were vomiting.  She said conditions and waiting times were unacceptable and she hoped nobody would recognise her as a politician.  All of her stress has been experienced by thousands of parents and thousands of children of elderly parents, yet it is only now that the penny seems to be dropping.  Apparently as a consequence of this Government Deputy's testimony, there will be a special meeting of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party to discuss the matter.  The horse has bolted and the Government is panicked.</p>  <p>  Does the T&aacute;naiste accept that the winter plan trumpeted by the Government two weeks ago as the answer, even though there are no new staff and no new beds, is failing in the context of what is unfolding in emergency rooms and in children's emergency departments across the island?  Does the T&aacute;naiste share his colleague's assessment of the health service?  Is he embarrassed to be a Minister and T&aacute;naiste in this Government?</p></speech>

Like everybody else in government, I appreciate the pressures the health service is under and the pressures that are sometimes imposed on parents and families.  There are a lot of good things happening in healthcare but there are also real pressure points.  Deputy O'Connell, as a mother and a Government Deputy, was expressing a frustration and a recognition of the need for significant investment in children's healthcare.  Effectively, they reaffirm the need for a new children's hospital and continued investment in hospital care for children.  It is not acceptable that a parent taking a child into a hospital emergency department, particularly when seeking specialist paediatric care, should have to wait for long periods of time.  That is not acceptable to me, to the Government or to the Minister for Health.  That is why we are changing how we provide hospital care and emergency care for children by making a massive capital investment in a new children's hospital, with satellite facilities in different parts of Dublin and elsewhere, including the large paediatric unit that was announced for Cork University Hospital in the past number of months.</p>  <p>  The truth is that at this time of the year there are added pressures that have resulted in waiting times being longer than they should be in emergency departments, primarily because of flu, the vomiting bug and respiratory virus issues.  In response, Children's Health Ireland, CHI, has restricted all elective and routine inpatient procedures in the coming weeks.  The Health Service Executive, HSE, has issued an apology to all families whose children have had their procedure postponed at short notice.  Every effort is being made to improve the situation and appointments will be rescheduled at the earliest possible opportunity.  Influenza hospitalisations are increasing, as they always do at this time of year.  The best prevention measure for parents is to ensure their children get the flu vaccine, which will help to reduce pressure on the system.  I encourage parents, in particular, to think about that and to act on it to ensure we reduce pressure on the system. </p>  <p>  Children's hospitals' emergency departments remain open, although patients attending have experienced some delays.  CHI operates cross-city bed management for admissions to its three emergency departments in Dublin and the urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital, which is now up and running and will have a capacity to deal with 25,000 children over a 12-month period.  Things are happening and this is a priority for Government.  We know exactly the pressures on hospitals, both for staff and, more important, for patients.  We are responding to that from both a policy perspective and an investment perspective.</p></speech>

What is happening is that the fire service is being called into emergency departments around the country.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach trumpeted the new children's urgent care unit at Blanchardstown hospital.  However, that was supposed to be open Monday to Sunday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. but it is only opening Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. because it cannot be staffed.  It has not been staffed properly because the mess the Government has presided over in regard to the national children's hospital project is impacting on staffing budgets across the health service.  There are 117,000 children on inpatient and outpatient waiting lists and postponing elective surgery will add to those lists.  Nothing is being done about the consultant contracts to address consultant vacancies.  The Government is presiding over nursing vacancies.  If those positions were filled, the waiting lists would be addressed more quickly and people would not be left waiting.  There are 13 beds in Temple Street hospital's emergency department.  Yesterday, 12 of those beds were taken by admitted patients because there was no space for them elsewhere in the hospital.</p>  <p>  That is the reality to which the T&aacute;naiste seemed blind and oblivious until one of his colleagues suddenly woke him up.  Now he is professing concern.  Concern is not good enough for somebody who is waiting three days for a bed.  Concern is not good enough for somebody whose child is so sick that they have to leave the emergency department after waiting nine hours and still not getting treatment.  That is good enough.

We are prioritising how that is spent, depending on the pressures that emerge from week to week and month to month.  We have committed additional funding of &euro;26 million to the winter initiative, the purpose of which is to ensure that throughput in hospitals is as efficient as it can be through the pressure months of the winter.  It is about providing step-down facilities, adding extra beds and staffing to the system and keeping people out of hospital as much as possible through the winter months where we are now starting to see pressure.</p> <p>That goes for children as well as adults.  We will continue to prioritise their healthcare with the resources available to do so.  If the Deputy looks at the bigger picture, which some people in this House do not, although I accept this is because they want to solve problems, 27,000 patients who were in hospital last May had the opportunity to have their say on how they rated the health service in a national inpatient survey.  Some 84% of those who took part rated their stay in hospital as either good or very good.  There are good things happening in healthcare in Ireland.  We have incredibly dedicated staff who are looking after people well but real pressure points remain and we will prioritise our response accordingly.</p></speech>

The results are stark.  Homelessness is up 67% while more than 10,000 of our citizens are homeless.  That is the new normal under Fine Gael in the country with the fastest growing economy in Europe.  The number of homeless children has increased by 81% under the Government.  It has nearly doubled.  I mentioned one of those children, Sam, in the House last month.  He is just one of more than 4,000 children who face into this Christmas without a home.  The first duty of any decent society is to protect its children and the vulnerable.  As the T&aacute;naiste will be aware, too many of our children are facing into a type of Christmas they simply do not deserve.  I refer to a Christmas in emergency accommodation, in a hotel room, or in bed and breakfast accommodation.  For some it will be their fourth year in a row.</p>  <p>  Last Tuesday, a conference held by Social Justice Ireland told us that there are toddlers unable to walk or crawl because of prolonged stays in emergency accommodation.  Their development has been stunted and their future stolen from them.  As the T&aacute;naiste will be aware, the greatest cause of family homelessness in this State is the unaffordable and out-of-control private rental sector, which is .  Rents have increased by 40% since this Government took office in 2016.  The average new rent in Dublin now stands at more than &euro;2,000 per month, while, in Cork, it is more than &euro;1,300 per month.  This has locked a whole generation of young people and young families into an out-of-control rental market.  It has locked them out of the aspiration to ever own their own home.  Reports published by the Central Bank just last week told us that the average deposit for a new house now stands at &euro;87,000.  How can individuals and families, locked into unaffordable rents, ever hope to secure a deposit of &euro;87,000?  For young people and young families whose rent swallows up their pay packets, the message from Government is clear: their future in Ireland is uncertain.  </p>  <p>  The Government has refused to take responsibility or to deliver the necessary housing.  It has refused to take responsibility for unaffordable rents and for its failure to deliver affordable homes for first-time buyers.  While failing to take responsibility for the housing crisis, it has also failed to listen to the alternative policies and solutions that we, in Sinn F&eacute;in, and those advocating on the front line have put forward, which would reduce the cost of rent by introducing a tax measure for renters and, crucially, a rent freeze.  The Government has rejected that proposal, as has Fianna F&aacute;il.  These solutions would put a brake on the out-of-control rental market and would give renters breathing space to save and plan for the future.  Will the Government take immediate action and listen to the concerns of renters throughout the State, understanding that the system is out of control?  Will it belatedly accept what Sinn F&eacute;in has argued for and introduce a rent freeze?</p></speech>

There is still a lot of work to do but more than 50,000 new homes have been built over the past three years.  There was an increase of 82% in the number of new homes completed between 2016 and 2018.  Some 10,000 new homes will be added to the council housing stock this year, followed by 11,000 next year and 12,000 the year after that.  The <i>daft.ie</i>report published this month states: &quot;It looks as though Ireland's longest-ever run of increasing rental prices may soon come to an end.&quot;  It was not the Government saying that but <i>daft.ie</i>.  We have brought in new laws to significantly strengthen tenants' rights.  By the way, Sinn F&eacute;in has supported most of these, including some of the rental changes recently introduced by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy.  The number of apartment completions has increased by more than 81% over the past 12 months.  Residential property prices are decreasing in Dublin and price increases are slowing throughout the country as more and more homes are built.  We are helping people to buy their first home.  To date, 15,000 new homes have been bought by first-time buyers with the assistance of the help-to-buy scheme.  If I recall correctly, I was heavily criticised for introducing this scheme at the time but it is working.</p><p>While we have a housing crisis, and have had one for some time, the Government has responded by driving supply across all types of tenure, including social housing, affordable housing, cost-rental properties, and privately purchased houses.  We have prioritised first-time buyers because a number of years ago they comprised only a tiny percentage of those buying houses because they simply could not afford to put deposits together.  Since the introduction of the help-to buy scheme under Rebuilding Ireland, 15,000 new homes have been purchased by first-time buyers.  There are still pressures in the system and we need to continue to increase supply.  We need to build approximately 35,000 additional homes a year and we need to ensure that between 10,000 and 12,000 houses are added to the social housing stock each year but we are getting there.  Next year, we will spend &euro;2.68 billion on the housing budget, which is multiples of what it was only three or four years ago.  Rebuilding Ireland, which is a five-year housing plan, is working and is responding.  </p><p>Unfortunately, we still have people who are homeless and under real pressure.  If one looks at the homelessness figures, however, in the first six months of this year, almost 3,000 adults and their dependants exited homeless services.  That figure continues to increase quarter after quarter.  The rate of increase in homelessness has dramatically slowed down.  We now need to get on top of it and accept the reality that we must make a significant impact over the next 12 months on the 10,000 people who are homeless today.  We are making progress.  Some people are trying to use the housing challenge as a political stunt next week to try to raise profile in advance of a by-election and this misses the point.</p></speech>

In the T&aacute;naiste's own home city of Cork, they are &euro;1,300.  He may think those levels of rent are acceptable but they are not acceptable to ordinary people.  The reality is that, since this Government took office, homelessness has increased by more than 67% and child homelessness has increased by 81%.  More than 4,000 children will go to sleep tonight in emergency accommodation, without mentioning the thousands of people who are back living with their families because they cannot afford to rent.  The worst of all is the damage we, as a society, are doing to these children.  People on the front line have told us about children who cannot crawl and toddlers who cannot walk.  I am a father, as is the T&aacute;naiste.  One of the best experiences one can ever have is to see one's child taking his or her first steps.  The Government is denying children the development milestones they should normally be able to achieve because they are in cramped accommodation in hotel rooms, bed and breakfast accommodation, or hubs.  Some of them have spent four years in such accommodation.  The T&aacute;naiste can tell those children and their parents that his plan is working; it is not.  He can tell the renters who are paying &euro;2,000 a month that his plan is working; it is not.  He needs to get his head out of the sand, invest appropriately, and introduce a rent freeze so that the craziness of landlords increasing rents and putting families into homelessness can be stopped.</p></speech>

The core issue is that until we increase the supply of housing stock in all sectors, including affordable rental and cost rental, as we are doing, we are not going to see reductions in rents, which is what we want.  We can try to swim against the tide and force a rent freeze on a stock that is not sufficient in volume or we can try to get more houses built across all tenures so that renters have a choice of where they want to rent and people who want to purchase a house can afford to do so.</p></speech>

The coalition comprises nine not-for-profit organisations that fall under section 39 of the Health Act 2004.  The coalition comprises Rehab, Enable Ireland, the Irish Wheelchair Association, MS Ireland, Headway Ireland, National Council for the Blind, Chime, Acquired Brain Injury Ireland and Cheshire Ireland.  As we all know, they cater for tens of thousands of our citizens with disabilities in our constituencies and employ more than 9,000 dedicated staff members.</p>  <p>  The coalition informed us about its research last week, which shows a funding shortfall of at least &euro;20 million between those organisations each year.  That is only the amount required to keep services going and those organisations have had to cut services over recent years, including respite and day services and a range of specialist services for children and adults.  That has happened because the funding they receive from the HSE simply does not match the cost of delivering those services.  They have also faced additional costs in recent years, including pay restoration and unwinding the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI; additional regulations and compliance costs, which are necessary; and soaring insurance costs with which the Government has not dealt.</p>  <p>  Many organisations are struggling to retain staff because of the difference in pay between section 39 bodies, as defined by the 2004 Act, and section 38 bodies which have HSE staff.  This adds substantially to training, recruitment, staff retention and agency staff costs and lengthens waiting lists for people with disabilities.  These organisations have tried to bridge the shortfall using their own resources but that is increasingly difficult.  Not-for-profit section 39 organisations deliver two thirds of our disability services and are contracted to deliver vital health and social care services.  In fact, 35% of the overall disability budget is spent in this area.  Although the staff feel they are delivering the same kind of services as HSE staff, these organisations are not fully funded and their employees are not being treated the same.</p>  <p>  I raised this with the T&aacute;naiste and the then incoming Taoiseach more than two years ago.  The Government set up an independent review group, chaired by Dr. Catherine Day, in late 2017, which reported early this year.  Will the Government implement the key recommendations of the report, especially those in chapters 8 and 9?  One recommendation is that the Department of Financial Expenditure and Reform should examine the financial analysis of deficits and surpluses of voluntary bodies.  The report also recommends a move to multi-annual funding, including budgets for three to five years, and a forum where the HSE, the Department of Health and the voluntary sector, including section 39 bodies, can meet regularly and avoid the annual wrangling over budgets.</p>  <p>  Will the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, meet representatives of the disability action coalition?  The emphasis should be on action to try to ensure that the deficits of these nine organisations will be addressed.  We are discussing a supplementary health budget in the amount of &euro;338 million.  </p></speech>

Such organisations provide a broad range of services across the health system, including large acute care hospitals, specialist hospitals, disability services, hospice care, mental health services and addiction and rehabilitation services.  Community-based support groups focusing on social inclusion support and advocacy may also operate under these sections.</p>  <p>  Service arrangements are in place between the HSE and all service providers, which clearly set out the obligations of the organisation, the services for which they are engaged by the HSE and the funding that has been agreed for that.  The HSE is monitoring, on an ongoing basis, the financial position of organisations funded under the service level agreements.  The current service level agreement process provides a forum for such organisations to discuss any issues or difficulties with the chief officer of the relevant community healthcare organisation.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Health is aware that some section 39 organisations have raised concerns about financial sustainability with the HSE, including a number of organisations in the disability sector.  The HSE has assured the Department of Health that it is committed to working intensively with such organisations to support them as appropriate to address such issues in the context of the service level agreement process.  Where it is identified that a genuine issue is arising that may impede the effective and efficient delivery of services by sections 38 or 39 social care service providers, any remedial action will need to be considered by central Government, as a resolution cannot be addressed within the current health Vote resources.  </p>  <p>  In May this year, the voluntary hospice group wrote to the Minister for Health asking that all section 39 hospices be redesignated as section 38 organisations on the basis that hospices provide core services not provided by the HSE.  I have been involved in that conversation with the Minister for Health.  As of now, there is no established procedure for transitioning from section 39 status to section 38 status.  There are obstacles to overcome while determining how a mechanism could be created to facilitate such a transition, which include additional costs to the Exchequer, employment ceilings and conditions attached to transfer as well as legacy and governance issues.</p>  <p>  This is a real debate.  Dr. Catherine Day produced a report, which I understand is with the Minister at the moment.  He is likely to implement its recommendations but it is important for him to have the opportunity to outline that in the context of the related issues.  This issue is getting serious Government consideration.</p></speech>

The outdated funding system in operation results in conflict, year in and year out, with the HSE.  Once again this year, as every year, section 39 services are struggling desperately to keep going.  It is important that the Minister for Health meets representatives of the disability action coalition soon, I hope before Christmas, and he might set out a timetable.  Everybody in the House will agree with that because of the nature of the services involved, which are important to our society.  A timetable should be agreed for 2020 to implement these key changes.</p>  <p>  What is happening with pay restoration for section 39 organisations?  The Minister told me previously that there is engagement with the Workplace Relations Commission on this matter but the exact cost of restoration for the entire sector has not been determined, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform needs to become involved in this because it is a considerable burden on the disability action coalition members.</p>  <p>Is it possible, even at this late stage, to look again at a Supplementary Estimate and to ascertain if we need more funding for these bodies?  It is &euro;338 million at present.  Can we add to that to enable them to balance their books this year?

We must try to shrink that number by being more accurate in predictions 12 months out, while at the same time recognising that healthcare will need more and more money every year.  This year the HSE has allocated &euro;1.9 billion to the disability service programme.  In context, this is an increase of almost &euro;350 million since 2016.  We continue to raise expenditure in the area of disability, and this will continue as demand continues.</p>  <p>  The issue of section 38 organisations versus section 39 organisations, and the request for recategorisation from section 39 to section 38 status, is a complex issue for the Government.  It is a very expensive problem to solve and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is involved in this conversation, as is the Minister, Deputy Harris.  I will ask the Minister if he will meet the disability action coalition.  I would be very surprised if that would not happen before the end of the year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-11-28a.198" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1240" speakername="Michael Lowry" time="12:30:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112800015#N00900"><p>The T&aacute;naiste will be aware that the Irish Farm Film Producers Group, IFFPG, is a not-for-profit body approved by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to run the national farm plastic recycling scheme.  Farmers understand and appreciate the necessity to properly dispose of farm plastic because of its potential to inflict huge damage on the environment.  Farmers fully co-operate with and are willing participants in the scheme.  All producers of farm plastic participate in IFFPG by paying a levy per tonne of plastic sold on the Irish market.  The scheme then collects the waste plastic from farmers by way of farm collections or, more typically, the farmers can bring their plastic to bring collection centres where they are charged by weight.</p>  <p>  A third source of income for the IFFPG in previous years has been the resale price of plastic to third-party recycling facilities outside the jurisdiction.  The farm waste plastic market underwent a dramatic shift in January 2017 when the Chinese recycling market closed abruptly.  There are other recycling facilities available in Europe, which our operators cannot afford to access.  We have this ludicrous situation here because Ireland is the only country in Europe whose regulator has designated this type of plastic as amber waste material.  The current Irish designation is amber, which attracts significant and stringent transport requirements and charges.  These regulations are imposed by the National TransFrontier Shipments Office in Dublin City Council.  In contrast, the status across Europe is that farm plastic is designated green and enjoys free movement with no additional costs.</p>  <p>  A combination of closure of the exports to China and the non-viability of transfer to other European recycling centres has left alarming stockpiles of plastic in the hands of IFFPG and private businesses.  It is now inevitable that such plastic will have to be exported from the jurisdiction to be recycled at a considerable loss.  No Irish recycling facility is equipped to deal with such significant levels of farm plastic recycling.  We now have, therefore, an enormous amount of plastic sitting in gigantic piles in several locations around the country.  These mountains of plastics are growing daily and, ironically, have become a threat to the environment.  They must be seen to be believed.</p>  <p>  During its tenure, the IFFPG has collected quantities of waste farm plastic far in excess of its target.  It is currently collecting approximately 70% of available plastic.  The balance of the plastics on the market are collected by private Irish businesses.  These independent operators are subject to the same regulation as the IFFPG but do not receive any portion of the financial levy paid by farmers.  This is not a fair or equitable situation and leaves the independent operators at a financial disadvantage.</p>  <p>  In light of the current market conditions, will the Government acknowledge that it is time for a policy review in respect of farm plastics, including: establishing a strategy for building a national farm plastic recycling facility; and reviewing the export status of farm plastics?  Will the Government also ensure the equitable distribution of the producers' levy among all licensed assemblers and shippers of plastic, in circumstances where the IFFPG benefits from 100% of the levy on all farm plastic, even though it collects only 70% of the plastic?</p></speech>

I will address some of the issues now, as flagged by Deputy Lowry.</p>  <p>  The legislative framework for the import and export of waste in the European Union is set down in very clear regulations in the European Parliament and the Council.  Under the waste management and shipment of waste regulation 2017, Dublin City Council is designated as the national competent authority for the waste exports and imports.  The National TransFrontier Shipments Office, NTFSO, was established under the auspices of Dublin City Council.</p>  <p>  It is important to clarify that used farm plastics are not categorised as hazardous waste.  The NTFSO has determined that used farm plastics can be shipped in accordance with green procedures, as opposed to amber procedures, provided that used farm plastics have undergone treatment at an authorised facility in Ireland.  This treatment includes processes such as sorting and washing that result in the removal of contaminants like sand, soil, grit and stones from the plastics prior to export.  Unprocessed used farm plastics are subject to the prior notification and consent procedures set down in EU regulations, which apply to the shipment of amber listed waste.  There is an issue between amber and green listed waste and I accept that this has a real consequence for where one can export to.  Differentiating the two is the cleaning mechanism to make sure that, effectively, pure farm waste plastics are being exported.</p>  <p>  The Deputy referred to the IFFPG.  It does a very good job for farmers in respect of collection and making available 235 bring centres annually for farmers to bring waste plastics.  Yes, there is a challenge in that it is proving more difficult to export to some of the markets we previously exported to.  Bord na M&oacute;na has opened a recycling facility in Littleton in the old briquette factory, which has reopened in a partnership between AES Bord na M&oacute;na and the Sabrina Manufacturing Group.  This facility now recycles farm waste plastic, which had previously been exported, into plastic pellets that are used in the production of plastic films.  Currently 24 people are employed at the facility but it is intended to increase this number to 40.  A submission is being prepared to increase the intake of waste plastics to 50,000 tonnes.  This will see a further 20 jobs on top of that next year.  We are building capacity at home to recycle farm plastics in an environmentally sound way.  There are also export options under a green category rather than the amber category, but it has to be cleaned first.</p></speech>

It has no place to go.  Anybody who looks at this sensibly would say that the classification method is a nonsense.  This plastic waste is usually covered with nothing other than muck or dry clay.  It should be classified as green.  Will the T&aacute;naiste ask the authorities in the city council if this waste could be reclassified as green?</p><p>Private sector operators should have <i>pro rata</i>access to the moneys collected through the levy.  As it currently stands, IFFPG has a monopoly on all moneys collected, even though it only handles some 70% of the plastic.</p> <p>In circumstances where the IFFPG has substantial net assets and cash in excess of &euro;3.7 million on hand, it should be tasked with establishing an Irish recycling facility and supporting places like Littleton in the private sector.  These types of initiative would be logical and would use the moneys held by that company on behalf of the State.  In fact, they are farmers' moneys and should be better spent.  The Government needs to acknowledge that while the management policy in respect of the collection of plastics over the past 20 years has been good, it has also been an exercise in short-term thinking dealing only with the collection of farm plastics.  There is no long-term strategy but that is what we need to consider.</p></speech>

One does not see much in the way of farm plastics being disposed of inappropriately any more.  The collection hubs and the collections from farm yards, which I understand are organised and paid for by the levy, work well.  I also understand that what has changed in recent months is the ability to export large volumes to China, resulting in large amounts of farm plastics being, as the Deputy suggested, in storage.  We need to manage that at home in terms of an increased capacity to recycle the plastic appropriately, which is a viable business.</p>  <p>  On the questions of where the levy should go, who should be able to access it and whether it is possible to recategorise amber waste as green waste without going through an expensive washing facility, I will ask the Minister to revert to the Deputy directly.</p></speech>

As he is aware, I met a number of union representatives and CE supervisors probably before, or maybe arising from, the all-party motion.  We engaged in a process over the past couple of months to try to put some proposals to my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to resolve the issue, but not exclusively in respect of pensions.  I was very clear to the union and representatives as to where the direction of our negotiations could go.  Those proposals are on the table at the moment pending discussions.  As I told the Deputy privately beforehand, I am in the supervisors' corner and will be rooting for them as hard as I can.  We want to find a resolution for this issue collectively.  We will keep working until we do.</p></speech>

Like many, I read the account of the T&aacute;naiste's parliamentary colleague who was embarrassed at the overcrowding in the emergency department in Crumlin.  The question that many of us are asking is what planet has the Government been living on for the past number of years.  This has been the lived experience of thousands of patients throughout our health system, not this week, last week or last month, but for many years under the Government.  Monday saw the highest ever recorded number of patients without a bed in any Irish hospital, which stood at 85 in University Hospital Limerick.  In my county of Donegal, Letterkenny University Hospital has seen 224 patients without a bed since Monday of this week.  As of this morning, there were 31 patients awaiting beds.</p>  <p>  There are many issues that the Government is not addressing, including capacity and closed beds, but I will focus on the recruitment freeze.  The T&aacute;naiste may dispute the fact that there is a freeze, but the HSE has acknowledged that "non-critical replacement posts will be paused".  Whether one calls it a pause or a freeze, it is having a serious impact on staffing our hospitals and providing the necessary capacity to ensure that patients are admitted to hospitals.  Will the T&aacute;naiste give a commitment to the patients who are lying on trolleys or to the thousands of others who had to experience this indignity that the HSE recruitment freeze will be lifted right now?</p></speech>

That is what the HSE did in the past, but not any more.  This does not mean that the HSE is not recruiting.  It is.  We need to provide more money, and we are.  That is why there are significantly more doctors and nurses in the system now than 12 months ago.  We will continue to do that.</p>  <p>  There are real pressures on accident and emergency departments.

He called it "a growing concern right across law enforcement and intelligence agencies across Europe" and stated that the Garda was concerned about right-wing social media activity, planned arson attacks targeting direct provision centres and the infiltration of community groups.  The Garda Commissioner specifically mentioned the difficulty of far-right messages being shared on websites and social media.  Yesterday, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission raised serious concerns about remarks made by election candidates and elected public representatives.  The commission is calling for a code of conduct and sanctions to ensure that while political debate remains free and open, it also remains free of rancour, discrimination and talk that is demonstrably racist.</p>  <p>  In the context of these two strong interventions by senior public officials, does the Government agree that we need to have legislation in advance of the next general election to ensure that hate speech by parties or candidates is outlawed and that the spread of far-right messaging on social media, often originating outside the State, is controlled and, indeed, eliminated?</p></speech>

The challenge we face in terms of social media platforms providing a platform for blatant inaccuracies, often advocated for by anonymous namers and accounts, is a major one.  Free speech is not the same as providing a free platform to spread whatever one thinks will gain one political advantage or to bully or target someone.

He mentioned a figure of &euro;100 million.  If we divide 192 social housing units into &euro;100 million it means that each of those social housing units will cost &euro;520,000.  If, as the architect Mel Reynolds suggested to me in a paper this week, that does not include the site value lost from handing over those sites to the private developer, Bartra Capital Property Group, the actual cost for what would be fewer social housing units than proposed in the original O'Devaney Gardens plans will be between &euro;583,000 and &euro;683,000 per unit.  That is when the State could build on its own land for &euro;220,000 per unit or refurbish the original units for approximately &euro;100,000.  If that is true, it is a shocking handover of money, land and assets to a private developer and we will pay extortionate prices for fewer social housing than were in the original O'Devaney Gardens plans.  Can the Minister tell us if this is true?</p></speech>

The financial arrangements are a matter for Dublin City Council but we have put the resources in place to support the building of those homes.

It gave a devastating account of a range of quarries where massive works were being carried out, which were damaging ecosystems and rivers.  They were without any planning permission or were using the High Court system to prevent local authorities from doing their job.  What we saw was a defiance of planning law and highlighted our feeble regulations.  Some local authorities appeared to be buying materials from illegal operators.  Everybody knows that quarrying is an essential part of the construction industry, which is an indigenous industry, but it has to be carried out legally.  Last night's programme was an appalling indictment of what has been happening across the country.  Will the Minister introduce, if necessary, new legislation and regulations?  Will he ensure that local authorities do their job?</p></speech>

It is a very serious issue but Part VIII of the Planning and Development Act is very strong on this area.  We had very lax regulation around quarrying development for a number of years.  We moved to make changes some years ago.  New ministerial guidance was issued.  New planning guidance was issued also.  An opportunity was given to the industry to regularise its affairs and go through a consent process.  The planning powers, and the enforcement powers, are in place.  The local authorities have to follow up on those enforcement powers.  That is the important issue here.  We need to make sure local authorities are doing that.</p></speech>

The Commissioner came to Tipperary recently to listen to the joint policing committee, JPC, and all the Oireachtas Members who represent the area.  The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is aware of that as is the Minister's party.  We are in a perilous situation in Clonmel in respect of the number of Garda members.  We expected that we would be assigned at least ten garda&iacute; after all the pleas we made but we are not getting even one in that district.  It is shocking that the people of Carrick-on-Suir and Clonmel can be neglected in that way.  The Garda superintendent, William Leahy, and his team of garda&iacute; are in a dangerous situation because they do not have back-up.  It is shocking in what is the biggest inland town in the country and district.  It is shameful.</p></speech>

I am delighted the Minister is in the Chamber this morning.  We have seen many policy launches and so on but the reality on the ground is very different.  This morning, we had a briefing by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, on the warmer homes scheme.  I am dealing with the case of an 89 year old woman who has made an application.  She has been successful in the sense that she is priority 1 but she has been told that there is not the funding to do the work.  She is facing a waiting time of 18 months, which means she has to go through another winter.  I do not have to tell the Minister that an 89 year old woman living in a cold house may not have 18 months.  I was told by officials at the briefing that the criteria were broadened so much last year that they have been inundated with applications and do not have the funding to match the number of applications being submitted.  The net result is that people will not get the work done under the warmer homes scheme that they have been promised.</p></speech>

I am glad to be able to tell the Deputy that budget 2020 has doubled the financial allocation for the warmer homes scheme.  It is one area where we recognise that we need to facilitate more homes.  This is a scheme where the State provides a 100% grant for people who are qualified for the fuel scheme.  That is approximately 22% of the population.  The Deputy is right.  The level of retrofitting is now substantially greater than it used to be; it used to simply involve attics and lagging jackets.  It now involves substantial upgrading of the fabric of the house.  That is more expensive but we have doubled the funding for it.</p></speech>

It relates to the national broadband plan.  The history of the national broadband plan is littered with broken promises and a failure to live up to commitments.  The initial plan was that by the end of 2020, broadband services would have been delivered to the entire country.  At present, 30,000 business premises and private residential homes in County Donegal are still waiting on the national broadband plan to deliver.  That is one third of premises.  Given that the new plan announced and signed last week has a final delivery date of 2027 and given the high percentage of affected homes and business premises in Donegal, will the Minister commit to ensuring that Donegal is prioritised in order that this large number of premises can start to be addressed?  Will he also tell the House when the first homes will be connected?</p></speech>

It is amazing that the Government gave &euro;39.4 million to the IWA and it is not able to stretch a point and give &euro;1.1 million for this particular venture to continue.  As Deputy Naughten said, all we are asking the Government to do is make the IWA pause this situation.</p></speech>

There was a powerful demonstration, which was on a cross-party basis, at the Committee on Health last Thursday.  One of the most powerful contributions was from a Government Deputy, Deputy O'Connell, who has been in the news this morning but it was done on a cross-party basis with 12 Members involved.  The chief executive officer of the IWA has refused, as Deputy Naughten said, to give any reply.  She said she would go back to the board and put it to the board and now she will not even respond to the Members.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste to get this paused now.  It is causing untold hurt and damage to vulnerable people.</p></speech>

It is cherished and treasured by families I know and by individuals and their carers and loved ones over many years.  These appeals are not only made on a constituency interest basis.  The T&aacute;naiste will know, perhaps even from his constituency, how important this is to every one of these families as the only dedicated holiday resort facility in this land for people with disabilities.  I join in the appeal made by Deputies Naughten and Eugene Murphy today that in this final 24 hours on the eve of the proposed closure of Cuisle, the T&aacute;naiste would take the initiative to ensure Government does not let this slip by.  It would be devastating and it can be so easily resolved if the political will is there and if a willingness on the part of the IWA could be demonstrated.</p></speech>

She made a similar plea to some Deputies this afternoon.  The issue, as I understand it, is that the IWA has proposed to move from providing services in this facility to locating services in accessible hotels in both the Galway area and the midlands as an alternative to what Cuisle is providing.  The Government is open to talking to the IWA.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, has indicated he is available to meet at any point with the IWA or the HSE on this issue but we also have to be guided by the organisation that is providing the services to try to provide the best services it can for its clients.  I also understand there is a significant capital investment requirement at the Cuisle facility of between &euro;1 million and &euro;2 million to make it compliant with standards and safety requirements and so on.  I will speak to the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, on the issue and I will try to reflect the concern that has been expressed.</p></speech>

Subsequent to that, Bord na M&oacute;na announced the closure of a number of facilities in the midlands.  Arising from that, the Government made a just transition fund available to assist in providing alternative options and creating alternative jobs for people who have lost their jobs.  Could the Minister confirm that Littleton in County Tipperary is not excluded from that programme?  Could he  confirm what the criteria are and if the criteria for access to the programme have been finalised?  Are the Government and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in communication and in negotiation with the European Commission on the possible application of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for all the plants that have closed in the midlands and in Littleton?</p></speech>

A waste facility has been developed there and it is hoped that waste facility can continue to expand.  On the broader issue of the use of the just transition fund, as the Deputy knows, this was established for the first time as a result of the introduction of the carbon pricing and we recognise that a number of counties will be calling on the resources of this fund.  We will seek to be broad in our approach but in the immediate term the concentration has been on the losses that have recently occurred as a result of the foreclosing of the expected electricity generation from peat in the midlands.  We have not ruled out the provision of funding in the other regions and I know the Moneypoint issue was raised with me, for example.  The terms and conditions have not yet been worked out and Kieran Mulvey, who has been appointed as the just transition commissioner, will be making recommendations on how we should do that.  The likelihood is that support would come from the platform for coal regions in transition because the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is specifically confined to situations where international trade has disrupted employment.  In the carbon impact sector here, it is the platform for coal regions in transition that would come into play and that has been extended to include peat.</p></speech>

In October 2018, the Civil Liability and Courts (Amendment) Bill unanimously passed Second Stage in this D&aacute;il.  This Bill would tackle the scourge of insurance fraud, which is driving up premiums.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, indicated in March 2019 that he would return to the D&aacute;il and decide whether a money message for this Bill would be signed or not.  Six months later, we are still awaiting clarification on whether the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, will sign this money message.  I wrote to him two weeks ago and he replied to say he is looking into it.  I do not know if the Government realises how serious the cost of insurance is.  The delay the Government is presiding over is having a detrimental effect on business and will result in large-scale business closures and job losses if members of the Government do not get the finger out and adopt the sensible proposals coming from this side of the House that have support on all sides of the House.</p></speech>

That presenter earns more weekly than the average beef farmer earns in a year.  The fact that this is happening is an absolute scandal, but the fact that it is happening at a time RT&Eacute; is in bits financially is complete madness.  Any goodwill in the community regarding saving or even growing RT&Eacute; in the future is being damaged by these types of salaries.

If DKIT does not get its act together by April 2020, it will risk losing out on its part of the &euro;90 million in funding set aside for technical universities.  What is the Government doing to help to sort out the position of DKIT?  It is the first time 80% of the students at DKIT have attended third level education, and the last thing we want to see the college losing out.  Will the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, get involved and ensure that DKIT gets a fair crack of the whip?</p></speech>

We have an ambition to create technological universities.  There is already one and we would like to create many more.  Advantages will flow from creating technological universities, but the benchmarks that have to be met to qualify technically for the status are clear.

In the past 24 hours, I have been informed that the gynaecological service at Our Lady's Hospital in Manorhamilton, for which there is a clinic once or twice per week, has been cut.  I was told earlier that the final clinic will be held next Wednesday.  That will mean that that women using the service will have to go to Sligo University Hospital, which is also under great stress and will be unable to cope in the way it currently does.</p>  <p>  This is the third time this week I have raised issues regarding the contraction of health services in the north west.  They may be small matters to people when we consider big Government, but to people in the north west, they are important issues.  They affect people throughout the country.

In the past few minutes, there has been welcome news that the injunctions against Pauric Brady and Colm Leonard have been lifted.  I sought that action yesterday and asked the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine about it on Question Time.  It is good news.</p>  <p>  Many issues must be addressed and it is important that the task force meets in plenary session.  There was to be a meeting on 14 October but, unfortunately, that did not happen.  I wish to impress on the T&aacute;naiste the importance of getting people around the table as quickly as possible to deal with the outstanding issues in the beef sector and to make progress.  I also urge him to impress on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine the importance of ensuring that representatives of the retailers will attend.</p></speech>

He is committed to it and to reform in the sector in a way that can protect farmers and their families.</p> <p>The last time there was an attempt to get this process started, the Deputy knows what happened.  We have to make sure there is no repeat of that.</p></speech>

On Tuesday, I will again plead with Members to focus on promised legislation and the programme for Government.  The T&aacute;naiste and Taoiseach cannot answer questions to specific Ministers.  There is another means.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-11-28a.305" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="13:35:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112800022#U00200"><p>I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>  <p>  The Bill is being introduced to extend the power of the liable relatives unit of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to make a District Court application for a payment order in respect of jobseeker's transitional payment to one-parent families, thereby enabling the State to recoup from a liable relative a contribution towards the cost of providing this payment.  I would like to explain the rationale behind the Bill, which was first put on the Order Paper in December 2017 and introduced in the D&aacute;il on First Stage in January 2018.  Under current legislation, when the child of a lone parent turns seven, his or her parent moves from the one-parent family payment to the jobseeker's transitional payment and the legislative power of the liable relatives unit of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to issue payment orders, and have them enforced by the District Court if necessary, ceases.  This Bill addresses this issue by extending the liable relative provision to recipients of the jobseeker's transitional payment.  At present, the liable relatives unit cannot pursue an absent parent after the child has turned seven and the primary caregiver - the mother, in the majority of cases - has moved from the one-parent family payment to the jobseeker's transitional payment.  Nevertheless, there is an onus on mothers to seek maintenance.  Many women who are signing on have told SPARK, the lone parents' organisation, that they have been informed that if they do not have proof of seeking maintenance by their next sign-on date, their payments will be terminated.  This is deeply unfair.</p>  <p>  While this Bill will not address all the issues regarding maintenance, it will address a gap in the legislation and may go some way towards assisting lone parents, who are one of the household types most exposed to poverty and social exclusion.  The reforms to the one-parent family payment that were made some years ago had a detrimental effect on lone parents.  They increased the likelihood of lone parents being at risk of poverty and created a gap in the relevant legislation.  I am seeking to address this gap by bringing forward this legislation.  The liability to maintain the family scheme is managed and administered by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  The Social Welfare Acts provide that where certain welfare payments are in place - specifically, the one-parent family payment - an assessment may be made against a liable relative requiring him or her to make a contribution towards the cost of the one-parent family payment.  In every case in which the payment is awarded, the Department seeks to trace the other parent or liable relative to ascertain whether he or she is in a financial position to contribute towards the cost of the payment.  In practice, the Department contacts the liable relative and assesses his or her ability to contribute towards the maintenance.  If the liable relative wishes to pay maintenance directly to the lone parent, the lone parent will be able to hold on to 50% of it.  His or her lone parent's allowance, therefore, will be reduced by 50%.</p>  <p>  I would like to explain the unfortunate position that has arisen as a result of a lacuna in the law.  When the child of a lone parent is aged seven, the Department tends to write to the liable relative  - it may be obliged to do so - to inform him or her that he or she is no longer obliged to make the payment I have mentioned.  As a result of this, some people who were voluntarily paying maintenance simply stop doing so.  That cannot have been the Government's intention when it was drafting the appropriate legislation.  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the announcement by the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection that moneys will be allocated for the establishment of a judge-led group to examine all issues relating to maintenance and lone parents.  We also support the recent efforts of this House to establish a statutory child maintenance agency to address the issue of maintenance.  However, we still believe that the Bill I am introducing is necessary to close a loophole in current legislation.  This simple measure, which can be implemented easily, will extend the liable relative provisions that apply to the jobseeker's transition payment and other relevant payments.</p></speech>

I will explain how this may affect the overall issue of child maintenance, which is a complex area that should have the welfare of children at its centre.  The current system of maintenance places the burden on individuals to seek maintenance through informal agreements or the courts.  Recipients of the one-parent family payment from the Department are required to prove they have made efforts to seek maintenance.  The Department places additional burdens on individuals who pay maintenance by assessing them as liable relatives.  Issues relating to maintenance generally are matters for the Minister for Justice and Equality, who has responsibility for the Family Law Acts, which govern maintenance requirements.  The existing Family Law Acts place a legal obligation on parents to maintain their children.  These obligations continue to apply in cases in which the family unit has broken down.</p><p>Relevant maintenance payments can be arranged directly between the parties themselves, with the assistance of supports from the Department of Justice and Equality, such as the Family Mediation Service and the Legal Aid Board, or, ultimately, through the courts.  The enforcement of the obligation on parents to maintain their children is a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Social Welfare Acts provide that if certain welfare payments are in place, specifically the one-parent family payment, an assessment may be made against a liable relative requiring him or her to make a contribution towards the cost of one-parent family payment.  In every case in which one-parent family payment is awarded, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection seeks to trace the other parent or liable relative to ascertain whether he or she is in a financial position to contribute towards the cost of the payment.  All liable relatives who are assessed with a maintenance liability are issued with a maintenance contribution assessment setting out the amount assessed.</p> <p>The amount assessed can be reviewed where new information comes to light regarding the financial or household circumstances of the liable relative.  The liable relative can commence or increase the current payment to the one-parent family payment recipient or make the contribution directly to the Department.  Decisions on the assessed amounts can be appealed to the social welfare appeals office.  The liable relative provisions cease once the youngest child reaches seven years of age and the one-parent family payment claim ceases.  However, the legal obligation under the Family Law Acts to maintain the children does not cease.</p> <p> This Private Members' Bill seeks to extend the remit of the Department's liable relatives unit, incorrectly named as the "maintenance recovery unit" in the Bill, to the jobseeker's transitional payment.  This would extend the application of the liable relative provisions from situations where the youngest child is seven or younger to situations where the youngest child is 14 or younger.  While the Minister shares some of the concerns expressed by stakeholder groups about how the maintenance system currently operates, she believes that it is timely to review these arrangements to see what can be learned from international best practice.  It is the Minister's belief that the Government should await the outcome of the judge-led review and not implement piecemeal changes to the existing system prior to its conclusions.</p> <p> As the Deputy is aware, the current system is not working in the optimal way for the families affected or for the State's finances.  The Minister has had several discussions with stakeholders, experts and people affected by the current system.  Having listened to the points raised, it is clear that the current system is not working as intended.  We need to do more to help couples who find themselves in this difficult and challenging situation.  For example, there were 9,000 maintenance cases to the Courts Service in 2018.  The judge-led maintenance review will help to find solutions in terms of international best practice and help to identify how Ireland can achieve better outcomes in a proactive manner for children and for families.  We must recognise that family structures are changing rapidly, there is a changed understanding of gender roles and, increasingly, more unmarried couples and more patchwork families.  The maintenance review will look at all of these issues.</p> <p> We all know that lone parents have consistently been one of the most vulnerable groups in Ireland.  Even during the period of high economic growth and employment, the rate of consistent poverty for Ione parents remained comparatively high compared with two-parent families.  The 2017 survey on income and living conditions shows that the consistent poverty rate for lone parent households was 20.7% compared to 3.9% for two-parent households.  The current policy approach for supporting Ione parents through the one-parent family and jobseeker's transitional schemes are to provide tapered income supports as their children get older, while at the same time increasing the employment and educational supports that the Department offers.</p> <p> A recent analysis by the Central Statistics Office of employment for differing household types shows that the employment rate of Ione parents is increasing steadily as the economy recovers, but it also shows that the gap between coupled and lone mother employment rates remains relatively large.  The employment rate of female lone parents has increased from 48.5% in quarter 2 of 2012 to 60% in quarter 2 of 2018.  This is a positive development, but there is evidence that the rate of in-work poverty among lone parent households in Ireland is high in comparison with coupled households.  The Department provides three main schemes to support lone parents, the one-parent family payment, jobseeker's transitional payment and jobseeker's allowance.  The appropriate scheme that a lone parent can avail of is generally determined by the age of the youngest child claimed for, subject to eligibility requirements.  One-parent family payment is available where the youngest child is aged under seven.  Jobseeker's transitional payment may be claimed where the youngest child is aged between seven and 13 years of age, inclusive.  Once the youngest child reaches 14, standard jobseeker's allowance applies.  This progression from one-parent family payment to jobseeker's transitional payment to jobseeker's allowance was a fundamental element of the reforms to the one-parent family payment scheme undertaken since 2011, as until then income support for lone parents was passive in nature and involved limited engagement by the State with lone parents. </p> <p> One-parent family payment was originally available until the youngest child was 18.  The non-conditional nature of the payment, coupled with its very long duration had, over time, engendered long-term social welfare dependency and associated poverty among many lone parents and their children.  Research has shown that being at work reduces the at-risk-of-poverty rate for lone parents by more than half.  The purpose of the one-parent family payment scheme reforms is to maximise the opportunities for lone parents to enter into and increase employment by providing them with enhanced access to the wide range of education, training and employment supports that make up the Department's Intreo services.  In 2004, at the height of the economic boom, lone parents were over four and a half times more at risk of poverty than the rest of the population.  The 2017 survey of income and living conditions shows a significant improvement, although lone parents are still almost two and a half times more at risk of poverty than the rest of the population.</p> <p> It is important to take this opportunity to set out the range of measures put in place by the Government to support children and families, including lone parents, in budget 2020.  These include payment of a 100% Christmas bonus in December 2019 to recipients of a long-term social welfare payment, including one-parent family payment; extension of the schools hot meals scheme from September 2020 to 35,000 additional school children; a &euro;3 increase for qualified child dependants aged 12 and over in all weekly payments; a &euro;2 increase for qualified child dependants up to age 12 in all weekly payments; an increase in the working family payment threshold by &euro;10 per week for families with one, two or three children, benefitting some 55,000 families at a cost of &euro;19 million from January 2020; and an increase in the earnings disregard for working lone parents receiving one-parent family payment or jobseeker's transition payment by &euro;15 to &euro;165 per week from January 2020, benefitting some 16,900 families.</p> <p> There is a wide range of supports for children and families, including Ione-parent families, across Government and beyond the social welfare system.  Extra funding of &euro;54 million has been allocated to child care services for the introduction of the national childcare scheme, to meet the continuing cost of the early childhood care and education programme, to fund the access and inclusion model and to support the introduction of a sectoral employment order setting the statutory minimum pay and conditions in the childcare sector.  The maximum hours under the national childcare scheme for preschool child care will increase from 40 to 45 hours per week for working parents and from 15 to 20 hours per week for low income parents not working or studying.  The maximum hours for school age child care for low income parents who return to work will increase from 17 to 22 hours per week with effect from September 2020.  Additional funding of &euro;29 million is allocated to Tusla to continue work to reduce the number of children awaiting the allocation of a social worker and address cost pressures in residential and foster care.</p> <p> The Government also plans to extend free GP care to children under the age of eight and to provide free dental care for children under six with effect from September 2020.  Stakeholders have highlighted that child maintenance poses serious personal and administrative blocks within the social protection and legal systems.  Delays in legal proceedings have the potential to over-burden the Courts Service and cause significant delays and hardships for the parents and their children.  Requirements for seeking maintenance and liable relative provisions may also cause issues between the parents over and above the difficulties and hardships they already face.  Adding the liable relative provisions of one-parent family payment scheme to the jobseeker's transitional payment may also cause the extension of any issues already arising between the parents in terms of adversarial legal proceedings and legal costs incurred in pursuit of maintenance.  The Minister shares some of the concerns expressed by stakeholder groups about how the maintenance system currently operates.  We believe it is timely to review these arrangements to see what can be learned from international best practice.</p> <p>The Minister has held meetings with some of the stakeholder groups and will continue to engage with them on this matter in the future.</p> <p> As part of budget 2020, &euro;150,000 has been allocated to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to examine international best practice in respect of maintenance payments by liable relatives, and how Ireland can achieve better outcomes in a proactive manner for families.  The Minister is currently making arrangements to establish a judge-led group to progress that work as a priority.</p> <p> The Government is taking on board the concerns of the stakeholder groups regarding child maintenance and the wider issues for lone parents.  The Bill does not give any recognition to the substantial work done to support lone parents and the significant commitments set out as part of budget 2020, nor does it recognise that the Minister is consulting stakeholder groups and has secured funding to undertake research in this area as part of a judge-led group.  She has moved to find effective solutions and, in the recent budget, to build on the supports we are providing to vulnerable families.  On that basis she proposes a timed amendment to the question that the Social Welfare (Payment Order) (Amendment) Bill 2018 be read a second time, to allow six months for consideration of the outcome of the current judge-led review on the maintenance system that was announced in budget 2020 to see what can be learned from international best practice in this area.</p> <p> Maintenance is a delicate, sensitive and complex area that should have the welfare of the child at its centre.  I assure the House that the Government will continue the important work that has been undertaken over several years to support lone parents, work that has been recognised and welcomed by groups representing children and families in Ireland.  I am keen to explore the possibilities for making improvements to the existing costly, confrontational and adversarial system based on best practice internationally, to the benefit of all concerned.  I look forward to hearing from Deputies on this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-11-28a.309" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1327" speakername="Maurice Quinlivan" time="13:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112800024#W00200"><p>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in support of the Bill, which aims to right a wrong done to lone parents who are impacted by Government decisions at every turn.  Lone parents were not only subject cuts to their primary payments during the economic downturn, the Government actively took decisions that made their lives and those of their children more difficult.  The consequences of those decisions were not unintended or unknown because many remain in place.  The changes to the one-parent family payment in 2012 is one example.  They reduced the cut-off age to seven years with disastrous consequences for lone parents.  They could not leave a seven year old child at home but could not afford childcare so they were locked out of taking up employment or returning to education.  Research commissioned by the Government, and undertaken by Indecon, concluded that the 2012 changes made life harder for lone parents.  The Minister of State should be proud of that.  Lone parents were locked into poverty without affordable childcare; they were trapped.  The Government knew that was going to happen, as it was told at the time.  To add insult to injury, the Department began to issue letters to non-custodial parents when their child turned seven to tell them they were no longer obliged to make a contribution as the one-parent family payment had ceased.  A letter such as that should never have issued to any parent.  To do that is shameful.  The Minister constantly reminds us of the legal obligations on parents to maintain their children.  The letter issued to non-custodial parents does not reflect that.  It is not good enough, and the practice of issuing that letter must stop.</p>  <p>  This Bill fixes only one loophole for lone-parent families.  The wider issue is the non-payment of child maintenance.  Unfortunately, when it comes to maintenance payments, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is only interested in recouping the money it pays out in one-parent family payment to cover its own costs, rather than to give children what they deserve and to assist lone parents in making this happen.  The Department cannot even get that right.  In 2018 and in this year to date, the Department's liable relatives unit has examined 18,078 cases.  Of those, 2,174 people began making payments, but the vast majority paid nothing.  The Department may refer to its enforcement powers but these may as well not exist.  Since 2016, only 19 cases were referred to obtain an order directing that contributions be made, which is pathetic.</p>  <p>  There are many reasons we need the urgent establishment of child maintenance services, but the main one is that court rooms are no place for child maintenance payments to be determined.  That is the bottom line and that has to change.  More important, the payment process involving the Courts Service does not work.  Lone parents are obliged to seek maintenance.  In cases where they have to go to court to do this, the eventual granting of a maintenance order does not guarantee that the maintenance will ever be paid.  It is a ridiculous situation that does not work for the child or the children who should be central to the payment or maintenance.  In every country where statutory maintenance arrangements are in place, child maintenance plays a role in reducing poverty, something the Government has failed to do.  It will not come anywhere close to meeting its target of lifting 95,000 children out of poverty by 2020, and that is by its own admission.  Establishing a child maintenance service would help to lift children out of poverty but, more than that, a statutory child maintenance service would protect women who seek maintenance.  It would support them and provide them with advice and assistance.  For the first time, it would put the child first.  In this year&rsquo;s Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance announced funding for research into child maintenance.  My colleague, Deputy Brady, asked him previously about this and what it involves.  It was good to hear some clarification in the Minister of State&rsquo;s response and, while he did not read all of his speech into the record, I read it.  We ask that the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection publishes the terms of reference for her new judge-led group and exactly what it will examine.  If it is guidelines, it may as well not bother wasting its time because guidelines will be pointless.  We need a new statutory child maintenance service.  While the Bill is important and should be supported by every Member, we have much more to do to give lone-parent families the support they need and deserve.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-11-28a.310" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="13:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112800024#W00300"><p>Deputy O'Dea introduced the Bill in January 2018 to provide for the extension of powers of the maintenance recovery unit of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to make a District Court application for payment order in respect of jobseeker's transitional payment to one-parent families.  One can see where Deputy O'Dea is coming from.  There may well be a lacuna in the law, which the Bill would rectify and enable the State to recoup from the liable relative a contribution towards the cost of providing the said payments.  Maintenance is a significant area.  The Minister of State and I concur with the view of his senior Minister that it is a complex area, which invites many issues to be addressed.  Unfortunately, in Ireland securing maintenance often ends up in confrontation and an adversarial approach is taken.  It is important that the people who should pay maintenance are made liable for it and do not escape scot free.  It is something on which the public focuses; people are concerned about the issue.</p>  <p>  This seems to be an anomaly in dealing with it, as Deputy O'Dea noted.  I spoke to him about this and he informed me of the situation where a child turns seven years, which is the critical point.  That is when the parent moves from the one-parent family payment to the jobseeker's transitional payment.  It seems that there is a hole in the bucket where the Department's recovery unit is not in a position to chase into the District Court to seek an enforcement order for maintenance that might be due.  If it was incorporated into legislation, it might well extend this to the wider jobseeker's transitional payments.  </p>  <p>  When the child turns seven years and the parent moves from the one-parent family payment to the transitional payment, the onus remains, mostly on the mother, to seek the maintenance payment.  The Bill seeks to remedy this by targeting the particular gap in the law.  As Deputy O'Dea and others said, this is a legitimate issue.  Were the Bill to be enacted, the jobseeker's transitional payment would come under the definition of "allowance" under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 and it would be added to the definition of "competent authority" under the same Act.</p> <p>The effect of this would be to extend the competence of the Minister over this payment, as well as the one-parent family payment, when it comes to Part 12 of the primary Act, which relates to family maintenance.  The core issue is that single parents, typically women, are being asked to prove they are seeking maintenance payment from a former partner by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  It is nub of the matter.</p> <p> With the one-parent family payment, former partners are required to pay maintenance to offset some of the costs of that payment.  It must be recognised that it will be only some of the cost.  It is very important that maintenance is paid in this respect.  Deputy O'Dea might agree that the Department is very often quick to assess or compute the amount of maintenance that a person should be getting and often exceeds the maintenance that is being provided.  While that is an argument for another day, imputation should not be a way of addressing this matter.</p> <p> As I stated, this Bill would close the loophole and jobseeker's transitional payment would be included in the definition in the primary Act.  The Single Parents Acting for the Rights of our Kids, SPARK, group has sought this change for a while and, like Deputy O'Dea, a number of us in the Labour Party have met representatives of that organisation.  It does good work for single parents and it was probably involved with the genesis of Deputy O'Dea's Bill.</p> <p> There is a debt recovery section in the Department and if I am right it costs approximately &euro;600,000 to operate while the recovery amounts to only approximately &euro;200,000 or &euro;250,000 per annum.  We can see from the balance that it is not easy but every recovery unit should at least make the effort to pay its way at a minimum.  The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, has made the point that the Department already has power in the regulations it operates under but Deputy O'Dea and I have been around long enough to know that perhaps primary legislation has greater weight than secondary legislation.</p> <p> The Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, has indicated that a judge-led review will be put in place that will engage in a comprehensive examination of this maintenance issue involving necessary and relevant stakeholders.  Otherwise it would not be effective.  I hope that arising from that there will be a significant set of new rules on maintenance recovery that will become part of the rules of court.  That will set a floor when it comes to recovery.  There are other elements to this.  For example, how much should be paid for a child who is younger than 12, as more maintenance would be required for older children?  These issues should be set out and the recoupment process should operate in an efficient and effective fashion.</p> <p> It is time to carry out an overall review of the payment of maintenance and Deputy O'Dea's Bill could be a central part of this if it is passed into law.  Not alone is it appropriate and timely to examine maintenance issues, including consultation with all relevant stakeholders but there is much international best practice that we could also examine, notwithstanding the complexity or difficulties of the matter.  Statute-based solutions are far better than regulations.</p> <p> I was listening to the beginning of the debate in my office and I understand the Government's proposal is to postpone consideration of this Bill for six months, pending a full review of family maintenance that will be done as part of a judge-led review.  I understand that rationale but in that case, the loophole identified by Deputy O'Dea will continue to exist in law for another six months and possibly for longer.  Let us be clear, as the Acting Chairman and everybody else knows, the probability of having a general election in the next six months is higher than not.  This amending legislation would be further delayed with a transition to the next D&aacute;il.  Although I do not anticipate it will take 70 days to form a Government next time, as we have a system that should shorten the process, that will depend on what the electorate says.  Notwithstanding the fact that I agree with the Government's view, as relayed by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, this is a complex and difficult matter.  I wonder why there is a need to wait until after the review to accept the Bill.  If it was passed, it could form part of the review and if any inconsistencies arose within the review, it could be fixed.</p> <p> The Labour Party sees the proposed legislation as achieving a significant and worthy objective that has exercised the minds of various organisations, including SPARK, in remedying or fixing the loophole.  It is difficult to see what argument the Government can sustain, as it certainly has not put forward one to satisfactorily contradict the claim that there is a loophole in the current law.  As it stands, I am minded to recommend to my Labour Party colleagues that we support the amending legislation.  In the case of a review, there is a touch of "live horse, get grass" but the horse might not live and there might be no grass for anybody.  This is timely and I compliment Deputy O'Dea on bringing it forward.</p></speech>

I welcome the useful contributions and discussion with my colleagues, Deputies O'Dea and Penrose.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is focused on how Ireland can achieve better outcomes in a proactive manner for families with child maintenance.  It is important to acknowledge the significant efforts made to enhance the position of families and children, including lone parents, across a range of Government initiatives, including social protection, childcare, health and education.</p>  <p>  The Family Law Acts place a legal obligation on parents to maintain their children.  In cases where the family unit has broken down, these obligations continue to apply and relevant maintenance payments can be arranged either directly between parties or with the assistance of the Department of Justice and Equality, such as through the family mediation service, the Legal Aid Board and, ultimately, the courts.  This Private Members' Bill seeks to extend the remit of the Department's liable relatives unit to the jobseeker's transitional payment and, in effect, this would extend the application of the liable relative provisions from cases where the youngest child is seven or younger to cases where the youngest child is 14 or younger.</p>  <p>  The Minister is keen for a review of the maintenance system to be carried out, including an examination of the system's effectiveness and how accessible it is for those seeking to recover maintenance.  Maintenance is a delicate and complex area, as colleagues have noted, and it should have the welfare of the child at its centre.  It is essential we recognise this.  A number of issues have been raised concerning the current arrangements for maintenance in respect of liable relatives, including the availability of accessible advice and self-assessment information from amicable child maintenance arrangements, questions around age-appropriate child maintenance payment rates, the need for mediation services and the need for a whole-of-government approach in dealing with child maintenance.</p>  <p>  This is a highly sensitive and complex issue that cuts across areas of family and social welfare law.  It is about much more than law, however, and it must take account of the sensitive and delicate human emotions in the area.  It is therefore important to have a detailed examination of approaches that have been successful in other jurisdictions in order that we can ensure that our system in Ireland is informed by best international practice and is well placed to serve the needs of affected families across the country.  For that reason, the Minister is in the process of establishing the judge-led group to examine the sensitive and complex matter of enforcement of child maintenance payments.  It is expected that this group will be set up very shortly.  </p> <p>The composition of the expert group will reflect the key parties that have an interest and engagement in this area, including solicitors and barristers who deal with the issues on a daily basis.  The group will shape and influence the terms of reference for its work based on its experience and expertise in this sensitive and complex area.  We are keen to explore the possibilities for making improvements to the existing costly, confrontational and adversarial system, based on best practice internationally and for the benefit of all concerned.</p> <p> While the Minister acknowledges the relevance of Deputy O'Dea's proposals in the context of the current issues with the child maintenance system, I ask the House to defer consideration of the Bill for a period of six months.  That timeframe will allow for consideration of the outcome of the judge-led review of the maintenance system to see what can be learned from best international practice in this area.  In addition, a six-month referral would allow for further consideration of the sensitive and complex issues associated with the Bill, particularly the child maintenance and other elements which appear to be legally problematic.  I ask colleagues to accept my proposed deferral.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-11-28a.314" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="14:15:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112800026#Y00200"><p>I should be shocked by the Department's response but I am unshockable at this stage.  The Minister of State's whole speech is a disgrace.  To give one example, he notes that my Bill refers to the Department's maintenance recovery unit instead of the liable relative unit.  I remind him that the Bill was drafted back in 2016 when the unit in question went by the former name.  In any case, what does it matter what it is called?  We are living in a country which has an absolutely disgraceful rate of poverty among lone parents, which is the issue with which my Bill is concerned.  I include the latest Survey on Income and Living Conditions, SILC, figures in my calculations, which show that the rate of poverty for lone parents has hardly moved at all.  Is this statement from the Minister of State the best the Department can do in response to a genuine proposal to correct an oversight in the law?  Doing so would help people today, as Deputy Penrose said, not in six months' time, 12 months' time or at some undefinable time in the future.  The Department's response is disgraceful.</p>  <p>  The rest of the Minister of State's statement was littered with references to hot meals, preschool childcare, Tusla and GP cards for children under the age of eight.  The Bill has nothing whatsoever to do with those issues.  It has a specific purpose, namely, to correct a glaring loophole in the law which arises as a consequence of a drafting error in the original legislation.  The Minister of State's speech is nothing but padding.  I am almost tempted to do what my colleague, Deputy MacSharry, did when, as a Member of the Upper House, he ripped up a Minister's speech in the Seanad Chamber because it was so nonsensical.  The Minister of State's speech is certainly in the same category.  I am looking at one sentence which states: "Adding the liable relative provision of the one-parent family payment scheme into the jobseeker's transitional payment may also cause the extension of any issues already arising between the parents in terms of adversarial legal proceedings and legal costs incurred in pursuit of maintenance."  What does that mean and what possible relevance does it have to anything?  If we take this to its logical conclusion, there should be no liable relative provision at all, even for children under the age of seven.</p>  <p>  The Minister also said: "The Bill before the House does not give any recognition to the substantial work already done to support lone parents".  That is especially amusing.  It seems we are expected to draft a Bill which includes a section 1 setting out how wonderful the Minister is because she did this and a section 2 outlining how she is marvellous because she did that.  This is an insult to lone parents and the representative organisations that have long been advocating for the change set out in these provisions.  We are being told that the Government proposes to do something in six months' time because there is a judge-led group examining the matter.  However, I am informed by people who have been in touch directly with the Minister that the group has not been established yet.  God only knows how long it will take to produce its report and how long thereafter it will take to implement whatever recommendations are made.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, day in and day out, people - it is generally speaking fathers - are getting letters from the Department stating that their obligations have now finished and they do not have to make any more payments.  As a result, people who were paying maintenance, even on a voluntary basis, are stopping those payments, which is forcing single parents into the court system.  We know the difficulties to which that gives rise, but the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is apparently oblivious.  This is happening today and it will happen tomorrow and next week.  People are being hurt and disadvantaged by it, people who are, in many cases, living in abject poverty.  The Department's attitude is to say it will look at the issue in six months' time, when many more people will have been hurt.</p>  <p>  The real kicker in the Minister of State's speech is the reference to best international practice.  I could hardly believe my ears when I heard that.  This provision has been in place since 2012.  What has the Department been doing for the past seven years and what has best international practice to do with it?  Nobody has ever put up a defence that the legislation in question is as it should be.  Everybody accepts that a mistake was made when it was drafted.  The liable relative provision applied to lone parents but lone parent's allowance was restricted to those parents whose children were under the age of seven.  Parents with children older than that were moved to the transitional jobseeker's allowance and the legislation did not provide for the extension of the liable relative provision to them.  What is so complex or mysterious about this?  The draftsman simply made a mistake but it is one that is hurting people.  The Government's blas&eacute; attitude is that they should be left to suffer and if another 50, 60, 100 or 200 people get a letter and proceed to stop making maintenance payments, it does not matter.  What we should be doing, apparently, is looking to best international practice.  If I ever heard a lame excuse in this House, that is the lamest.</p>  <p>  The Government's response indicates the distance that has emerged between the Government and ordinary people and the degree to which it has lost touch with reality.  That is something I am hearing from people in the course of my canvassing for the by-elections.  On behalf of the lone parents who are being hurt and will be hurt in future by this loophole in the law, I have no intention whatsoever of accepting the Minister of State's proposal to defer the matter for six months.  On the contrary, I will be pressing for a vote.</p></speech>

I am very glad the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, is here to take the debate.  An application from St. Aidan's comprehensive school in Cootehill, County Cavan has been with the Minister's Department for a long time.  It relates to the provision of a new PE hall and socialisation space, an extension to the woodwork and engineering rooms and general refurbishment work.  From replies to representations to the Department and parliamentary questions, I understand that this application has been under consideration and under assessment for some time.  In recent years, some necessary improvement and upgrading works have been carried out at St. Aidan's comprehensive school.  There is an urgent need to provide these additional facilities and I urge the Minister to have the application progressed, finalised and approved at the earliest possible date.</p>  <p>  St. Aidan's was one of the first comprehensive schools, having been built back in 1966.  We should be thankful that there has been substantial growth in enrolment in recent years with 512 students now enrolled.  There is an extra first year class this year and it is projected that there will be another additional first year for the 2020-21 school year.  This is a sure sign of the positive role the school plays in the community and of the determination of parents to have the opportunity to send their students to St. Aidan's.  </p>  <p>  These applications were originally made some years ago in respect of a substantial upgrading of St. Aidan's.  They have been revised in the meantime.  When this project is approved, Cavan and Monaghan education and training board, ETB, will manage it.  As the Minister is aware, our local ETB has been very successful in managing building projects for both primary and second level schools over the past 11 or 12 years.  As he will be aware, the projects managed by Cavan and Monaghan ETB have represented very good value for money for the Exchequer and the taxpayer and have been delivered on time and under budget.  I am sure that, when the Minister approves funding for the St. Aidan's comprehensive school project, it will also be delivered on time and under budget.</p>  <p>  The applications relate to the PE hall, necessary upgrading of the woodwork and engineering rooms and an art room.  There is also a requirement to undertake general refurbishment works including, very importantly, the upgrading of an old heating system.  It is clear that upgrading and refurbishment works are necessary for a building that is more than 50 years old and which has been in use practically every day during that time.</p>  <p>  I have had the opportunity to visit the school on many occasions.  The good educational environment and the good leadership of the principal, Mary Ann Smith, her deputy principal, and the entire staff of the school, including both teaching and support staff, are clear to anybody who visits.  Along with other Oireachtas Members, I recently visited the school for the opening of a room for students with hearing impairments, for the presentation of another green flag to the school, and for the presentation of a health promoting schools flag, the result of another very welcome initiative and achievement of the school.  That was a very worthy endeavour and great credit is due to the teachers and students who participated in these competitions and who won those awards.  </p>  <p>  Apart from the school's core work of teaching subjects and delivering education, there has always been a very varied and worthwhile programme of extracurricular activities.  It is delightful to see the many awards won in different sporting disciplines when one enters the reception area of the school.  In recent years, the school has successfully competed in county, provincial and national competitions in camogie, basketball, soccer, and Gaelic football.  Many of the school's teams have taken national awards home with them.  We are very aware of the need for people to participate in sport.  Great credit is due to the school and to the staff who take on the coaching and management of different teams.  That work goes on well after normal school hours.  The lack of basic PE facilities is very frustrating for the coaches, management teams and those preparing teams.  </p>  <p>  As well as good leadership from the principal, deputy principal and all the school staff, there is a very active board of management and an equally active and committed parents' association.  All the members of these bodies, as well as the public representatives who support them, are determined to ensure this building project proceeds to construction as soon as possible.  The Minister's assistance in this respect would be much appreciated.</p></speech>

St. Aidan's is a co-educational comprehensive school under Catholic patronage.  There are currently 512 pupils enrolled in the school.  This represents a decrease in enrolment of 2% in the last five years.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that a building project for the provision of a one-class special educational needs base was completed at St. Aidan's comprehensive school in early 2019, as he will be aware.</p>  <p>  My Department's planning and building unit has subsequently received an application from St. Aidan's comprehensive school seeking further capital funding for additional school accommodation, as outlined by the Deputy, including the provision of a PE hall.</p> <p>This application is currently being considered by the Department and as soon as this process has been completed, the school authority will be informed.<br/><br/>The Department is in receipt of an application from the school for the summer works scheme 2020 onwards for a windows project commensurate with the level of funding available through the scheme.All applications will be assessed in accordance with the prioritisation criteria outlined in the governing circular letter for the scheme.  In that regard, applications submitted for other works will be considered under future rounds of the summer works scheme.  St. Aidan's comprehensive school will be considered in this regard.<br/><br/>More generally, under the national development plan, increased funding has been provided for the school sector capital investment programme.  This funding allows for a continued focus on the provision of new permanent school places to keep pace with<br/><br/>demographic demand and also provides for an additional focus on the refurbishment of existing school buildings to include the building and modernisation of PE facilities in post-primary schools.<br/><br/>As the Deputy will be aware, under Project Ireland 2040, we will invest &euro;8.4 billion, compared to &euro;4.9 billion in the previous decade, in primary and post-primary school buildings.  This investment will see a 70% increase in the school building budget which will be targeted at delivering on the twin objectives of catering for the continued increase in demographics and a greater focus on refurbishment and upgrade of existing school stock.  <br/><br/>The Government remains committed to delivering on existing projects on the school building programme.  The immediate priority of my Department is providing 20,000 new and replacement school places each year to ensure that every child has a school place.  The Government will focus, in the medium term, on the provision of PE facilities in post-primary schools.<br/><br/>Project Ireland 2040 provides the investment necessary to implement the commitments in the action plan for education to reform and modernisethe school curriculum by committing to a PE hall build and modernisation programme, starting in the second half of the Project Ireland 2040 period, that ensures that students in all post-primary schools have access to state of the art facilities to support PE provision, particularly in the context of the roll-out of PE as a leaving certificate subject.<br/><br/>During 2018 and 2019, the capital budget is facilitating extensions and new schools being delivered as part of the roll-out of Project Ireland 2040 which involved overall construction activity during 2018 and 2019 of circa 130 large-scale projects ranging in value from &euro;1 million to projects in excess of &euro;20 million.  There was also in excess of 280 projects with a project value of less than &euro;1 million at construction during this period.  All of these projects are expected to deliver more than 40,000 permanent additional and replacement school places and replace circa 600 prefabs.  This will make significant progress in providing modern energy efficient school facilities and the replacement of temporary accommodation.  All new schools being constructed by my Department include the provision of PE facilities and also endeavours to include these facilities in the design of major extensions within the constraints of available funding where possible.<br/><br/>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  Deputy Smyth has also raised this matter on a number of occasions.  I welcome the opportunity to outline the position of the Department of Education and Skills and I understand that the application from St. Aidan's is under review and the Department will be in contact with the school authority directly.</p></speech>

I hope that he will be outlining approval for the project the next time he communicates with us on this matter.</p>  <p>  The Minister gets requests for worthy building projects that need to be advanced every day of the week but this one is exceptionally worthy.  The school in question is overcrowded and does not have PE facilities for more than 500 pupils.  Some of the existing classrooms need upgrading as a matter of urgency.  </p>  <p>  There school has exceptionally good academic results.  I instanced earlier all the extracurricular activities that go on and, if permission for the PE hall is granted, it would be available for the community.  This school does not close at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m.  It is open, within reason, for community events and there is also access for other schools to use its facilities.</p>  <p>  The money that the Minister will hopefully allocate at an early date will be put to exceptionally good use and is needed.  St. Aidan's comprehensive school was established in 1966 and is a source of pride to everybody in Cavan and Monaghan.  It draws pupils from both counties and was one of the first comprehensive schools established after the announcement of the extension of free second level education to all in the mid-1960s.  It is basically the same school that was founded in the 1960s with some upgrading work completed over the years.  There is a requirement for further upgrading and refurbishment work.</p>  <p>  I instanced the PE hall but there is also a need for proper construction and engineering for classrooms, an art room and the heating system.  There are no canteen facilities in the school for the 512 pupils and 53 staff.  That is a big congregation of people in a limited building.</p>  <p>  I said earlier that the Cavan-Monaghan Education and Training Board will manage the project when it gets to the stage of construction.  That board has delivered projects on time and within budget for the Department in Cavan and Monaghan over the past few years.  I have no doubt that, when the Minister is in a position to approve that funding, the money will be put to very good use.  The wider community in Cootehill will very much appreciate the provision of those upgraded and additional facilities.</p></speech>

I have also spoken to my Cabinet colleague, Deputy Humphreys, about this and Senator O'Reilly keeps this issue on the agenda.  I am well aware that a good bit of preparatory work is required for these applications.  I am also aware, as the Deputy pointed out, that the education and training board is very much involved in this.</p>  <p>  I do not want to create expectations which is something I never do and is not my style.  The application is being reviewed at the moment although that does not signpost where we are going with this.  There are needs for additional accommodation and the provision for creative arts and physical education in the school and I will ask my officials to ensure the issue is kept on the agenda.  We will see where we go at the end of the review.</p></speech>

Last Sunday, a 22 year old postman, Eoin Boylan, was brutally murdered in his garden at Clonshaugh Avenue.  This was the fifth murder involving a local feud this year.  There were three fatal shootings in May, including that of Jordan Davis, who was shot in front of Our Lady Immaculate school in Darndale as he pushed a four month old baby in a buggy.  In January, Zach Parker, aged 23, was shot dead at a gym in Swords.</p>  <p>  This cannot be allowed to continue.  There can be no normalisation of this activity and children, in particular, cannot be allowed to continue to witness such horrible crimes on a weekly basis.  The people of Coolock and the surrounding areas are citizens of this State, like everyone else.  They are honest, decent, hard-working people who are raising their families, going to work and getting on with things as best they can.  They are entitled to the protections of the State like everyone else but that does not seem to be the case in this situation.</p>  <p>  Coolock Garda station needs more resources and personnel to tackle this problem.  DMR north is the relevant division and Coolock sub-district is the station involved.  A report presented to the joint policing committee, JPC, meeting last month showed an increase in several types of crime, including burglary, which is up 34% on last year and robbery from the person, which is up 200% on last year.  The area on the north fringe of the city is experiencing an explosion in population in the Coolock Garda district.  There needs to be a reorganisation of Garda districts because of this and the mooted new Garda station for Northern Cross should be given the go-ahead immediately.</p> <p>I am aware the Minister visited Coolock Garda station in June of this year.  Following the Minister's visit, nine probationary garda&iacute; commenced in Coolock.  They are most welcome but, of course, this is not enough.  We need more community garda&iacute; in the area, as recommended by the task force on policing.  This would help to stamp out on-street drug dealing, which would be welcomed by everyone.</p> <p> The report published this week by the EU drugs agency and Europol makes for frightening reading.  Drug-related violence and intimidation are nationwide problems.  The report details the three-tiered hierarchy of crime gangs, with the top tier now apparently gone international.  I put it to the Minister that not enough is being done to break up these drug rings nationally.</p> <p> I welcome the publication of new legislation by my colleague, Deputy Curran, in regard to drugs and children.  I hope the Government will support the Bill.  The proposed legislation will make it a crime to use children in the distribution of drugs, and it would be a criminal offence to buy drugs from a person under the age of 18, or to cause a child to be in possession of drugs for the intent of sale or supply.</p> <p> Separately, we need to support our young people in their efforts to live active and fulfilling lives, and to avoid being caught up in the devastating drugs culture.  There are many youth and sporting organisations and individuals in the Coolock area doing great work with our young people, including the Northside Partnership, the Dublin north east drugs task force, Sphere 17, RASP, the Kilmore West Youth Project, the Kilbarrack Coast Community Programme, and more recently Fr. Bryan Shortall who is the new parish priest of Priorswood.  I call on the Government to launch a new initiative in the Coolock area, co-ordinated by the Northside Partnership and the Dublin north east drugs task force, and in consultation with these organisations, to tackle the drugs culture in this area.  One could call it a task force or whatever one likes, but we need to take the initiative and we need special measures to be implemented in the Coolock district to tackle this escalating problem. </p></speech>

I also acknowledge the importance of raising the issue under Topical Issue matters in the manner the Deputy has done, rather than engaging in type of soundbite politics we see every day on the Order of Business.  There are not many of those people here now.  Those are the people who rush in, engage in soundbite politics and then leave the Chamber.  I very much welcome the points raised by Deputy Haughey.  I assure him that the Government is committed to ensuring that Ireland is a safe and secure place for all, and that the well-being of all our communities is a priority for me as the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the incidents referred to by Deputy Haughey, and in particular the shooting that took place in his constituency last weekend.  I have condemned this wanton violence and I call on everybody to pass on any information they might have, however small, by calling the Garda station in Coolock or the Garda confidential line.  The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot comment on any specific investigation or any other ongoing criminal investigation, but I assure Deputy Haughey that we are making progress in tackling drugs and organised crime.  I share Deputy Haughey's concern about the destructive impact that drugs and crime related to drugs can have on communities.  I fully agree on the importance of tackling such behaviour effectively.</p>  <p>  Before addressing the Garda resources in the area, I will take the opportunity to highlight that action is being taken on a range of levels to address these matters.  While policing is a key issue, I believe Deputy Haughey will agree that we cannot address this as a policing matter alone.  There is a need to address drug-related offending in a strategic multiagency way.  Our policy in relation to drug and alcohol misuse is set out in Ireland's national drugs strategy for 2017-2025, which is a health-led response.  I note that the strategy is unique among national drugs strategies across EU member states in recognising the need to address drug-related debt intimidation at a community level.  It is also important to note the budget provided for Garda youth diversion projects, and I appreciate the work done in this regard by Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton.  I also recognise the importance of community stakeholders and community leaders in this work.  Deputy Haughey referred to the activity on the ground on the part of many people, and he specifically mentioned Fr. Bryan Shortall, who I saw on television recently.  I agree with the points made by Fr. Shortall on those broadcasts.  Work such as that in communities plays an important preventative role and show good results over time, coupled with Garda enforcement action.</p>  <p>  The Garda national drugs and organised crime bureau continues to have significant success in tackling these issues.  I understand from the Garda Commissioner that since its establishment in March 2015, the bureau has been responsible for the seizure of controlled substances with an estimated value of approximately &euro;167 million and has seized 108 firearms.  I also mention Operation Hybrid.  With regard to Garda numbers in the Coolock area, as of 31 October 2019, the workforce increased from 103 garda&iacute; and 11 staff to 117 garda&iacute; and 16 staff.  This means that an additional 73 garda&iacute; have been allocated to the Dublin metropolitan region northern division since the start of 2016, alongside a 38% increase in Garda civilian staff over the same period.  These numbers are still increasing.  The Taoiseach and I will attend the Garda college in Templemore tomorrow to see a graduation of a further 200 new garda&iacute;.  I understand that the Garda Commissioner intends to allocate additional Garda resources to the DMR northern division from the attestation scheduled for tomorrow.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach visited the offices of the Northside Partnership in September 2019 when he met with the chairperson, Nessan Vaughan, and the chief executive, Paul Rogers.  The Taoiseach listened to the views of representatives of several local organisations who outlined what should be done to tackle disadvantage in the area.  The Taoiseach's visit, along with visits by the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Richard Bruton, and the Minister of State at the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Finian McGrath, followed some of the shootings I referred to earlier.  The Taoiseach heard presentations, including one on the loss of a teaching post in Our Lady Immaculate national school in Darndale.  This case was put forward following the shooting of Jordan Davis outside the school, on a school day.  The Taoiseach said he would get back to the group with his proposals, but we are still waiting.  The meeting took place in September but the Department of Education and Skills has since confirmed that the school will lose the teacher.  This is despite the strong case made on that day.</p>  <p>  I note the collective call from former Ministers of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy to the Government to renew its efforts on the drugs crisis, to beef up the local partnerships and the local drugs task forces, and to listen to communities affected about what needs to be done.  The recent big call by these former Ministers of State and by several organisations working on the drugs crisis on the ground is that communities just wish to be listened to.  They have the on-the-ground experience and they know what needs to be done.  As the Minister rightly said, it is not just a criminal justice issue; it is also a community issue.  There is a need to develop youth services and sporting organisations and to tackle disadvantage generally.  The call from the former Ministers of State was a cry for help that communities want to be listened to.  The Government needs to renew its efforts on the drugs situation.</p>  <p>  The Coolock garda&iacute; still need more resources.  The area has had a population explosion.  A new Garda station is promised for Northern Cross, which the Acting Chairman, Deputy Alan Farrell, will be familiar with.  We need to ensure that the resources are put in place as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I undertake to the House and to Deputy Haughey that when I meet the Taoiseach later this evening I will be happy to raise the issue of the Northside Partnership.</p> <p>I had the opportunity of visiting the partnership.  I acknowledge the community work being undertaken over a range of issues and pursuits in that area.  I would be happy to ensure that Deputy Haughey gets an appropriate reply.</p> <p> The second issue was that of resources.  I am pleased that it has been possible for the Government to sustain the level of funding necessary to recruit a further large increase of Garda numbers and staff in what is a difficult financial climate.  The large-scale recruitment and redeployment within the Garda means that we are significantly increasing the Garda workforce.  Garda deployments in all areas of the country, as well as specialist national units, have benefitted from increased recruitment.</p> <p> Regarding the Garda's capital allocation, this year we invested &euro;92 million in projects, including the fleet, the Garda estate and ICT.  One of the key actions in the plan published last year following the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland is in the course of being implemented and will allow for a new operating model for the Garda, the object of the exercise being to reduce bureaucracy, devolve power from Garda Headquarters and increase the number of front-line garda&iacute;.  It is all about availability and visibility.  I have welcomed the announcement by Commissioner Harris as regards the new operating model.</p> <p> I thank Deputy Haughey for raising this matter by way of Topical Issue, which gives him an opportunity to make his case and me an opportunity to attempt to reassure him of our commitment to the area.  I would be happy to engage further as time evolves.</p></speech>

It has criteria, including an income threshold, a guaranteed contract or an offer of a contract of employment etc.  I will provide an example because, when people approach Deputies with a problem, trying to resolve it often gives an insight into the kinds of challenge that people face.  I have raised this issue with three different Ministers, but I cannot get a resolution to it.  I will use this specific example to discuss the general issue.</p>  <p>  I was contacted by a husband and wife, both of whom are in Ireland on critical skills visas.  One is a medical doctor and the other is an engineer.  There is no issue for the engineer, but there is for the medical doctor, who is not in employment.  She had employment at the beginning, but that contract did not last.  Many of our GPs are self-employed, as are many of the locums who fill in for them.  GPs want to employ locums on a self-employed basis because of reasons of taxation and so on that would lead to problems otherwise.  As such, I am discussing a specific category.</p>  <p>  The doctor in question is highly skilled but not working.  When I raised her case with three different Ministers, one of the replies I received was that the Department of Justice and Equality had corresponded with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, which is a part of the former.  According to the reply, INIS had advised that applying for stamp 4 residency permission would permit an individual to establish and operate a business and was reckonable as residence when applying for citizenship and so on.  I was trying to find out whether someone in that category could be granted permission to be self-employed and was pointed in this direction by INIS.  However, this approach will not work because, as the Minister of State knows, one can only obtain a stamp 4 if one meets the other qualifying criterion relating to one's length of time in the country.  I am going around in circles.</p>  <p>  Of concern is the fact that we have a deficit of GPs and doctors generally.  Their skills are needed.  In the case in question, the doctor can stay in Ireland because her husband has a critical skills visa, but I cannot imagine that she is the only example of this situation.  Are we failing to retain doctors who have come to Ireland because of difficulties around the types of employment common among GPs?  Are people who have come to Ireland in good faith finding that the employment they expected is not available?  This is a specific category of a more general issue.  Will the Minister of State consider it with the Minister for Health and the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation?  I do not see how the issue can be resolved.  There is a wider issue of retaining the skills in question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-11-28a.344" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="14:55:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112800030#CC00400"><p>On behalf of the Minister, who has just had to go to another appointment, I thank the Deputy for tabling this important matter.  I was interested in what she had to say.  As she knows, individuals seeking to enter the State in order to work as a GP are eligible to apply for a critical skills employment permit from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  With this permit, an individual may apply to the Department of Justice and Equality for permission to reside in the State for the purpose of employment as a locum doctor.  The residence permission - a stamp 1 permission - allows such an individual to remain in the State under a contract of employment for a period of up to two years and can be renewed.  At the end of that two-year period, it is open to individuals to make an application for permission to reside in the State under stamp 4 conditions, which grant unrestricted access to the labour market.  In instances where an individual or his or her employer does not wish to enter into a contract of full-time employment in this regard, it is open to the individual to make an application under the atypical working scheme, operated by the Department of Justice and Equality, in order to receive permission to work in the State as a medical professional on a short-term basis for up to a maximum of 90 days.  This permission allows an individual to work in this manner for up to eight months in a calendar year.</p>  <p>  Extension of the atypical working scheme to include locum practitioners in the primary care area was implemented on the basis of consultations in 2015 between the Departments of Justice and Equality; Health; and Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the HSE.  As part of those consultations, the evidence available suggested that longer term contracts of employment that would allow an individual to make an application for a critical skills employment permit from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation were not especially desired either by the individual medical professionals themselves or by their employers.  Accordingly, it was determined that the expansion of the atypical working scheme to facilitate the HSE in meeting urgent healthcare recruitment requirements was the best course of action.</p>  <p>  I can advise that in 2018 a total of 90 individual doctors engaged in employment under the scheme in this manner and that 95 individuals have done so to date in 2019.  Further advice from key stakeholders received over the course of 2019 indicates that these figures represent a minority cohort of the total number of overseas medical professionals engaged to provide locum services in the State.  The Minister has made some changes this month, but I will probably say more about those in my next contribution.</p></speech>

If we are to attract other people with that skill set, they must not become bound up in a lot of unnecessary bureaucracy.  I acknowledge that there have to be safeguards, but this skill set is undoubtedly required.</p>  <p>  Is there ongoing engagement with the professional bodies on this matter, specifically as it relates to general practice?  If changes are being made, they may be helpful.  It is only when problems arise that one gets a fuller understanding of the issues that people encounter.</p> <p>I would appreciate it if the Minister looked at that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2019-11-28a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1277" speakername="David Stanton" time="15:05:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2019112800031#DD00200"><p>The policy related to the use of locum doctors in the primary care sector is primarily a matter for the HSE.  The role of immigration service delivery of the Department of Justice and Equality is to provide immigration mechanisms for non-EEA medical personnel recruited to fill temporary vacancies in the health sector as and when required and to meet the needs identified by the HSE.  These mechanisms are kept under continuous review with the HSE to ensure that the process retains sufficient flexibility to address urgent recruitment requirements as they arise.</p><p>The Department continues to liaise with the HSE to ensure that sufficient flexibility is available within the locum scheme.  In that regard, I draw the Deputy's attention to the revised arrangements for locum GPs, which the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, announced recently on 22 November.  It is very recent and the Deputy may not be aware of it.  The revised arrangements, which are published on the immigration service delivery website, provide enhanced provisions in respect of applications processing and intermittent travel for locum doctors and offer a further demonstration of the capacity of the State to operate flexible and fluid schemes to meet fast-changing employment requirements while also promoting ongoing compliance with employment law and taxation obligations, to which the Deputy alluded, under a variety of sectors.</p><p>On the Deputy's final point, I understand that the doctors' co-operatives welcome the changes in the atypical working scheme, which were announced only last week.  That is on the <i>inis.gov.ie</i>website.  It means that the waiting time changes and that doctors can take some time within the 90 days to leave the country and go home if they need to do that.  They were the two main requests of the GP co-operatives.  Those changes were made only last week, and they have been welcomed, but we are open to other suggestions as the need arises.  I hope the Deputy will be happy with that response.</p></speech>

I want to speak to the Minister about the public consultation currently under way on the route corridor options for the N2 Clontibret to the Border and the N2 Ardee to Castleblayney road schemes.  Before I make my argument to the Minister, and I do not want that to sound negative, it is important that I say that I am speaking on behalf of the residents of Donaghmoyne.  The residents, along with everybody else living along this route, are acutely aware of the importance of saving lives.  There is no adversity in terms of that ideology.  Saving lives is of utmost importance.  By the same token, however, we must take into consideration people who will be most affected by such a project.</p>  <p>  This particular project is being rolled out by Monaghan County Council in partnership with Louth County Council, in association with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, to develop a scheme to upgrade a 32 km section of the N2-A5 Dublin to Derry road.  We all acknowledge that this scheme is long overdue and much desired but I am speaking on behalf of the residents of Donaghmoyne who are very concerned about the scheme, particularly the Ardee to Castleblayney section, which involves changes to the existing road.  It is bums on seats, so to speak, that make us acutely aware of the concern and frustration among these residents.  Donaghmoyne is a rural part of south County Monaghan but hundreds of people turned out for the public meetings on this issue.  I understand more than 800 submissions have been made in the public consultations that were invited by the local authority.  People are not just talking about this issue; they are writing about it in submissions.  That hundreds of people turned out for two public meetings is a way to gauge the importance of this issue to them.  The concerns of the residents are well-founded in terms of the environmental impact of any new route.  It is important to reiterate that road safety trumps everything but we also must take into consideration how the residents will be affected; some believe they will be adversely affected.</p>  <p>  There is a groundswell of support in terms of wanting transparency from the TII on the issue.  Derek Maguire has been active in chairing these public meetings where he brought clarity to the issues for the local community.  That is why I am delighted that the Minister came into the House to hear about those concerns.  The residents believe there are questions to be answered by the TII.  Residents need transparency on each of the route options.  A number of options have been proposed and they want transparency on how options are being selected.  They want to know the process through which submissions are being received by the local authority and how it will select a final option.</p>  <p>  Monaghan County Council has appointed a consultancy firm in advance of this project to put it through the planning and design stage.  Residents want to know who will be in control of the compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, that will affect a new route.  In the event of a new road being established, will the Government and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport provide the funds necessary to Monaghan County Council to maintain the original road, which is the N2, as well as the new road, or will it be allowed fall into disrepair?  The residents have a real concern about speeding traffic and fatalities on that road.  They want to know that there will still be an acute Garda presence and speed cameras on that route.  I will conclude and allow the Minister to address some of those concerns.</p></speech>

I would point out to her that one or two aspects are not under my area but I will convey them to the right area.  The Deputy spoke about a Garda presence in certain areas.  I know the residents have concerns but that is not something over which I or any of the agencies under my Department's aegis would have control.</p></speech>

Under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015, the planning, design and operation of individual roads is a matter for the relevant road authority in respect of local and regional roads or for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned, in respect of national roads.</p><p>Within the overall context of Project Ireland 2040, the national development plan, NDP, has been developed by Government to underpin the successful implementation of the new national planning framework, NPF.  This provides the strategic and financial framework for Tll's national roads programme for the period from 2018 to 2027.  In the years covered by the plan, over &euro;11 billion will be invested in the overall road network.</p><p>The NDP identifies two categories of national road improvement project.  The first category covers projects to advance to construction, subject to the satisfactory outcome of the project appraisal and development consent approval processes.  The second category relates to projects at pre-appraisal and early planning stage, which are being assessed with a view to developing a pipeline of suitable projects for development.</p><p>Both the N2 Ardee to Castleblayney and N2 Clontibret to the Border schemes fall into the second category of projects at pre-appraisal.  Both schemes are located on a Trans-European Network, TEN-T, route.  The schemes will improve the regional connectivity to the north west, which is a strategic priority of the national planning framework as part of Project Ireland 2040.</p><p>Both projects have had project appraisal plans submitted by TII and approved by my Department.  I understand from Tll that technical advisers have been appointed to provide the engineering and consultancy services to develop the proposed schemes from inception to the preparation of compulsory purchase orders, an environmental impact assessment report and a business case in order to seek approval to proceed with making a planning application.  The conclusion of this work will allow project requirements to be established and the financial commitment required to develop these major projects to be identified.</p><p>The study area identification for both projects has been completed and the non-statutory public consultation on constraints mapping was carried out in June 2019.</p><p>Route corridor options were published in October 2019 and, as the Deputy knows, public consultation is under way for both schemes. Feedback received through the public consultation process in the next stage of the planning and design process will be taken into consideration for each scheme.  An emerging preferred route corridor will be identified in late 2020 and a further round of public consultation will take place before the preferred route corridor is finalised.</p><p>I am informed that TIl has provided an allocation of &euro;1 million to Monaghan County Council this year for the progression of the N2 Ardee to Castleblayney scheme and a further &euro;1 million to Monaghan County Council for the Clontibret to the Border scheme.</p></speech>

They also have stated that to move the N2 away from Carrickmacross and the surrounding areas obviously will have a detrimental impact on local businesses and employment.  What will be the economic impact on Carrickmacross or does that come into consideration when TII is nailing down what the route will be?  These residents are reasonable people.  We talk about climate action and climate change and they are concerned about the environmental impact it would have to build a new route through their fields, farms and homes.  What will the environmental impact be?  What will the impact be on the hedgerows?  What will the impact be on the biodiversity?  What will the impact be on the natural heritage of Donaghmoyne that will adversely affect the residents living in that area?  What consideration does TII give to those possible negative outcomes?  There is a concern a new route will negatively affect the quality of the drinking water in the area in both public schemes and private wells.  There is a concern for the wildlife.  The residents want to know how with what importance TII is taking that.  Does it take those kind of things into consideration?  We hear a lot from the Government about climate action and healthy living but the residents of Donaghmoyne feel they have more to lose than to gain if the proposed route was to cut through their farms, lands and homes.  How is constructing a new road in line with Ireland's sustainable development goals, such as climate control and the reduction of CO2 emissions?  I want to make it clear to the Minister the residents are concerned, and rightly so, given the points I have raised today.  They seek assurances from the Minister today that all the matters I have mentioned, such as the environmental impact, the drinking water and the natural heritage of the land and landscape are matters TII will take into consideration when it is trying to nail down its final option.</p></speech>

I am responsible for overall Government policy and if there are infringements on Government policy in what is happening.  The residents have great concerns about that and they can convey them to me through Deputy Smyth.  I am happy to listen to them.  The Deputy spoke about the quality of the drinking water, the detrimental impact on local businesses, the research and upgrade done by TII.  What she said was fair and she correctly referred to TII and the local authorities in that regard.  These are all matters that could usefully be addressed to TII and the local authorities but they are not something in which I would get directly involved and I prefaced my remarks by pointing that out.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is lucky in one sense.  I know people are impatient about the development of roads of this sort but this particular project is at an early stage of development and therefore, it is not possible for me to indicate the timeframe for the construction of the projects, which will be dependent on the satisfactory conclusion of the statutory planning approval process.  The schemes will need to obtain both business case approval and planning consent and will be subject to the availability of funding in the future.  All the concerns the Deputy addressed have been raised in a timely fashion and it is not too late to raise concerns.  Those concerns should be addressed to TII, however, and not to myself or other authorities, although it is appropriate the Deputy should raise the matter in this House.  I will make sure those concerns are conveyed to the appropriate authorities, even though I am unable to give a direct response to the lengthy detail the Deputy has given but I will make sure those details go to the right places.</p></speech>
