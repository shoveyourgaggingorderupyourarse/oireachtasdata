    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-27a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/992" speakername="Miche&aacute;l Martin" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032700003#A00200"><p>On Sunday last the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>  revealed the draft guidelines for the personal insolvency service and outlined that debt deals might force mothers to stay at home and how women could be forced to give up their jobs.  The article quoted the draft guidelines and stated: &quot;Where a person is working and paying for child care as a consequence of his or her employment the cost of child care should not exceed the income of employment&quot;.  When asked about this on Monday, the Taoiseach said he would find it incredible that somebody would say a person was required to give up work to meet these changes.  That is what is outlined in the draft guidelines.  Did the Taoiseach know what was going on and was he aware of the draft guidelines when he commented?  Had he read the draft guidelines?  He may in his comments have been trying to dampen the understandable anger at such a proposal.  </p><p><br />  What we are witnessing is a degree of incoherence in the Government in that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, has confirmed the guidelines in his comments to <i>The Irish Times</i> and<i> Irish Examiner</i> and his understanding of the rationale behind them and the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, stated on &quot;Newstalk&quot; this morning that the guidelines might have been drawn up by a man and that that was the cause of it all.  This incoherence adds to the anger and disbelief.  I put it to the Taoiseach that what this represents is micro-management and nanny statism as it affects the personal insolvency service.  This highlights the fundamental flaw that there is no independent oversight of the banks and how they propose to deal with customers and those in mortgage arrears.  We are all hearing this from people across the country in their daily dealings with the banks.  </p><p><br />  The guidelines are anti-women, anti-family and anti-employment.  In the first instance, child care programmes are essential for the development of children, while work is an essential part of people's lives.  Under the personal insolvency framework, they should not be forced out of work.  The sustainability of family income and careers will depend on security of tenure in employment in the medium to longer term.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that people who earn less than their child care costs will not be forced to give up their jobs and that what is proposed in the draft guidelines will not be included in the guidelines when published?</p></speech>

They may also decide to go to the personal insolvency agency to discuss their circumstances with an insolvency practitioner.  However, the guidelines referred to by Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin have not yet been published.

No woman or man will be forced to give up his or her job, irrespective of the reality of his or her current income position, as distinct from the child care costs involved.  I know young people, women in particular, including teachers and nurses, who are not earning as much as their current child care costs.  It is a feature of the Government and the Ministers for Social Protection and Education and Skills to provide as much child care assistance and support as they can in the preschool year, after-school provision and so on.  It is a fact of life that these challenges apply for a relatively short period.  I again confirm for Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin and the House that the guidelines referred to which have not yet been published will not include as a condition that anybody, woman or man, will be required to give up a position, regardless of his or her circumstances.</p></speech>

I welcome the Taoiseach's confirmation that the banks will be told to change the guidelines.  However, what this speaks to is the fundamental flaw in the Government's approach to dealing with the issue of mortgage arrears.  People need independent oversight of the banks which cannot be trusted to deal properly and in a reasonable manner with those in mortgage arrears.</p></speech>

He has also cut the fuel allowance period by six weeks so that it does not extend beyond 5 April which is next week.  He also cut the gas and the electricity allowance to those on the household benefits package and he allowed gas and electricity prices to increase.  Last year he deducted one week's fuel allowance from more than 60,000 citizens because of an error.  Many people in receipt of fuel allowance cannot afford to heat their homes.  As I am sure the Taoiseach is aware, during this particular period people have to wear their overcoats indoors because they cannot afford to turn on the heating.  This is particularly the case with pensioners who are very susceptible to hypothermia in these freezing conditions.  We are told the cold snap could last for another four weeks.</p><p>  It is a matter of record that the Taoiseach's Government is imposing savage cuts on the most vulnerable citizens while protecting the rich and the elites.  It is an absolute shame.  I am sure the Taoiseach would agree that people are suffering as a result of being cold in their own homes, but he can rectify this.  Will he make an emergency order to extend the payment of the fuel allowance while these severe weather conditions prevail?</p></speech>

Superintendents are making what he calls secret decisions behind closed doors with no authority in road traffic legislation to allow them to do so.  This is a frightening situation, an affront to the premise that the law should be conducted in public.  That is not only his informed opinion but is supported by Deputies on this side of the House who have repeatedly asked the Minister for Justice and Equality to specify the legislation that he believes gives power to senior garda&iacute; to terminate penalty points.  He has not yet answered those repeated questions.</p><p>  Does the Taoiseach share our surprise that the Minister for Justice and Equality, who we believe has not yet seen the report of his own internal inquiry, has concluded that one of its key recommendations is that PULSE access must be restricted to rank and file garda&iacute;?  In other words, the conclusion of a report initiated on foot of evidence that rank and file garda&iacute; had of malpractice by senior garda&iacute; is that no rank and file garda&iacute; will ever again have access to that information.  In other words, the only people who can see what senior officers are doing will be senior officers.  One could not make this up.</p><p>  Will the Taoiseach tell us whether the Minister is deliberately trying to make sure that there will never again be a Garda whistleblower?  Where is the protection for people who put their necks on the line to unearth malpractice, as the Minister encouraged them to do when he initiated his whistleblowing system?  How can we have any confidence in an internal inquiry conducted by the Garda into its own activities when before it started the Commissioner said there was no basis to the allegations and before it concluded the Minister said that the solution should be to gag the whistleblowers?  Will the Taoiseach tell us what legislative basis there is for garda&iacute; to terminate penalty points?  Is it not time to launch an internal inquiry?  If not, who is guarding the garda&iacute;?</p></speech>

First, in respect of whistleblower legislation, a comprehensive Bill covering the entire range of whistleblowing and passing of information will be published and passed in the House later in the year.  The report the Deputy mentioned has been prepared by the Garda Commissioner for the Minister for Justice and Equality.  As I speak I cannot tell the Deputy whether the Minister has actually received the report.  If he has not, he is due to receive it shortly.  The report will be published in full.  It will be debated here and I will not comment on reports that the Deputy has of what might be in the report.  When the Minister has the report he will publish it and it will be debated here and everybody will have an opportunity to have their say on it.</p></speech>

That would be entirely inappropriate.  The questions I raised related to comments and speeches made by the Minister and points that he has already ascertained.  I would like the Taoiseach to deal with the question I asked.  Does he think it is appropriate that the Minister, who commissioned this report that allegedly nobody has seen, has already concluded that some access to PULSE should be removed?  He did not answer my question about the legislative basis for garda&iacute; to have the power to terminate fixed-charge penalty points.  When he answers that question he might refer to the Road Traffic Act 2010, which removed the right from judges to use the Probation of Offenders Act precisely because it would mean that penalty points could be terminated, which should not happen.  Why and on what legislative basis does the Taoiseach maintain that garda&iacute; have this mythical power?</p></speech>

The legislation is necessary to reduce the pay of public servants regardless of whether the LRC proposals are passed in the ballot.  Legislation will also be needed to adjust the pension levy and to make changes to pensions in payment.  The legislation will include provisions to cut the pay of senior staff and office holders, including members of the Government, the Oireachtas and the Judiciary.  Preparations are under way to draft the legislation and it will be brought before the House in a timely way to ensure that it will be in operation by 1 July.  If the ballot is favourable the legislation will implement the proposals reached under the auspices of the LRC.  In the event that the measures proposed by the LRC are not passed in the ballot, the Government will have to consider the measures necessary to meet the expenditure targets of &euro;300 million in savings this year and &euro;1 billion by 2015.</p></speech>

Given the distress caused by the remarks made by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport that women do not have a right to work or that their work is secondary to the banks, or that families do not have a right to child care, is it not crucially important that we are clear on when these guidelines will be published?

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-27a.176" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032700007#E00400"><p>I am pleased to brief the House on the outcome of the spring meeting of the European Council which took place in Brussels on 14-15 March.  This month's summit took place in an atmosphere of relative calm but its deliberations were no less important for that.  As is traditional at the spring European Council, our focus was strongly on economic policy with a particular focus on how we can ensure a return to sustainable growth and job creation.</p><p>  Ahead of the meeting I informed the House that implementation would be a key message and that turned out to be the case.  Leaders agreed that implementation of the broad array of measures already agreed, whether in the areas of the Single Market, the compact for growth and jobs, the recently agreed youth guarantee or the two-pack or the banking union package, would have to be our collective priority.  I briefed colleagues on the work of the Irish EU Presidency which is advancing across a range of policy areas to boost jobs and growth.</p><p>  We have already had some notable successes, including agreements on the two-pack of economic governance measures, the capitalisation of banks, the youth guarantee, which will help our young people get off to a good start, and the reaching of an agreed Council position on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  I told the meeting that we would continue with our shoulder to the wheel to the last minute of our period in office because there is no time to be lost.</p><p>  Progress continues.  Since the summit we have reached provisional agreement with the European Parliament on the critical single supervisory mechanism for European banks.  This is a keystone in the banking union package and it represents a major and concrete step in making the June 2012 decision to break the debilitating link between banks and sovereignty a reality.  I encouraged my colleagues to approach the files on which we are continuing to work across the various formations of the Council with the maximum degree of flexibility and compromise.  These include important files in the Single Market on professional qualifications, public procurement and accounting as well as the outstanding elements of banking union.  The Single Market is one of the Union's most valuable assets in the search for growth and we must make the most of it.</p><p>  As is customary, the meeting began with a presentation from European Parliament President, Martin Schulz.  He focused on the Parliament's views on the multiannual financial framework, MFF, on which it had cast a resolution critical of the agreement reached at the European Council in February the day before the meeting.  That decision gave a mandate to the Parliament negotiating team to seek increased flexibility within the MFF, a review clause and an agreement on own resources.  It also stated that the Parliament would not open negotiations on the MFF until the Commission brought forward a draft amending budget to cover unpaid payment claims for 2012.  While the MFF was not on the agenda for the meeting I took the opportunity to set out for President Schulz and for colleagues our determination as holders of the Presidency to get full negotiations with the Parliament under way as soon as possible and I stated that I would work in good faith with him to secure agreement.</p><p>  Following the exchange with President Schulz we moved on to discuss economic and social policy.  A key focus in this regard was providing clear direction for national and EU economic policies against the backdrop of unacceptably high unemployment levels; some 26 million are without jobs throughout the Union.  While drawing encouragement from the steps taken thus far to stabilise a decidedly difficult set of circumstances, we acknowledged clearly the need to redouble efforts towards growth and job creation.  President van Rompuy highlighted four particular strands that capture well the emphasis of what was agreed.  The first is the need to restore financial stability and maintain it.  This is critical for confidence of consumers and investors alike and it means pressing ahead with work on banking union in particular.  The second is the need to ensure that public finances are structurally sound.  This entails a path for fiscal consolidation that is both growth-friendly and differentiated, according to national circumstances.  The third is the need to bring new urgency to the fight against unemployment, especially of young people.  All our efforts are aimed at this overarching goal.  Financial stability and economic recovery are the foundations on which the job creation necessary to respond to the unemployment crisis will be built.  The fourth is the need to support long-term growth.  This implies continuing to pursue the difficult process of structural reforms, restoring competitiveness and unlocking a new wave of business investments that will underpin a sustainable recovery.</p><p>  Naturally, these strands are strongly interdependent and we need to press ahead coherently on all four.  Member states will prepare their national reform and jobs plans in April, the reviews of which will inform clear country-specific orientations to be agreed in June.  Along with the development of these country-specific orientations, a full review of the compact for growth and jobs has been lined up for our June meeting, one year on from its adoption.</p><p>  The spring European Council noted that the &euro;10 billion increase in the European Investment Bank's paid-in capital agreed last year will help to co-finance up to &euro;180 billion worth of projects in the coming three years.  We agreed that the June summit will place a particular emphasis on measures aimed at creating jobs and boosting the financing of the economy for fast-acting growth measures.</p><p>  The Commission, together with the EIB, will report to leaders on targeted priorities, in particular with regard to infrastructure, energy and resource efficiency, the digital economy, research and innovation and small and medium sized enterprises.  I will meet the President of the EIB, Werner Hoyer, again in Dublin next month to discuss these matters, as will the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin.  In line with what the Government has said since coming to office, I am satisfied that this meeting of the European Council recognised the urgent need to address unemployment, especially among the young.  It is the most important challenge we face.  This corresponds with our priorities as Presidency; our drive for stability, jobs and growth are not abstract ambitions.  Rather, they are the means to achieve and secure a jobs-rich recovery.  Again, implementation must be the key.</p><p>  Ahead of the meeting, President Van Rompuy wrote in stark terms to members of the European Council setting out his strong disappointment at the unacceptable delays in delivering progress on key Single Market files.  This was something we also discussed.  As I have stated, delivery is a key priority for us as Presidency.  We need to conclude work urgently on Single Market Act I files that remain open, while aiming for as much progress as possible on key Single Market Act II files as they are published over the coming months.</p><p>  This meeting agreed further important action on cutting red tape.  An extensive consultation with small and medium enterprises has identified the top ten areas of EU legislation that impose the highest compliance burdens.  The Commission will come back to leaders in June with concrete proposals to address these SME concerns.  In identifying the top ten most burdensome EU laws, the Commission included the following in the top five: REACH, Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals; the value added tax legislation; the general product safety and market surveillance package; the recognition of professional qualifications; and, the shipments of waste and waste framework legislation.</p><p>  The Commission will ensure swift and effective implementation of its regulatory fitness or REFIT programme, rapidly identifying the regulatory areas and tranches of legislation with greatest potential for simplifying rules and reducing regulatory costs.  We look forward to its first proposals in this area in the autumn.  This is also a key focus for us domestically under the Action Plan for Jobs.  For example, we estimate that the single application system we are introducing for up to 25 licences is set to save the retail sector upwards of &euro;20 million per annum.</p><p>This is led by the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, and beginning with the retail sector as a pilot project, an integrated licensing application system will be designed in the first half of 2013 and implemented by the fourth quarter of this year.</p><p> We did not have a full discussion on strengthening Economic and Monetary Union.  That awaits finalisation of the report to be presented in June by President Van Rompuy.  However, the European Council took the opportunity to recognise again that any new step towards deeper EMU must be accompanied by parallel steps to ensure stronger democratic accountability and legitimacy.  We have also been asked by President Van Rompuy to address the social dimension and as we move forward, we must never forget the necessity to bring people with us.</p><p> A key element in qualitatively deepening EMU is, of course, banking union.  The Irish Presidency continues to give top priority to files relating to the promotion of banking union and the good progress we are making was recognised by the European Council.  We have achieved provisional agreement with the European Parliament on the single supervisory mechanism, SSM, as well as reaching agreement on the capital requirements directive, or CRD IV as it is known.  These are significant achievements which represent important steps towards banking union, restoring confidence in the European banking system and building stability across Europe.  The setting up of the supervisor will pave the way for the European Stability Mechanism to take on the direct recapitalisation of banks.</p><p> Intensive efforts are under way by the Irish Presidency to accelerate Council discussions on the banking resolution file, with a view to reaching agreement on key political issues.  All of this important work is under way in the context of the key decisions made by the Heads of State and Government on 29 June last year, when &ldquo;they affirmed that it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns.&rdquo;  We will spare no effort in working to deliver on that commitment.  The discussions in that context are being led by the Minister for Finance.</p><p> Following the conclusion of discussions at the European Council on the Thursday evening, leaders of the 17 euro area member states met for a euro summit meeting.  We heard from ECB President Draghi on how to lay the foundations for growth.  In his interesting presentation he highlighted some of the critical factors required, including confidence, credit and competitiveness.  This was followed by a useful exchange in which we each reflected on some of the key issues confronting individual member states.  In this discussion I highlighted the progress Ireland had made towards recovering its competitiveness as we looked forward to exiting our programme later this year.</p><p> While we welcomed the new Cypriot President, Nico Anastasiades, to the table, we did not discuss the developing situation in Cyprus in detail as it was to be discussed by Finance Ministers in the eurogroup chaired by Dutch Finance Minister on the Friday afternoon.  It is welcome that it has been possible for the Cypriot authorities to reach an agreement with the troika that will allow a programme of support to be put in place.  As the House will be aware, this was a very complex and sensitive process and will be exceptionally challenging for the Cypriot people.  From hard won experience, we in this country know the real strain associated with the agreement of such a programme and the genuine anxiety and concern it causes among citizens.  I hope it will be possible for the Cypriot Government and people to focus fully on economic recovery, although I appreciate there is a very difficult journey ahead.  I assure them that the Government and people of Ireland are with them at this difficult time and that they can rely on our support as they seek to emerge from their difficulties.  I very much welcome the fact that all deposits in Cypriot banks below &euro;100,000 have been fully safeguarded.  This is an important reassurance for savers across the European Union.  Unfortunately, given the debt dynamic in Cyprus, there were simply no easy options available.  The path now agreed, although onerous and challenging, represents the best available outcome in these very difficult circumstances for the Cypriot people.</p><p> While economic matters were the focus of our work on the Thursday afternoon and evening, on Friday morning, 15 March, we moved on to foreign policy matters.  We had a useful and welcome discussion on the European Union&rsquo;s strategic relationships, with a special focus on Russia, one of a series of such discussions planned by President Van Rompuy.  The wide-ranging and positive discussion, in which the complexity of our relations with Russia was fully recognised, focused on the many areas in which we enjoy strong co-operation in mutual trade and investment; our energy relations; and our relations as partners in international fora in the pursuit of peace and security.  It also addressed the areas in which there were differences and we reflected on how best to convey our differing views in our dialogue with Russia.  There was a clear agreement that the European Union must adopt a more co-ordinated approach to its relationship with Russia and that we needed to work towards a stronger, single EU message on key issues in the strategic partnership.</p><p> Also on Friday morning Prime Minister Cameron briefly updated leaders on preparations for the G8 Summit, which will take place in Lough Erne, County Fermanagh in June.  The main agenda will deal with terrorism, tax, transparency and trade.  We are co-operating closely with the British authorities to assist in ensuring the success of this significant event.</p><p> Before the meeting concluded, the issue of EU policy on Syria and, in particular, the question of the arms embargo were briefly raised by President Hollande and Prime Minister Cameron.  After a short exchange of views, it was agreed to ask EU Foreign Ministers to address this topic as a matter of urgency, starting with a thorough discussion at the informal foreign affairs meeting that took place in Dublin last Friday and Saturday.  As the T&aacute;naiste hosted that meeting in Dublin Castle last weekend, he will address the matter in his remarks later.</p><p> While in Brussels, I also had a number of meetings which might be of interest to the House.  On 14 March I co-chaired the tripartite social summit, which brings together social partners at EU level.  We had an excellent exchange with representatives of European trade unions and businesses on how to move from crisis to stability and to generate growth and employment.  We also exchanged views on the social dimension of EMU.</p><p> While the multi-annual financial framework was not on the European Council&rsquo;s agenda, I met Presidents Barroso and Schulz to discuss the consultations we have had with the Parliament to date and ensure we were all working together co-operatively to secure the earliest possible agreement.  Putting a budget in place for the European Union for the period 2014-20 will help to ensure a degree of certainty and security that will underpin economic stability.  Separately, I had a brief bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Cameron, building on our summit meeting in London earlier this month.</p><p> The outcome of this month&rsquo;s European Council was welcome, for the European Union, as well as for Ireland nationally and in holding the Presidency.  There was recognition of what had already been achieved, including under the Irish Presidency, but, more importantly, there was a recognition that a wide range of measures which had been agreed remained to be implemented or to be implemented in full.  We must act on these measures.  In the coming months, in the second half of our Presidency, we will use all of our energy to make as much progress as is humanly possible across the full range of our priority files, all the time with the objective, front and centre, of restoring stability and encouraging sustainable growth and job creation.  I will, of course, continue to keep the House updated on all relevant developments.</p></speech>

Listening to the Taoiseach's statement one would think the European Union was progressing steadily with calm and controlled leadership.  However, the reality is that these very leaders have, once again, undermined confidence in Europe and deepened an already severe crisis.</p><p>  The events of the past few weeks show the exact opposite of the picture the Taoiseach has presented.  A complacent and casual summit meeting produced nothing new.  It has been followed by an incompetent and profoundly damaging series of events relating to the situation in Cyprus.  A deal originally welcomed by the Government as delivering stability, in fact, threatened financial meltdown.  For the first time, a member state of the euro area has publicly announced that leaving is a realistic, immediate option.  At a stroke, confidence has been undermined and uncertainty has returned.</p><p>  The link between sovereign and banking debt has not been broken.  Respect for all member states, irrespective of size, has not been shown.</p><p>Basic principles relating to the security of average deposits in banks have been torn up.  Four years into the crisis, the European Union's first bank run was prevented by closing banks and introducing capital controls which had been banned for decades.  The Taoiseach has claimed in the House that progress was made when leaders agreed to keep going with the same economic policies.  Ireland, as holder of the Presidency of the Council, has the power to promote new measures.  However, the Taoiseach is happy to carry on without proposing a single significant initiative.  In the last week no effort has been made to assert the spirit of solidarity that is supposed to underpin the work of the European Union.  There has been no accountability.  The cycle of complacency and crisis has been reinforced.  The Taoiseach remained silent when the head of the Eurogroup and anonymous Commission sources tried unilaterally to exclude bank recapitalisation from the work of the ESM.</p><p> The current panic with regard to the situation in Cyprus is the biggest example yet of failed leadership at European level.  The impact of the collapse of its two leading banks on the entire Cypriot economy can be directly traced to the write-down of Greek debt that started 12 months ago.  That write-down was fully justified.  In fact, it might not go far enough.  The failure to take any action on the situation in Cyprus until the last possible moment has caused immense damage.  The Taoiseach admitted that the impending crisis was not covered by the summit at all, which is an extraordinary revelation.</p></speech>

I raised these issues on a number of occasions.  They did not appear out of nowhere.  Having said that, the scale of the incompetence and inaction in the last fortnight was a surprise.  Everyone in Europe should take it as a failure that four years into the financial crisis, the ECB can still threaten to close down a country's banking system, in effect, unless that country immediately agrees to its terms.  The initial proposal to tax all depositors, regardless of their levels of savings, to recapitalise the banks caused alarm within minutes of being announced.  It undermined one of the core principles on which the entire banking system was based.  It suggested deposit guarantees would no longer be treated as sacrosanct but would instead be seen as conditional.  If the proposal had been proceeded with, it would have undermined the capital base of banks, made their funding more expensive and further damaged the lending without which families and businesses could not prosper.  This decision could not possibly have survived.  Thankfully, the Cypriot Parliament stopped it before it could do more damage.  I would like the Taoiseach to explain how his Government could possibly have agreed to this deal.  The Minister of State, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, has acknowledged that the Eurogroup Finance Ministers made a mistake when they agreed to the deal.</p></speech>

It was wrong to have agreed to the deal.  I would like the Taoiseach to explain why the Government issued a statement welcoming the proposal and claiming it provided the basis for long-term stability in Cyprus.  Why did he and the Irish Presidency of the Council quietly support the bullying of Cyprus with threats to immediately withdraw liquidity from its banks?  The Taoiseach spoke in London recently about how Ireland had not been treated fairly in 2010 - he included his typical partisan digs in the speech - but was happy to support the same treatment of Cyprus just a few weeks later.</p><p>  As the full details of the final deal have not been properly analysed, we cannot say what it means for Cyprus or Europe.  The complete burning of bondholders and shareholders is welcome.  It reinforces the fact that equity demands further significant relief for Ireland.  The various parts of the troika have not clarified their financial commitments or the terms of the commitments.  There is also a lack of clarity about the Russian loans.  A first look at the impact of the measures suggests the Cypriot economy will lose 18% of its GDP this year and next.  This is a severe recession by any measure.  The undermining of the country&rsquo;s main industry will compound it.  Over 150,000 Cypriots are employed in financial services.  Even in the absence of the final details, we can see that Cyprus is threatened with a further cycle of escalating debt and stagnation.  As a result of the impact of the events of the last week, the Cypriot public has been radicalised and discontent is likely to increase.  This has been reported all over Europe and across the globe.</p><p>  The continued limits on bank transactions show there is great uncertainty about the deal, even among those who agreed to it.  We should not allow the introduction of capital controls to pass without noting that the removal and prohibition of such controls have been a core element of the Single Market for decades.  Their introduction within the eurozone is unprecedented.  This poses a long-term problem for banks in many countries that have substantial non-national deposits.  As with previous bailouts, this support programme is flawed because it does not provide a means for helping the economy to transition.  It provides no funding to soften the blow of massive and immediate contraction.  Clearly, a functioning banking system and sustainable public finances are needed if an economy is to grow.  Equally, a recovering economy needs a stimulus.  Severe problems will be caused by the failure to provide external support for the real economy and thereby give hope to those facing the impact of the substantial reduction in national income which is about to begin.  This failure is reinforced by the decision of the Taoiseach and his colleagues to reduce the EU budget and their rejection of any consideration of the type of transfers that are essential if growth is to return in Europe.</p><p>  The Commission announced yesterday that it intended to establish a task force on Cyprus.  This seems to mean there will be a slight reprioritisation of existing funding and extra loans will be co-ordinated through the European Investment Bank.  There will be no direct assistance.  We are expecting economies to recover and overcome large debts through structural reform alone, but that has not worked and will not work.  The lack of extra funding for regions and countries that are in trouble is damaging the whole of Europe.  Stronger economies are losing far more in lost growth than they would have transferred through larger EU budget contributions.  Countries such as Ireland have no option but to implement fiscal consolidation, but we should be doing so in a less damaging and less unfair way.  Europe as a whole remains one of the world's most wealthy regions.  Its combined debt levels are fully manageable.  It has the capacity to deliver a stimulus, but it lacks the leadership to act.</p><p>  It seems from reading the ten pages of conclusions issued after the summit that the leaders chose to spend two days in Brussels ignoring the reality of what is happening throughout Europe.  The conclusions are full of statements about how progress has been made and a steady course is being followed.  When they are translated into everyday language, however, it is clear that the leaders believe they have already agreed all of the right policies which merely have to be implemented.  The air of unreality in the conclusions suggests the Council has given up trying to do anything significant.  The main item agreed at the summit was a series of reports on the economic prospects of member states.  Any criticism of member states is based mainly on their failure to cut spending or raise revenue fast enough.  The European semester process has been reduced to a control mechanism, rather than a genuine effort to agree to economic plans.  It has been shown time and again that the policy of control is doing substantial damage in Europe which, unfortunately, is not recovering.  Growth projections have been cut and unemployment is continuing to increase across Europe.</p><p>  The Taoiseach has told us that &quot;jobs and growth&quot; is the slogan for our Presidency of the Council.  While he has repeatedly spoken about what is supposedly being done to deliver jobs and growth, the details show that this is more about empty words than substance.  The multi-annual budget agreed to by the Council proposes to cut Europe&rsquo;s ability to help countries.  There will be no stimulus provided by the European Union.  In some areas, it will promote a further contraction.  The budget imposes a severe 10% cut on struggling rural and farming communities, thereby undermining one of Europe&rsquo;s few successful and properly funded activities.  Even though everyone agrees that research and innovation are vital for growth, leaders have agreed to an 11% cut in research funding.  On four separate occasions the Taoiseach has talked about taking decisive action on the emergency that is youth unemployment throughout Europe.</p><p>He has claimed that Europe has agreed to deliver the "youth guarantee" of a quality education or training place for every unemployed young person within four months.  To support this, he has repeatedly mentioned the &euro;6 billion which has been agreed for youth unemployment in the new budget.  This is worth examining in detail.  There are currently more than 7 million young people unemployed in the Union.  The funding is to be allocated across the full period of the new budget and much of it is the repackaging of existing funds.  If we put this aside and assume that all of the money is new, this so-called "youth guarantee" involves exactly &euro;122 per unemployed youth for each year of the budget.  It is a classic example of wanting to be seen to do something rather than actually doing anything.</p><p> What I find hard to understand is why, in the face of this lack of ambition, urgency or engagement, Ireland refuses to speak up for a different approach.  It may well be that nothing could dislodge certain governments from their refusal to contemplate giving the EU the funding and policies to actually help deliver jobs and growth.  What is certain, however, is that there has been no concerted effort to try to persuade them.</p><p> My party&rsquo;s position is that we reject the analysis of those who blame Europe for this crisis.  Certainly, European policies have made it worse in some cases, but the failure is not that of the Union but of its leaders and its members who refuse to operate in the spirit of solidarity and cohesion which is supposed to be the foundation of the Union.  We believe there is now an absolutely compelling case for a significant increase in EU resources as part of a wider agreement on a genuine monetary union.  This cannot happen if those who represent citizens at the Council table refuse to even raise the issue.  The biggest threat to the Union today is not the traditional anti-EU element of the right and left; it is the supposedly pro-EU politicians who indulge in nationalist posturing and refuse to commit to an agenda of making the Union work for all of its members.  I welcome the fact that the proposals for the single supervisory mechanism are proceeding, but what I do not welcome is their incomplete nature and the failure to move ahead with the resolution and deposit protection measures which are the other two essential elements of a proper banking union.</p><p> As I have said before, the justice of Ireland&rsquo;s case for further significant relief from banking-related debts gets stronger all the time.  The Taoiseach owes it to this House and to the Irish people to explain what exactly he is doing to bring this about.  He has yet to publish the requested evaluation of the long-term impact of the conversion of the promissory notes.  He has said nothing about the retention by the ECB of profits on Irish bond holdings and he is silent about the impact of the Central Bank of Ireland being forced to sell off its holdings sooner than anticipated.</p><p> This was a complacent summit which did nothing to stop the cycle of stumbling from crisis to crisis.  Its message was &ldquo;carry on regardless&rdquo;.  It did not even agree one of the incremental steps which have replaced the desperately needed radical plan for delivering growth and jobs.  The world is looking on while the people in Cyprus have been refused access to their own money as the banks have been closed since 15 March.  Confidence in the ability of the EU leaders to deal competently with this ongoing issue is at an all-time low and this is worryingly increasing the anti EU sentiment that is growing at too rapid a rate in Britain and across the EU.  In the meanwhile, all we have seen from the Irish Presidency is regular press releases over-spinning everything and reinforcing this complacency.</p></speech>

It is clear, both from the economic priorities emanating from the Council and its approach to the Cyprus crisis, that the EU is wedded to the failed policies of austerity, or fiscal consolidation, as the Taoiseach calls it.  There is nowhere the dynamism and determination needed to tackle the jobs crisis across the EU.  However, it is on the Cypriot situation I want to focus my remarks.  It is there that we see the real dysfunction at the heart of the EU approach to the economic crisis.</p><p>  The fact that the Eurogroup, including the Minister, Deputy Noonan, would sign up to a bailout which contained a levy on bank depositors under and over &euro;100,000, while sparing senior bondholders in the banks, quite frankly beggars belief.  That was a huge mistake by the Government.  The Taoiseach admits in his statement today that the issue was not discussed in detail at the summit yet he welcomed and signed up to this development.  Following this, European leaders stood back over the last week and allowed Cyprus to be brought to the brink of economic collapse. Instead of assisting the people of the island, they have bullied it and accused the Cypriot people of being the authors of their own demise.  So much for European solidarity.  We do not see such allegations being hurled at larger European states when they get themselves in difficulty.</p><p>  The revised bailout agreement means that senior bondholders will take a hit as will deposit holders over &euro;100,000.  While I welcome the decision not to hit deposit holders under &euro;100,000, the reality is that the Rubicon has been crossed.  International depositors looking at the mess in Cyprus may consider not just withdrawing their money from banks there, but from across the EU.  It is claimed in some media that several large multinationals withdraw their money from eurozone banks every Friday in case something happens over the weekend, and that was before this latest crisis.</p><p>  The prevailing sense is of a European establishment making it up as it goes along.  The decision to try to hit depositors under &euro;100,000 put into sharp focus ECB President Draghi's statement last July that the bank will do whatever it takes to preserve the euro.  This appears to now include hitting depositors and possibly those with under &euro;100,000 in a bank.  The Irish Government welcomed this, which was a mistake.  The Cypriot Parliament rejected it but the damage was done by then.  Why should investors, especially large investors, trust the EU or the ECB?  Fears that bank accounts could be raided in future bailouts were given added weight by the head of the eurozone finance ministers. who at first suggested that the Cyprus bailout could be a template for future action and then had to retract this.</p><p>  The ECB put Cyprus under huge pressure to agree a plan by threatening to collapse the Cypriot banking system.  The bailout that has now been agreed includes the increase in its corporation tax from 10% to 12.5%.  This is a sovereign state having a new tax rate imposed on it.  The Irish Government claims the EU cannot make us increase our corporation tax rate, yet the Government was part of the group forcing this on Cyprus.</p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in at the beginning of the Irish banking crisis called for bondholders to be burned.  When we advocated the burning of bondholders in banks, Fianna F&aacute;il, Fine Gael and Labour told us it would never happen, that the EU would never let it happen and that banks had to be bailed out at any cost.  The EU appears to have now signed off on the burning of senior bondholders in Cypriot banks.</p><p>  Last June, the Government told us that a seismic game-changer had been reached which would see the separation of banking debt from sovereign debt.  It told us that in future bank crises the ESM would directly recapitalise banks and the sovereign would not be expected to take on a bank bailout.  It told us that, because we had taken on this liability, we would be retrospectively recapitalised.  The EU could have committed to using the ESM to cover losses needed for the Cypriot banks.  It did not do this and the question is why it did not.  Where now is the commitment to separate sovereign debt from bank debt?</p><p>  Comments today and yesterday by some politicians in Europe throw into doubt whether the ESM will ever be used to recapitalise banks, whether retrospectively or not.  Yesterday, the European Commission confirmed that it hopes the ESM fund will not be used for directly recapitalising banks.  This seems to confirm comments by the chief of the eurozone finance ministers, Mr. Dijsselbloem, who yesterday questioned whether the ESM bailout fund will ever be used to rescue banks directly.  Where now are Ireland's hopes that the ESM will be used to recapitalise the pillar banks?  What about the &euro;30 billion of taxpayers' money this Government and its predecessors gave to Bank of Ireland, AIB and Irish Life &amp; Permanent?</p><p>There seems to be a complete U-turn on EU policy about the use of the ESM and the burning of senior bondholders.  This is a U-turn which causes real problems for citizens of this State who had this debt foisted on us by Fianna F&aacute;il.  We now have a legacy bank debt which may never be dealt with.</p><p> The critical questions for the Government in all of this are what is the point of the ESM and where does Europe now stand on banking solidarity.  What is the Irish Government's attitude towards the burning of depositors in Irish or European banks and why did the Government support it in the Cypriot case?  Will the citizens of this State ever receive debt assistance for the debt this Government and the previous Government put on the shoulders of taxpayers to bail out banks with taxpayers' money?  Will this be done through the ESM or without it?</p><p> Prior to the European Council meeting, the Taoiseach agreed in the D&aacute;il to raise the Jerusalem report published by European diplomats.  They raised serious concerns about the actions of Israel in building settlements and excluding Palestinians from their land.  The Taoiseach made no mention of this in his statement today.  Did he raise this report at the summit meeting as he promised?</p></speech>

Many people listening at home would agree with this assessment.  For too many people, it will be seen as further proof that the EU's austerity response to the crisis facing many member states is failing.  No discussions on the MFF or the budget took place at the European Council meeting.  Listening to the Taoiseach's speech prior to the meeting, we would have been under the impression that this would have been on the table.  The Taoiseach said a discussion took place afterwards.  It seems to have been an afterthought.  The European Parliament overwhelmingly rejected the EU budget proposed by the Council, a piece of breaking news I outlined to the Taoiseach in this House.  If the Council's proposed budget had been passed, it would have been the first time in 56 years that the EU budget had been cut, which would have made no sense while the EU continues to face significant economic problems.  The Council's proposed budget was an austerity budget that would have locked the EU into austerity for the next seven years.  Many of us said in this House and elsewhere that it did not contain sufficient spending power to boost investment in jobs and would lead to many member states being starved of strategic investment in key areas.</p><p>  Thankfully, 506 MEPs, who are probably more clued in to what is happening on the ground, also believed this and voted against the Council's proposed budget.  Will the Taoiseach outline at some stage whether the discussion on the MFF will be placed on the agenda of the next Council meeting in May?  Has the Irish Government given up on its chance to raise the MFF with the European Council during Ireland's Presidency?</p><p>  The European Parliament's rejection of this budget presents a lifeline to the Taoiseach.  It is a real opportunity to renegotiate a better deal.  The Parliament's rejection also allows him to argue for a greater stimulus investment in jobs and growth, for which many people across Europe are arguing.  Major savings can also be made on unnecessary administrative costs.  I have raised this issue on numerous occasions.  I hope the Taoiseach will raise this issue when the budget is being discussed at the European Council.  The monthly charade involved in thousands of MEPs, officials and documents decamping from Brussels to Strasbourg should be discarded in favour of the European Parliament having one seat.  It is an inefficient and hugely expensive process.  If one talks to most people across Europe, they will agree that this is the case.  The EU could save an estimated &euro;200 million per year or &euro;1.4 billion over a seven-year period of the current budget.  If this money was invested in job promotion, it would have great potential to change people's lives.  I hope the Taoiseach takes the opportunity given to him by the European Parliament and uses Ireland's Presidency to renegotiate a pro-growth, pro-jobs, progressive budget which is desperately needed by Ireland and the EU.</p><p>  The loss of Irish MEPs was also not placed on the Council meeting agenda.  Again, many people are asking why this was the case.  A total of 12 Irish MEPs voted against a proposal which would, yet again, reduce the influence and amount of MEPs Ireland has in the European Parliament.  This included four MEPs from the Taoiseach's party and three MEPs from his partners in Government, the Labour Party.  Could the Taoiseach tell us whether this rejection of the proposal by seven Government MEPs is a reflection of the Government's unhappiness with this proposal?  Ireland has lost out with regard to successive seat redistributions which has a negative impact on the ability of Irish MEPs to defend Irish interests and makes it increasingly difficult for Irish representation to the European Parliament to reflect adequately the range and diversity of political opinion in Ireland.  The fact that the larger member states all maintain their current allocation of seats while relatively smaller and medium-sized countries such as Ireland have their representation reduced serves further to strengthen the view regarding the substantial influence of these larger countries in deliberations not only of the Parliament but within the EU.  The Taoiseach received a letter this morning from the three MEPs requesting that he consider taking measures to ensure the proposal that the Council sends to the Parliament for approval maintains the current allocation of seats to Ireland.  If necessary, they also believe the use of the veto would be justified to ensure Ireland does not again lose out in this vital area.  Will the Taoiseach argue in favour of Ireland maintaining its current allocation of seats at the next Council meeting?  Would he be willing to use the veto to ensure Ireland maintains its current representation in the European Parliament?</p><p>  It has also been reported that the French and British governments are actively lobbying to lift the EU arms embargo on Syria so they can supply Syrian opposition forces with weapons.  Does the Taoiseach agree this will only serve to deepen the conflict and increase the hurt, pain and bloodshed inflicted on a daily basis by both sides on the Syrian people?  I hope the Irish Government stands firm against any attempt to lift this embargo and puts its efforts into creating a negotiated settlement to end hostilities in the region.  We need to get people talking instead of increasing the militarisation of the conflict in Syria.  Ireland should use its Presidency to call for a cessation rather than an escalation of the conflict in Syria.</p></speech>

In June 2012, we were promised seismic changes in the way banking and sovereign debt would be dealt with in the EU.  Instead, the citizens of Europe have been treated to institutional dishonesty and mendacity by a dissimulating EU leadership.</p><p>  In the old days, bank robbers wore masks and waved guns around.  There was no mistaking their intention.  The gang leaders demanded the cash and they fled the scene fearful of capture.  In today's European Union, bank robberies are planned in Brussels and Frankfurt.  The godfathers united in a gang called the troika send their hitmen and hitwomen in pinstriped suits who stay in luxury hotels at the expense of their intended victims and rob with the threat of a nuclear wipe-out of bank depositors, bank workers and the very economies of the target countries.</p><p>In the old days, bank workers, aggrieved depositors and victims of bank robberies, could turn to the law for redress.  In today's European Union, the bank robbers are the law.  This is the surreal new world of the European Union where the establishment of the EU, Big Brother and, it would seem, the ghost of John Dillinger, have morphed into an economic Frankenstein that terrorises citizens, robs their assets and lays waste their economies.</p><p> Once, the European Union establishment used to boast loudly that it was a haven of democracy and solidarity, a beacon of light in our world and an example to be imitated by the savages unlucky enough to be outside its borders.  After two weeks in which the Cypriot people - Cyprus is the smallest member state of the EU - have been threatened, terrorised and bullied by the EU, the IMF and the ECB, the moral reputation of this troika lies somewhere south of that of robber barons and economic gang rapists.</p><p> That an Irish Government as President of the EU would warmly welcome the first edict relating to Cypriot banks that literally would rob working people and pensioners in Cyprus and literally steal the widow's mite, is a grotesque betrayal of the generosity of the Irish people.  We have a Government which is in a position of perpetual prostration in face of the demands of the institution of European capitalism, the IMF, the ECB and the EU bureaucracy itself.  As an Irish legislator and socialist, I apologise to the people of Cyprus for the treacherous role of the Irish Government in its collusion with the modern robber barons of the troika as it seeks out a bailout of its diseased financial system.</p><p> Aggressive states invariably invent a pretext for an attack on another country; so also with the troika.  The slander in this case is that Cyprus is virtually a client state of the Russian mafia.  What nauseating hypocrisy.  The EU was a key cheerleader for the privatisation of massive assets that belonged to the Russian people when Stalinism collapsed.  This meant the pillage of the privatised assets by those who became oligarchs and billionaires.</p><p> For 20 years before the international financial crash of 2007, the EU was a key cheerleader and implementing agency for wholesale deregulation and liberalisation in the financial markets, enabling billions to be transferred freely all over the world in search of speculative profits.  The people of Cyprus are the victims of these policies.  If the financial markets system is sick, dysfunctional, destructive of democracy and exploitative of ordinary people and society - it is all of these - it has become so in the watch and under the legislative provision of the institutions now collectively known as the troika.  The troika solution to the diseased system it has created is to burn the civilian population, leaving an economic scorched earth in its wake.</p><p> Cyprus is the last straw.  It is time the victims turned.  It is time that workers and the poor united across borders, from Greece to Ireland, to break this dysfunctional system, take the financial institutions into public ownership and democratic control and plan for people, not for private profit.  That is the democratic socialist alternative.</p></speech>

Cyprus joined the European Union in 2008 and its loan books grew by 32% in one year.  Its banks attracted depositors because of the high interest rates.  Money in Cypriot banks earned twice as much as in Italy or Spain and four times as much as in Germany.  The Cypriot banks were eight times the size of the Cypriot economy, employing 150,000 bank workers out of a population of 700,000.  Losses on the Greek sovereign bonds equalled one third of the Cypriot GDP.</p><p>  In former times, wearing his other cap, the T&aacute;naiste would have questioned this domination by rogue banking systems of the world economy, nation states and people's lives.  The Russian mafia has been referred to by Deputy Higgins.  A banking Mafia is dictating the lives of ordinary people and causing penury in many areas of the world.  These banks are engaged in casino capitalism.  I ask why the T&aacute;naiste, who is a Labour Party Minister, does not enter this key debate on how society should be run.</p><p>  Two European economies have been destroyed, Greece and Cyprus and Ireland, Portugal and Spain are in deep recession.  We need to move away from this casino banking mafia-run international system.  The T&aacute;naiste would have made the argument in the past that we need a banking system in which people can have confidence, that they can be assured that their money will not be put on the next horse in the 4.30.  We need a system that serves the interest of the people, of small business and the economy in general.  This should be a State-owned, democratic banking system.  As Deputy Higgins said, this must be part of the debate when deciding how to move our economy forward.</p><p>  The people of Cyprus are so bloody angry about what has happened.  They are in tears.  They are like the people who come to my office and to the T&aacute;naiste's office with tears in their eyes because they cannot deal with the levels of debt, stress and pain.  The Irish Government could play a key role in that debate.  The T&aacute;naiste is supposed to be a representative of the working man and woman and he should be speaking about their situation at the EU summit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-27a.208" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/956" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032700012#K00300"><p>Latest events in Cyprus once again place a serious question mark over any notion of European solidarity.  Where is the solidarity?  How could the people of Europe think there is any such thing?  The programme of austerity has proven to be a disaster.  Europe is dominated by an absence of growth, by unemployment and by levels of youth unemployment in particular which vary from 30% to 60%.  Europe is dominated by all the social problems which represent the fallout from these frightening unemployment figures.  Is it a price worth paying?</p><p>  In 1998, when Condoleezza Rice was asked if the deaths of 500,000 Iraqis in the 1991 bombing campaign was a price worth paying in order to control the price of oil, she replied, &quot;It is a heavy price but, Yes, it is worth paying.&quot;  The powers of central Europe would probably give the same answer if asked about the ravaging effects of austerity across Europe but the majority of Europeans would not.</p><p>  The Cyprus experience marks an escalation in what is called austerity economics.  This is an effort to pay for the cost of this now six year old global crisis in a new way.  It is an effort to fund the bailout of banks in a new way.  This new way was agreed last week by the European forces in control, the ECB, the EU and the IMF.  It imposes on Cyprus a new step which is literally to snatch money from the bank accounts of many of the citizens of Cyprus.  It is a form of blackmail.  The officials of the banks and the political leaders are saying to the people, &quot;This awful deal makes you - who have nothing to do with the crisis and did not get any bailout - pay the cost of the crisis and the bailout.  You must do this because if not, we will do even more damage to you and your economy.  So, give us your deposits, give us your money, pay more taxes, put up with fewer social programmes, because if not, we will impose even worse on you.&quot;  This is the basic idea of austerity.</p><p>  On the decision to take money from depositors, a depositor, whether a business or an individual, puts his or her money into a bank in the belief that its security is guaranteed because otherwise, no one would put their money in banks.  Shareholders and bondholders may be investors and speculators but depositors are not.  The plan is to take the depositors' money, thereby destroying all confidence and the presumption of security or insurance, in the language of these politicians, in order to recapitalise and restructure our banks.  Translated into simple English, they will take the depositors' money and bail out the banks.  In other words, the money leaves the accounts of the depositors and goes into the account of the bank itself.  The banks, through the government, are stealing from their own depositors.</p><p>  A woman struggling to run a family business in Cyprus said the whole point of the bailout was to shrink the banking sector but instead they destroyed the entire economy.  It is simply an attempt to save private banking.  It is a refusal to confront private banking, not just in Cyprus or Greece but across the world, that has driven us into a catastrophe of global proportions.  </p><p>Governments are doing everything to fix the situation without imposing on them and without questioning their failed performance.  It is an amazing study in how to solve a problem by refusing to confront its cause.  In <i>The Guardian</i>today, political editor, Seumas Milne, does not mince his words when he writes:<blockquote><font color="#333333">The deal forced on Cyprus by the German-led Troika at the weekend isn't a bailout: it will effectively destroy the island's economy.  Instead of getting a grip on its grossly inflated banks, it will impose a brutal credit contraction, combined with sweeping cuts and privatisations, wiping out perhaps a quarter of Cyprus's national income.  Ordinary Cypriots, not Russian oligarchs, will pay the price.</font></blockquote> Some have hailed the fact that the raid was carried out on Cypriot bank deposits over &#8364;100,00 rather than on the public purse.  At last, it has been said, the rich and those responsible for private banking failures are being made to cough up.  That would have been a good thing but it is savers not bankers or shareholders who are taking the 40% hit.  Many of the targeted depositors include pensioners, who are scarcely rich, and small businesses, which will now go bust.  The Cypriot Government should have learned from Iceland instead and taken over the banks, isolated the bad loans, protected deposits, imposed losses on the wealthy and used a publicly-owned banking sector to rebuild the domestic economy.  This would have offered citizens a better future - almost certainly, I admit, outside the eurozone - and encroached on private capital's privileges.  Clearly, that could not be tolerated.  Instead, in classic EU style, Cypriots have been given no say while German MPs vote on the deal.  Across Europe, people are being held to ransom by banks, bondholders and corporations determined to ensure they do not bear the cost of the crisis they created and by politicians who regard it as their job to oblige them.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste will forgive me for asking.  The presence of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, suggests she might take questions, which she is well able to do.  I would like to ask her about her criticisms of finance Ministers at the Eurogroup meeting, but I am not going to do that.</p><p>  I put it to the T&aacute;naiste that the Taoiseach in his speech to the House said that while the new Cypriot President was welcomed to the table, there was no discussion at the summit of the developing situation with Cyprus as it was to be discussed by the finance Ministers.  It is an incredible statement.  We have just witnessed an incredibly incompetent approach to the resolution of the Cyprus crisis which has been going on for nine months.  It has almost precipitated a significant banking run and a meltdown in Cyprus with consequences beyond to such an extent that capital controls have been imposed, which are unprecedented in the EU and are against its entire spirit.  Banks have remained closed since 15 March 2013.  The T&aacute;naiste's colleague, the Cypriot foreign Minister, has admitted that Cyprus had not anticipated the Eurogroup demand that Nicosia impose a deposit tax.  He went on to say that Luxembourg was the only country to support the Cypriot position.  Behind the scenes, Greece had said it was with them but the only country to support them at the Eurogroup meeting and in general was Luxembourg.  Everybody else remained silent.  The foreign Minister said the proposal of the troika - or directorate as he called it -  to impose a draconian deposit tax represented a ruthless decision to wreck the country's economic system.</p><p>  Why did Ireland remain silent?  Why did we not back Cyprus in this situation?  It is extraordinary that Cyprus has been hung out to dry and that decisions have been taken which will have far-reaching implications for its sustainability as an economy into the future.  Do we have any principled positions on these issues?  We welcomed the original across-the-board tax on deposits, which was correctly overturned by the Cypriot Parliament.  Why did we not support Cyprus in its hour of need?</p></speech>

Ireland expressed its solidarity with Cyprus with regard to what was happening there.  No country wants to see a crisis in its banking system.  Cyprus's banks are closed and people are limited to taking &euro;100 per day out of ATMs.  We have seen a very severe package being put together to address the banking situation.</p><p>  The sequence as I understand it began some time ago when it was known that there were problems in the Cypriot banking system.  A general election took place in Cyprus and there was a change of government.  Discussions took place which resulted in a early proposed package of measures, some of which were favourable to the Cypriot Government.  It was rejected by the Cypriot Parliament and came back for further discussion.</p><p>  There is no doubt that what is happening in Cyprus is serious and severe.  The imposition of major levies on deposits and people's savings has a very severe impact.  It is not a route that this country, thankfully, will go down.  We are in an entirely different situation now.  The way we handled the banking crisis that we inherited from Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin's Government was entirely different.  Thankfully, we have not had to travel the same route as Cyprus.</p></speech>

That was entirely reprehensible and I would like an explanation for it.  There is no point in being rhetorical about solidarity when the Government was on board for the taking of money from bank deposits.</p><p>  At the last discussion in the House before the summit, the Taoiseach gave me a firm commitment that he would raise there the Jerusalem report.  The Jerusalem report indicts the Israeli Government, particularly, though not exclusively, for its settlement policy.  The Taoiseach did not mention it in his remarks.  I asked him the question while he was still in the Chamber but he did not respond.  I ask the T&aacute;naiste now if the Taoiseach, in keeping with the commitment he gave in the House, raised the Jerusalem report at the summit.</p></speech>

Last week, when the Cypriot deal was initially done, people asked why we did not follow suit and said it was a great idea.  Now we know and those who were arguing one way now have an entirely different position.</p><p>  On the Jerusalem report, it was agreed at the summit that foreign affairs issues, of which there were a number, including the issue of Syria, would be referred back to the Foreign Affairs Council.  There was a meeting of foreign affairs Ministers last weekend in Dublin at which the issue of Syria was discussed.  There is an ongoing discussion on the Middle East peace process and an ongoing dialogue between the European Union and the United States of America, in particular.</p><p>President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry visited the Middle East last week.  I had discussions with Secretary of State Kerry before the visit and we are in continuing contact about the visit and about getting discussions moving to try to bring about a settlement of the crisis in the Middle East.  The Taoiseach and I discussed the Middle East peace process with President Obama when we met him during the St. Patrick's Day events.  We will keep up contact with the United States Administration to use the leverage of the United States Administration and the European Union to try to renew the talks and discussions to get a settlement of the Middle East peace process.</p><p> The European Union has taken a strong position on the settlements, which are illegal.  They should not proceed with the continuation of settlements in the West Bank.  If they continue, it will make the achievement of a two-state solution physically impossible.  We need to concentrate on renewed efforts to get talks going to bring about lasting peace in the Middle East.</p></speech>

I refer to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>, which quotes a German banker who headed up the Deutsche Bank London operation and who was involved in the IFSC:<blockquote>Instead of having to go all the way to Wall Street, German banks soon found a casino in their own euro zone backyard: Dublin. &#8220;Ireland, with its tax breaks, became a convenient place to do all of this business.&#8221;  [He goes on] &#8220;If you set up a tax haven, however, you have to be clear that people will come who are not necessarily interested in business but simply the tax benefits.  It was Ireland that opened a Pandora&#8217;s box.&#8221;</blockquote>I put it to the T&aacute;naiste that it is an accurate description of the IFSC as was and as is.  The comparison with the casino financial system in Cyprus is very strong.  The only difference between what happened in Ireland and in Cyprus is that the intervention of the Cypriot people last week forced the EU finance Ministers, including our Minister for Finance to back off on an outrageous proposal to raid the savings of ordinary people under &#8364;100,000 and forced Governments to burn the bondholders and corporate depositors and protect those with savings under &#8364;100,000.  That contrasts sharply with the T&aacute;naiste's continued determination, in the context of Ireland's crisis, to protect the bondholders and the corporate depositors and inflict all the pain on the people who have under &#8364;100,000.  The T&aacute;naiste should not tell us he would not consider raiding the bank accounts of ordinary citizens because the T&aacute;naiste has just given himself the power to do that.  The Government will raid the bank accounts and wage packets of ordinary citizens to impose the home tax.</p></speech>

It would be worth the Deputy's while checking from where it came before making that kind of allegation.</p><p>  I thank all the Deputies for their contributions to the debate.  This month's European Council meeting represented an important opportunity for European leaders to take the pulse of the Union, particularly with regard to economic and social policy.  It is fair to say, as the Taoiseach noted at the start of today's debate, that while leaders recognised and, indeed, welcomed the considerable achievements that have been made, the emphasis must remain on the continuing need for implementation of the wide range of measures that the Union has already agreed.  Full and timely implementation of what we have agreed will ensure that our currency and the Union are returned to stability and that our energies are converted into restoring sustainable growth that generates jobs for our people.</p><p>  I am happy to report that the first half of our Presidency has already seen a series of important achievements not least the provisional agreement we reached earlier this month with the European Parliament on the single supervisory mechanism for European banks, which is an essential precursor for the direct recapitalisation of banks by the ESM; the youth guarantee, which promises to provide young people with a good quality offer of employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed; agreement on the capitalisation of European banks, the CRDIV; the two-pack of economic governance measures; and an agreed Council position on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, the source of the vast majority of transfers to Ireland from the EU budget.  These are real achievements, each of which has the potential to contribute positively to realising our Presidency priorities of stability, growth and jobs.</p><p>  At the European Council, the Taoiseach reassured his colleagues that, as holders of the Presidency, we will continue to engage with partners and with the institutions to ensure every opportunity is availed of to ensure we follow through on implementation across the broad.  The spring European Council was an important moment for governments to look in a very concrete way at the real economic and social challenges now being faced in most of our European capitals.  The issue of jobs was at the heart of much of that debate.</p><p>  This month's European Council marked the conclusion of the first phase of the European semester process, with the provision of guidance to member states as they now set about preparing stability programme updates under the Stability and Growth Pact and national reform programmes under the Europe 2020 Strategy.</p><p>  The country-specific orientations for each member state will be returned to by leaders in June as will a full review of the Compact for Growth and Jobs, a year on from its adoption.  That will be a very important.  I welcome the fact that this meeting of the European Council explicitly recognised unemployment, especially youth unemployment, as the most important challenge facing us.  That tallies well with what this Government has been saying over the past two years and with our priorities as holders of the Presidency.  We now have agreement on the youth employment initiative and the youth guarantee.  What is critical now is that they be implemented imaginatively and with energy.</p><p>  Importantly, leaders also recognised the ongoing potential of the European Investment Bank to play an important role as a catalyst for growth and job creation.  In hard cash terms, the &euro;10 billion increase in the EIB's capital will go towards assisting in the co-financing of up to &euro;180 billion worth of projects up to 2015.  That is real money and real investment.</p><p>  The potential of the Single Market to assist in boosting growth and employment remains.  To make that potential real, we are prioritising the reaching of agreement on the key remaining Single Market Act I files.  We also intend to progress, to the degree possible, Single Market Act II files, as they are published.</p><p>  I welcome also the concrete moves which leaders have endorsed towards reducing the regulatory burden, especially on our SMEs, the backbone of our domestic economy and of domestic employment.  Reducing unnecessary burdens at the EU level should complement what we are doing nationally and contribute to improving competitiveness.  In each of these areas, what is now needed is urgent action and concerted implementation.</p><p>  As holders of the Presidency, we continue to work closely with President Van Rompuy as he prepares the report on strengthening Economic and Monetary Union which he will present to the June meeting of the European Council.  While there was no substantive discussion of this at the European Council, the meeting took the opportunity to take stock of progress towards the creation of a banking union and towards delivery of the commitment to separate banking and sovereign debt made last June and reiterated by the European Council in December.</p></speech>

The Bill is misnamed.  It should be the Motor Vehicle and National Debt (Duties and Licences) Bill 2013 because one of the sections actually deals with the &euro;150 million that is being hijacked and sent to the Department of Finance.  It will not be spent on roads at all.  When paying for something, people are entitled to ask what they are getting for their money.  They see roads and footpaths deteriorating at the same time as they are subject to increases in motor tax.  Where is the money going?  It is going into the local government fund.  One cannot talk about one section of this Bill without talking about other aspects.  The money is going into the local government fund so it is not going towards road improvements.  The money is to fund local authorities.  On Second Stage, the Minister was very up-front about saying that up to &euro;150 million would be taken from the fund and sent to the Minister for Finance.  He stated very clearly in his Second Stage speech that it would go towards paying off the national debt.  People should be under no illusion about where the money is going.  It is not everyone who gets an opportunity to examine legislation and make that connection for himself or herself.</p><p>  The approach is dishonest.  Revenue should fund what it is collected for.  This is simply not the case in this instance.  If one takes into consideration the &euro;150 million, one will note that the local government fund has been depleted, by &euro;534 million, from a high in 2009 to a low this year.  This is above the amount that is expected to accrue from property tax.  Despite increases in motor tax to improve the roads, there will not be an improvement in services.   It cannot happen because the money is not available.</p><p>  If motor tax rates were being increased for the purpose of fixing roads and footpaths in my constituency and elsewhere, I would not have tabled an amendment objecting to the legislation.  The money is not being used for the stated purpose and the Government should be up-front in stating the true purpose.  With the withdrawal of public transport services around the country, very few people have adequate public transport.  They do not have a choice but to use a car.  The money they pay in tax is not being used for the repair of roads or the provision of public transport, as an alternative to driving; rather, it is being used purely to pay off the national debt.  I cannot emphasise this enough and I object as strongly as I can.</p><p>  I am disappointed that one of my amendments has been ruled out of order.  Essentially, it is the one that gets to the core of the problem.  It refers to the transfer of money to the Department of Finance.  The local government fund uses a needs-and-resources model but the baseline of the assessment of needs is very flawed.  It takes no consideration of recent population increases and the associated needs, including in the constituency of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd.  Populations do not grow without a growth in associated needs.  The baseline is very flawed.  If the Government is to have an equalisation fund with a flawed baseline, areas with growing populations, which have new needs, will be disadvantaged.  It is a case of there being one circle.  There is a dishonest approach and people are receiving extra bills through their doors.  I drive a very small car and noted there was an increase in my motor tax in the order of &euro;47.  People are talking about this; I am not complaining about the motor tax I have to pay, but it shows there is a sizeable increase that is noticeable.  It is costing people more to go to work.  The funding is not to make the roads safer or to improve road surfaces, which is what people believe it is for.</p></speech>

I certainly agree with Deputy Murphy in that regard.  That &euro;150 million is being taken from approximately &euro;1 billion in revenue to pay off the national debt is a scam and a shame.  In our constituencies, we note the number of potholes and roads requiring maintenance.  There are unfinished estates on which money could be spent.</p><p>  Traditionally, the money went to the local authorities and was divided between them.  People do not realise that so much is being taken from this revenue.  They actually believe they are paying for road maintenance.</p><p>  I object to the fact that an amendment was ruled out of order on the basis of there being a cost to the State.  This is connected to what happened in 2008 under the previous Government.  There was much hype about people buying new cars.  All sorts of incentives were given to people to buy new emission-free cars attracting a low rate of taxation.  There is a fundamental problem in that we are either moving towards an environmentally friendly society and looking towards emissions reduction or we are not.  Our very motor tax system is wrong and we should be examining emissions.  There needs to be an overhaul of our approach.  There is no use in saying that what was proposed in 2008 was not viable because it would cost the State at a later date.</p><p>We need to look at basing motor tax on car emissions rather than on their size.  The current process is flawed.  I am opposed to this Bill on that basis and on the basis of Sinn F&eacute;in's amendments having been ruled out of order.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-27a.273" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1001" speakername="Thomas Pringle" time="12:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032700017#P00200"><p>I agree that this Bill has been wrongly named.  It should be entitled the appropriation Bill, to appropriate money to write down debt.  The linking of motor taxation to car emissions was a positive development.  It encouraged people to buy cars of greater value to the environment and society and eased the burden on them in terms of taxation of such vehicles.</p><p>  The Government amendment introduced on Committee Stage shows the real purpose of this legislation and the Government's proposed use of moneys from motor taxation into the future.  It is proposed that &euro;150 million will be taken from motor taxation receipts this year and put towards writing down our national debt.  Last year, &euro;46.5 million was taken from motor tax receipts and used for this purpose.  This illustrates the mockery of the entire Government process.  It is now proposed that money previously collected through motor tax and ring-fenced for local government will be stripped from the Local Government Fund and replaced with funding from the property tax, which will bring no additional benefits to local authorities.  The &euro;150 million to be taken this year is only the thin edge of the wedge.  We will see in future years more funding being taken from motor taxation receipts and local authority funding being bridged by receipts from the local property tax, with no additional benefit to local authorities or services, which will continue to be put under threat.  This will also lead to further deterioration of our roads.  This Bill should be opposed on the basis that funding is being taken from motor taxation receipts and used to write down national debt, which is disgraceful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-27a.274" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1069" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" time="12:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032700017#P00300"><p>I thank the Deputies for their comments and views.  I should first point out that the amendments tabled by Deputies Catherine Murphy and Dessie Ellis were ruled out of order not by the Department but by this House.  I am happy to debate the issues.  While they cannot be put before the House by way of amendment, they can be debated in the context of our discussion.</p><p>  I note that Deputy Murphy is opposed to the increases that took effect from January 2013 on the grounds that the moneys being raised will go to the Exchequer rather than the Local Government Fund.  Ensuring sustainable funding for local authorities is a priority for this Government.  We are progressing the introduction of the local property tax as part of this process.  This will, in time, become an important element of funding for local authorities.  Nevertheless, the local property tax will not be the only source of funding.  We need to ensure a robust and predictable source of additional funding for the Local Government Fund.  Motor tax is the source of this funding.  It is an unavoidable fact that the new CO2-based system of motor tax introduced in July 2008 by the previous Government is working, that more people are buying cars that pollute less and that manufacturers are reducing the CO2 emissions of cars, all of which have resulted in less income receipts.</p><p>  There is nothing in this Bill that alters the fact that the lower the carbon emissions of a vehicle the lower the motor tax applicable and the higher the carbon emissions the more one pays.  The amount collected has fallen significantly and it is predicted it will decrease by more than 50% over the next 15 years.  If we do not make these adjustments, the tax base in 15 years' time will have shrunk by 50%.  In other words, the number of cars with low emissions will have increased, resulting in lower receipts from motor tax.  This means there would be no funding available to maintain our roads, about which the Deputies have expressed concern.  The switch was not revenue-neutral.  In other words, while the initiative was good for the environment, it resulted in a loss of income for the Exchequer.  Everybody accepts that the lower the emissions from cars the better for our environment and for society.  As a result of this loss of income we must increase motor tax rates, albeit proportionally between vehicles with lower and higher emissions.  </p><p>  Every year since 2008 there has been a year-on-year reduction in income related to this changeover.  It went from a high of &euro;1.06 billion in 2008 to &euro;1.01 billion in 2011.  In the absence of the budget last year, motor tax income would have been in the region of &euro;954 million, a reduction of 5.5%, and would have continued to decline.  Without these proposed rebalancing measures, the downward trend will continue as the proportion of vehicles taxed on CO2 emissions increases.  Last year, for the first time, the majority of new registrations were in the lowest tax band.  This trend is expected to continue in future years.  It is unsustainable to operate on the basis that an increasing majority of cars will be taxed at the lowest level, leaving us in a worse financial position.  Accordingly, a rejection of the increase announced in the budget would result in a worsening of the local authority funding structure over time and the environmental inadequacy of the lower tax band would become entrenched.  On both counts, this would not be responsible and would damage the local authority system that Deputies are seeking to protect.</p><p>  The fact that a maximum of &euro;150 million will be taken from motor tax receipts this year has been the subject of much comment today.  It was also the subject of comment in the clear, concise and transparent budget statement by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  Notwithstanding the concerns expressed by Deputies, there has been no secrecy about it.  The proposal was set out in the Minister's budget speech, which was available, as it should be, for all Deputies to read.  There has been transparency in regard to what is proposed.</p><p>  As stated by Deputy Pringle, &euro;46.5 million was transferred last year from the Local Government Fund to the Exchequer in a transparent process.  In other words, it was announced and was done.  What is proposed for this year is applicable to this year only.   I accept that this money is being used to write off national debt.  We are in exceptional times.  We are spending &euro;1 billion more per month than what is being taken in.  Notwithstanding all the points made-----</p></speech>

I believe this is a balanced approach.  The Government is committed to supporting the Local Government Fund, which will retain the bulk of income from motor tax to be used to fund local services.  The balance of the fund, for distribution to local authorities and to provide for road and public transport infrastructure, will be of the order of &euro;960 million.  In other words, almost &euro;1 billion in motor tax receipts will be definitively used to maintain the road network, notwithstanding that up to &euro;150 million of all the money collected may not be spent in that way.</p></speech>

We know this measure is contained in that Bill.  Nobody is saying this proposal is being introduced without having been previously flagged.  The point we are making is that motor tax receipts should go to local authorities for the purposes outlined.  I find it difficult to understand the reason Fianna F&aacute;il, which introduced the emissions rule in 2008, did not table amendments to this Bill.</p><p>It seems ironic that its members have remained silent throughout the debate.  The party introduced this measure which imposed huge costs.  It made a false promise and not one word has been said by its members during the debate.</p></speech>

While the Minister mentioned the increase in motor taxation in his Budget Statement, he did not mention that the revenue accruing from it would go specifically towards writing down our debt.</p></speech>

He has said the Government needs to raise this tax to place local government on a sustainable footing and that the money raised will be sent to the Department of Finance to pay down the national debt.  That is what will be done with the money raised.  It will not be put into the motor tax or local government fund; rather it will go towards paying down the national debt, as the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government made very clear during his Second Stage speech.  It was stated that this was where the money would go.</p></speech>

It will not be used to provide a sustainable source of funding for local government; it will go nowhere next, nigh or near local government.</p><p>  The idea behind introducing carbon emission targets and the approach to reducing such emissions were in recognition of the fact that we had carbon change obligations.  Transportation is one of the areas in which we face a serious challenge.  We are losing routes from the public transport system, which makes people much more car-dependent.  We will struggle to meet the carbon emission targets by 2020 and there is every chance that the targets will be increased in the review to take place in 2015.  We need to reward people for good behaviour in reducing carbon emissions and will have to pay fines if we do not reach the targets.  It is counterproductive not to at least consider this issue from a medium-term perspective.</p><p>  Let us be absolutely clear; this is not about the motor tax or local government fund.  The proposed increases - this is the reason I tabled the amendment - are to achieve one thing and one thing only, namely, to pay down the national debt.</p></speech>

There are 55 amendments which I hope to deal with today, if possible, but I am obviously in the hands of the Opposition spokespeople.  We have groupings with which we can agree.  If the House wishes to facilitate it, the intention is to get this Bill finished today as I am anxious to make it law as soon as possible.  We do have animal welfare issues that I would like to deal with by using the tools available in this legislation.  I want to do that sooner rather than later.  It is my intention to get through the amendments as quickly as possible today.</p></speech>

If Deputies want to make detailed points - there are still some issues of contention about the Bill - it would be a pity to rush the legislation.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-27a.312.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032700022#U00500"><p>This question relates to the conduct of audits and studies on the road network.  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in respect of the national roads programme.  The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national roads is a matter for the National Roads Authority, NRA, under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  As regards national roads, therefore, assessment of the condition of the network is the responsibility of the NRA.</p><p>  In line with the requirements of EU Directive 2008/96 on road infrastructure safety management, which was transposed into Irish law in 2011, the NRA has put in place comprehensive guidelines on road safety management procedures for national roads in Ireland, including network safety management, temporary inspection of safety measures, road safety inspection, road safety impact assessment and road safety audit procedures.  The NRA anticipates that the first round of road safety inspections will be completed by the end of 2013 in compliance with the directive.</p><p>  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority.  Works on those roads are funded from local authority resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is a matter for the local authority as well.  State grant payments are administered by the National Roads Authority on my behalf.</p><p>  My Department and the NRA commissioned Pavement Management Services Ltd. to carry out a pavement condition study on the entire regional road network in 2011.  The pavement condition study involved the use of machine surveys to collect road condition data, skidding resistance data and digital imagery on the regional road network.  The main objective of the study was to establish, by county and nationally, the lengths and areas of various categories of regional road requiring various types of remedial works.  This information is required to quantify the current status of road conditions within counties and nationally and to provide a benchmark measurement against which the future actual road conditions can be compared.  Where comparable, the roads were measured against the results of a previous study in 2004, and the results indicated that there had been a considerable improvement in ride quality over the seven-year period.  In addition, the study indicated that nationally the percentage length of the regional road network requiring road reconstruction had dropped significantly from 24% in 2004 to 15% in 2011.</p></reply>

Yet again, there seems to be a considerable number of questions on the Order Paper from Fine Gael backbenchers.  We have seen the same with health questions.  I believe it is unhelpful.  The Minister is usually a straight talker and I wish to put one straight question to him.  Has the Minister, anyone in his Department or anyone associated with him discussed the questions on the paper with any backbenchers in Fine Gael in an effort to have them put down questions on his behalf in order to filibuster Question Time?  Will the Minister answer that question?</p></speech>

My office does not put in questions on behalf of backbench Deputies, but we tell them when Question Time is coming up and when the deadline is and we invite them to submit their questions on relevant issues, which they do all the time.  It is important to bear in mind that everyone in the House is elected and everyone in the House has an equal right to ask questions.  As an Opposition spokesperson, Deputy Dooley gets priority over all other Members, as does Deputy Ellis and whoever represents the Technical Group.  However, backbenchers, whether from the Labour Party, Fine Gael or Fianna F&aacute;il, are elected on the same basis and have an equal right to put down questions, and it is a good thing that they do so.</p></speech>

He is one of the few who has clearly indicated there is a practice within his Department.  He has not spoken for anyone else but at least he has indicated that there is a practice of filibustering Question Time, effectively stuffing the oral questions section of Question Time with general questions that will elicit positive answers-----</p></speech>

However, they are now taking up time in the House which heretofore was used by the Opposition to hold the Minister to account on a variety of issues.  The Minister is a straight talker and I do not believe he needs to do that.  I call on him to consider desisting from the practice in future.</p><p>  In recent weeks the Minister announced that &euro;42 million of Government funding for local authorities could be diverted to emergency road works.  I am concerned that the Minister somehow believes that &euro;42 million is adequate to deal with the level of damage done to the road network as a result of his not being in a position last year to provide additional resources to keep the ongoing care and maintenance programme in place.  The Minister is somehow suggesting that the local authorities should be in a position to do the works from within their own resources while failing to recognise that the local authorities are well strapped because of the increased burden that now befalls them in respect of taking charge of many of the housing estates that need significant service upgrades.  It is not appropriate to suggest that somehow moving money around will resolve the difficulties that are being experienced by motorists on a daily basis.</p><p>  I have been through County Meath on many occasions in recent weeks and once one moves off the main roads there are major problems there.  The Minister must address this in a more substantial way.  I call on him to carry out an audit in the first instance and put himself in a position to know exactly what funding he will have to find for next year's road upgrade programme.</p></speech>

Local authorities have more flexibility in how they can use it.  They have a right to use it in a discretionary way.  They requested this discretion in order that they could prioritise emergency repairs over restoration works.  I have also allocated an extra &euro;2.7 million, particularly to deal with drainage issues which present a big problem on rural roads.  I acknowledge that we are not able to allocate enough funding for roads to maintain them to the standard we would like.  This is because budgets have been cut centrally in the Department but also because local authorities have cut their budgets considerably.  It should be borne in mind that local authorities receive two thirds of motor tax revenue but do not have to spend it on roads.  They should put more of it into road maintenance.  In the next budget and at Estimates time I will make the point strongly to my colleagues that while roads are, by and large, in very good condition, there are parts of the country where they are starting to deteriorate and we will need additional finance to repair them.</p></speech>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-27a.342.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032700023#V00500"><p>This question relates to manual road crossings on the rail network.  As has previously been outlined to the Deputy, matters relating to upgrading works at individual level crossings on the rail network are operational day-to-day matters for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  My Department is fully aware of the importance of railway safety and continues to provide for substantial Exchequer investment in railway safety measures, despite the significant financial challenges.  The overall investment in railway safety measures is in excess of &euro;1.5 billion since 1999 when the railway safety programme commenced.  Investment in railway safety measures this year alone will be approximately &euro;90 million.  It is a matter for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to prioritise the use of these funds, based on appropriate risk assessments.</p><p>  I understand from Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that in the past 12 years, with an investment of in excess of &euro;150 million, it has reduced the number of level crossings on the rail system from over 2,000 to just over 1,000 today.  The total number of manually operated level crossings on the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann network, defined as those where the operation of the crossing gates is the responsibility of the crossing user, is 814.  The vast majority of these, 649, are field to field crossings, generally used for agricultural activities.  There are a further 117 level crossings on private roads, with the remaining 48 on public roads.  There are an additional 72 crossings on the network on public roads where operation of the crossing is manual, but this operation is conducted by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann staff.</p><p>  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is committed to an ongoing risk reduction programme at all manually operated level crossings.  This programme is achieved through level crossing upgrading and improvements or the closure of the crossing, where practicable.  The allocation of limited available expenditure on these level crossings is prioritised on a risk evaluated basis.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is actively looking at technological solutions for the improvement of safety at these manually operated level crossings as a means of optimising funding across the broad range of user operated level crossings on the network.</p></reply>

This is a problem.  While there has been progress, I am concerned when I hear the Minister of State say this matter is the responsibility of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  It is the responsibility of the Department and the Minister of State should tell Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann that the situation with regard to manually operated crossings is unacceptable.  Let me give some examples.  I am aware a bridge is to be built over the railway crossing at Reilly's Bridge in Cabra in the near future, but in the meantime we have traffic jams one mile long, at a cost to the State in terms of people and workers being delayed.  There is also an issue of health and safety.  I cannot pinpoint a major incident in recebt years, but we need to ensure such an incident never happens.  There is an automatic crossing in Athenry which runs to a schedule, but a problem arose there recently.  If an automatic crossing is scheduled and the train service is delayed or something else happens, this could lead to a serious problem.  I have mentioned Reilly's Bridge, but just up the road at Ashtown there is another manually operated crossing.  Approximately 2,000 apartments were built in the area, but we allowed a manually operated crossing at the site.  The failure to provide for a flyover or other means of crossing the line represented bad planning on the part of the local authorities.</p></speech>

When I took up my role in the Department, one thing that struck me straightaway was the volume of funding going towards railway safety measures.  A substantial amount, &euro;1.9 billion, has been invested since 1999.  There is probably just cause to say priority should have been given to particular crossings during the years.  I am aware of some of the crossings to which the Deputy referred.  The completion date for the Reilly's Bridge crossing is the end of 2014.  That said, in the past two years Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has been prioritising areas where crossings need attention on a risk basis.  It will continue to be active in that regard and ensure it prioritises those crossings where there are safety risks or greater efficiency can be achieved.  The Deputy is aware that improvements have been made under our work programme in improving speeds on various lines throughout the country.  Some of these improvements are due to a number of crossings being dealt with.</p></speech>

This is another problem in terms of health and safety.  This was promised at Athenry, but it has not yet been delivered.  In a situation where a train service is delayed or some other unforeseen event occurs, there should be a backup system to help resolve the issue.  I accept that there have been huge improvements and that there is an ongoing programme in palce.  However, we must take cognisance of all of these crossings and assess whether they can be dealt with.  It is more important to deal with some of them rather than others, as there are very heavy volumes of traffic on main routes.  The Minister of State needs to push this issue with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, particularly in cases in which it is clear there are serious problems.  Fortunately, there have been no incidents reported, but we must prevent any such incident happening.</p></speech>

The Deputy is aware that a serious volume of work has been done on heavily used lines.  Speeds and journey times have improved considerably in recent months.  The work will continue and we will ensure that where work is necessary from both an efficiency and a safety point of view, it will be prioritised.</p></speech>

The Department, supported by NewERA, has engaged extensively with CIE on its financial and business planning.  CIE's draft annual report and financial statements for 2012 were received on 28 February, in accordance with the timeframe laid down in the code of practice.</p><p>  In addition to the supplementary PSO funding of &euro;36 million allocated by the Government in 2012, further financing was required in 2012 in order to fund the voluntary severance schemes, particularly in Irish Rail, and ensure adequate funding into 2013.  Progress was made at the end of 2012 on the sale of non-core assets, in particular the sale of Spencer Dock properties.  The resolution of CIE's financial position will involve increased borrowing facilities for non-capital purposes.  Discussions are continuing to secure additional banking facilities to ensure adequate funding into 2013.  Any such funding will rely on the delivery and implementation of a convincing business plan.  CIE has undertaken a rigorous business planning process with the aim of returning to a break-even position and achieving a sustainable debt position.  Given the pressure on the public finances, there is no possibility of additional funding from the Exchequer in 2013.  The implementation of a credible business plan will, therefore, be essential to CIE&rsquo;s financial recovery in the period ahead.</p></reply>

He will be aware that the accounts of CIE have been late virtually every year for the last three or four years.  Can I have an assurance that they will not be late this year?  The Minister of State has said the accounts are now in the hands of the Government.  I hope they do not have to be referred back to the company as they were last year, when they finally emerged in November.  If a company like this is losing so much money, why is its chief executive being paid so much?  How can we justify paying between &euro;150,000 and &euro;200,000 to the chief executives of Dublin Bus, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and CIE at a time when the company is losing a fortune?  I know that the loss of money is a kind of movable feast at CIE in the context of the subvention it receives.  I would have thought that the aim of the Government should be for CIE to break even without a subvention.  Despite the reduction of &euro;36 million in the subsidy, there have been fare increases and very few cost reductions in the past year.  CIE has been given an easy way out.  I would like the Minister of State to assure the House that there will be no further fare increases.  I would like to hear an affirmation and a justification in this regard.  The managing director of AIB, David Duffy, this morning justified his salary of over &euro;540,000 in the context of the bank's losses.  Leaving the banks aside, why should the State pay &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000 a week to the managing director of a company that is being rescued by the banks on a weekly basis?</p></speech>

He raised a couple of specific issues.  The accounts were late this year because the board would not sign off on them until many of its questions had been answered from an auditing point of view.  I think that is rigorous.  As the Deputy is aware, there have been many changes at board level in CIE and its subsidiaries.  He also asked about the issue of chief executive salaries.  There is no chief executive of CIE.  On foot of a decision made by this Government, the executive chair is no longer in place.  Three chief executives are in place among CIE's subsidiaries.  Their salaries have reduced substantially.  Many changes have been made across CIE.  There have been many personnel changes at all levels within the organisation and its subsidiaries.  These are significant improvements, given that CIE was caught in a perfect storm when its subvention was reduced, its passenger numbers decreased and its fuel costs increased.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has implemented a significant voluntary severance programme, which will make a vital contribution to its cost recovery programme.  The group has generated cash from various activities, such as the sale of Spencer Dock.  It has developed a five-year plan to reduce costs and manage cashflows.  It is now engaged in an ongoing process with its unions to implement those plans.  The recommendations that have been made to improve the group's treasury and cash management functions have been implemented.  A great deal of work is taking place.  I assure the Deputy that the Department is working closely with CIE to ensure a robust business plan is in place for the future.</p></speech>

We have been hearing about the company in the same terms for ten years.  It has had robust business plan after robust business plan.  CIE has been the black hole in the semi-State hemisphere for a very long time.  We need something more dramatic than this, particularly given that the auditors expressed serious worries last year about whether CIE was a going concern.  I wonder what measures and what vision the Minister of State and his Government colleagues have in mind to ensure CIE continues as a going concern.  When passenger numbers continue to fall, as they undoubtedly will, the outlook is that we will continue to implement sticking plaster solutions - either withdrawing the subvention or not - as each crisis emerges.  In that context, what are the plans for the subvention this year and in the next five years?  Is there a plan to run down the subventions or to keep them at a higher level?</p></speech>

The subvention will decrease this year.  The planned subvention for this year is &euro;226 million.  That has to be the case, obviously, in light of the economic situation.  I would like to give the Deputy some welcome news.  Recent figures have shown that the number of people travelling across the various services is stabilising and in some cases is on an upward trajectory.  We are quite happy about that.  We project that a number of the commercial plans that have been put in place by the various subsidiaries could be quite successful.  While there is a long road ahead, I assure the Deputy that day-to-day active engagement with CIE is at a level it has not previously been at.  I am well aware of the Deputy's concerns about the historic operation of CIE.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is taking a significant active role with CIE on a day-to-day basis to ensure it will continue as a going concern into the future.</p></speech>

The programme for Government contains a commitment "to establish a Cabinet Sub-Committee on Infrastructure to explore the benefits to the public transport passenger of a more diverse bus service provision".  In line with this commitment, the National Transport Authority conducted a non-statutory public consultation in the summer of 2012.  A report on the process is available on the website of the authority.  I draw the Deputy's attention to the Competition Authority's submission, which highlighted the positive international experience of tendering.  The National Transport Authority briefed the Cabinet sub-committee on the process in October 2012.  Public consultation submissions will be considered and taken into account by the authority when it comes forward with proposals.  If the authority proposes to enter into a further direct award contract or contracts for bus services, it is obliged to carry out a statutory consultation under section 52 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.  Furthermore, the legislation states that it may not enter into direct award contracts unless "it is satisfied that the continued adequacy of the public bus passenger services to which the contracts relate can only be guaranteed in the general economic interest by entering into such direct award contracts".  Accordingly, the matter will require further examination by the National Transport Authority before any decisions are taken.  I have been advised by the authority that it is commencing a series of analytical tasks in respect of the public service obligation bus market.  This analytical work will be completed before August of this year, when the authority anticipates that statutory consultation on any new direct award contract will need to commence.</p></reply>

Does he agree that the international experience of market liberalisation is quite mixed?  He mentioned that the Competition Authority has highlighted the international experience.  On the basis of research I have done, that experience appears to be quite mixed.  The initial results in countries where liberalisation has happened to a large, medium or small degree show that states can obtain some savings in certain circumstances.  That needs to be borne in mind.  In some countries, privatisation has led to monopolisation, or a variation thereof, over a number of years.  This has led to an increase in the costs incurred by the state.  It might be appropriate for the Minister to refer to a report produced by the transport committee in 2003 or 2004, after members of the committee met representatives of London Bus, in the context of the decisions due to be taken.  Is it the case that the overheads of private operators are significantly lower than those of Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus?  Does the Minister agree that a wider discussion of the liberalisation and privatisation agenda is required?  As I see it, liberalisation is certainly not a panacea that would solve all our problems.  In fact, it might create greater problems.</p></speech>

The very good report produced by the Competition Authority gives an overview of where this has worked well, where it has not and the reasons for that success or lack thereof.  The report gives us a good idea of how this can be done in the right way.  The subvention paid to public transport is relatively low.  It is important to compare like with like.  In some countries, public transport operators receive public service obligation payments only.  We also pay capital grants to such operators, particularly in the case of the railways.  If one adds the capital grants to the public service obligation payments, one will find the level of subvention is not as low as it might seem.  It is also important to bear in mind that we do not have the same level of public transport as other countries.  We do not have high-speed rail or underground rail, for example.</p><p>If we did, subvention would obviously be higher.  Touching on what Deputy Ross said earlier, I do not believe it would ever be possible to have a public transport system that did not require some subvention.  It is a public service, after all.  Therefore, it is always going to require some subvention if one wants an extensive network covering all the cities and rural areas.</p></speech>

I must disagree, however, that Ireland ranked poorly in the World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2013.  Out of 140 countries, Ireland was placed in 19th position and scored well under pillars such as &quot;Policy Rules and Regulations&quot; - fourth place; &quot;Human Resources&quot; - 11th place; &quot;Tourism Infrastructure&quot; - 12th place; and &quot;Safety and Security - 12th place.</p><p>  Our ranking of 29th under the heading of &quot;Cultural Resources&quot; reflects the fact that we have only two world heritage cultural sites.

I welcome any increase in tourist numbers.  It is an established fact that cultural tourism is one of our main attractions when it comes to selling and marketing Ireland to international markets, particularly in the US and Germany.  According to the Government's Action Plan for Jobs, our rich culture, heritage and natural environment can assist in the development of the tourism product and allow us to gain a comparative advantage over other countries.  Tourism is central to this Government's economic recovery programme and key policy actions are outlined in the programme for Government and in the Action Plan for Jobs.  In spite of this, it is very clear that we have failed to develop our cultural and heritage capital to its full potential and to capitalise on our natural resources.</p><p>  In the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report 2013, Ireland is ranked 117th out of 140 countries when it comes to protection and utilisation of our natural resources.  We are ranked 29th when it comes to our utilisation and development of our cultural resources.  If these figures are broken down even further, we see we are ranked 88th in terms of world heritage cultural sites and 79th in terms of world heritage natural sites.</p><p>  Will the Minister impress upon his colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Deenihan, the importance of protecting and developing the Moore Street battlefield site?  This has huge potential in terms of its ability to attract international tourists to the country.  The site and historic quarter is unique and its as yet untapped potential could, if properly harnessed, give a major boost to the capital in terms of jobs and income.  As such, it should be utilised to its potential.</p></speech>

I visited the Moore Street site about a year ago and I certainly believe the O'Connell Street and Moore Street sites, taken together, have real potential for tourism and also for our own history and heritage.  I have discussed this matter with the Minister, Deputy Deenihan, and, ultimately, it will be his recommendation that the Cabinet will act on.</p><p>  In regard to cultural resources, as the Deputy points out, we are ranked 29th overall in that particular pillar.  This relates to many things, for example, the number of sports stadia per head, the number of world heritage cultural sites and the number of international fairs and exhibitions.  While we scored very well in terms of sports stadia, for example, we only scored quite well when it came to international exhibitions, being placed in the top 26.  With regard to the issue of natural resources and environmental stability, we came in 117th, which appears poor, although it is not an area we necessarily have much control over.  When it comes to the number of world heritage natural sites or the number of species, for example, or terrestrial bio-protection and marine protected areas, much of the ranking is just down to the fact we are a small country and an island.  There is nothing the Government can do to change the number of habitats and species we have in the State.</p></speech>

Significant investment has been made in the country's public transport network in the last decade.  As I am sure every Deputy agrees, we have modern bus, tram and train fleets.</p><p>  While we are not in a financial position at present to make further substantial investments to expand our public transport network, the Department, working with the National Transport Authority, will continue to invest in public transport infrastructure where it will give the greatest return.  For example, the Luas cross-city line will link the red and green lines, improving the attractiveness of the LUAS network as a whole.  We are also continuing to invest in bus lanes in cities around the country to get the best use of our buses and improve the passenger experience by reducing delays and improving reliably.  We will continue to invest in rail safety and maintenance programmes to ensure the optimal operation of the rail network.</p><p>  The Government recognises that efficient public transport services are essential for social and economic well-being and will continue to provide financial support to the operators of public transport services under the public service obligation.  The National Transport Authority has developed a range of technological solutions to make public transport more attractive and accessible to passengers, including an online national journey planner, the real-time passenger information system, which has been a great success, and the Leap card, which enables passengers to make cashless trips on a range of different transport modes.  In addition to investing in public transport infrastructure and delivery, the Department and the National Transport Authority actively promote the use of public transport, through targeted programmes such as the green schools travel flag, smarter travel workplaces and smarter travel areas.</p></reply>

There is no doubt the cuts to the public transport system, in particular the cut in the Government subsidy, year on year, has led to serious cuts in public transport, particularly in Dublin Bus, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann services, which have led to a lack of services for passengers in a number of areas.  I know this from what I see in my own area, where routes have been cut.  I question the logic behind cutting these routes when we should be trying to adapt and improve routes, not eliminate them completely, which is what has happened.</p><p>  There are other areas we need to look at in terms of improving public transport.  I again come back to the whole issue of some of the capital projects that have been dropped, such as Metro North, which would deliver a public transport system to the airport.  While there were costings in the past, costs have come down considerably.  I would like to think we could achieve a link-up between north and south Dublin and our national airport.  This is an area that has been neglected.</p></speech>

The reality, from a public finance point of view, is that we were not able to proceed with a number of good projects, as the Deputy is aware.</p><p>We have prioritised linking up the Luas lines, a measure the Deputy supports.  It is a good project that is progressing.  It was unfortunate but there have been other significant investments.  For example, there was a requirement to change many bus fleets and that has been done.  There was a requirement to modernise many areas, particularly technology.  We finally launched integrated ticketing, which is being rolled out in phases.  Other developments include real-time passenger information and Wi-Fi on trains and buses so much progress has been made to make the public transport user's experience better.  Those were crucial developments that needed to be done and over time we will see the success of those changes.  The Deputy raised the issue of Network Direct in Dublin.  Much of the analysis shows that many people are quite happy with some of the changes, particularly cross-city services and getting into town more quickly.</p></speech>

Integrated ticketing has been a massive improvement, as have the bus signs which have been very successful in making times available to people as they are standing at bus stops.  However, if we continue to cut the subsidy to these networks, we will end up with more cuts and less people on public transport.  I know the Minister of State said in the past that he did not see this but I certainly see an increase in the number of cars being used in certain areas across the city because the public system has been removed from some streets.  It is not all about whether it is economical to go from A to B.  There are areas with a significant amount of senior citizens and people with disabilities and these people need to be served and helped.  This needs to be taken into account.  That is why the subsidy was there.</p></speech>

A public transport network was closed down in Longford-Westmeath, namely, the rail link between Athlone and Mullingar.  This serves two gateway towns and is a very important piece of infrastructure.  The road linking those two towns is one of the worst in Europe.  It takes well over an hour and a half to commute by road.  I ask the Minister and Minister of State to consider opening the rail link between Mullingar and Athlone.  Doing so would make sound economic sense.</p></speech>

In that regard, the dublinbikes scheme has been very successful.  However, there are still areas of the city not covered by the scheme, in particular the docklands area.  That part of the city, which is a new part and has a considerable number of jobs and young people working there, is not well connected to the centre of Dublin.  The same is true of areas south and north of the canals.  Could the Minister of State provide a quick update on the negotiations that are happening regarding dublinbikes?</p></speech>

I understand the argument the Deputy is making but the constraints are there.  Dublinbikes has been incredibly successful and there are plans to roll it out in other areas.  The NTA is always looking at how this can be expanded because it has been so successful, with many commentators arguing that it is the most successful bicycle scheme in the world.  I will be engaging with the NTA in respect of the area referenced by the Deputy and I will contact him directly about that.  There are also plans to look at rolling it out across other parts of the country and those discussions are ongoing.  I am quite hopeful about that into the future.</p></speech>

Accordingly, I have referred the Deputy's question to F&aacute;ilte Ireland for further information and direct reply.  As the Deputy may be aware, the integrated marine plan for Ireland published by the Government in July 2012 contains an action that the appropriate Departments and agencies will utilise existing built and natural assets, for example, lighthouses and offshore islands, to develop tourism products and services.  Work in this area is ongoing and will be particularly supported by the development of the wild Atlantic way initiative which will highlight all aspects of the maritime experience, heritage and culture.</p><p>  I am advised that the Commissioners of Irish Lights are currently in discussion with the Special EU Programmes Body about a cross-Border project to develop the tourism potential of lighthouses along the northern coast.

I fully support the central aim of the national substance misuse strategy in reducing the level of alcohol consumption and binge drinking.  I am very supportive of a number of the measures proposed, including minimum pricing, health warning labels and statutory advertising codes.  However, I am concerned that placing constraints on sporting organisations by eliminating the alcohol industry as a source of sponsorship will have negative impacts on the development and availability of sport and, consequently, on our efforts to maintain and increase sporting participation at local level.</p><p>  There are huge and obvious economic, social and health benefits accruing from sport.  It is very important that funding is available to sports organisations to ensure that sport is maintained at grassroots level so that as many people as possible can participate.  In view of the current economic constraints, Government investment in sport has had to be reduced in recent years.  The imposition of a ban on sponsorship would further undermine the efforts of sporting organisations to be self-sufficient.</p><p>  It is estimated that sport sponsorship by the alcohol industry amounts to around &euro;30 million per year.  To place this in context, the Irish Sports Council's budget is just over &euro;40 million.  Difficulties currently being experienced by some of our high profile teams and events in securing sponsorship suggest that the funding lost might not readily be replaced by alternative sources.  Sports organisations may well be placed in a position where they have to curtail their development programmes, which are crucial to promoting participation at all levels.</p><p>  I believe that any measures introduced should be evidence-based, effective and reasonable.  The evidence from the Government's report, State of the Nation's Children, is that the proportion of young people who do not commence drinking before the age of 18 is growing very substantially in Ireland.  This has occurred in an era of greatly increased exposure to sports sponsorship by drinks companies, particularly through high profile tournaments with saturation TV coverage.  On the other hand, in France, which has a ban on such sponsorship, the evidence is that drinking by young people is increasing.  It is worth mentioning that Great Britain took the failure of the French approach into account in deciding not to ban alcohol sponsorship of sport.  Similarly, whatever decision we take should be evidence-based.</p></reply>

Beer consumption in Italy has increased in a country that has nothing like the advertising seen in this country.  It does not change the fact that we have a far more serious problem.  I agree that damaging sport would be problematic because sport is far more of a social benefit than people realise.  The Minister of State talks about evidence.  If the alcohol industry thought that spending &euro;30 million would not get young people to consume more alcohol, it would not spend it.</p><p>These guys make business decisions, not health decisions.  Given that alcohol and tobacco abuse and obesity are costing the State in the region of &euro;5.5 billion, will the Minister of State agree that it would make sense for the Government to replace that &euro;30 million in sports sponsorship?  I do not mean that sports organisations should do without the money, but where is the joined-up thinking?  It costs the Government &euro;5.5 billion to deal with the abuse of alcohol and tobacco.  It is, therefore, a no-brainer that it should spend more on sport.  Drink companies would not be spending this money on advertising if it was not profitable for them to do so.</p></speech>

We all know that the drinking culture presents a serious issue, as does binge drinking.  The banning of advertising is one option.  However, the Government does not have the means to provide that funding for sport.  When the national lottery was set up, the money was to be used for the funding of sport and the arts, but that is not the case.  The revenue goes into the Exchequer and my Department has to make a case for its budget each year.  The Deputy is aware that the economic position is difficult.  Our contribution to the Irish Sports Council is more than &euro;40 million.  The allocation has been reduced in the past two years because we simply do not have the resources.  For example, we could not find a sponsor for the Irish Open golf championship and F&aacute;ilte Ireland had to step into the breach.  Funding has been taken away from tourism development.  I would love it if there was no drinks company sponsorship of sport, but we have to live in the real world.  There is a serious economic crisis.  All codes, including rugby, soccer and the GAA, have had great difficulty in securing sponsorship.  One organisation could not secure sponsorship to cover the cost of jerseys.  Another secured sponsorship but at a much reduced level in these difficult times.  It would be preferable if it was not necessary to depend on sponsorship, but if the &euro;30 million is taken away from sport and festivals, we will have a problem.</p></speech>

It provides &euro;40 million for sport, but it provides &euro;5.5 billion in order to deal with the abuse which participation in sport would challenge.  I thought the Government was planning to exercise joined-up thinking.  Where is that thinking if &euro;5.5 billion can be spent on dealing with the abuse of alcohol and tobacco?  It only needs to reduce that amount by 20% to save more than &euro;1 billion.  A sum of &euro;40 million is peanuts by comparison.</p></speech>

They have serious concerns about a restriction on advertising and sponsorship.  They outlined issues such as the effect on local clubs.  In my area it is often the case that a local club will be sponsored by the local pub and fund-raising events for the club are held in the pub.  I am caught between whether I agree with a ban on advertising alcohol at matches.  Where would we stop?  Should McDonald's not be permitted to advertise because it encourages obesity?  The same argument applies in the case of fizzy soft drinks.  This debate needs a lot more thought.</p></speech>

I would love to see the Department of Finance giving us more funding for sport.  Governments think in terms of one to five years rather than one to 15 years.  The more money that is invested in sport, the healthier society will be.  There will be a lower incidence of diabetes and obesity and as the years progress, less money will be needed to deal with health issues.  There will be a decreased need for hospitals and nursing staff, if members of society are fitter.  Since I became Minister of State with responsibility for sport, the percentage of the population which does not participate in sport has decreased from 16% to 13%.  We need to keep working on that number.</p><p>  The Deputy is correct that it would be difficult to police a ban on the advertising of alcohol at sports events, considering that sports programmes are broadcast from all over the world.  For example, when it was banned in France, the consumption of alcohol increased.  This proves that the ban did not have the hoped-for influence.  As a result of the French experience, Britain decided not to impose a ban.  I would much prefer if drink companies were not involved, but the Government does not have the funds.  Deputy Dessie Ellis is correct and speaks my language.  The bigger professional sports bodies would survive and the grassroots bodies would be the ones to suffer.  We do not want that to happen; we want the grassroots bodies to be funded.  People do not start at the top of a sport, they start at the bottom.  More than ever, there is a need for grassroots sports organisations.  Sport has lifts the soul, the mind and the spirit of the people in the past four or five years, despite the economic downturn.  We must, therefore, do our best to find the funding for sport.</p></speech>

I agree that young people must be educated about what they eat and drink in order to have a fitter and healthier society.  We need to get people walking and to be health conscious.  The Departments co-operate in discussions and at committees on actions needed to educate young people and everyone else to ensure their health and well-being.</p></speech>

Since March 2011 the Government has implemented a range of measures to support hotels and the wider tourism industry.  VAT has been reduced to 9% on accommodation, restaurant and other services and this lower rate continues in 2013.  The visa waiver scheme is encouraging visitors from emerging markets to add Ireland to their trip when they are visiting the United Kingdom.  The halving of employers&rsquo; PRSI for those on modest wages has reduced the cost of employing people.</p><p>  More recently, the Government has confirmed that the extended employment and investment incentive scheme, EIIS, and the new Real Estate Investment Trust, REIT, initiatives will apply to tourism accommodation.</p><p>Subject to the requirements of the legislation, the EIIS should encourage investment in the renovation of existing accommodation by allowing investors in such projects to avail of tax relief, whereas REITS will facilitate investment vehicles in tourism accommodation.  Tourism and coach operators in particular will also benefit from the fuel rebate, while small tourism businesses will benefit from the higher VAT threshold of &euro;1.25 million.</p><p> During 2013, the Government will provide almost &euro;140 million to tourism agencies to support the industry, to market tourism at home and abroad and to fund product development.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is also providing a range of business and training supports to tourism enterprises, including assistance to tourism businesses to engage constructively with their banks.  The measures put in place to support tourism helped to contribute to growth of almost 8% in visitor numbers in 2011.  While visitor numbers increased only marginally in 2012, figures released last week by the CSO showed that spending by visitors to Ireland increased by 4.5% last year to &euro;3.68 billion.  In addition, F&aacute;ilte Ireland reports that the number of people employed in the tourism and hospitality sectors in Ireland is now 185,000, which represents an increase of 5,000 on the previous estimate.  That is good news.</p><p> As Deputies are aware, 2013 is the year of The Gathering which initiative will provide further support for the industry this year as well as a legacy effect for future years.</p></reply>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-27a.409" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032700028#AA00150"><p>With all the questions that have been grouped together, it appears no one is here to facilitate a response, with the exception of my colleagues in Sinn F&eacute;in, who are always here.  I will be happy to make a couple of points.</p><p>  The Minister of State will be aware that representations have been made by the Irish Hotels Federation to complain about a lack of appropriate information to help it to develop niche markets and to engage in more efficient planning and marketing.  The federation believes the Central Statistics Office should be encouraged to conduct frequent and more detailed surveys of visitors and their requirements.  Surely, we must engage in that activity.  In particular, good and frequent intelligence is required about where foreign visitors go, their requirements and how their holidays could be improved.  The president of the Irish Hotels Federation, Mr. Michael Vaughan, says a lack of detailed information has reduced the effectiveness of his organisation's international marketing campaigns.  He said there must be a greater emphasis on attracting business conferences and the promotion of the regions.  Unfortunately, the back-up data required are not available.  I ask the Minister of State to impress on the Taoiseach, under the aegis of whose Department the agency operates, the necessity for the CSO to put in place additional modules in its ongoing investigative work to address the deficit in information which would be of use to the Irish Hotels Federation to do what it does best.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-27a.410" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1074" speakername="Michael Ring" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032700028#AA00200"><p>My officials have met the CSO because, as Deputy Dooley is correct to say, we need up-to-date information.  If there is a problem in the market, we must know on time, whether that is at the beginning, middle or end of a year.  If we must carry out a marketing campaign in a particular quarter in which there is a problem, we need the information.  My officials have met representatives of the CSO who have told us their agency will try to provide us with more accurate figures more quickly.  I hope that will happen.</p><p>  I met a number of hoteliers last week from all over the west.  I had meetings with the representatives of Irish hoteliers in Dublin.  They were complimentary and expressed their delight that we held the marketing budget this year.  They were also delighted that we were able to maintain this year the lower VAT rate of 9% down from 13.5%.  The VAT reduction has provided hotels and restaurants with a great return.  Hoteliers are pleased that The Gathering initiative is in place and will help to fill beds this year.  Hoteliers are approaching and talking to us.  Of course, there are problems, but we are trying to work through those with them.  Overall, sentiment is good this year and we are confident that, with The Gathering and last year's spending increase, we will have a good tourist season.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-27a.411" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1022" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032700028#AA00300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  Certainly, some of the initiatives which have been introduced, including the change to VAT, have done wonders.  I have received good reports.  Are we satisfied that in all cases the VAT reduction has been passed on by the industry?  Are there instances in which people have abused the reduction by failing to pass on the cut?  I do not know.  I have not heard of anyone being brought to task.</p><p>  I want to ask the Minister of State about the Moore Street site, which is very important leading up to 2016.  If we were to work on the initiative to preserve buildings and to get the battlefield site up and running, it would be a major boost to tourism.  We should also not forget that 2014 is the anniversary of the Battle of Clontarf, which was one of the few victories we won on an all-island basis and is one of the few we can celebrate.  It is a big anniversary for us.</p></speech>

This year, we have The Gathering, which I hope the Deputy will encourage.  The Gathering is not being led by the Government or F&aacute;ilte Ireland, it is community led.  The people of the country have come in behind the initiative.  Between 7,000 and 8,000 people turned up at public meetings on the initiative which took place nationally last year.  Almost 3,500 events are planned for 2013.  Those events will create a legacy for next year and the year after.</p><p>  Deputy Ellis asked about VAT.  We reduced the rate from 13.5% to 9% and there was a positive reaction.  Customers will always give their reaction.  They were happy to see that prices, particularly in Dublin, fell.  Of course, there always will be people who do not pass on the benefit but hotelier and restaurant representative bodies encouraged their members to do so.  The Deputy will have seen from my earlier reply that 180,000 were employed in the industry last year and that this number has increased now to 185,000.  That is 5,000 jobs we did not have last year.  It must be welcomed.  Hotel and restaurant bodies encouraged their members and the public, as always, reacted.  The public saw the menus and saw the reduction in prices.  It was good.  The cut was passed on.  Businesses know this is only a temporary relief and we told them clearly that if it was not passed on, we would quickly put the rate back up.  The reduction is in place until the end of 2013 and it has worked very well.</p></speech>

It is a community-based initiative across the length and breadth of the country.  I have received a number of complaints about the Irish Hotels Federation.  We must put down a marker that people must not be fleeced by hotels on peak occasions, including St. Patrick's weekend.  It is a particular problem in Dublin when people come to major events.  This has been brought to my attention and I ask that the Minister of State maintain contacts with the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland to ensure prices are maintained and that inflated prices are not charged at certain times of the year during major events.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-27a.416" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1074" speakername="Michael Ring" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032700028#AA00800"><p>Deputy McLoughlin makes a good point.  Everybody has his or her part to play in the recovery of the tourism industry.  I send the message loudly and clearly to hoteliers, restaurateurs and anyone else involved in the tourism business that this is the year we bring people to Ireland, in particular for The Gathering.  They will be our ambassadors when they go home.  If they get ripped off here, we will not be able to do anything about what they say.  There has never been better value in Ireland.</p><p>The hoteliers are playing their part and the restaurants are playing their part, and I hope they will continue to do so.  There are sometimes complaints about hotels, but most hotels have 95% of their hotel rooms filled when an event is coming up.  They may have a small capacity remaining and when they come to the end of their capacity they may increase prices.  If there is a major event in Rome, Spain or any place, one will pay if one comes in looking for a bed at the last minute.  To be fair to the restaurants and hotels, they are giving good value for money and doing a good job.  There is plenty of competition and spare capacity, which is why everyone must compete.</p></speech>

There has been increased activity but that was in line with an upturn that was already taking place in the tourism sector.  It is worth remembering that it was not a gift of the Government to the tourism sector; it was a gift of the private pension funds of the State that has provided the funding.  It was done on a three-year basis, so it was not willy-nilly that the Government managed to provide funding again this year.  Some &euro;400 million was taken from private pension funds.  Funding was extracted to abolish the travel tax, or a portion of it, but it did not materialise.  I supported the Minister of State on this point because the airlines did not buy into the kind of increased activity that was suggested.  The saving to the State was not returned to the private pension funds, but that is another day's work.  I am guarded about the impact of the reduction.  It was a stimulus, but on a meal costing &euro;50, the saving buys a cup of tea at the end.  I am not sure that is an incentive for increased spending.  It created a good story and increased talk about reduced costs, but the jury is out on its effectiveness.</p></speech>

The American football match was a huge event for the country and tourism got a major bounce out of it.  We should get further events like that, and work needs to be put in now to achieve this.  I refer in particular to the bid to host the Rugby World Cup in 2023.  It could be incredibly significant for tourism, the economy and brand Ireland, which we are promoting so well this year.</p></speech>

It is all about perception.  If people think they are not getting value for money, it creates a problem.  People saw the effect of the VAT reduction from 13% to 9% when it was passed on.  In addition, the trade started to introduce deals and realised it had to do something with its cost base and provide value for money.  It was a good move.  We had to negotiate with the troika.  Hoteliers are hoping it will continue, and we must examine that point.</p><p>  Deputy Eoghan Murphy is correct in respect of sporting events.  The Navy-Notre Dame game was probably the most successful event that took place in this country.  When those people went back to America, they sold a positive message about the country.  It did not just happen in Dublin; when these people arrived they spread to every corner of the country.  They came back to Dublin for the event and the message sent home was that there was value for money in Ireland.  The figures for December, January and February show that the number of trips to Ireland increased by 2.6%.  From mainland Europe they increased by 5.7%, although tourism from Britain is weak again.  Trips from North America have increased by almost 10%, while other long-haul markets are up by 15.3%.  People realise they are getting value for money.</p><p>  Tomorrow the Minister and I are meeting the IRFU, which will make a proposal and talk to us about hosting the World Cup.  I compliment the GAA on its decision last weekend to open up its facilities.  It was a credit to the organisation and I was delighted to see it making its wonderful facilities available.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-27a.430" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1020" speakername="Tommy Broughan" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032700029#BB01300"><p>I thank the Minister of State for attending.  Over the past two decades in the D&aacute;il, I have raised the Stardust tragedy and its aftermath probably on hundreds of occasions, given the ongoing and heroic struggle for justice of the Stardust Victims and Relatives Committee, outstandingly led over the years by Ms Christine Keegan, Ms Antoinette Keegan, Ms Gertrude Barrett, Ms Brid McDermott and Mr. Jimmy Dunne, with the strong support of many others, including Ms Geraldine Foy and Mr. Robin Knox.</p><p><br />  I greatly welcomed the valuable re-examination undertaken by Mr. Paul Coffey SC in 2009 and its further clarification of the utterly flawed conclusions of the earlier Keane tribunal report of 1982.  However, a number of disturbing issues have recently been raised with me about the publication of the Coffey report and the apparent significant differences between the report as carried out and submitted to the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party Government by the independent legal expert, Mr. Coffey, and the document published a month later by the Government. </p><p><br />  I have before me excerpts from a copy of a document obtained through an FOI request by the researcher Ms. Geraldine Foy, namely, the Stardust report that was issued to the previous Government by Mr. Paul Coffey SC on 10 December 2008.  Paragraph 5.12 states: <blockquote>The real difficulty appears to lie in the fact that despite having made a finding based on evidence that the cause of the fire is unknown, the Tribunal has placed on the public record a &#8220;finding of fact&#8221; of criminal wrongdoing which is <i>prima facie</i> speculative and fraught with evidential and logical difficulties.  Moreover, the finding is so phrased as to give the impression to a reasonable man or woman in the street that it is a finding established by evidence and not a mere hypothetical explanation for the fire.</blockquote>Paragraph 5.13 then states:<blockquote>I accept that this is profoundly unsatisfactory to the survivors and the bereaved.  I also accept the Committee&#8217;s submission that such was the scale of the disaster that it has become a matter of communal if not national history to an extent that engages a public interest in ensuring that the public record of what happened is factually accurate and established by evidence.  I further accept that a new inquiry is necessary if it is the only way of placing on the public record a finding that is based on evidence.</blockquote>  However, paragraph 5.13 of the Coffey report that was eventually published on 7 January 2009 states:<blockquote>This is profoundly unsatisfactory to the survivors and the bereaved who through their Committee argue that such was the scale of the disaster that it has become a matter of communal if not national history ... It seems to me that the terms of resolutions under which the Tribunal was established by the Oireachtas require nothing less [than looking at new evidence].</blockquote>The later and published version of the Coffey report omits the key statement that Mr. Coffey &#8220;further accept[s] that a new inquiry is necessary if it is the only way of placing on the public record a finding that is based on evidence.&#8221;</p><p>Will the Minister explain this material difference between the December 2008 Coffey report and the January 2009 Coffey report, which was brought before this House and which I welcomed on behalf of the 48 victims and their families?  Why was the key sentence omitted from the final version of a report by an independent eminent legal person when published by the Government?  It is further argued by members of the Stardust relatives and victims committee that there were 70 significant report alterations between the 10 December 2008 report issued to the Government by Mr. Paul Coffey SC and the final report of 7 January  2009.  Is this the case?  If it is, it is an extraordinary situation.</p><p> Is the Minister aware that a 2008 Garda letter, referred to in tab 31, appendix 9 of the Paul Coffey report, was neither published nor seen at any time by the families, their researchers or their representatives before 2010?  This was a Garda letter referring to a basement at the Stardust nightclub, which did not exist.  Above all, is the Minister aware that the committee and its supporters have consistently sought proof for this non-existent Stardust basement referred to in the Keane report but without success?  Is it not clear that the non-existence of this basement was confirmed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in its 2004 review of the Foy report?</p><p> In 2009, after 28 years of campaigning by the victims and relatives committee, the report by Mr. Paul Coffey vindicated their long struggle to achieve some level of justice for their loved ones.  They rightly believed the original flawed Keane report added horrific insult to injury.  There is still a sense that there is not closure in this matter for many of the relatives of the victims of the Stardust fire and these material alterations, which they have discovered through a freedom of information request, make a strong case for a new Michael McDowell-type commission of investigation to finally establish what happened and to vindicate the names and families of the 48 tragic young victims. </p></speech>

I recognise that Deputy Broughan, who has been following this issue for as long as I can recall, is far more versed in it than I am.  I promise to convey his remarks to the Minister.  On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I would like to thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  The Minister regrets that he is unable to be present today due to other business.</p><p>  The Minister would like to again emphasise that irrespective of any differences of opinions, no one disputes the magnitude of the tragedy or the impact it had on the families concerned and on the wider community.  Deputy Broughan made the point that closure is very difficult in this case.  </p><p>  In the limited time today, rather than reiterating the full history of the examination of the issues surrounding the Stardust fire, the Minister would simply note that Mr. Paul Coffey SC was appointed in 2008 by the then Government, with the agreement of the victims' committee, to review the case made by the committee for a new inquiry into the fire.  Mr. Coffey publicly invited submissions from all interested parties and the committee gave extensive oral evidence and made written submissions as to their case for a new inquiry. </p><p>  His report was published in January 2009 and he concluded that the original tribunal finding of arson was a hypothetical one only and that no one present on the night can be held responsible.  He further concluded that in the absence of any identified evidence as to the cause of the fire, the most another inquiry would achieve would be another set of hypothetical findings, which would not be in the public interest.  </p><p>  The then Government accepted Mr. Coffey's findings and introduced motions in the Oireachtas in 2009 endorsing his conclusions and expressing sympathy with the families.  These motions were passed by both Houses.  By endorsing Mr. Coffey's conclusion that the finding of arson was hypothetical only and that no one present could be held responsible, the motions also addressed a long-standing stigma of suggested criminality which some of the victims and bereaved felt hung over all who had been in attendance on the night.</p><p>  While Mr. Coffey's findings were welcomed, there continued to be dissatisfaction and, in time, proceedings were taken by a number of the families to the European Court of Human Rights.  Last year the court rejected that application but only on time grounds.  Since then, representatives for a number of the families have written to the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of the Taoiseach making various claims and putting the Departments on notice of possible legal proceedings.  Following consultation with the Attorney General's office, the Minister's Department has recently responded to the effect that it did not accept the conclusions arrived at in the correspondence and that legal proceedings along the lines indicated would be defended.</p><p>  Notwithstanding that, to be of assistance to the Deputy, the Minister would like to make some general comments.  The reference to withdrawn evidence is understood to relate to a reference to a basement on one of the maps used by the original tribunal.  The fact is that Mr. Coffey would have been aware of this matter and it was a matter for him to assess it.  </p><p>  Turning to the question of Mr. Coffey's report, the position is that Mr. Coffey's final report was received by the Government on 7 January 2009.  This is the report which was associated with the Government's decision to move motions in support of his recommendations and which was then put in the public domain.  An earlier draft of the report had been submitted in early December, on the basis that Mr. Coffey had asked to be permitted to make amendments for the purposes of correction, accuracy and clarification prior to its publication.</p><p>  For the avoidance of any doubt, I should make it clear that no attempt was made by the Minister's Department to influence Mr. Coffey's drafting or to suggest any amendments.  Irrespective of any analysis of the earlier draft however, it is the report of 7 January which represents Mr. Coffey's final and entirely independent advice to the Government on this matter and it stands on its own in this regard.  </p><p>  While it is the case that there is understandable concern that it has not been possible to establish the cause of this dreadful fire with certainty, no grounds have been put forward which would enable the House to resile from Mr. Coffey's findings - effectively, that another inquiry would not be in a position to take this matter further.</p></speech>

I appreciate the Minister of State's good intentions to bring this matter to the Minister, Deputy Shatter, and to ask him if he would review all the departmental files in regard to the Coffey report and the concerns I have expressed.  Will he look again at the possibility of a short, sharp commission of investigation under the 2004 legislation to attempt to bring closure to this matter?</p><p><br />  The Minister of State referred to hypothetical findings and so on.  She investigated the issue of the victims of the Magdalen laundries in great depth and did some outstanding work in that regard.  There is much documentary evidence available, including the Foy report, complied by Geraldine Foy in 2004, a famous book by two young journalists from the northside, Tony McCullough and Neil Fetherstonhaugh, entitled, <i>They Never Came Home</i>, evidence from local residents and so on, which is totally at variance with the conclusion of Keane and Coffey that the actual cause cannot be found.  Will the Minister look at that again?  </p><p><br />  Approximately seven parishes in the wider Coolock area were devastated and continue to have profoundly sad memories of that time.   There was a sense in this House and in the Seanad when the Coffey report came out that we were close to getting closure but these recent revelations, through a freedom of information request and from other sources, have disturbed that and people still want some sort of closure, which we finally got with the Magdalen report a few weeks ago and with the Murphy and Ryan reports into other great tragedies in Irish history.  That is the type of closure for which we are looking and perhaps a commission of investigation is the only way to go.  The Minister of State might convey that to the Minister, Deputy Shatter.</p></speech>

No one could possibly imagine how people must feel in this regard, no matter the length of time that has passed.  Closure is often very difficult.</p><p>The Deputy is quite correct that where an event has generated panic, it can be difficult to ascertain how it started and finished and the cause.  One cannot say for certain what exactly happened and where responsibility lay.  While we may all have drawn our own conclusions, it is very difficult to be absolutely certain.  I will most definitely convey the Deputy's remarks to the Minister in the same manner in which he made his case.</p></speech>

I have raised in the House previously the issue of community alert and neighbourhood watch schemes in rural areas, particularly the rural part of east Galway, which I represent.  I would like to draw the attention of the Minister of State to an aggravated burglary which took place last Friday night at the home of the parish priest in Caherlistrane, County Galway, the Very Reverend Pat O'Brien.  As Fr. O'Brien pointed out, it was the second raid on his house.  During the first raid, a few weeks ago, a small sum was taken from a Tr&oacute;caire box.  The second raid was more serious.  Four men wearing balaclavas and gloves broke into the parochial house between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. and tied up the priest.  One of the men was carrying a crowbar.  Fr. O'Brien, who is in his 60s, was the only occupant of the house at the time.  The gang ransacked the house for over an hour before making off with a sum of cash.  One of the gang's persistent demands was for gold.  After the gang fled, Fr. O'Brien managed to free himself and raised the alarm at a neighbour's house.  He was not seriously injured but is understood to be very traumatised by the incident.  The garda&iacute; in Tuam have reported that no arrests have been made.</p><p>  Swift action is needed to address the rise in rural crime across the county of Galway.  At the joint policing committee meetings that I have attended, public representatives from all parties and none have talked about the fact that ten Garda stations were closed in the county.  They have stated that recruitment is required and that extra garda&iacute; are required to address the growing problem.  We also need the necessary vehicles, which I understand can be provided because there is some funding available.  I hope the Minister will lift the ban on Garda recruitment.  The public deserves a decent service.</p><p>  At present, there are those who are making a career out of criminal activity, as is evident from the raid on the house of Fr. Pat O'Brien.  This House has discussed the cash-for-gold industry, which appears to be a contributor to the increase in rural crime.  One of the burglars who raided the house of Fr. Pat O'Brien was obsessed with gold.  There have been numerous media articles on the theft of scrap metal.  There are anecdotal reports on the theft of scrap metal, precious metals and jewellery to obtain cash.  This matter is of particular public concern because of the rising level of theft fuelled by rising metal prices.  Precious metal prices have increased by 50% since 2009.  The reasons for the current focus on this form of theft are the economic downturn and the increase in metal prices worldwide.  The relative ease of securing cash in the second-hand trade is also a factor.  Obviously, there are no official statistics on the number of scrap metal sales or thefts.  The second-hand trade, with the exception of pawnbroking, is not regulated by legislation.  The pawnbroking industry is not the same as the cash-for-gold industry.  Cash-for-gold businesses are currently not registered or legislated for in any specific way.  Consequently, the general criminal law on stolen goods is used when there is crime in this area.  There has been a Private Members' proposal on this.  I hope that today or very shortly we will get some more information on what is happening in respect of the cash-for-gold issue.</p><p>  Fr. O'Brien is a very forgiving man.  It is reported in the newspaper that he said to one of the criminals that he would say mass for the raiders.  It is indicative of his humility that he was able to identify with one of the raiders, who was good to him.  He was terrified of another individual who raided his house.  I have known Fr. Pat O'Brien for years and went to secondary school with him.  It is typical of him to be forgiving and to give such an example in the approach to Easter week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-27a.438" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032700031#DD00400"><p>I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, who is unfortunately away on business and cannot attend.  The Minister is very conscious of the deep distress that burglary and similar crimes can cause to householders in both urban and rural areas, in addition to the broader impact it can have in terms of fear of crime in our communities.  He also shares the justifiable outrage of all decent people at those who commit aggravated burglaries in the homes of the elderly and more vulnerable.  The Minister is also very conscious of the need to support strong partnerships between communities and local garda&iacute;.</p><p>  With regard to the policing response to burglaries, the Minister is fully confident that the Garda is doing everything in its power to bring the perpetrators of such crimes to justice.  In this regard, he is in close touch with the Garda Commissioner and he is assured that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is devoting all the resources necessary to confront those who seek to profit from burglary.</p><p>  The Minister welcomes the progress being made as part of Operation Fiacla, which is focused on identifying and targeting gangs involved in burglaries throughout the country.  Operation Fiacla is intelligence-driven and, as part of that operation, specific burglary initiatives have been implemented in each Garda region to target suspected offenders.  The Garda authorities have indicated that, as of the end of February 2013, 4,226 persons have been arrested and 2,327 persons have been charged under the operation, reflecting the extent of the operation and the impact it is having.  The Minister is also a strong supporter of the work of the community alert programme.  His Department, along with the HSE, has for many years provided funding for this valuable national programme, which was set up initially in 1985 by Muintir na T&iacute;re in association with the Garda authorities.  This programme has since developed into a national movement comprising more than 1,300 local groups which work with the Garda to promote crime prevention and improve the security of older and vulnerable persons in the community.  Community alert harnesses, in a modern context, the qualities of neighbourliness and mutual support which have long been characteristic of community life in Ireland.</p><p>  Earlier this year, the Minster was pleased to participate with the Garda Commissioner in the launch of new Garda community crime prevention guidelines, which contain advice for those wishing to set up community alert, neighbourhood watch or similar groups and outline the support that their local community garda&iacute; will provide.  These new guidelines take account of societal changes which have occurred since the initial schemes were established and provide a step-by-step guide to the establishment of future schemes.  They also enhance both individual and community participation in crime prevention.</p><p>  The Garda national model of community policing aims to build upon and enhance good community policing practice.  It recognises the need for dedicated community police officers, of whom there are approximately 1,000 deployed in communities countrywide.  It is also worth emphasising, as the national model does, that all garda&iacute; have a role to play in community policing, and this is very much a part of the general ethos of the force.  To further underline the commitment of the Garda authorities to community alert, the Commissioner has signed a renewed memorandum of understanding with Muintir na T&iacute;re, which provides an updated framework for the operation of the programme.  The Minister will continue to support the Garda in its ongoing operations to clamp down on those who seek to perpetrate cowardly attacks on innocent householders.  He also reaffirms his support for the operation of the community alert programme and for effective partnerships generally between communities and local garda&iacute; in tackling all forms of crime.</p><p>I again thank the Deputy for raising this important matter which impacts not only on the individuals or households burgled but also on entire communities.</p></speech>

For some years it was difficult to establish a community alert scheme in a town because people were not directly affected by this type of crime.  However, these days meetings in rural areas to discuss the establishment of community alert and neighbourhood watch schemes are well attended.  A useful tool in community alert schemes is texting by mobile phone which has proved very effective.  I have been in people's homes at the time they have received text messages about unusual events occurring in the area and I know this provide them with great assurance.  They often also receive follow-up texts providing an explanation for what has happened.  Resources are badly needed in this regard and it is welcome that such a measure will be supported by the Minister.  Texting arrangements are crucially important in the reporting of unusual activity.</p><p>  Perhaps the Minister of State might respond to my query about recruitment and the provision of Garda vehicles which are important in dealing with crime and vandalism, as occurred in the case of Fr. O'Brien.  As regards attacks on people's homes, as has happened on many occasions in the case of people living alone, particularly the elderly, the focus of the Minister and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be on ensuring those committing these crimes are dealt with.</p></speech>

O'Brien who, as correctly pointed out by the Deputy, is a most forgiving man.  While I am not certain that forgiveness will do in this instance, it would be nice if we could all adopt that attitude.</p><p>  On recruitment, like all other Departments, the Department of Justice and Equality, owing to the gap between what we take in in taxation and what we spend and, as a result of our being in a bail-out programme, our not being in full control of resources, is required to make substantial savings year on year.  There are, therefore, no immediate plans to engage in further recruitment to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, the Government is confident that in the event of our exiting the bail-out programme at the end of this year and once again being in full control of resources, should further garda&iacute; be required as a result of retirements or personnel leaving the force to do other things, this issue will be reconsidered.</p></speech>

The agency is to be commended for its work.  I would like to give a flavour of the position in this regard.  </p><p>  The media and politicians have tended to concentrate largely on those producing medicines-drugs.  I have for some time believed pharmacies have been keeping their heads down as regards the variations in charges for medicines-drugs.  The ones who are losing as a result are the consumer and, through the drug refund scheme, the taxpayer.  I will give an example of what is set out in the NCA study which applies nationally.  The percentage difference in price of individual prescription medicines ranges from 37% to 119%.  The average percentage difference across all products nationally is 56%.  In terms of how the consumer is being misled, the average price variation among the 39 prescription medicines included in the study is 30% and 27% in Galway and Waterford, respectively.  The corresponding figure for Cork and Limerick is 29%.  These are huge variations.  </p><p>  I have never believed in self-regulation.  Historically, it has not worked well in this country.  This is proof positive that pharmacies, left to their own devices, will engage in this behaviour.  They have some explaining to do.  I will give an example in Dublin from the study.  The cost of a particular drug used in the treatment of stomach complaints varies in price from &euro;19.96 to &euro;42.33, a difference of 112%.  Given the variations in price of the same product in a small city like Dublin, pharmacies have some questions to answer.  </p><p>  On regulation, as legislators, we cannot put our trust in pharmacies.  I do not include pharmacies in general, as I know the prices in most pharmacies in my area, of which there is a large selection, including branches of one or two of the large multiples, are modest.  We must address this issue.  As legislators, we may have run out of time in doing so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-27a.444" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032700032#EE00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.  As indicated by him, a recently published survey by the National Consumer Agency found substantial variations in the prices charged for prescription medicines in pharmacies.  At national level, the percentage difference found in the prices of 39 individual prescription medicines ranged from 37% to 199%, the average percentage difference being 56%.</p><p>  The HSE reimburses pharmacists for products dispensed under the General Medical Services and other community drug schemes, including the drug payment scheme, in accordance with the reimbursement rates set out in the list of reimbursable items.</p><p>Under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009, the fees and allowances paid by the HSE to pharmacists were reduced in 2009 and again in 2011.  These reductions resulted in cumulative savings to the HSE of approximately &euro;154 million per annum.  These measures included a reduction in the wholesale mark-up on drugs from 17.66% to 8%.  In addition, the retail mark-up payable under the drug payment scheme and the long-term illness scheme was reduced from 50% to 20%.  The reduction in the cost of medicines should be of benefit to all patients who hold a DPS card, irrespective of whether they reach the &euro;144 per month threshold.  I would be very disappointed if all pharmacists were not passing on the benefits of lower prices and mark-ups to patients.</p><p> I urge customers, as best they can, to consult the HSE website to check the prices of their prescription medicines.  If they are being charged more than the price listed - that is, if they are being charged more than a 20% retail mark-up, as I mentioned - they should raise it with their pharmacy.  I accept it may not always be easy for patients to do this, but is also open to them to move their custom to a different pharmacy if they are dissatisfied with the prices being charged by their current pharmacy.</p><p> The Department of Health is also raising the issue of price transparency with the regulatory body for pharmacists, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, PSI.  While it would not be realistically possible to display the price of each of the approximately 7,000 medicines currently on the market in Ireland, the PSI is being asked to examine how greater price transparency can be achieved.</p><p> In addition to the measures I outlined, I wish to advise that the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012, Committee Stage of which was passed in the D&aacute;il last week, provides for the introduction of a system of generic substitution and reference pricing, which will greatly assist in resolving the situation the Deputy has raised.</p><p> It is important to note that the top two products identified by the National Consumer Agency as having the largest percentage price variation nationally are Losec and Zoton.  Both of these products belong to a group of drugs known as proton pump inhibitors, which will be one of the first to be assessed for interchangeability and reference pricing once the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill 2012 is commenced.  This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and pharmacists and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines, resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients.</p></speech>

Like others, I welcome the proposed Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Bill, which has been long awaited.  I am glad that the Government has seen fit to move on it.  I look forward to seeing how it will operate.  The Minister of State is well briefed on this area.  There is the issue of price variation, particularly in this city, where one can pay double the price depending on the distance one lives from the city.  If one adds such price variation to the prices of medication under the drugs refund scheme, which the Minister of State highlighted, patients are suffering a double whammy.  The consumer is being mugged with regard to the prices charged for medications in certain chemists.  Under the drugs refund scheme, the taxpayer is being mugged, because with medicines priced at this level they can easily reach the ceiling to which the Minister of State referred.  These are the anomalies in the system.  I compliment the Department on the work it has done in this area and I look forward to the new legislation and to the policing that will take place in regard to pharmacies.</p></speech>

The National Consumer Agency report is useful because it focuses public attention on the particular instances the agency has addressed.  The Deputy is absolutely right that this is a matter of continuing concern.  It is of continuing concern to me, as a Minister of State with responsibility in the area, to the Minister for Health and to the Government generally that such variations in pricing can occur, sometimes in circumstances in which pharmacists are relatively close to each other and in the same area of a city.  This needs to be rectified and, at the very least, explained and understood.  Therefore, the Deputy is right to raise this issue.</p><p>  The legislative and other measures that the Government has taken will have a real effect, particularly the legislation on generic substitution legislation which I mentioned, which the Deputy acknowledged and which has passed Committee Stage in the House.  Once the legislation is enacted, the Irish Medicines Board, IMB, will commence assessment of medical products and groups of medicinal products to establish groups of interchangeable medicinal products.  Once the IMB has published such a group, the HSE can set a reference price for it.  There is also provision in the legislation for reference pricing, which involves comparisons with the prices of medicines in other comparable countries.  The enactment and the operation of that legislation will have an important impact on this issue, about which we are all concerned.  It is something about which we need to be vigilant.  The agency report is very helpful in that regard.</p></speech>

I know he had an important engagement with the representative organisation of some major wind industry leaders and ambassadors, the Irish Wind Energy Association, today.  I welcome his announcement today that the REFIT scheme is to be extended by two years to 2017.  I asked the Minister to consider that issue as recently as last month and I am delighted he is pursuing this course.  I know from his announcement that his intention is to bring certainty to wind planning.  This has been a particular problem for areas with poor grid development.  They have been unable to develop projects and are being discommoded by the slow pace of grid development in the country, which is something outside their control.</p><p>  This brings me to the nub of the problem I want to highlight.  As the Minister will know, there is a massive wind resource in Mayo and we are only too willing to develop its potential.  Unfortunately, the standard of the grid in that county is that of a bog road, compared to the superhighway we need to get the electricity out.  We do not have a superhighway grid; we only have a bog-road one.</p><p>  I very much welcome the plans to develop the grid into the west, which will represent a &euro;240 million investment in the area by EirGrid.  A 400 kV line will go into County Mayo, which is much needed.  However, at the rate matters are progressing, that line will not be in place until 2019 to 2020.  I know the Minister indicated as recently as today that he is concerned at the rate at which we are achieving installed capacity.  Currently, it is 180 MW per year, on average, and he would like to see it at 250 MW per year.  </p><p>  I am asking the Minister to set up a pilot project in north Mayo.  In 2012 EirGrid made a contentious decision to increase the total amount of wind energy connected to the existing 110 kV network under Gate 3 in this area from 170 MW to 340 MW, but the line does not have that capacity.  People were made offers prior to that decision.  They were offered 60 MW and the understanding was that there would be up to 180 MW on that line.</p><p>The offers exceed the capacity on the line and the line is saturated.  This, and the constraints and curtailments that EirGrid's decision will impose on them pose a challenge for the financial viability and realisation of projects that have come a long way through the planning process and are due to sign connection agreements under Gate 3 this summer.  They will not be as bankable as they were and the money that people have already spent on grid connection and the planning and development of their projects is rendered more speculative because they cannot be sure of the outcome.</p><p> I ask the Minister to be innovative.  We cannot wait till 2019.  I know there is a plan to develop a circuit between Ballina and Castlebar which would reinforce the line and allow the 340MW uprate.  Part of the area would be an environmentally sensitive special area of conservation.  We will not build a line there overnight.  It will take at least five years.  There is a great deal of new smart technology in this area including special protection and dynamic line rating schemes.  I ask that some of the projects in the Mayo area receive special attention because of the way they have been discommoded due to EirGrid's decision, as well as being a pilot project.  I am sure this problem does not affect only Mayo.  I am sure it is a problem in other areas with massive resources but no grid.  The Minister could direct EirGrid to invest in this and give a commitment to do so by the end of summer so that people are not required to sign connection agreements under Gate 3 and spend hundreds of thousands of euro when they do not know if they can get finance from the bank to build the projects.  We must consider other solutions if we are to achieve the Minister's objective which is to increase installed capacity per annum.  Otherwise, we will not reach the 2020 targets because of the weaknesses in the grid in the areas where we have the resource.</p></speech>

They will also greatly enhance the installed capacity in the seven or eight years to 2020 which should put us in a position to meet our targets comfortably.  As Deputy Mulherin knows it is EirGrid's role, as the national transmission system operator, to develop and upgrade the transmission system in order to meet ongoing and future electricity needs.</p><p><br />  The European smart grid task force defined a smart grid as &quot;an electricity network that can cost effectively integrate the behaviour and actions of all users connected to it - those who generate, those who consume and those who do both - in order to ensure an economically efficient, sustainable power system with low losses and high levels of quality and security of supply and safety&quot;.</p><p><br />  Smart grids are not smart meters and <i>vice versa</i>.  However, smart grids can include smart meters.  Simply put, smart grids are electrical networks which have intelligence built into them in order to enable more efficient operation of the entire electricity supply system and to facilitate distributed, embedded generation and demand control measures.  They are enabling for the system operator and also for generators and electricity customers.  The smart grid is a key enabler of a future low carbon electricity system that facilitates demand side efficiency, increases the share of renewable and distributed generation and enables consumer participation.</p><p><br />  I understand that EirGrid has recently provided the Deputy with a briefing on how the overall Grid25 strategy will include the deployment, where appropriate, of smart grid technologies that will help system operators use grid infrastructure more efficiently.  EirGrid's Grid25 programme is a series of projects to upgrade the current electricity system while continuing to operate and maintain a safe, secure and reliable system.  EirGrid has extensive work under way in the smart grid sphere, including its involvement in the Smart Grid Innovation Hub in a collaborative initiative by EirGrid and the National Digital Research Centre, NDRC, and in the EirGrid announcement of demonstration projects in the smart grid sector, as well as through EirGrid's DS3 programme in the facilitation of renewables area, for delivering a secure, sustainable electricity system.</p><p><br />  EirGrid is also continuing to implement and trial smart grid technologies such as real-time condition monitoring tools, advanced demand side management techniques for example, smart devices in the home, extensive use of ICT infrastructure to communicate from the National Control Centre to key grid users and use of innovative transmission infrastructure technology, for example, super conductors, all allowing for more efficient and secure operation of the power system in real time.  EirGrid and the Northern Ireland operator, SONI, support several demonstration projects in the smart grid sector in order to encourage the development of a smarter grid in Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p><p><br />  The Government, in its policy statement on the strategic importance of transmission and other energy infrastructure which was published in July 2012, underlined the need and urgency for new energy infrastructure to be developed both in the national interest and from a European perspective.  In addition to highlighting the importance of the interests of individual energy consumers, the policy statement was conscious that public acceptance and understanding of energy infrastructure is a major challenge.  This requires public confidence that projects and programmes adhere to the highest international standards of safety, health and environmental and visual impact, and technology choice.</p><p><br />  Continued progress made with the Grid 25 programme and other essential energy infrastructure initiatives will have positive impacts for all local communities in underpinning regional and economic development and jobs.  As regards Deputy Mulherin's argument I am aware that EirGrid is considering at present whether measures would be possible to facilitate the connection of additional wind generation in areas of Ireland, including Mayo, while the development of vital grid infrastructure developments is ongoing in parallel.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that I have had discussions with EirGrid which were helpful.  I am asking that something more firm, like a commitment, would be given by next summer because investors in projects are being asked to spend a lot of money on signing up connection agreements by that date and they need to know where they stand in respect of the implementation of smart grid technology to stretch capacity on the existing structure.  Unless we take this innovative approach and try to upgrade it and get more out of it, which the technology allows, we will not realise our wind or wave or any other capacity potential because the final infrastructure is many years down the line.  We need to consider all the other options.  My understanding is that the cost of some of the smart grid technologies would be borne to a great extent by the generators.  I am not saying that there are not cases where there may be some socialisation of the cost.  These projects are very far advanced and need this type of assurance from EirGrid and while I respect the fact that they have to do their job the Minister's interest is in achieving the renewable energy targets for wind-generated electricity.  I am asking that they might be guided in that direction.</p></speech>

The consultation process in respect of curtailment and scheduling took a great deal longer than anybody could have predicted three and a half years ago.</p><p>It is also true that EirGrid has not been able to deliver as quickly as might have been anticipated for a variety of reasons.  The way is now clear.</p><p> There is an analysis under way of the large number of wind generation sites seeking to connect to the grid.  After it is completed, it is EirGrids intention to specify where further studies on smart grid technologies might take place.  I do not want to be dragged into telling EirGrid how to do its job or pre-empt the analysis.  I understand, however, EirGrid will consider including County Mayo, among other areas, in further studies to commence this summer on this topic.</p></speech>

I am proposing an amendment to Schedule 3 to provide that the Minister may introduce such regulations without the need for local authorities to specifically request as is currently the case.</p><p>  Regarding amendments Nos. 1 and 2, as we need to amend the Dog Breeding Establishment Act 2010 and the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011, it is necessary to include in the Long Title that amendment to those Acts as proposed.</p><p>  Amendment No. 27 effectively bypasses section 16 of Dog Breeding Establishment Act 2010 in circumstances where a dog is identified in accordance with the animal health and welfare regulations.  The purpose of this provision is to ensure the legislation is consistent and one measure does not contradict another.</p><p>  In other words, I want to introduce a regulation which requires all dogs to be microchipped, a move I believe Deputies will welcome.  It will take some time to put that regulation in place and we will have to go through a proper consultation process to ensure we get it right and make it as cost effective as possible.  We also need to ensure the regulations linked with this Bill supersede what is already in the existing legislation, namely, the Dog Breeding Establishment Act 2010 and the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011.  Microchipping of dogs will apply across the board as it does already with dog-breeding establishments and the greyhound industry.  We cannot have different standards applying depending on where a puppy happens to be born.  We have learned a few lessons in the past several months with equine identity, passports and microchipping.  I want a central database to know how many dogs there are in the country.  Accordingly, if there is a case of a stray dog, or one which has suffered cruelty or was abandoned, we can then establish who owned the dog and take appropriate action.</p></speech>

We have several codes of conduct and regulations to agree to relating to fur farming, the digging out of animals and the micro-chipping of dogs.  We will also have an entirely new and improved approach towards equine identification also.  I intend to bring these issues to the committee in order that we can go through them and iron out concerns people may have.</p><p>  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan asked about retrospection.  I am keen to see all dogs micro-chipped, but we have to have a reasonable timeframe for people to do this.  I understand the United Kingdom is setting a date of either 2016 or 2017 for all dogs to be micro-chipped.  We must figure out how best to ensure people will be able to afford to do this.  For example, we will discuss the matter with the Veterinary Council of Ireland to determine whether veterinary surgeons throughout the country will do this work at cost.  I gather that if they were to do so, it might cost approximately &euro;7.50 to have a dog micro-chipped, as opposed to &euro;40 or &euro;50, if one were to pay the cost of expertise and so on.  However, in doing it in that way veterinary surgeons would be bring in far more clients to their practices and it would make sense for them to do so.  We need to work this out with veterinary practitioners and other interested groups.  We will have a consultation process before we finalise any regulation and it will involve a discussion at the committee.</p></speech>

This reflected recent changes in the law at EU level relating to the replacement of the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 by the European Union (Protection of Animals Used for Scientific Purposes) Regulations 2012.  Therefore, we need to keep the references in this legislation up to date.  Amendment No. 12 is similar to amendment No. 6 and reflects the replacement of the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876 by SI No. 543 of 2012, the European Union (Protection of Animals Used for Scientific Purposes) Regulations 2012.  In other words, the law changed while the Bill was being considered and we have reflected this in the amendment.</p></speech>

The detailed discussion on Committee Stage was helpful, given the need for precision not only in the wording used but also in the ordering.  While the points were certainly open to debate and it is perhaps unlikely that owners of more wilful species such as cats would be prosecuted for the behaviour of such animals because they are considered ungovernable - perhaps that is a questionable term - I took the view that there was strong enough merit in the points made by Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v to persuade me to reorganise the section to ensure the terminology relating to &quot;having regard to the animal's nature&quot; and so on was clarified to make it clear that this proviso applied to the section as a whole.  While the amendment does not change the meaning or substance of this important provision, it removes any ambiguity.  We held a long discussion on the matter on Committee Stage.  I do not propose to accept Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's amendment on the topic because while it sets out to solve the same problem, it would weaken rather than qualify the basic duty of care on an animal owner.  Therefore, it would have greater scope to be misused by unscrupulous persons.  In other words, I have accommodated the Deputy's concerns in my amendment, while at the same time maintaining the strength of this important section in making clear the responsibility of an owner towards his or her animals.</p></speech>

There are two aspects to it, the first of which relates to fur farming <i>per se</i>.  Many of us have made known our views and how opposed we are to fur farming.  At this stage many countries in Europe have banned fur farming, the latest being the Netherlands, the third largest fur producer after China and Denmark.</p><p>We also see a phasing out of fur farming in other countries and that would have a been a sensible approach to take here.</p><p> I also discussed before the way animals are gassed.  The second part of my amendment relates to the welfare of the mink.  The Minister says he wants greater regulation, so fur farming will not be banned in this Bill.  Therefore, there is a need for much stronger controls over how the mink are held and how they are gassed.  As I pointed out on Committee Stage, there are serious issues for the environment.  Fur has a higher impact in respect of 17 of the 18 environmental themes, including climate change and toxic emissions.  The climate change impact of 1 kg of mink fur is five times greater than that of the highest scoring textile wool, owing to the feeding requirements and the nitrous oxide emissions from mink manure.</p><p> There are two issues in question here.  I would love to see fur farming banned and do not understand why we must retain it in this day and age.  We could follow the good example of other countries in Europe and even if we do not ban it outright, consider phasing it out.  In the meantime, we must show more concern for the welfare of the mink while they are being kept in captivity and about the way they are gassed.  There is also an issue with regard to mink escaping from captivity and damaging bird life in their area.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Sullivan wants fur farming banned, but what I propose to do is to introduce a new code of conduct and a new inspection and licensing regime in order to reassure people that within the boundaries of farming, the welfare of the animals is protected.  This goes for matters such as the density of animal numbers in cages and the way in which they are killed.  I will bring that code before a committee and we will be able to discuss it.  However, I cannot agree with the Deputy that we should simply ban fur farming.  We will introduce a tight code of conduct and a new licensing regime and if it is necessary to introduce regulations, we will do that.  However, let us wait and see how the code works.</p><p>  This is a practice that is relatively small in Ireland and there are only four or five fur farms here.  I want to ensure that the fur farming that takes place here is of the highest standard.  If at some point in the future, we need to review that because of welfare standards or concerns, we can do that.  However, we have taken a policy decision not to do that at this stage, but to focus on ensuring that welfare concerns are properly attended to.</p></speech>

I appreciate the point made by the Minister that he will look at this issue in the form of a code of conduct, but the problem for us is that what we are dealing with currently is an Animal Health and Welfare Bill where this practice, which is inherently cruel and inhumane, will be allowed to continue, while we are expected to buy into a promise of regulation and improvement.</p><p>  Given the thorough knowledge the Minister has of his brief, I am sure we will be given regulations and that we will have an improvement on what exists now.  The problem is that we have no input into that process.  However, we have an input into this Bill.  In that sense, the moving of this amendment is appropriate.  Fur farming is a small scale practice here and is not of major significance.  Often, the argument is put forward that there are serious economic considerations with regard to the need to practise this barbarity.  That is not the case here as we are talking about just five registered mink farms, yet in 2006 approximately 170,000 mink were being killed here and 300 foxes.</p><p>  There are issues with regard to the type of regulations the Minister intends to introduce.  In Germany, there have been substantial improvements in regulations and while it has not banned the practice of fur farming, it has upgraded significantly the quality of life of mink.  That is somewhat of a contradiction as mink do not have much of a quality of life, but at least they are being kept in better cages and are given some form of toys, better food and wire mesh floors have been banned.  We have no such guarantees with regard to the issues here or in terms of the manner by which the animals will be killed.  I would prefer an outright ban on fur farming as that is the only choice that is compatible with animal health and welfare, because the idea of keeping the practice of keeping and rearing animals just for their fur has no logical basis.</p><p>  While the Minister said previously that there are currently no foxes being farmed in Ireland for their fur, there is nothing in the legislation which prevents this from happening in the future.  We need more and this amendment gives us more and that is the reason I support it.</p></speech>

The Minister has admitted that fur farming is a very small operation here.  This begs the question why we do not seize the opportunity today to put an end to this barbaric practice.  This barbaric practice does not represent the future of rural economic life here.  Fur farming is on the decline, is unnecessary, deliberately cruel, wrong and profoundly unnecessary.  There is no need or justification for it.  I am very interested in hearing what the Minister has to say on this.  Why does he not take the opportunity today to be the Minister who brought in a ban on fur farming?  Why does he not accept Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment and do a good day's work in the House?</p></speech>

It is true there are only five fur farms.  However, it is not true to say this practice is deliberately cruel.  This is a farming practice and like poultry or some pig farming, it is an intensive practice.  I am not overly supportive of the industry, but I do not feel I should ban it.  Quite a number of people here make a living from work linked to the five existing farms.  If we banned fur farming, we would have to compensate these people.</p><p>  I have thought about this issue and considered banning fur farming, but on balance I believe better regulation is a fairer approach to take for the people in the industry.  As legislators, we must ensure we apply best practice so as to ensure welfare considerations are focused and that we put a code of conduct and licensing system in place that will reflect that.  If this code and system make the industry uncompetitive, so be it.  I am slow to ban outright something that I am personally not that comfortable with, but that is far different from deciding to ban something.  I believe this industry has a right to survive and deserves a policy response that allows it do that.  However, I have a responsibility to ensure that within that, we impose welfare standards within reason on the industry.  We will do and will bring the code of conduct to committee where I suspect the Deputy will have an input into it.  The Deputy should wait and see what we do in that regard.</p><p>  One of the first things I did when I became Minister was to ask for a report on fur farming.  I received that report and it makes a series of recommendations.  Some Deputies have probably read the report, but the recommendations may not go far enough for them.  It is a step in the right direction and we will now move ahead to put a code of conduct in place.  Let us see then in five years' time where we are with this industry.</p></speech>

The Irish Wildlife Trust's report on mink farms, which was covered on television some time ago, pointed out the dreadful conditions that exist in such farms.  I accept that the Minister has said he does not intend to ban this industry outright, but I would have expected him to consider phasing it out as other countries are doing.</p></speech>

This is a policy choice.  We have decided to ensure Ireland acts as an international benchmark in prioritising welfare standards.  We will ensure the standards in this industry are as high as the standards in any other country, if not higher.  We will do that through a code of practice and a licensing system.  That is the approach we have decided to take.  There are recommendations and European standards relating to how animals should be killed.  It is important to emphasise that there is no farming system that does not involve some pain when animals are slaughtered at the end of their lifetimes.  I do not know whether the Deputy has ever visited a slaughterhouse at which poultry, pigs, sheep or cattle are killed.  This is part of farming.  We need to apply standards that ensure the suffering of these animals is minimised at the time of death, just as we have done in the case of other farmed animals.  We will try to do that through the code of conduct on how animals are killed at the end of their lifetimes.</p></speech>

It was felt that if the explanation had to be recorded by the authorised officer, at least it would be recorded at the time.  This would put an extra onus on the official taking action not to act in a capricious way because the explanation of the owner of the animal would be taken there and then, rather than having a <i>post factum</i> argument.  That is the thrust of the amendment.</p></speech>

I can understand what the Deputy is getting at, namely, if an authorised officer is to require somebody to stop what they are doing because the officer has a concern there may be a welfare implication, the person who is supposedly offending should have an opportunity to give an explanation.</p><p>The problem with it is that it would weaken the power of authorised officers.  If one reads the section of the Bill which it is proposed to amend, it states: <blockquote>An authorised officer who has reasonable grounds for believing that a person is offending against this section, in relation to an animal, may require the person to immediately desist from so offending, and, if necessary, to take such action as the officer may require in the interests of the health and welfare of the animal.</blockquote>The purpose is to prioritise the protection of the welfare of the animal.  If the authorised officer has reasonable grounds for believing a person is offending, he or she has to be able to take action, in some cases quickly.  In keeping with the training of authorised officers in a code of standard to which they must operate, in the vast majority of cases it will be the case that an authorised officer will have a conversation with somebody who may be committing an offence before action is taken.  However, there are certain circumstances where there is no need for an explanation and where seeking an explanation would simply be wasting time.  We must ensure people do not adopt delaying tactics by giving long and detailed explanations to which the authorised officer would have to listen if this amendment was accepted.  In certain circumstances an authorised officer must have the power to act quickly, decisively and in the interests of the animal or animals concerned, regardless of whether they are on the back of a trailer coming off a ship, in a farmyard or garage where dog fighting could be happening.  I understand the point the Deputy is making, but the amendment would weakens the section.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept it.</p></speech>

That such a comprehensive animal health and welfare Bill is being put through the House today is a significant step forward.  All of us agree that many of its provisions represent a substantial step forward in protecting animal welfare in the State.  Against this backdrop, that hare coursing is excluded from the provisions of the Bill is a gaping anomaly and contradiction.  In essence, we are recognising that the practice is inherently cruel but allowing it to continue.  </p><p><br />  Ireland is one of the last remaining countries to allow hare coursing to take place.  It has been banned in England, Scotland, Wales and, most recently, Northern Ireland.  It is something a majority of Irish citizens in opinion polls and I consistently believe is an outdated practice with no part to play in modern Ireland.  This is not just an opinion; it has been verified by what is taking place on the ground where the level of participation in coursing clubs has been declining dramatically in recent years.  Each season the numbers involved are growing smaller.  Census figures released in 1935 revealed that there were over 219 coursing clubs in Ireland.  Today there are less than 90 and the figure is declining.  It is a practice engaged in in about ten counties.  The only area in Dublin in which it is engaged in is my constituency.  </p><p><br />  Information circulated to all Deputies which shows that a very successful drag coursing event took place negates the traditional argument that people who love greyhounds will not have a chance to exercise their dogs and allow them to compete.  That is nonsense.  We do not need to allow hare coursing to continue for dogs to be exercised or compete.  Successful drag coursing events held in Ireland prove this and negate that argument.  The Minister must take this on board.  Not allowing this barbarity to continue and replacing it with drag coursing would do far more for the tourism industry.  </p><p><br />  During the years we have heard many ridiculous arguments justifying hare coursing, all of which can be defeated.  We hear such nonsense that coursing clubs look after and protect hares.  Let us be clear: hares are snatched from their environment and kept to be chased by dogs.  They sustain massive injuries that I will not read into the record because we have done so before.  That the organisers do not plan for deaths to occur which are an unfortunate by-product is not a reason to allow it to continue.  </p><p><br />  I do not accept the argument that hare coursing is a traditional sport in Ireland.  It was first introduced by British garrisons.  The fact that something is traditional does not mean it is acceptable.  Standards in society change and what was the norm can become unacceptable as time passes.  In times past there were freak shows at which people with disabilities and those who looked different were paraded in the name of entertainment.  The holding of such events today would be reprehensible.  Similarly, activities involving wanton cruelty such as cock fighting and bear baiting which passed for sport 100 years ago would not be deemed acceptable by anybody today.  All of the evidence shows that this is not a natural activity for hares which do not enjoy being chased.  They are gentle animals which are under threat and whose numbers are in decline as a result of this activity.  It is not acceptable that it should continue.  Successive opinion polls show this is not a minority viewpoint.  </p><p><br />  I am surprised that the Minister has continued to allow this cruel practice and excluded it from the provisions of the legislation because it is the one gaping anomaly that most citizens do not accept.  Even at this late stage, I appeal to him to accept our amendment and allow us and coursing clubs to move on to develop the activity mentioned which involves no cruelty.  Many people who consciously stay away might then return.  We do not see this as in any way an attack on the rural way of life.  The majority of people living in rural areas oppose hare coursing.  I therefore ask the Minister to support the amendment.</p></speech>

When it became known in animal welfare circles that the Minister was working on this Bill, there was a great sense that finally we were going to do the right thing and that cruel practices such as hare coursing, the gassing of mink and the culling of badgers would finally be eradicated.</p><p> I want to go back to the beginning of the Bill.  In the Long Title, on page seven, it is definitely stated that the aim of the Bill is to prevent cruelty to animals.  Under Part 3, which is entitled "Animal Welfare", on page 13, it is stated that a person who is in possession of a protected animal must ensure that the animal is treated in a manner that safeguards the health and welfare of the animal and does not threaten the health or welfare of the animal or another animal.  Nobody can tell me that coursing is the sort of activity in which the welfare of the animal is not at stake and in which there is no cruelty.</p><p> I refer to an interesting quotation from a German philosopher, Immanuel Kant: &quot;He who is cruel to animals becomes hard also in his dealings with men.  We can judge the heart of a man by his treatment of animals.&quot;  Irish men are not coming across very well when we see the way in which animals are being treated in this country.  I do not think it is doing our international reputation any good to be one of three countries that continue to allow live coursing.  I understand that The Gathering has also removed hunting from its website.  This was a golden opportunity to get rid of hare coursing.  It is obvious that the majority of people in this country totally oppose it.  I know that Deputies are annoyed by the volume of e-mails they receive on this matter, but this shows the extent of the support for putting a ban on coursing.</p><p> Damage is being done to greyhounds, who are gentle animals.  They are being deliberately blooded and trained to do something that is against their nature.  We know also of the damage to hares in the way they are netted, housed and used.  There is also an increasing use of rabbits.  Greyhounds have suffered injuries because they become frustrated with wearing the muzzle.  As I said on Committee Stage, I do not advocate that muzzles should not be used.  However, it is unnatural for the greyhound.</p><p> The Minister referred on Committee Stage to employment in the coursing industry.  However, employment can be supported if drag coursing is introduced.  Like Deputy Daly, I hope the Minister can consider its introduction.  To have coursing events monitored by coursing clubs is not an adequate supervision and inspection system.  The hares are injured during coursing.  They are mauled and some of them have been killed either during or after the coursing.  The hare is a sub-species of the mountain hare.  There could be issues with regard to the survival of the species, which may become endangered.</p><p> My predecessor, the late Tony Gregory, tried to bring in a ban on coursing in the early 1990s but was unsuccessful.  More than 30 years later, we are in the same situation.  This is a cruel practice.  If the Minister is concerned about animal welfare he will reconsider.  Neither Deputy Daly nor I will give up the fight on this one.</p></speech>

We had a discussion about language when dealing with the previous amendment.  However, I do not think there can be much debate about this amendment.  Hare coursing is deliberately cruel and unnecessary.  As Deputy O'Sullivan has outlined, issues of employment can be addressed in other ways, such as by the use of drag coursing.  It sticks out like a sore thumb in this Bill that the opportunity to ban coursing is not being seized.  I wonder why it is not being seized.  It is very ironic that in our vote on the previous amendment, Fine Gael, Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in all stood shoulder to shoulder.  Not since before 1918 have the nationalist parties stood together so much to oppose progressive measures towards achieving animal rights.  This is an opportunity for the Minister to redeem himself.  I acknowledge the positive elements of this Bill but this provision is a significant anomaly.  In failing to ban hare coursing we have failed to seize political responsibility and responsibility for the environment in which we all live on this island.  It is a completely barbaric, unnecessary and unacceptable practice.  It certainly does not represent the future of Irish economic and rural development.  We should ban it outright today.  I support the amendment.</p></speech>

I come from a county with a proud coursing record and with long-established coursing clubs.  Coursing is part of our heritage and our culture.  It is fine to hear Deputies saying that any jobs lost can be replaced in other ways.  It is difficult to create employment in these difficult times.  The employment provided by the coursing and greyhound industry in Tipperary is indigenous employment, of the people, by the people.  It is employment created by the money and initiative of the people themselves.  It is created by their own kennels and by investment in breeding dogs.  They nurture the greyhounds and the greyhound industry.</p><p>  We had a very successful festival in Clonmel in February.  On numerous occasions I have invited Deputy Clare Daly and Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan to come down to observe the festival.  However, there are none so blind as those who will not see.  I ask them to come down to see how humane coursing has become and how valuable the industry is to the county and to tourism.  Only today I learned that hunting has been taken off the website for The Gathering.  If that is the case, it is more the pity, is m&oacute;r an trua &eacute;.  It is part of our nature to hunt and fish and do coursing.</p><p>  I was shocked to hear Deputy O'Sullivan say she was appalled at the result of the previous vote.  Thankfully, we live in a democracy and we are entitled to vote.  If, as has been claimed by my two colleagues, opinion polls have recorded a demand for the banning of coursing, why have those people not elected 100 Deputies to this House?</p><p>  Deputy O'Sullivan referred to the e-mails sent to Deputies.  Those e-mails are part of a concerted, organised and contrived campaign - a silly campaign, in my view.  These are the same people who came to a coursing meeting in Clonmel a couple of years ago and cut the wire of the compound holding the hares.  The hares ran out onto the motorway and were slaughtered.  This was done in the name of animal rights.  They were slaughtered and pulverised into the surface of the motorway.  Those people were not thinking about the welfare of those animals.  Some years ago, the same people put broken glass on the greyhound track.  These are the people who talk about minding the delicate greyhounds.  That glass was inserted into the track in order to do unmerciful damage to the feet of the greyhounds.  These people need to get real and to stop the bully tactics.  We are entitled to our indigenous industry.  We are entitled to carry out and to participate in our sports, and more so when it is providing employment.  The same applies to hunting.  Anyone with a nag, a foal or a mare needs a stable, tackle, a horse box and the means to pull it.  They will need to avail of veterinary services.  We are generating an industry and we should be allowed to continue.  If it does not suit the people in the Pale, that is fine.  These people say that coursing was supposed to have been introduced into the garrison towns.  If that is so, I say tough; it is something that we adopted.  Everything British is not bad.  People have got lots of enjoyment out of coursing and lots of jobs have been created out of it.  It is an industry worth at least &euro;6 million to the town of Clonmel.  I invited the Minister to come to Clonmel but he was unable to come this year.  His late colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Shane McEntee, God rest him, came to Clonmel last year.  We cannot all live in glasshouses and say that this can be stopped.  These are the same people who are looking for jobs here and jobs there.  It is not so easy to create jobs.  We used to have a flourishing greyhound industry in south Tipperary but it is not half as flourishing now.  However, there is still a good residue of people employed and a good residue of spending around this industry.  Let us accept the democratic will and the vote.  I do not know what will be the result of the next vote; I can only account for my own vote and account for my own people in Tipperary.  Some people were horrified because only 14 people voted against the closing of fur factories, which have created valuable employment in certain parts of the country.  Let us get real.  We cannot on one hand scream for more jobs and more industry while on the other hand banish an indigenous industry that is of the people, by the people and for the people.  If we had more of that, we would not have half the unemployment we have.</p><p>People are entitled to make and continue their efforts, but it sticks in my craw when they start moaning that only 14 voted one way while 100 voted the other.  That is where I have the problem.  Is it a democracy or not?  Are we going to be led by so-called opinion polls which overwhelmingly say that coursing should be banned?  Why is that not reflected at the ballot box?</p><p> We have to deal with this in the real world.  Goodness knows, the people involved are burdened enough and we should allow them to enjoy their sport.  If they want to breed and care in every way for their greyhounds and horses and to generate an industry and jobs for themselves and their families, are we going to stop them because some idealist says this is cruel?  I have said it before and hate to revert to it, but some of the people who are anti-blood-sports are totally pro-abortion.  I cannot get it into my little head how anyone can be of that frame of mind.  That debate is coming down the tracks.  They are unashamedly pro-abortion and anti-blood-sports.  I rest my case.</p></speech>

For some, hare coursing is an unacceptably cruel practice.  For others, it is not.  It is part of parish and club life and their upbringing with greyhounds and so on.  There is a balance I must strike as a Minister in the Bill.</p><p>  It is important to record, for people who have never been to a coursing meeting - as I have not - that veterinary staff from my Department and rangers from the National Parks and Wildlife Service carry out random monitoring inspections during the coursing season to verify compliance with licences and rules governing animal welfare.  Everybody - even those who would like coursing to be banned - will recognise that over the last ten years, we have moved significantly towards clearer rules and regulations on adherence to animal welfare standards, linking those to the licensing of hare coursing.  As a further control, a monitoring committee on coursing was established during the 1993-94 coursing season, comprised of officials from my Department and representatives from the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Irish Coursing Club, to monitor developments in coursing.  The situation is therefore kept under constant review to ensure that coursing is run in a controlled and responsible manner in the interests of hares and greyhounds alike.</p><p>  Some people assume there is a significant mortality rate among hares used for coursing.  It is important to record that a very high proportion of hares captured for coursing are returned to the wild.  During the 2011-12 season, 97.3% of hares caught for coursing were returned to the wild.</p></speech>

That is not to say I am attempting to convince Deputies who are adamant that coursing should be banned.  While I can understand their concerns, I must legislate in a balanced and fair way.  We are doing that, and I cannot accept the amendments proposed by Deputy Clare Daly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-27a.518" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1015" speakername="Clare Daly" time="16:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032700042#PP00500"><p>The Minister makes the point that hare coursing is part of people's upbringing and club history, etc.  Our point is that the success of the greyhound industry and the continuance of coursing clubs do not depend on killing, hunting or maiming hares.  It is simply not the case.  People who want to continue with these clubs and to exercise their dogs, which many of them love, do not require thousands of hares to be netted, torn from the countryside, used as live lures for greyhounds, kept in captivity for weeks, trained to run up a field and then released for pairs of dogs to chase.  The fact that some hares are only maimed, receive a broken leg or experience trauma before being released is not really a justification.</p><p>  As a result of attitude changes and campaigning efforts by animal rights and welfare activists, changes in this area were made, not least because of the efforts of the former Deputy Tony Gregory and some of our other predecessors.  The fact that dogs are now muzzled has obviously reduced deaths, but it has not eliminated them.  While it is true that veterinarians and National Parks and Wildlife Service staff make checks, I put it to the Minister that against the backdrop of the requirements the Bill imposes to monitor and care for other animals, it would be better not to waste the time of officials in attending hare coursing events.  They should concentrate on meaningful jobs which really protect the welfare of animals in different circumstances.</p><p>  While it may be true that not every hare who participates in coursing dies, no coursing event takes place which does not see the death of a hare.  We have a catalogue released under the Freedom of Information Act by the National Parks and Wildlife Service which lists instances of death and injury.  We could be here all day listing them.  For example, in Clarecastle and Ennis in 2011 and early 2012, five hares were hit, three of whom died in the escape after coursing.  On day 2, seven hares were hit, two killed and four injured.  There were eight fatalities.  In Wexford, 12 hares were found to be unfit for coursing.  Of the 86 hares captured, a number were found to be missing.  In Thurles, ten hares were hit, two were injured and two died.</p></speech>

We are all for individual freedoms and supporting individual rights.  It would be fine if no harm was being done, but harm is being done.  This is deliberate and barbaric cruelty that serves no purpose and does not offer a single job.  Deputy Mattie McGrath may not have heard correctly because we did not say jobs would be lost as a result of this.  No scientific evidence has been put forward to say a ban on hare coursing will diminish the jobs in the area.  A more valid argument is that the more humane and acceptable alternative, drag coursing, could lead to more jobs being created in the industry.  The majority of counties may begin to look at it if it is so great.  I do not think it will happen but there is no evidence that jobs will be affected in this way.</p><p>  I do not accept that this is about idealism.  It is about a civilised society moving on and recognising that it is unacceptable that inherently cruel practices, which do not occur in the wild or naturally, are put forward in the name of sport and entertainment.  Assuming the Minister does not hear our pleas this time, we will return with new Private Members' Bill and other legislation in the lifetime of the Government.  There is no way we can allow this to continue.</p></speech>

This is referred to in my Department as the horse-whisperer amendment.  There has been some concern over the section of the Bill to which it pertains.  I have had it re-examined and am happy this provision will not be used as a basis for prosecutions against either farmers or educators, no matter how misguided or ill-informed future regulators may be.</p><p><br />  It was suggested that we add a clause making it clear that normal farming practices are not covered by the section.  Aside from the difficulty with defining &quot;normal farming practices&quot;, there is another problem in that if we specified that this concept was not covered, we would need to allow for every other legitimate activity that might involve animals, including those of riding schools, sports events and even walking the dog.  Obviously, the list would never be complete and would be pointless.  However, I am proposing a slight amendment in regard to the roping of horses.  As currently worded, performances involving this activity are banned whether they cause suffering or not.  However, there are some  specialists in this area who carry out this activity in a very humane and non-coercive fashion.  My amendment proposes to allow such activity were no unnecessary suffering is caused.  That is made quite clear in the amendment and I hope it will be accepted by the Deputies opposite.</p></speech>

The amendment provides that only a single notice need be lodged with the council or local authority.  This can apply for up to a year.  This was a sensible suggestion to reduce unnecessary bureaucracy and I am happy to accept it.  Amendment No. 42 updates section 58, which contains a reference to an offence under section 18.  Due to amendments to section 18, this should refer to section 18(5) and not section 18(7).  Amendment No. 42 is essentially a consequence of amendment No. 16.</p><p> Essentially, this is about taking a pragmatic and sensible approach to poison so that farmers do not have to go through the process of applying for a permit to lay poison each time they wish do so.  That would not have been practical in terms of implementation.</p></speech>

Is the Minister seeking to convince us that this particular aspect of the Bill is strong enough to prevent this from happening and that there are serious consequences for those found guilty of this activity?</p></speech>

We deliberately have not dealt in a detailed way in this Bill with the laying of poison because it is dealt with under the Wildlife Acts.  In the case of a person laying poison - in most cases this will be at farm level - we felt a need to bring clarity to whether he or she needed to get permission from the local authority to do so.</p><p>  What happened recently was shocking.  My understanding is that the Wildlife Acts deal with that issue.  It should not have happened.  It is possible to secure prosecutions if it can be proven that the birds were poisoned as a result of illegal laying of poison.  I do not think we can deal with the detail of that in this Bill.</p></speech>

The amendment introduces an additional safeguard by providing for a period of time within which the person may make representations and requiring the Minister to consider them before moving to withhold moneys.  I should stress that the power to withhold moneys applies only where the State has had to intervene in cases of probable wrongdoing, such as disposal of non-compliant animals whose status was unverified and which, therefore, could not enter the food chain, thus giving rise to a cost to the State associated with their disposal.</p></speech>

There is always the danger, where several Departments are involved, of issues slipping through the cracks.  We are concerned about the needless and unnecessary suffering of animals.  While I acknowledge that there are currently regulations in this regard, sometimes regulations are not strong enough.  This amendment seeks to ensure that animals are safeguarded when exposed to hazards in testing and research laboratories.  We have discussed this issue on a number of occasions with the Minister.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 18 proposes that a code of practice may issue in respect of animals used for scientific purposes.  This is not appropriate, as such animals are subject to EU regulations, given effect to by a 2012 European Union directive on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes.  This policy area falls outside my remit and is a matter for the Department of Health.  As such, it is difficult for me to accept the amendment.</p><p>  On animal research, the implementation of the three-Rs principle - namely, reduction, refinement and replacement - in respect of the use of animals in research forms a critical aspect of the new directive in this area.  I understand the Deputies' concern but I do not have the capacity to deal with it in this Bill as it is already covered under EU regulations, which regulations are enforced in Ireland through the Department of Health rather than my Department.</p></speech>

I believe in the importance of the Houses of the Oireachtas and their input.  In fairness, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has demonstrated that with proper engagement by this House the legislative process can seriously improve legislation or regulation.  That was my experience as a Minister also.  </p><p><br />  The resolution of this Government on taking office was that it would engage the House in much more legislative work.  Amendments Nos. 19, 26 and 28, therefore, seek to provide that when regulations are being introduced they automatically go before the relevant committee of the Houses for discussion.  While currently there is a requirement to lay regulations before the Houses, only a few regulations are discussed by the relevant committees.  I believe it would be better if we had a process in this regard similar to that introduced in regard to European laws, which if not of any great consequence can be disposed of quickly.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this series of amendments.  I am not asking him to do anything that would not go along with the spirit of how he has handled this particular piece of legislation.  I wish other Ministers followed his good example in this regard.</p></speech>

The <i>status quo</i> as referred to by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is that those regulations need to be laid before the Oireachtas and can be annulled by it within 21 sitting days, but the Minister can act if he or she needs to do so.  I have given a commitment to reappear before committee to get its views and opinions on the regulations linked to this legislation.  For me to tie the hands of future Ministers by requiring them to get approval from a committee before introducing a regulation, regardless of the circumstances, would be to compromise them in doing their job.  Much of the time we have to introduce regulations in response, for example, to European law.  It is often the case that those regulations have to be implemented within a particular timeframe.  In some cases, doing so is left to the last minute.  That should not be the case.</p><p>A Minister should have the flexibility to be able to introduce regulations if it is deemed necessary to do so without having to wait to get approval from the relevant committee.  It is right that any new regulation would be laid before the Houses and if the Houses disagreed with it and voted on it accordingly, then it could be annulled.  It is a different matter to have to go through what can be quite a prolonged procedure before one makes a regulation.  There are certain cases where one would need to make a regulation quickly, particularly in the case of a disease outbreak or some other issue.</p><p> I can understand the Deputy's view.  As the Minister responsible, I will try to bring as many of the regulations as we are preparing before a committee in order that we can debate them before they are finalised.  However, to make that a requirement in the legislation would not be right.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept the amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-27a.567" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032700047#UU00200"><p>I do not agree with what the Minister has said for a number of reasons.  What I propose would not require the approval of a committee but it could discuss a regulation.  There was a situation where I have had to introduce emergency legislation and it was passed in a day.  The Government had a similar experience recently.  If an emergency regulation had to be introduced, I am sure it would be facilitated by the House and with the way the Oireachtas works the Government has a majority in the committees.  The idea of making a regulation and then possibly annulling it does not allow for the amendment of it.</p><p>  The introduction of a regulation to set fees for Rossaveal Port, which come under the remit of the Minister's Department, arose during the term of this Government but on examination it was found to be riddled with inconsistencies.  When I raised it at the committee I was told that the regulation had to be made and that I would have to get the Minister to annul it.  I have no doubt if the Minister had put that regulation before us we would have pointed out to him that there were many inconsistencies in it.  I think he would have accepted the logic of our argument, but as a consequence of what happened, that are many difficulties with it.  The idea of a regulation being made and then annulled is not as good as introducing a draft regulation, debating it and making it in its original form or amending it.  If we did that, we would avoid many difficulties.</p><p>  The practice of being asked to introduce a measure at five minutes to, half a minute to, or one minute to midnight is endemic in the system.  The person presenting it could have had it for two years.  The Minister may wind up having items landed on his desk at 5 o'clock of a Friday evening and being told that they are very urgent.  I quickly disposed of matters except in such circumstances.  I would have asked the person presenting the matter when he or she received it and if he or she had received it six months or a year ago, my response would have been that I would take a similar time to decide on the matter.  Normally I would clear a matter overnight but I was wary of the five minutes to midnight syndrome in terms of a person presenting a matter very late at night having had it for a long time.  People quickly got the message not to try that one with me.  It is a very bad feature of the system and it should be avoided.  There is no excuse for people having European material and not bringing it forward.  That has been happening for years and we have all fought that battle.  Presumably the Minister is fighting the same battle as I fought against leaving everything to the last minute and then rushing a measure through because somebody is chasing it up because of the pressure of meeting a deadline.</p></speech>

In general, I think the formulation of policy and legislation is not being currently rushed through unless it is forced on us.  I can cite a good example of why I cannot accept this amendment.  In 2001 during the foot and mouth crisis, the then Minister made an order restricting the movement of animal and animal products from Northern Ireland on the night of Good Friday, having been notified of the outbreak of the disease that afternoon.  If the Minister had been legally required before making a regulation to go to the Oireachtas to debate it, the then Minister would not have been able to respond in that instance.  I agree with the Deputy that a better way to do this is to bring forward a draft regulation, have a debate on it, ensure that obvious mistakes are ironed out and that would give Opposition spokespersons, who take their job seriously, the opportunity to do that and then the regulation could be finalised and enforced.  That is a preferable method but of any morning any issue could arise with which I would have to deal quickly.  It could be an outbreak of a disease or a crisis, whether it be a dioxin scare, a foot and mouth crisis, an outbreak of BSE or some other issue, with which I would need to deal quickly and competently to lock down the situation.  A Minister in my position needs to be given the powers to be able to do that, if he or she has to do so in an emergency situation.  That is why we have a retrospective assessment of regulations when they are introduced and they can be annulled if they are not properly done.  In this Department, in particular, given the history of the past 20 or 30 years, we need to be able to act very quickly in certain circumstances.  What is being asked in these amendments, even though it is preferable in terms of practice in nine out of every ten regulations that I would have to introduce, in requiring a Minister to go through that procedure and forcing him or her potentially to wait for a D&aacute;il sitting to introduce a regulation is not appropriate in all circumstances.</p></speech>

It is difficult to see where a crisis could arise there.  Therefore, my case stands.  In the parts of the Bill where I propose to insert these provisions there are not necessarily any circumstances in which the type of crisis the Minister mentioned could occur.  If he could show me where a draft regulation of the type to which I referred relates to that type of a crisis situation, I will withdraw my amendment if he accepts the amendment that relates to the making of a regulation that could never arise in a crisis situation.  Animal health levies is an obvious example of that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-27a.570" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032700047#UU00500"><p>I will respond to that.  The case of animal health levies which the Deputy has raised is a fair point.  The section the Deputy is seeking to amend states: "Where the Minister proposes to make regulations under this section, [that is, animal health levies] a draft of the regulations shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House."  This means that the Houses of the Oireachtas need to pass this regulation in regard to health levies before it can be introduced.  In the case of animal health levies the Minister has to go through that practice because it is not one of a crisis mode.  What I am referring to is some of the other asks in terms of a Minister being able to make a decision quickly.  Both Houses of the Oireachtas have to support the regulation in regard to an animal health levy before the Minister can introduce it.  That surely satisfies the Deputy's concerns.</p></speech>

The requirement for advance payment of the levy on live exports reflects a time when most animals were exported from individual holdings.  Nowadays livestock must be assembled for export and over 98% of cattle exported are processed through approved assembly centres.  The advance collection of the live export levy is therefore no longer practical and causes auditing difficulties.  A better and more efficient system of collection is required.</p><p> Regulations to be made under section 27(2) will facilitate the setting up of the system to ensure more cost-effective means of collecting the levy, particularly the animal health levy on live exports.  Currently, moneys due are collected by Department staff on duty at assembly centres and lodged manually to the Department's bank account.  It will be possible to set up an electronic system for collection, which will be more effective and efficient, through regulations under section 27(2).  The &euro;5 million contribution by farmers under the levy system underpins the compensation regime.  In other words, we are modernising the system.  This will make it easier to pay, and one will not have to pay some days in advance.  This is just moving the payment model with the times.</p></speech>

The Government, however, has to ensure that the people appointed have the relevant expertise to carry out proper animal protection.  What safeguards exist to ensure that happens?  What standards will the Minister set for these officers?  It is a new area in Irish legislation.  Where will the officers come from?  That is a particularly pertinent question against the backdrop of austerity measures, the public sector recruitment embargo and the fact that there is no other public sector recruitment.  If new people will not be appointed to fill the new positions then existing employees, maybe in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or other Departments, will be the ones called to be authorised officers, and we have to ask what their expertise is and how it will be safeguarded.  How will the Minister's Department monitor and evaluate achievement of those targets and so on?</p><p><br />  We think it necessary to include in the Act the caveat that there must be due regard to experience and qualifications, because otherwise anybody could be an authorised officer for the purpose of the Act.  What safeguards are there, apart from leaving it to the Department to work out the guidelines of the process, to which we would not be privy?  It would be better if there were an independent body.  In the absence of that, we need a bit more.</p></speech>

They will not be worth the paper on which they are written unless there are qualified inspectors with the necessary expertise to ensure adherence to those regulations and that the codes and standards of practice are being addressed.  There are concerns among some animal welfare groups that even when garda&iacute; go in to a situation people get away with cruelty because the garda&iacute; are not exactly sure of the legal rights.  There have been requests that ISPCA inspectors be considered as authorised officers in non-farm cases.  They have proven themselves.  They have the knowledge and expertise and they act impartially and professionally.  To enforce the greater regulation that the Minister wants and that we all support, there is a need for trained inspectors.  Is there a sufficient register of people who abuse animals and is it kept in a professional way so that these people are known?</p></speech>

It goes without saying that if someone is going to act as an authorised officer, he or she will have to have the knowledge to do the job.  It is important to reassure people by making this explicit rather than implicit in the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-27a.606" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="17:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032700049#WW00200"><p>We are all at the same thing here.  Section 37(1) states: "The Minister may for the purposes of enforcing this Act or an EU measure, appoint in writing, such persons or classes of person as he or she considers appropriate to be authorised officers for the exercise of all or any of the functions conferred on an authorised officer under this Act specified in the appointment."  I do not want to be appointing some officer from the ISPCA, for example, as an authorised officer for certain jobs but then have people asking what are his or her experience and qualifications.  I would then have to define the qualifications in law.  Once one introduces a requirement to preclude certain people from being made authorised officers, then one has to define what it is based on.  What is a qualification in this area?  Some people may have years of experience but few qualifications.  That is why I deliberately left it open, so that a Minister may only appoint someone appropriate to do a specific job.</p><p>  Let us take an example in which Ireland has a significant animal disease outbreak, forcing me to appoint hundreds of authorised officers to get a handle on sectioning off large areas of land and give them powers to act on my behalf for a specific period and reason.  I do not want to be tied down dealing with qualifications and experience.  I will need to be able appoint somebody appropriate for the job quickly.</p><p>  My amendment, No. 33, does not propose to appoint somebody under section 37(3) under a service agreement.  My thinking is that a person with a lot of experience of dealing with cases of animal cruelty and management, particularly in an urban environment, would be useful for our Department.  However, people going onto farms need to have the experience to understand farm practices and so forth.  There was a genuine concern that there would be people entering farms who would pursue animal welfare concerns but without an understanding of farm practices.  My amendment deals with these concerns.  I have also spoken with the animal welfare organisations on this matter, and they are not looking to go onto farms.  They want to be able to do their jobs in partnership with my Department as authorised officers in certain cases, so they can effectively deal with animal cruelty and abuse cases in private homes and urban environments.  They would be a fantastic asset to my Department.  They would also have to deal with cases on public lands.  For example, there have been some horrific horse welfare cases in the past ten days that I have had to deal with in Cork and other parts of Ireland, where horses are starving to death in fields.  In these cases, I would be happy to have the help of authorised officers from various sources who have experience of dealing with animal welfare but who are not necessarily veterinary practitioners or departmental employees.</p><p>  Regarding Deputy Clare Daly's concerns, we will not necessarily have to employ a whole new raft of people.  One can appoint an authorised officer who is currently employed by the Department, a local authority or the ISPCA, for example.  They would not be taken on and paid for this role but would be given extra powers under the law to do their own job more effectively.  This is not about recruitment but about giving the extra powers of an authorised officer to people who are already employed in this area so they can do their jobs more effectively </p><p>  I feel my amendment deals with the concerns raised by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, while amendments Nos. 30 and 34 may actually preclude the persons whom the Deputies wish to see appointed to these positions from being appointed.  Accordingly, I will not be accepting these amendments.</p></speech>

There was another case in Cork recently in which a red fox was tortured and hanged from a bus stop.  These cases show us the vital need for inspectors.  I felt the term &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; was a little bit loose in the legislation.  While I am not suggesting a qualification or a degree is the answer to everything, experience is also vital in this area.  I accept the Minister will take this into account when appointing inspectors but I did feel the term &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; was vague.</p></speech>

We will be screening potential officers to ensure they have the experience.  The last thing we want is to appoint someone with the powers of an authorised officer who means well but does not know what he or she is doing.  This would cause real damage to what we are trying to achieve with the legislation.</p></speech>

There was a genuine concern among the farming community that we would introduce new authorised officers who would not have an understanding of farming.  I have said the authorised officers currently inspecting farms are likely to be the same people who will continue to do it.  The contracts we may enter into with experienced officers working for the ISPCA and other welfare organisations will not involve farms.  The organisations are not looking for access to farms anyway.</p></speech>

We have avoided over-prescribing what qualifications an authorised officer should have.  In the case of disease, it is reasonable to suggest that the power conferred on an authorised officer under <i>subsection (4)(a) </i>and <i>(b) </i>may only be exercised by an inspector of the Minister.  It seems to me that an authorised officer would not be capable of determining whether a disease was present.</p><p><br />  The beginning of section 42 refers to circumstances in which an authorised officer is of the opinion that a contravention of the Act, an EU measure or animal health and welfare regulations may have taken place or may be taking place or where an animal, animal product or animal feed, land or premises is, or may be, affected with disease or a disease agent.  This comes back to the question of how an authorised officer who is not an expert can determine everything about a disease without consulting a veterinary practitioner, particularly if he is not an inspector of the Department.  Therefore, I believe both amendments are realistic and sensible in the context of the Bill.  They ensure that only a person with the competence to make a judgment on disease is authorised to do so and that such a person should have the qualification to make a judgment as well.</p></speech>

We held a discussion on the matter on Committee Stage.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v sought to set up two classes of authorised officer.  The first was an officer of the Minister, who, I understood at the time, was to be a veterinary surgeon or somehow more qualified than a person who was simply an authorised officer under the provisions we are discussing.  I took the view that it was unnecessary to have two classes of inspector and that authorised officers should simply be authorised officers.  That is why I do not propose to accept amendment No. 36.</p><p>  Amendment No. 38 relates to the animal health and welfare notice, a concept we are introducing in the Bill whereby an authorised officer can give what is essentially a yellow card to someone.  I believe this is a good concept, as it gives an option to an authorised officer to give a welfare notice to someone who may be compromising welfare without having to go to court.  To make a distinction between inspectors of the Minister and authorised officers confuses the situation.  The important points about the issuing of welfare notices are that the person must engage in consultation before he does so and that there are systems to ensure that notices are given out only in appropriate circumstances.

There was a concern among farming organisations in particular, reflected in the commentary by some of the Deputies opposite on Committee Stage, that giving the power to authorised officers to impose on-the-spot fines would mean that farmers would be hit with fines from people seeking to use that power in an overly eager manner.  We have made some changes which reflect the views and concerns expressed on Committee Stage and I hope this will allay people's concerns.</p></speech>

This measure provides that an authorised officer who clearly sees that there is something wrong in the context of compromising animal welfare cannot, as initially proposed, simply slap a fine of &euro;250 on the farmer concerned.  The officer must go to the local authority or back to base and report the fact and then get a second opinion before imposing the fine.  In other words, this will prevent situations where there is an impulsive or power happy imposition of a fine on farmers or anybody else.  That was the concern expressed.  Now the officer will have to go back and get a second opinion that on the basis of a report there is a need to serve a notice.  That must happen quickly.  The point is that a notice will not just be about imposing a fine, but it will also give a direction to correct the problem.  It is a short, sharp response to a relatively insignificant breach of animal welfare regulations.  It allows a farmer or whoever is involved to receive a rap over the knuckles, pay a fine and fix the problem.  If the person concerned does not fix the problem, court proceedings may be taken.  This measure will keep people out of court and allow them to address what may have been a mistake of which they were not aware.  This is a way of dealing with the issue without having to go to court.  Where possible, we should be trying to keep people out of court for minor breaches of the rules.  That is what this is about.</p></speech>

This is an important piece of future-proofing.  With complex systems involving animal tracing, keeping paper copies of everything is costly and inefficient.

Given what we are planning to do in the context of the microchipping of dogs and horses and the management of horse passports and all of the systems this will involve which will require a software programme, it is evident that we should move away from paper records, if possible.</p></speech>

Durkan was in the Chair and we did not have an opportunity to speak to amendment No. 14.  We would have liked to have been able to draw attention to the cruelty of the digging-out aspect of wild animals going to ground involving the use of ferrets to the culling of badgers and the use of horrific which leaves them waiting to be shot and their young to starve.  We discussed this issue on Committee Stage and I understand the Minister is looking at the vaccination programme.  The amendment also concerned the use of animals in circus performances, an issue on which Deputy Clare Daly worked as a councillor.  It is welcome that Fingal County Council has banned the use of wild animals in circuses.  I say this in order that the animal welfare groups which had expected us to speak on these issues will understand we did not have that opportunity.</p><p><br />  I acknowledge the funding given to the rescue centres.  We understand that, with the current financial constraints, there is increasing pressure on these centres owing to the number of animals being neglected not to count animals being treated cruelly.  There is pressure on them also as a result of the position on both domestic and feral cats.  In the domestic setting there are many unwanted kittens and cats that are left to roam.  As a result, they breed rapidly as they are not monitored.  Feral cats present an increasing problem in many communities.  In this context, I have a concern about pest control companies.  I have received calls from people because such companies have come and taken cats on the assumption that they are feral cats.  They are not animal welfare organisations, not trained in animal welfare and not monitored or inspected.  They are business entities.  I am following up on this issue in respect of certain supermarket chains which are bringing in such companies to get rid of cats roaming around their stores.  Many of these cats have owners, but they are being seen as feral and their owners end up losing much loved pets that have been part of the family for a long time.  The Minister spoke about the microchipping of dogs.  I suggest we also look at the microchipping of cats.</p><p><br />  There are examples of good international practice in this regard.  In Rome, for example, there was a successful 15 year programme to trap, neuter and return cats.  Under a similar programme in Washington, the city's feral cat population decreased by 90%.  Many individuals and companies are doing their best to facilitate the capture of feral cats in order that they can be neutered and returned.  I would like to mention a constituency not too far from that of the Minister.  Recently a major operation took place on Cape Clear Island which was almost overrun by feral cats.  Welfare officers trapped the cats and took them away to be neutered.  They were then returned to the island.  The Minister should give serious consideration to the trapping, neutering and return policy and it would be cost effective.  He should also deal with concerns about pest control companies.</p></speech>

This is a quality of life and welfare rather than a pest issue.  In that sense, the role of pest companies is not essential.  If we are to deal with the issue properly, feral cats should be included in some form in the legislation.  We are talking about a population of approximately 1 million such cats in the country.  This obviously puts enormous pressure on rescue centres to take in unwanted kittens or cats.  The State funding provided is not adequate to keep up with demand.  The majority of these cats remain unneutered and breed rapidly.  If we are to deal with this issue properly, we must develop a trapping, neutering and return programme.  This is essential if we are to deal with the issue humanely.  There should be a national campaign to ensure these cats are brought to vets to undergo a health check, be treated for parasites, neutered, microchipped and returned to the wild, with some form of identification to provide clarity that the procedure has been carried out.  This could be done in conjunction with a programme covering domestic cat owners.  Otherwise, we will have a situation where hundreds of thousands of feral kittens will be born every year, many of which will die before they are one month old.  We should be moving in the direction of neutering.  The issue is of huge concern to animal owners and we need to include provisions in the Bill to deal with it, rather than highlight the categories in the section.</p><p>Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant. Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs. There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme. However, Social Welfare legislation provides for the payment of a rent supplement payment to a nominated payee such a landlord on behalf of the tenant.  This arrangement is entered at the tenant&rsquo;s request and subject to the consent of the Department. The department official dealing with the request will take into account all the relevant circumstances of the particular case and the tenant&rsquo;s preference will be accommodated where possible. </p><p>  Within the timeframe available, I have not been able to ascertain whether any Court decisions have imposed a civil liability on this Department for loss or damage arising from tenancy contracts as a result of rent supplement issues or whether any associated legal advice has been received.  The Department will advise the Deputy further on the matter in due course.  </p><p>  It is open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the Department any instance where they suspect that a tenant is receiving rent supplement and is not paying their rent. Where the Department becomes aware that a person is not using rent supplement to meet the accommodation costs, payment of the supplement is suspended and the matter investigated. Where a landlord has a grievance in relation to the non-payment of rent by a tenant, s/he may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board to have the dispute resolved through the Board&rsquo;s dispute resolution process. </p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s circulars regarding rent supplement do not place any legal obligation in relation to decisions on the payment of rent supplement but are designed to provide guidance to departmental staff in the exercise of their powers having regard to the requirements of the legislation.</p></speech>

We have increased the funding given to animal welfare organisations despite all the pressures of the last two budgets.  I hope to continue to do that.  We have a code of conduct for all welfare organisations.  They have to apply that code, which includes neutering and rehousing programmes, in order to get funding.  We are supporting the track, neuter and return programme for feral cats.  We are doing a great deal in this area.  We are considering whether to itemise feral cats specifically in legislation even though we have not done that in other areas.  There is a difference between a cat that is essentially wild and a protected cat that has an owner to whom we can attach responsibility.  We need to deal with the issue of animals that are essentially wild through the track, neuter and return programme because it is not easy to do so in legislation.</p></speech>

&#8212; that almost one in four family home mortgages and more than one in three buy-to-let mortgages are now either in arrears or have been restructured;

&#8212; the slow progress made to date by banks in identifying and implementing solutions for distressed borrowers;

&#8212; the additional burden being placed on families struggling with their mortgage arising from cuts to child benefit, PRSI increases, local property tax and other measures in budget 2013;

&#8212; the adverse impact on mental health, the well-being of society and the domestic economy arising from the failure to adequately address mortgage distress;

&#8212; the widespread concern about the threat of a significant increase in family home repossessions arising from the mortgage arrears resolution targets programme, the proposed changes to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the Government&#8217;s plan to reverse the Dunne judgment; and

&#8212; that, in effect, the bank will retain a veto, in the vast majority of cases, over any proposal to restructure the mortgage under the planned new personal insolvency service;recognises:&#8212; the importance of tackling the mortgage arrears crisis to support economic recovery; and

&#8212; the best interests of society are served by ensuring that families can remain in their homes so long as reasonable efforts are made to meet their mortgage commitments;calls for:

&#8212; the establishment of clear, consistently applied guidelines in respect of reasonable living expenses for distressed borrowers;

&#8212; the family home to be protected from repossession unless every other possible alternative has been exhausted, including giving the borrower the option of entering a mortgage-to-rent arrangement;

&#8212; the Government to refrain from introducing legislation that will remove obstacles to the repossession of family homes until such time as the Central Bank is satisfied that the banks are properly addressing the mortgage arrears crisis by entering into meaningful long-term sustainable solutions to mortgage distress with individual borrowers;

&#8212; the setting up of a mortgage resolution office, under the new Insolvency Service of Ireland, to arbitrate between borrowers and lenders and, where necessary, to make a binding mortgage resolution order; and

&#8212; greater emphasis on the implementation of long-term sustainable mortgage solutions such as split mortgages, shared equity and permanent interest rate reductions.</p></speech>

notes the speedy publication by the Government of comprehensive legislation to reform our insolvency laws and the enactment of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 which provides for non-judicial debt resolution mechanisms, which include a Personal Insolvency Arrangement which will facilitate the retention of their family home by individuals who are insolvent and enable them to resolve debt issues by agreement with creditors with the assistance of a Personal Insolvency Practitioner;

recognises that Central Bank interaction with mortgage lenders is key to addressing mortgage arrears and that the Central Bank is now further intensifying its engagement with the main mortgage lenders to ensure that lenders offer sustainable solutions to their customers in arrears;

supports the Central Bank in this work, in particular, in setting specific targets for action and in monitoring and auditing the achievement of those targets;

further notes the Central Bank&#8217;s review of the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears to strengthen protections for customers and also allow to provide for effective, timely and sustainable resolution of individual arrears situations;

accepts that, for a functioning mortgage market, it is necessary to protect and vindicate, in a fair manner, the legitimate rights of both debtors and creditors;

while accepting that the option of repossession has to be one of the options to deal with mortgage default and distress, also notes the view of Government that this should only be an option of last resort and that there are a range of other resolution options available that can be deployed to deal with mortgage distress in the best interests of both the borrower and lender;

encourages the Government and other authorities to continue with the work to bring the Insolvency Service of Ireland, and the debt resolution processes provided for in the Personal Insolvency Act 2012, into operation as soon as possible;

notes that the Insolvency Service of Ireland will shortly publish guidelines on reasonable living expenses for debtors who propose to enter into debt resolution mechanisms; and

condemns the failure of the previous Government to publish or enact any legislation to reform bankruptcy and insolvency law, and its failure to create any statutory debt resolution mechanisms or structures to facilitate individuals in financial difficulty to resolve such difficulties by agreement with creditors and to facilitate the restructuring of mortgage debt.&quot;- (Minister for Justice and Equality).</p></speech>

It states:<blockquote>Family is important for it is the bedrock upon which society is built.  The family home is the physical aspect of family... The home is recognition that we are not just economic entities measured on some stock exchange... Those young families who purchased properties between 2003 and 2008 bear the brunt of the economic collapse.</blockquote>The document refers to &quot;working parents whose principal desire is to pay their way and raise their families&quot;.  I have come across many such cases.  The paper says &quot;we have a simple choice to make&quot; regarding whether we are &quot;on the side of the family&quot; or &quot;on the side of international finance&quot;.  New Beginning's argument is that &quot;whichever way we look at this, it must mean debt write-down&quot;, at least for some of those who are in this terrible trap.  It continues:<blockquote>The banks will demand as much as possible.  The grim reality is that the banks will now be devoted to debt collection and teams of people will be incentivised to recover as much as possible [even] when the victims are so vulnerable .... At New Beginning we believe that a sustainable mortgage is based upon a payment constituting about one-third of a borrower's post-tax income.  Thus, if a borrower has a post-tax income of &#8364;3,000 per month, [it is sustainable to] pay &#8364;1,000 per month towards their mortgage.  Paying more has two negative effects: firstly it deprives the borrower of funds needed to live and prosper and secondly [and just as importantly] it deprives the economy of families' spending power.</blockquote>I believe the proposed threshold of approximately 35% is a necessity, although obviously people earning very large amounts of money can afford to pay more.  New Beginning refers to the &quot;real case of a young Dublin couple with three children&quot;.  It explains:<blockquote>They own a house worth &#8364;250,000 and have a debt of &#8364;450,000.  Their income has been severely reduced.  The man lost his job and is now doing freelance work.  Based on 35 per cent of their net disposable income they [can sustain a spilt] mortgage of &#8364;300,000 &#8211; which is &#8364;50,000 more than the house is worth.</blockquote>They put that scenario to Bank of Ireland, but according to New Beginning its &quot;best proposal is that the term of the mortgage be increased by nine years to 29 years; the borrowers will pay over 45 per cent of their net income&quot;, with the matter to be reviewed after six months.  That is not a solution for that kind of situation.  As the document states:<blockquote>There will be no incentive for this family to improve their lot because any improvement goes to the bank and no matter how much they pay they will never pay off this loan.  The family will not spend and they will be deprived.  The lack of spending will deprive the economy.</blockquote>There is a lose-lose in this situation.  We should be listening to people who are at the coal face as they try to deal with this issue.  The New Beginning document from which I have quoted makes some very good points about the results the current approach will have for families and for society.</p></speech>

There should be no mistake about the fact that many people are suffering and need solutions.  They are sick to the teeth of listening to all the talk in the D&aacute;il in recent months.  A number of options are set out in the motion before the House.  Regardless of our politics, we should all support any scheme or plan that offers a sensible solution to the current mortgage crisis.  This is particularly important at a time when over 95,000 residential mortgages are in arrears of more then 90 days.  We have all noted the slow progress that has been made to date by the banks in identifying and implementing solutions for distressed borrowers.  We are aware that budget 2013 measures have placed an additional burden on families who are struggling with their mortgages.  I refer to the cuts in child benefit, the PRSI increases and the introduction of the local property tax, etc.  I emphasise that I voted against the property tax because it is outrageous to impose a tax on the family home and thereby penalise people who are already under enough pressure.  The Government's failure to address mortgage distress in an adequate manner is having an adverse impact on mental health, the well-being of society and the domestic economy.  There is widespread concern about the threatened significant increase in family home repossessions as a result of the mortgage arrears resolution targets programme, the proposed changes to the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the Government's plan to reverse the Dunne judgment.  In effect, the banks will retain a veto in the vast majority of cases in which it is proposed to restructure mortgages under the planned new personal insolvency service.  I strongly support the proposal to establish a mortgage resolution office, under the new Insolvency Service of Ireland.  The office will arbitrate between borrowers and lenders and, where necessary, make binding resolution orders.  I call on all Members of the House to support the motion.  We need to support families suffering with mortgage arrears.  It is a total disgrace that they will be asked to pay the new home tax in the next few weeks.  It will heap more misery on the people of this country.</p></speech>

It is worth comparing the outcomes of the crisis in this country and the crisis in Cyprus.  Ordinary people in Cyprus have gone out to fight against the troika's disgraceful plans to raid their savings.  They have forced the troika and the Cypriot Government to accept that bondholders should be burned and that people below a certain level should not be touched.  This is in sharp contrast with what is happening in this country.  Our Government's only red line seems to be the protection of bondholders and the very rich.  It has chosen to unload all of the cost, the pressure and the suffering onto the shoulders of ordinary people.  I refer to the introduction of property taxes, for example.  In the area we are discussing, the Government is giving the banks the right to harass and intimidate mortgage holders who are in distress almost entirely through no fault of their own.  They are distressed because of the reckless behaviour of the banks, particularly between 2000 and 2008 approximately.  There seems to be no recognition in the Government's attitude to this issue that the primary blame lies with the banks.  It does not accept that the banks should take the hit for the property bubble and for the massive debts that are around the necks of distressed mortgage holders.  As a result, some 180,000 families are suffering immensely and our economy is being suffocated.  It is utterly outrageous that the Minister is talking about taking people's second cars from them, telling them they cannot go on holidays and policing what they can spend money on.  It is indicative of the utter failure of the Government to address the real issue, which is the suffering that ordinary people are enduring.  I have to say Fianna F&aacute;il's motion does not go half far enough in countering this.  It is still leaving the door open to the repossession of family homes and the policing of people's spending.</p><p>There is a simple answer to this.  First, there should be a write down of these mortgages to current market levels, where they should be, and, second, the repayments people are asked to pay should be no more than 30% or 35% of their income.  That is it.  There should be no further questions about how they spend their money or on what they spend it.  That is outrageous.</p></speech>

The opposition to the Government's supposed solution on mortgage arrears has been somewhat meek and mild.  It is an appalling solution.  Disguised in it is the discussion that comes out all the time about the Dunne judgment.  The Dunne judgment saved the houses of many people who would otherwise have had their houses repossessed.  Part of the Government's solution, which is not put up front, is to give back to the banks the right to repossession.  I do not accept any Minister's statement here that this will be the last resort.  Once the banks have it back, that is the power they hold at the back of every single settlement proposed under the new mortgage arrears procedures.  It is not the last solution; it is actually the first one, because it is the first threat.  It may be hidden and not specifically spelled out in each case, but it is there.  The floodgates will be opened to repossession in the next few months.  I gather from the Minister's reply here last week that the repossession Bill - that is what it will be, whatever it is called - will be introduced before the summer.  We can predict with great confidence and great fear that repossessions will be back in spades by Christmas.  That is not a solution to the mortgage problem.</p><p>  The other issue that is not recognised is that the banks' books completely and utterly underestimate this problem.  The banks will be recapitalised - wait and see.  They will have to be recapitalised because the under-provisions are so large they will have to allow for more bad debts.  The question then is: from where will this money come?  There are only two sources of money for recapitalisation.  One is the taxpayers, who have not got any left, and the other is the ESM, which says it will not give it anyway.  What will be the solution?  We are heading towards a disaster, the cracks of which we are trying to paper over by introducing what we call &quot;single individual cases being considered on their merits&quot;.  That is to extend and pretend.  This is an accident waiting to happen on the same-type scale as the last bank crisis.</p></speech>

Saying on the floor of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann that repossessions will be back in spades before Christmas is reckless.  People are under enough pressure without that sort of emotive scaremongering.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Justice and Equality and many others, including Professor Patrick Honohan and the banks themselves, have all said the very last resort will be repossessions.  I urge that speakers bear in mind the enormous pressure people are under.</p><p>  We have to acknowledge the reason we are here this evening is the economic destruction that has fallen over the country.  Even by Fianna F&aacute;il standards of cynicism, this is truly remarkable.  An hour and a quarter before polls close in Meath, we can now say that this was an extremely cynical attempt to link a Seanad candidate to a by-election and recreate him as some sort of a property owners guru to try to secure a victory in that by-election.  It will be seen for the cynical attempt it is.</p><p>  House prices in this country were artificially promoted by those in Fianna F&aacute;il.  Their cosy relationship with developers, their belief that house prices would only go up, and how they convinced the country of that, not to mention the obliteration of 250,000 jobs, are the reasons all of us are here now trying to sort out this problem.  This legislation includes a measure to create an independent body which exists nowhere else in the world.  I know Deputy McGrath might say we should be the first country in the world to have it-----</p></speech>

It also would be another incidence of Fianna F&aacute;il setting up another quango and employing more people, not to mention the legislative delays that would be incurred.</p><p>  The Central Bank is the independent authority.  It will be able to monitor the progression of the banks through the 20%, 30% and 50% of cases where they must offer sustainable solutions by the end of the year and the 100% of cases where they must offer sustainable solutions by the end of 2014.  Most, if not all, of the measures that are suggested in this Bill, such as mortgage-to-lease, split mortgages and interest-only arrangements, are already included as part of what will make up the sustainable measures.  If people are not happy, they have the personal insolvency legislation.</p><p>  The Government has to be commended for doing  a great deal to help in an extremely difficult situation, but Fianna F&aacute;il should use the opportunity here tonight to apologise, not for not taking all of these measures, but for not taking any of them, particularly in the past four or five years of its term in office, when it stood on its hands and did nothing to stop this.  Now, Fianna F&aacute;il Members come in here, after the Government has brought in its legislation, plagiarise the whole thing and pretend they are some sort of heroes, which they clearly are not.</p></speech>

I do not believe anybody in this country is not aware of the huge mortgage arrears crisis that besets us all.  It feeds into the difficulties that people have with public sector pay and the negotiations on public sector pay.  The great majority of people in Ireland recognise there was a bubble which has simply burst and that what went before the bubble burst is no longer sustainable.  People are quite happy, or if that is an exaggeration, people are willing to accept a reduction in their pay but for the fact they borrowed on the back of that pay, and they simply cannot now afford to pay a mortgage they took out in good faith.  There are ordinary public sector workers - nurses, garda&iacute; and teachers - right across this country who did not take out just one mortgage that they cannot pay but, in some instances, they took out two.</p><p>  This Government is very clear about this.  The last Government could not but have been clear about it either because, although the rate of mortgages which are now in arrears could be almost 20% at this stage, almost half of those mortgages were in arrears at the time of the last election, yet nothing was done.</p><p>  I am not exactly happy with the pace at which this Government has dealt with this issue, but it has dealt with the issue.  The personal insolvency service is about to open its doors and deal with the reality that besets ordinary people in this economy.  On that basis, I find the timing of this motion somewhat strange.  I wonder if it is more to do with electoral cycles than mortgage arrears.  What has changed now from one month ago?  The only thing that has changed is that the personal insolvency service is about to commence.  I greatly welcome that and believe everybody, especially those who are beset by mortgages they cannot pay, would welcome that.  While I sincerely hope it is not the case, I wonder whether this motion is motivated by a fear that the personal insolvency service might just work and that this country's progress can continue under a different Government to that which, while it did not cause the problem, certainly allowed this problem to fester to the extent it has.</p></speech>

This pressure was put upon us not through our own doing but by poor political leadership and poor regulation.  It is not just Fianna F&aacute;il and the previous Government that are responsible for this.  Other factors must be addressed as well.  However, I find this goes beyond what is normally accepted as throwing the pie back in the direction it came from.  According to Stephen Kinsella's five-year review of the financial collapse, August 2007 was the month in which the growth of the world economy began to falter and fail exposing the weakness of Ireland's banks, bursting the construction bubble, hammering the State's finances, escalating unemployment and bad debt levels and undoing a generation's worth of economic growth and development in a country that was just starting to leave the bad days of the 1980s behind.  He then refers to the role of the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government which was ably assisted by the Green Party and, prior to that, the Progressive Democrats and many cheerleading Independents, some of whom are still in the House.  The Government changed the composition of its taxation revenue, reducing income taxes and relying more heavily on property-based taxes exposing the State's coffers to a significant downside risk when the property market went down.  The banking regulator was off somewhere playing golf.  The media, which was making money from property supplements, stayed silent and was not knowledgeable.  The same was true of most economists who were not being paid by the banks to cheerlead the boom.</p><p>  There is an over-supply of shocking statistics to emphasise how unstable this situation was.  I will give two examples.  At the end of 2008, the total stock of foreign borrowing by Irish banks was around &euro;110 billion.  In 2004, Ireland's banks had only borrowed more than &euro;15 billion from abroad.  At that time, we were probably heading towards the abyss of the bubble but, at the same time, we had a diligent and prudent economy without reckless lending.  At the end of 2007, Irish banks were lending 40% more to property developers alone than they had to the entire Irish population a mere seven years earlier.</p><p>  This must be tackled.  The Government, in particular the Cabinet, would be from a different generation compared to those of us who will speak so passionately about this tonight.  The single biggest act in which we will engage during our tenure will be getting this generation out of negative equity.  I agree with a great deal of what Fianna F&aacute;il says here.  Unfortunately, I do not agree with the fourth point in the motion where it says that the local property tax and other measures in Budget 2013 are not appropriate because it put it here.  It said it had to be put in place.  Let us not kid anybody.  One can kid people a few times but this is far too serious a matter for someone to say that somebody else is responsible for it.  Between 160,000 and 200,000 families will be taken out of negative equity and an overburdened position where they are paying off more than a fair share of their disposable or net income.</p><p>  We now have four vehicles that will allow the State to deal with this.  If we do it in a prudent manner, in two years' time, nobody should be pressurised into a position of financial distress because they bought a family home.  I welcome this significant development.  I have two major passions while I am in this Government for as long as it lasts - the creation of jobs and, more importantly, sustainable mortgages.  This Government and I will do everything we can to ensure that what the previous Government did will be undone and that we are put into a better position.  I thank Fianna F&aacute;il for raising this motion.</p></speech>

We will not be like the Green Party and Fianna F&aacute;il and we will not flake on the Irish people.  If I was to arrive in this Chamber from another planet and read Deputy Michael McGrath's motion, I would have said "fair play" because everything to which he aspires is what the Government is doing and everything he writes down is what we are all trying to achieve.  Then I suddenly remembered that I am living in Ireland where the Deputy's party created a bubble for 14 years and the party is over.  The carnival is gone and the Irish people are left with the legacy of its reckless behaviour.  Rather than debating a Private Members' motion here, we should be before a tribunal with the 14 or 15 members of the previous Government before it justifying their actions because they behaved irresponsibly on behalf of the Irish people.  They betrayed the trust of the people and have the audacity to come in here and chastise the Government which inherited a mess, acknowledges the difficulties people face and is trying to get us back to sovereignty.  I appreciate Deputy Michael McGrath's motivation because he is a decent person but the party he represents is not.  Its policies have made our country the way it is and the people must never be allowed to forget that.</p><p>  In saying that, some of the speakers opposite who are not in the Chamber are pursuing an agenda that would have got our country into even more trouble and are still cheerleading via the column inches of certain newspapers which do not deserve to be mentioned in this House.  What we need to do is to make sure that the family home is never repossessed and taken away and that we preserve and protect that family home for decent men and women.</p></speech>

It is about making sure we have people living in their own homes and that banks behave responsibly and work with and not become disengaged from ordinary people who, in the majority of cases, are trying to make an honourable settlement in the realignment of their mortgages.  We all accept it is difficult.</p><p>  We cannot scapegoat the ordinary person regarding mortgages.  We must make sure that they are worked with and that the banks fulfil the obligations they have as outlined by Government.  We have seen the targets set by the Government.  Let us give them a chance to work.  I see people in my office every week, be they from small or medium-sized enterprises or family homeowners trying not just to salvage their family homes but to preserve and protect their family life as well.

Based on my experience as a young mother in the early 1980s, I remember all too well how difficult it was when my husband lost his job and we were left with a huge mortgage and young children.  I remember the turmoil, sleepless nights and the worry that tomorrow, we might not be able to pay next month's mortgage repayment and stay in our home.</p><p>  The statistics are alarming.  A total of 94,500 mortgages from private dwellings are in arrears for over 90 days, while 23,500 mortgages are in arrears for over 720 days.  The Government is well aware of current events.  It is not a laughing matter.  It involves people's lives and homes.  A home is not just bricks and mortar.  It is what happens inside those walls that matters.  This is a very stressful time for many young people and many people who have lost their jobs.  We should not use it in this Chamber to badger each other.  We should use it to solve the problems out there.</p><p>  Perhaps the Minister might take the following matter into consideration.  All of the banks have a responsibility to customers and must engage with borrowers right from the start.  They cannot bring them in and make fools of them.  Mortgage holders cannot deal with any further mortgage interest rates or distress.  It is difficult enough for them to pay what they can at the moment.  I am very concerned that people struggling to make their payments who want to switch to interest-only mortgages are being financially penalised by their banks.  A total of 37% of the restructuring accounts are on interest-only arrangements.  A young man rang me today to tell me he had incurred a charge of &euro;700 through switching to an interest-only mortgage and deferring his payments for three months due to financial difficulties.  The bank called it a credit cost increase.  I have not heard of this but then I am not a financial wizard like some people in here.  If that is true, certain banks are able to put even more pressure on people.  These are banks that are supposed to be sitting down with people and trying to sort out and help them through their difficulties.  The banks should not forget that they were helped out of the mess they were in.</p><p>They should not now turn on those ordinary borrowers, the small borrowers and the young people - not the big sharks - who bought into an outrageous market.  The banks are charging those people &euro;700 to switch to an interest-only mortgage deferred over three months and are calling it a credit cost increase.  I find this very difficult to understand and I ask the Minister of State to address that point.</p></speech>

The statistics show that 94,500 private home mortgage accounts are in arrears of more than 90 days, with 23,500 in arrears of more than 720 days.  These statistics are very sobering, recording as they do the nightmare situation facing families.  Most of these purchasers started out with dreams and hopes spawned in a Celtic tiger era.  People bought their homes in good faith.  They intended to pay for them.  Unfortunately, many people lost their jobs and they are unable to pay a mortgage nor can they sell the property.  The mortgage would still be in place even if the property could be sold.  They do not know where to turn.</p><p>  The situation is complicated and overwhelming in many cases.  The scale and the legal implications mean there is no overnight solution.  The mortgage is a debt to be paid yet the taxpayers bailed out the banks.  There needs to be a finely calibrated response to mortgage debt because each person's circumstances are different as is a person's ability to pay.  In some cases there is no ability to pay.  I agree with Deputy Buttimer's point about the family home.  I refer to innovative approaches such as trade-down mortgages, split mortgages, mortgage-to-rent schemes.</p><p>  The attitude to home ownership has not changed despite the economic crash; we like to own our own homes.  In my view there is serious merit in allowing people to have 50-year loans.  Most loans are between 20 and 30 years.  People want to be able to hold on to their homes and to repay the mortgage at an affordable rate.  This was done in the case of the promissory notes.  The home may well be inherited by the following generation and this is already happening.  I suggest that this may be a solution to allow people to hold onto their homes.</p></speech>

The figures are stark, but the stories behind the statistics are even starker.  The Government has acknowledged that this is one of the most serious social and economic problems.  It has taken determined action to ensure that those most in need of support are supported in a proper and timely manner.</p><p>  Thankfully, the number of new families in mortgage arrears is falling, but there remains a significant number of mortgages, over 94,500 for private dwellings alone, that are over three months in arrears.  The targets have been set out by the Government to tackle this crisis.  For example, by the end of June of this year, the banks should have proposed sustainable solutions for 20% of distressed borrowers, rising to 30% by the end of September and 50% by the end of the year.</p><p>  Much has been made of the dangers of moral hazard.  We are not looking for a write-off of debt that can be paid, but where a mortgage is in distress and there is not enough money to meet the mortgage then the bank must pull out all the stops to reach a workable arrangement for that family.  For too long the talk has been about the distressed mortgages and the pressure of these on the banks.  The focus must be and must remain on the distressed mortgage-holders and the families involved, in cases where what was once an ambitious mortgage is now sucking the economic lifeblood from a family.</p><p>  It is not just families that have been affected.  Our towns and villages are suffering from a severe case of economic inactivity as all of the available spending in the local area is sucked into faceless banks to pay interest on vast sums borrowed during the boom.  If we are to ensure that the banks deal properly and fairly with these distressed families, then funding is not the sole issue to be discussed.  We must not focus on providing a carrot for the banks but rather a stick in terms of bank oversight and heavy repercussions for banks who fail to meet the targets set out to reach sustainable solutions for families in real distress.</p><p>  The Taoiseach and Ministers must set out a clear plan of how banks will be dealt with in the event that they do not live up to these targets.  I welcome the fact that the Central Bank is to set demanding quarterly targets for the conclusion of sustainable solutions.  People want to see firm action, especially as the Government has in recent years provided the wherewithal to ensure the very survival of these banks.</p><p>  I refer to the issue of remuneration for bank personnel.  People are sick listening to the defunct argument that in order to get the top people, we must pay wages that compare well internationally.  For decades, Irish bankers have been earning top wages at a time when the banks they were overseeing were teetering on the brink of total collapse.  The money paid to top bankers during the boom was wasted.  In my view, banks that have been bailed out by the Government, whether to a large or small extent, especially in cases where they continue to lose billions annually, must show restraint in terms of wage levels at the top of the tree.  The danger is that the public perception becomes tainted to believe that bank personnel are paid too much.  The vast majority of ordinary bank workers have been through a torrid time in recent years, unsure of the future of their jobs, facing irate customers on a daily basis, dealing with people in huge financial difficulty, while also dealing with their own financial reality of reduced wages and increased costs.  </p><p>I support the Government's counter-motion and look forward to thousands of ordinary families reaching workable solutions with the banks in the remaining months of this year.</p></speech>

I wish to deal with an issue associated with mortgage distress which is the personal and family difficulties experienced by people.  One the factors causing psychological distress is the fear of losing one's home or the actual loss of a home.  The attachment to owning a home is ingrained in Irish people; it is in our genes.  I refer to the great quote from Parnell, "Keep a firm grip on your homestead".  The fear of a loss of the home has a significant impact on psychological well-being.  The loss of a home is often accompanied by the loss of employment with attendant severe psychological effects.  The three most common questions asked on meeting a person are, "Who are you?", "Where are you from?" and "What do you do?"  Loss of a home causes loss of self-esteem and self-worth especially in cases where a person is also unemployed.  It especially affects vulnerable people who have lost their job and are in danger of losing their home because of difficulties with paying the mortgage.  This creates stress in the home and has an effect on relationships, leading to their breakdown.  It can also lead to a stressed person abusing alcohol and drugs in an attempt to relieve the distress.  In many cases the compounding factors can lead to serious depression and other mental health issues.  There has been an increase of 24% in suicide rates as a result of the recession and other factors.</p><p>  The banks should recognise these outcomes in their discussions with very vulnerable people.  Some banks have trained and informed their staff on how to deal with customers and to be aware of the psychological difficulties they are experiencing.  However, more investment is needed in training banking personnel to understand the psychological distress being experienced by those with mortgage difficulties who are in danger of losing their homes and the consequences that might ensue as a result of their situation.</p></speech>

The latest figures underline the need for the Government to fulfil its pledge to deal with the mortgage arrears crisis.  The figures published almost three weeks ago show that approximately 186,000 family home mortgages, with a total mortgage value of more than &#8364;30 billion, are in some form of distress.  The crisis has had a serious impact on the daily lives of people who are not able to pay their mortgages.  In the last quarter, an additional 6,500 families have fallen into some form of mortgage distress.  The level of arrears represents a crisis and requires a decisive policy response from the Government.</p><p><br />  Deputy Michael McGrath stated that 40 split-mortgage arrangements had been implemented in the last quarter, bringing the total to 52.  Splitting mortgages must be central to the effort to resolve the crisis.  I would like to see the banks accelerate the roll-out of this option for eligible mortgage holders.  Deputy Michael McGrath proposed affording the mortgage resolution office a number of options which could be included in a mortgage resolution order.  These include the option of a split mortgage, whereby part of a loan is parked for up to ten years.  He also proposed interest-only payments for up to four years, extension of the period of a mortgage by up to 20 years, a repayment holiday for up to 12 months and participation in a deferred-interest scheme.  Deputy McGrath proposed that in the event of voluntary surrenders, financial institutions should lease family homes to borrowers at market rents.</p><p><br />  I quote from an article in the <i>The Connacht Tribune</i> on the 8,500 home owners across Galway who are in mortgage arrears or have restructured home loans and who face the prospect of leaving a legacy of debt and even repossession.  It is certainly very serious when it is revealed that additional debts incurred through default on mortgage payments or the restructuring of loans are not covered by mortgage protection life cover.  The article states:<blockquote>One of the country&#8217;s biggest life assurance companies has issued a warning that while life cover always 'cleared' the balance of a mortgage in the event of a death, average debts of up to &#8364;27,000 could be left behind after the policy pays out, which could ultimately lead to a repossession.  Central Bank figures published this week show that the number of problem mortgages in Ireland grew sharply in the last three months of 2011, putting further pressure on its banks and highlighting the challenges the government faces in reviving the moribund domestic economy.  Nearly one in seven Irish home loans are not being fully repaid and repayment is getting more difficult as unemployment remains stubbornly high and house prices continue to fall, according to the Central Bank findings.  Some 70,911 private residential mortgages &#8211; out of a total 768,917 in Ireland - had lapsed into arrears of 90 days or more by the end of last year, the latest figures confirm.</blockquote>  It is important to set out clear guidelines on what the word &quot;sustainable&quot; actually means.  Currently, banks have vastly different interpretations of what constitutes reasonable living expenses.  It is ludicrous to suggest the insolvency service should micromanage family finances, particularly if it means telling families that one parent cannot work outside the family home.  The Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice has undertaken excellent work on minimum income standards and set out the actual cost of living.  This work should be relied on to inform the debate fully as to what arrangements should be put in place for distressed borrowers.</p><p><br />  The Mortgage Resolution Bill offers practical and urgent assistance to those in mortgage difficulty.  This is the time for action, which is what people want.  We do not want banks retaining a veto over any proposal to restructure a mortgage.  The best solution is to ensure that families can remain in their homes as long as reasonable efforts are made to meet mortgage commitments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-27a.680" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="18:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032700056#DDD00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this important issue.  I compliment my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, on this motion.  Others, particularly Labour Party members, have raised questions about why the issue should be raised at this time.  Our party has raised the issue consistently in recognition of the very serious numbers of people who find themselves in mortgage arrears and under enormous pressure on a daily basis because they are in debt to financial institutions.  The motion should not be a surprise to anybody and it should not be construed as somehow tied up with the by-election that is taking place.  If someone in the Labour Party feels a discussion in the House tonight will improve or worsen the chances of a candidate, he or she will have a bigger surprise on seeing the level of support for the Labour Party tomorrow.  That is an issue for another day.</p><p>  It would be populist to come in here to have a go at the banks and blame financial institutions for the entirety of the crisis in which we find ourselves.  I am not going to do that.  I am aware, as are others, that there have been significant personnel changes at board and senior management level in the banks.  There is a group of people within the financial institutions now who are committed to finding a resolution to the problem.  Notwithstanding that, there is considerable inertia about resolving the crisis.  That is not surprising given the fiduciary duties of executives and board members, whose responsibility is to get the greatest return for shareholders.  The taxpayer is the only shareholder in one bank and the part-owner of another.  In one of the other institutions, the State has a considerable amount of share capital.  The best outcome from a shareholder's perspective will not always accord with the interests and needs of borrowers who are under significant pressure.  It is for that reason that one must take responsibility for resolving each individual case away from the financial institution.  If a bank has a veto, it will have to exercise it in almost all circumstances in order to meet its fiduciary obligations in company law.</p><p>  Deputy Michael McGrath's proposal formed part of a previous Fianna F&aacute;il Bill.  It seeks to create an independent office to act on the basis of a uniform set of guidelines to find a resolution and act as an honest broker to ensure banks get the best return possible while borrowers end up with a reasonable level of living expenses from their income.  The Taoiseach denied the existence of guidelines today and said that no spouse would have to leave employment where a family's child care costs were greater than that person's income.  While I welcome his clarification, I wonder what will be the next level of conditions to suck the lives out of people whom we need to encourage to return to the market.  The economy is in a perilous state.  It is completely hamstrung because of built-up debt.  People have no concept of what is available to them at the end of a week or a month to spend on a reasonable lifestyle.</p><p>  We have heard the criteria put forward over the weekend as to whether someone should be entitled to a Sky package or to retain a second car.  That frightens people.  They recognise that if guidelines such as this emerge, the banks will push them to the nth degree.  Rather than to trying to take the burden off the shoulders of distressed borrowers, it seems we are to place a noose around their necks for the next 15 to 20 years.  That must damage confidence in the economy.  On occasion, Ministers talk up the economy - perhaps to a much greater extent than is merited - as part of their effort to create an environment of confidence.  Do they really think that if they place that noose around the necks of so many borrowers, it will do anything for confidence or to generate growth?  We must take this seriously.</p><p>I am not so sure whether it will take another wave of evictions or another wave of draconian actions by the financial institutions for the Government to accept it got it wrong from the start.  The Government will not get hullabaloo from this side of the House if it slightly alters its course and accepts there is a better way, an independent way and one that will benefit the individuals who have the output from it and the economy, which will have the benefit of people with a positive outlook, money to spend in the domestic economy and who will go to work more positively and deliver better for all concerned.</p><p> I used the term noose around the neck without making any direct implications.  Sadly, hardly a constituency in the country has not seen an increase in suicide.  It is not always the case that it is associated with debt issues.  There are other contributing factors in some cases but a considerable number of people in recent months, and certainly in the past two years, have taken their own lives because of the financial pressure they are under.  While I accept the behaviour of the financial institutions has changed dramatically from what it used to be years ago in terms of the appropriate level of contact through telephone calls and letters, that has helped but has not lifted the burden.  People under financial pressure had high hopes when the Government said it would address the issue but the hope has abated.  People see the Government has left control in the hands of the financial institutions for the reasons I said.  They are not in a position to look favourably on proposals from individual borrowers.</p><p> Mental health is one of the more serious issues we must deal with but we are not addressing it.  We are spending a lot of time dealing with road safety, which is fantastic and which has reaped benefits and rewards.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, is publishing a strategy and it will save lives but the approach in respect of the resolution of the mortgage debt issue continues to be a charter for an increase in suicide by people who find themselves with no way out.  It reflects badly on all of us in the House.  We should put aside political differences and examine the issue from a vantage point.  In addressing it, we should try to find a solution that gives hope to people who, at the moment, have none and see no way out.  They see themselves looking into a dark tunnel.  If there is anything the Minister of State can do, it would be greatly appreciated by the families of people for whom, sadly, any changes will be too late.  If the actions the borrowers have taken in taking their own lives can lead to a change in policy from the Government, perhaps the loss of their lives will not have been in vain.</p><p> In conclusion, it is right and fitting that the Government puts in place the appropriate level of income for families to allow them to live normal lives.  People should be able to have a holiday, retain a family pet and where two cars are a necessity, they should be allowed to retain them.  If we continue along the way proposed by the Government, a serious situation will develop.</p></speech>

I also thank him for the work over the past two years on the issue.  In these two years the situation has considerably deteriorated and we have seen a relative lack of action on many fronts to deal with the issue.  The 94,000 mortgage holders whose residential mortgages are in arrears of more than 90 days look at the effort going into so many other areas of political activity, such as trying to get a deal on debt, the Presidency and the CAP, and see a comparative lack of effort on this issue.  The kinds of frustrations we are all seeing in our offices on a daily basis is easy to understand.  The lack of an independent solution is a key issue.</p><p>  Deputy Dooley put his finger on the issue in respect of banks.  It is easy to come in and slam the banks for a couple of cheap headlines.  Their legal obligations are such that they are not in a position to deal with the level of debt they have and, if they were, they can use that as an excuse.  It is one solid legal reason for an independent broker.</p><p>  Two weeks ago, there was a big press conference with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, outlining a programme of timescales for offers to be made to people with mortgages.  The problem is that the bank gets to make the offer.  The bank is still in the driving seat.  How will we equip the borrower in terms of an ability to handle the offer?  MABS continues to be under-resourced.  It cannot deal with any more people.  If we are serious, we should resource MABS to the extent that it needs.  There are enough experienced financial professionals out there to give other assistance if there was a willingness to do so.</p><p>  The Minister insisted there would be no forced repossessions but then Mr. Elderfield said there would be.  Today, the Taoiseach said no one will be forced to give up her job but the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, who has a habit for telling it as it is, said people will be forced to give up their jobs.  The difficulty is the vacuum of information.  Why did someone have the bright idea of leaking the guidelines over the weekend?  Someone in government had sight of the guidelines and decided to throw them out in an attempt to project action in the run-in to the by-election.  All it has done is scare people.  The debate about work and the choice available to those who work in respect of child care costs will be replaced by other issues as the guidelines become clearer.  Given the manner in which it has been handled over the past two days, if the guidelines are ready they should be published so we can have an informed discussion about them.  At least there would be uniformity in the financial system.  One bank looks for one set of information while another bank looks for different information.  Any Deputy worth his or her salt is dealing with this issue in the constituencies.  We are all engaging with banks on behalf of mortgage holders and commercial loan holders.  We know the different approaches of banks.  By publishing the guidelines, we can get rid of the fears arising out of the Government misinterpretation of the guidelines and we can allow people to start preparing.</p><p>  Regarding the announcement two weeks ago, offers will be made and the banks must have offers made to 30% of mortgage holders by the end of June and to 50% by September.  However, there is no deadline on settlement of the offers.  Much like SME lending, when banks all say they are reaching their target while we know it is not happening, the banks will say they have met the targets and made the requisite number of offers by June and September.  However, there will be no pressure on anyone to move the offers from the status of offer to a concluded deal.  It comes back to the central point of the argument, that there is no third party, independent broker to decide whether the offer is fair and whether the borrower is dealing appropriately and properly with the bank.  That is missing in the Government's approach.  Deputy Michael McGrath's Bill presents a resolution.</p><p>  Who can argue with the proposals of Deputy Michael McGrath?  Split mortgages, parking part of the loan for up to ten years, interest only payments, extending mortgage payments, repayment holidays and debt for equity swaps are all practical initiatives that will not pull the ground from under bank recapitalisation.  The asset is still in place except it is priced at a more reasonable level.</p><p>Many of these have been on the table for some time.  One would think the banks only came across the idea of split mortgages last week the way they have suddenly rushed to state they will offer these products.  They are available.  Surely the Government will not turn its back on a Bill which proposes a solution to the problem faced by so many citizens - the number is 94,000 and rising.  We are going to pass the buck to the personal insolvency service which is in its infancy, without giving it any idea of how many will avail of its services.  The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, reckons that it will receive 3,000 bankruptcy applications in its first full year of operation.  That is just on the bankruptcy and commercial side alone.  We have seen how many have gone overseas in the past few years.  What the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, did two weeks ago was to lump the entire mortgage resolution issue on top of the personal insolvency service.  Will it be given the resources it needs to manage it?  Will the commercial side which was greatly trumpeted and welcomed not be touched while we deal with the mortgage side?</p><p> In the early days of any new agency - for example, Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI; the centralisation of the medical card applications process and so on - it does not cover itself in glory.  What we are doing is that instead of giving the personal insolvency agency a chance to get up and running, we are placing the futures of 94,000 families on its shoulders to try to resolve their 90 days plus arrears issue without providing it with extra resources, without a clear timeline within which we expect it to deliver and without bringing in an independent third party to referee and define who is making a proper offer.</p><p> Mortgage arrears cause enormous distress and lead to enormous insecurity.  They are a major drag on the domestic economy, contributing to unemployment and the collapse of the retail and services sectors.  The issue needs to be resolved.  As a result of personal distress, the ability to make a judgment call is impaired, as is the ability to deal with matters as one might otherwise do.  That is another reason an independent third party should make that rational judgment call on the offer from the bank and the response of the affected mortgageholder.  There are so many reasons we need this agency, as prescribed in Deputy Michael McGrath's Bill.  There are so many additions it would bring to the equation and so many positives which would assist us in the solving of this problem.  It is beyond me why the Government cannot accept it as a practical step.</p><p> The personal insolvency legislation still gives the bank a veto.  A person's mortgage accounts for some 65% of his or her debt.  The banks still have a veto and there is no independence in terms of a bank making an offer.  One may not be in a position in terms of resources to respond to that offer and there is no independent body in place.  We are under-resourcing the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, at a time when it needs resources more than ever.  There is, therefore, no option available to many of the 94,000 borrowers affected.  If they go to the MABS, they must wait because of the level of service provided.  I cannot understand why the Government does not take this Bill on board and see it as the practical initiative it is or put forward some alternative in the form of a third party agency which would deal with this issue in a calm and rational way, the legal responsibilities we have given the directors of financial institutions and the moral responsibility we have as a country to resolve this issue and allow the people concerned to live their lives in an organised manner without the pressure and stress of this debt and allow the economy to start to grow again.</p></speech>

They should have asked, why is Fianna F&aacute;il raising this matter again.  My colleague, Deputy Dara Calleary, alluded to the passage of the personal insolvency legislation through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We sought, by way of amendment on Committee and Report Stages, to establish an independent appeals mechanism as part of the personal insolvency regime being introduced.  We welcomed and supported the main thrust of the legislation, but it is deficient and limited, as there is no participation by an independent third party to try to bring about a dispute resolution mechanism and disputes will undoubtedly occur.</p><p>  The purchase of a home by a person or young couple is one of the most significant and landmark transactions they will make in their lifetimes.  Currently, 94,000 people find themselves in a dire set of circumstances.  Instead of having a capital asset which is appreciating in value, they have a liability which is growing in size.  We are more than two years into the term of the Government, but we still have not progressed this matter significantly enough to give the people concerned hope.  </p><p>  As a practising public representative, like everybody else in this House, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, will know there are independent appeals processes for every State-backed scheme.  There is an independent social welfare appeals mechanism, including for jobseeker's, carer's and domiciliary carer's allowance and for medical cards.  We have the Office of the Ombudsman and if one goes through the planning process, there is an independent appeals mechanism.  There is the Employment Appeals Tribunal to deal with employment disputes.  One can even appeal through the various courts.  There is also an independent appeals mechanism to deal with third level grants.  We are now faced with a situation where the banks ultimately have a veto.</p><p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, is in the same wing of Fine Gael as the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, who, to his credit, is always clear.  Does the Minister of State trust the banks?  Will he give us a straight answer?  Does he trust the banks to deliver on their promise under the legislation?  I will be interested to hear his response.</p><p>  There is no fairness in the thrust of the legislation.  Much of what the Minister for Finance is bringing forward does not have fairness as a central tenet.  For example, if one looks at local property tax, the Minister has not recognised inability to pay.  There are some limited deferrals and some other minor reliefs.  In my constituency alone there are 25 unfinished housing estates.  Those living on these estates who are all in negative equity are liable for local property tax.  Many of the 94,000 people in mortgage arrears are living on such estates and are liable for local property tax.  These estates are largely unfinished and there are serious public liability issues attached to them.  Many of them should be demolished. </p><p>  We will have sight of what are considered reasonable living expenses when the guidelines are published.  There was a leak to the newspapers, to which the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, referred.  One person's reasonable living expenses would represent a barrier for another and his or her family.  For example, is the Minister seriously thinking of removing the ability to maintain private health insurance cover for?  Today in my local hospital, the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, people were asked not to attend the accident and emergency department unless the emergency was genuine.  What message does that send?  </p><p>  There is much to take into consideration when it comes to fairness.  However, we are not allowing people to avail of the services of an independent honest broker in a process covering the biggest transaction they will make in their lives and which affects their welfare.  We are always talking about the economy.</p><p>Let us talk about the societal issues.  We must recognise that we must foster a society in which people can live.  I would like the Minister of State to say whether he trusts the banks.  Does he believe they will do the right thing?  I do not believe they will.  We need independent oversight.  We sought this when the legislation passed through the Houses initially and we are now offering the Government a constructive alternative to what we proposed within the personal insolvency legislation.  I hope the Government will take it on board.</p></speech>

I suspect that if I were on the other side of the House, I would be raising this issue on Private Members' business.  I do not criticise the Opposition for doing so because this is a seminal issue.  There are many issues that will define the country's comeback from crisis to recovery that are out of our hands and determined by international factors, including the status of the eurozone but mortgage arrears comprises an issue that is entirely within our hands and one that we can resolve for ourselves because of the extraordinary recapitalisation of the banking sector by the Irish taxpayer.  It is, therefore, right and proper that the Opposition has tested the Government last night and tonight.  I do not blame it for having done so.</p><p>  The remarks made by Deputy Neville are also critical as they go to the heart of the debate.  I refer to the enormous stress that mortgage impairment is exerting on families and to the ability of people to fight back after four or five really challenging years.  The Government has made it absolutely clear that this issue is a priority this year.  We have set very firm deadlines and targets with the pillar banks for the resolution of the problem, and they must achieve them.</p><p>  Deputy Niall Collins asked me my view on the banking sector.</p></speech>

It is fair to say there has been considerable frustration on the part of the Government about the time it has taken for the Irish banking sector to come to grips with this problem and make progress.  The sector has been a bit like a rabbit caught in headlights in recent years, including when Fianna F&aacute;il was in government and during our term in government.  We will soon know whether our strategy is working.  We will know whether the timelines we have set &ndash; 20% by the end of June, 30% by September and 50% by the end of the year &ndash; are working, and whether that of Fianna F&aacute;il is a better one.</p><p>  I am not in any way criticising the Deputies opposite for tabling this motion.  I have considerable experience in opposition and one of these days I will get around to writing a book about it.  If I were in opposition, I would be doing the same thing myself.</p></speech>

We have been setting ourselves timelines.  Let us see whether we can achieve the targets.  There is confidence that we can do so.</p><p>  It is only right and proper that we put the banks through this process and demand that they deliver.  The fundamental problem in this society over the past two decades has been the extraordinary amount of group-think at the heart of the regulatory and banking systems.  This was responsible for the national crisis.  I have a very open mind as to whether the banks will actually achieve their targets.  They hoodwinked the current and previous Governments and we should be critical in our analysis of whether they will achieve the targets we have now set for them.  None the less, targets have been set and we will soon see whether they can be met.</p><p>  Section 23 of the insolvency legislation deals with what is regarded as reasonable living expenses.  If we are to make progress, we must be honest and truthful with people who have totally unsustainable mortgages and acknowledge that, in a minority of cases, their homes may be repossessed.  This is because they are in an entirely unsustainable position, despite the fact that, in the great majority of cases, people can stay in their homes.</p><p>  One aspect of dealing with mortgage resolution is being utterly truthful with people who find themselves in this appalling situation.  We must ensure this truthfulness is a fundamental part of the Insolvency Service of Ireland, which has been established under Mr. O'Connor.  We look forward to success in that regard.</p><p>  I concede that this is a crucial issue for this D&aacute;il, its Members and the economic recovery of the country.  We can get to a better place if we make progress.  There is confidence among members of the Government that the actions it has taken will help with the restructuring of impaired mortgages.</p></speech>

Last night, I listened to the opening remarks of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter.  To say the least, it was abusive and insulting that such an important issue could have been so trivialised.  We have come forward with proposals that we believe are genuine and honest in their interpretation.  Their purpose is to address the difficulties families are facing throughout the country.  Despite this, we were given a lesson in the history of the problem.  I accept that my team was on the pitch but, by God, the cheerleaders and pom-poms were very much on the Opposition side at the time in question also.  Time and again, people criticised the fact that the banks were not lending enough through mortgages, and it was argued that stamp duty should be removed to further inflate property prices.  We need a very honest debate on this issue.  We can look to the historical record to see who was right and wrong.</p><p>  Fianna F&aacute;il is being told continually that it should have seen the problem coming.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is very forceful in that regard.  He has a property portfolio that would put NAMA to shame.  Throughout the 14 years in office of the previous Government, the Minister was investing in properties.  He is a landlord of major importance and has properties in Florida, London and Dublin.  He has properties all over the place.</p></speech>

Does the Ceann Comhairle believe that any political party in this House would have allowed circumstances in which people must live with unsustainable mortgages?  We are coming forward with very genuine proposals, proposals we believe are important in ensuring independent oversight.  We must remove the veto of the banks.</p><p>  The Minister of State may interpret the legislation and guidelines any way he likes with regard to personal insolvency but the fact of the matter is that it is the lenders, the banks, that will have the final say on the resolution mechanism for people with distressed mortgages.  For the Minister for Justice and Equality to dismiss in the House last night any proposal to address the problem is disingenuous to say the very least, or arrogant to say the very most.  We are trying to highlight the difficulties of families and point out that the banks cannot be seen as independent in addressing this issue.  They were the bodies which, at the outset, increased lending in the system by assessing disposable income, including child benefit and revenue from property letting.  The Government is now asking the institutions to be adjudicators in cases where there are distressed mortgages and where there are families liable to lose their homes.</p><p>  Deputy Michael McGrath's proposal is very simple.  It is about ensuring that there is independence in adjudication and that there is a system in place that ensures families are given an opportunity to make a settlement and get on with their lives.  Nothing in the proposals on personal insolvency removes the simple fact that the bank is the ultimate decision-maker.</p><p>  Why has the Government not been pushing for mortgage resolution as speedily as we expected?  It made considerable commitments in this regard.  I am concerned that if the Government knows there is to be a mortgage resolution mechanism that is fair, equitable and independent, banks may need further capital.</p><p>The Government knows this politically because it stated previously that any further injection of capital into the banks would be viewed negatively by the public.  The Government has stated in the past that not another cent would go into the banks, but they may need further capital.  What is known for sure is that the banks will not address this issue in a way that is fair because doing so could expose their capital base.  I have major concerns about this.  For this reason we need an independent system to address the 94,000 mortgages under duress and the families supporting them.  The system must be independent because the banks cannot be trusted in this particular aspect of their affairs.  They have proven this previously in terms of how they assess a person's ability to pay and all that flows that that.</p><p><br /> Proposals put forward from this side of the House are a genuine effort to try to resolve this issue.  As stated by every Deputy who has contributed to this debate, this is a massive societal issue.  It has a hugely damaging impact on society at large and on individuals and their families.  Deputy Neville spoke about suicide, mental illness and all that flows from that.  Our proposals are solid and are put forward in a genuine effort to address this issue.  I will not sit in this House night after night and take a historical lecture from the Minister, Deputy Shatter, when he, given his involvement in property, did not see this coming either.  That is on the record and is not a personal slight.  People are saying that Fianna F&aacute;il saw this coming but chose not to do anything about it.  Time and again, I have called in this Chamber for an honest debate on how we got where we are.  </p><p><br /> The Government amendment states that it inherited a severe mortgage arrears crisis.  We acknowledge that.  It would be no harm if the Government members also acknowledged that when on this side of the House they did nothing for 14 years to raise this particular issue.  Not once was there any discussion about attempting to deflate the property bubble that was developing.  Not once in this Chamber did any Deputy criticise the then Government or put forward proposals.  The contrary was the case on every occasion.  The clarion calls from Government members when on this side of the House were for the Government to abolish stamp duty and open up the banks to further lending.</p><p><br /> What we are trying to do is to address a problem that is destroying society and families.  One has only to go to Dunshaughlin, Stamullen or any of the other commuter belt areas to see the pain and devastation this problem is causing homeowners.  I do not believe any party would have tried to cover up this issue and pretend that the property bubble would never burst.  If I or any member of the previous Government now on this side of the House had known that the property bubble was going to burst we would have cried halt.  Any time we tried to do so we were accused of interfering.  There were calls from those who are now members of the Government, when they were on this side of the House, for the abolition of stamp duty and the introduction of further tax reliefs.  They are now saying the opposite.</p><p><br /> Honesty is important.  The families who are listening, or are not listening, tonight want solutions.  I urge the Government, even at this late stage, to establish an independent appeals mechanism and remove the veto from the banks, which are the ones with vested interests in terms of adjudicating on a person's ability to pay.  The draft guidelines published in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>are disturbing.  Under these guidelines, families may be forced to give up private health insurance.  Private health insurance is now considered a luxury, as is being in employment.  The Government needs to get involved in the real world.  I urge the Government, at this late stage, to accept Deputy Michael McGrath's proposal that independent oversight be sacrosanct and the central tenet in any attempt to address the issue of mortgage arrears, which is a huge and damaging problem for families and society.  I commend Deputy McGrath's motion to the House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/dail/2013-03-27a.699" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="19:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013032700060#HHH00200"><p>I thank all Deputies who contributed to this debate over the past two nights and acknowledge the constructive and conciliatory contribution of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes.  It was consistent with the purpose of this motion, which is solutions-driven.  That is what we are about.  It is the reason my colleagues and I are in politics.</p><p>  As stated by Deputy Kelleher, the approach last night of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, was unfortunately very different.  He spent most of his time giving his version of history and lambasting Fianna F&aacute;il to such an extent that he almost ran out of time and had to read quickly through the important part of his speech.  He used all of his time lambasting Fianna F&aacute;il in what was an utterly non-constructive speech, which, in my opinion, was not befitting of a Minister.  The core of his argument was that any deal must be voluntary in nature.  He stated as a matter of fact, citing constitutional precedent, that the body which Fianna F&aacute;il proposed be established would be struck down by the courts.  I believe that is a debatable point.  Article 43 of the Constitution is clear that the issue of property rights is in the context of the principles of social justice and can be set aside if in the common good.  There is a strong case to be made that this proposal is sound.  Even if a constitutional amendment is required, so be it.  Let us have that referendum.  I do not accept that the Government can legislate to take people's private pension savings yet cannot introduce a proposal such as this because of property rights under the Constitution.  The reality is that if the political will existed this issue could be dealt with.  We could certainly enact legislation along the lines suggested by Fianna F&aacute;il.  I believe this should be done.</p><p>  The essence of the argument made by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, last night in opposing this motion, leaving aside his vitriolic criticism of Fianna F&aacute;il, was that the banks will do deals with borrowers because they know that if they turn down a deal the borrower has the option of bankruptcy, which is utterly ridiculous.  The Minister is essentially saying that bankruptcy will be the solution for a great many families.  There is no requirement for this.  In the vast majority of cases, a proper sustainable solution can be put in place without families being pushed to bankruptcy and all of the consequences that flow from that.  The best way to get the banks to act and enter into deals voluntarily, which is what we would all like to see, is to put in place an independent body which would have the ultimate power to impose a binding solution.  That would brings the banks to heel and ensure they enter into arrangements with people.  Currently, based on all the announcements from the Government, more power is being given to the banks.  Ultimately, if a person ends up in an insolvency arrangement the bank retains the right of veto.  </p><p>  What is frustrating is that this problem can be solved.  The economy will recover.  Many people currently dealing with mortgage distress will be in better financial circumstances in the future.  This is about sitting down with the banks, negotiating and putting in place the right solution and establishing an independent body which, when such negotiations fail, can put in place a solution.  We all know the scale of the problem.  The total mortgage book in respect of family homes is approximately &euro;110 billion, &euro;30 billion of which is accounted for by mortgages that are in arrears or have been restructured.  That is the scale of the problem.  It is enormous.  We know that action such as that proposed by Fianna F&aacute;il is urgently required.  </p><p>  The point of disagreement between us and the Government is who should have the final say if banks and borrowers cannot agree on a voluntary arrangement.  The Government's position is that the banks should have the final say through the measures provided in the revised code of conduct, the mortgage arrears resolution process and proposed legislation to reverse the Dunne judgment.  Fianna F&aacute;il has proposed a different solution, which requires that if it comes to it, an independent body would have the final say.  If the Government were to signal to the banks that if they do not step up to the plate and reach all of the targets set it will legislate to give effect to a proposal such as ours, we would see far more action on this issue.</p></speech>
